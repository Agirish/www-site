**What would you say to someone thinking of applying to TAC for the first time?**

Highly recommended… its a great way to get to these events when funds may be short. 
Its an opportunity.

**What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?**

Meeting with some of the folks and being able to talk about things that may take more time than on the lists.  Be able to exchange ideas before bringing them to the community.  Face to face can have a huge impact on attitude and interaction moving forward and its something that can be bestowed to the projects.  Sometimes its tough to put tone in email, so its good to share in a personal manner.

**What new things did you get into thanks to ApacheCon?**

I wouldn’t say it got me into anything new, but certainly underscored my feelings about Apache and the value it brings to me and my contributions.  It re-invigorates about why we do the things we do in open source and the impacts it has on the world.
