# About us  {#about}

The ASF does not have offices or buildings. Its only physical existence is the technical infrastructure that enables it to operate, and the staff.

The ASF Infrastructure team, known as "Infra", supports these services::

- web serving environment (web sites and wikis)

- code repositories

- mail management environment

- issue / bug tracking

- distribution mirroring system


Infra is responsible for the management and day-to-day system administration of the hardware that runs these services. Infra also reviews requests to install new systems or software on the ASF machines.

Infra deploys in production a number of Apache software applications, including

- [HTTP Server (httpd)](http://httpd.apache.org/)
- [Subversion](http://subversion.apache.org/)
- [SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/)
- [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/)
- [Traffic Server](http://trafficserver.apache.org/)
- [mod_perl](http://perl.apache.org/)
- [Creadur](http://creadur.apache.org/)
- [Gump](http://gump.apache.org/) and [Continuum](http://continuum.apache.org/)
- [Steve](http://steve.apache.org/)
- [mod_mbox](http://httpd.apache.org/mod_mbox/)
- Pulse and Orthrus (see [labs](http://labs.apache.org/labs))
- [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)
- [Directory Studio](http://directory.apache.org/studio/)
- A selection of [in-house projects](https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/infrastructure/trunk/projects/)
(including the [committers index](http://home.apache.org/committer-index.html) and the [committers URL Shortener](http://s.apache.org/))
- and the [Apache CMS](cms).
