# Apache Committer Personal blogs # {#personal-blogs}

Committers with personal blogs are encouraged to add their feed to
[planet.apache.org](http://planet.apache.org) for aggregation. To get your
personal blog listed and aggregated, check out the [planet
module](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/planet/) from our SVN repo and
edit the config.ini. See the README and FAQ files for details.

    :::shell
    $ svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/planet/
    
Read these committer blogs at [Planet Apache](http://planet.apache.org/committers/).
Many committers submit their technology-related blogs, but some committers 
also blog on personal matters.
