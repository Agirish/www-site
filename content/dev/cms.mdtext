**Notice:** The Infrastructure team is currently **NOT** accepting new projects for the CMS system. 
When/if we change this policy, we will announce it on the infrastructure mailing list.

The section on basic editing in the CMS, formerly on this page, is now on [this cwiki page][1]. More detailed information is on [this page][2].
