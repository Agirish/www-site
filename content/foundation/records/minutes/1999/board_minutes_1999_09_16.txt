 4. Officer Reports

    A. President  [Brian]

    Brian had nothing to report beyond what had been discussed heavily on
    the board mailing list regarding issues concerning Project Management
    Committees (PMCs). Brian reported that he had been spending time with
    people in IBM and Sun, discussing both Jakarta and XML.
     
    B. Treasurer  [Randy]

    Randy reported that the ASF had received 2 donations since the last
    meeting.  The following contributions were noted:
     
        Dave Long from Santa Barbara, CA in the amount of Four Hundred
        Twenty Five Dollars ($425.00)
        Eric Ross from Colorado Springs, CO in the amount of One
        Hundred Dollars ($100.00).

    These result in the ASF having a balance of Five Hundred Ninety
    Seven Dollars and Three Cents ($597.03).

    It was generally agreed that the ASF should acknowledge such
    contributions.  Randy suggested a nice QuickBooks receipt with the
    ASF logo.

    Randy also noted that he is still working on the credit card merchant
    accounts for Diner's Club, etc.  These are waiting on the Feds to give
    the ASF an Employer ID Number.

    C. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]

    Jim reported that the ASF had received signed membership application
    forms from all proposed new members with the exception of Robert Thau,
    who has not responded to an e-mail query for the membership application.
    Further discussion of this was deferred to be discussed on the list.
     
    Jim also reported the receipt of two actual trophies awarded to
    Apache. The first was for the Datamation Product of the Year (1999),
    which had been awarded and noted a few months ago. The second was
    the LinuxWorld Editor's Award (1999). The receipt of the trophy was the
    first notice of Apache's award status and was actually delivered during
    this meeting. This news was to be noted on new-httpd.

    Brian added that the ASF was counted as one of "100 companies that
    matter" by the Industry Standard this week, including a picture of Roy.

 5. Committee Reports

    A. Apache Conferences [Ken]

    Ken reported that the Apache Conference Committee had signed a contract
    with Camelot Communications as the show management company for ApacheCon
    2000. Ken reported about the meeting between members of the ``ConCom''
    and Camelot in Orlando FLA in July to investigate and choose the venue.
    AC2K will be covering travel and lodging for speakers. In addition to the
    standard speaker fee, AC2K will also be paying extra for ``white-paper
    articles'' to accompany their sessions and to go in the Proceedings.
    ThunderLizard Productions has been approached about doing a joint holism
    show. The location of ApacheCon Europe in next year is to be discussed
    on list. Dirk has the action to bring up this topic on 'concom@'.
     
    The next AC2K planning session is scheduled for October in San Jose.
     
    B. Apache Licensing [Brian]

    Brian reported that he is ready to ``properly form'' the Licensing
    Committee. The actual formation was tabled to be added under
    New Business for this meeting.
     
    C. Apache HTTP Server Project [BenH]

    Ben reported that a new release of Apache, 1.3.9, was released
    using standard open source methods and that 2.0 and APR are ``in
    motion.'' Ben thanked all who worked on the effort, particularly Ken and
    Roy. Ben suggested a change that would allow the addition of new members
    without ASF involvement, with the ASF membership following later.

    Ben also reported that he would ``prefer'' that the server project itself
    elect it's own V.P. and asked for advice on timing. 

 6. Special Orders

    A) Application for tax-exempt status as a private operating foundation.

    Five alternative resolutions for whether or not to apply for nonprofit
    status were discussed.  At the core of the discussion was whether the
    board should make a decision at this time or call on the Treasurer to
    further investigate the alternatives.  There was also concern that a
    specific resolution calling for 501(c)(3) status should be replaced
    with the general intent of a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization, with
    the appropriate IRS revenue code to be determined at a later time.

    During this discussion, Jim had to leave the meeting due to a power
    outage (Hurricane Floyd).  Brian substituted as note taker for the
    remainder of the meeting.
      
    The following resolution was adopted by a vote of the directors,
    with five "yes" votes (Sameer, Roy, BenH, Brian, BenL), three
    "no" votes (Ken, Dirk, Randy), and no abstentions:

      WHEREAS, The Apache Software Foundation is a private operating
      foundation that is not yet registered as a nonprofit, tax-exempt
      organization under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code;

      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that The Apache Software Foundation
      shall apply for tax-exempt status as a private operating foundation
      under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as soon as the means for doing
      so are readily available; and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the Treasurer is assigned the task of developing an
      appropriate budget for the costs associated with the application,
      including an estimate for obtaining the services of a professional
      bookkeeper and accountant familiar with the requirements on nonprofit
      corporations; and be it further

      RESOLVED, that donations be requested from the public in order to
      specifically cover the costs associated with applying for nonprofit
      status and maintenance of the corporate financial records in
      accordance with that status.
    

    B) ASF Software License

    An updated software license, in the form of a generic template, was
    proposed for use by ASF projects.  Roy noted that the Licensing
    Committee has been tasked with creating a framework for new licenses
    in the long-term, but that this license would satisfy the short-term
    needs of current projects.  Brian noted that the folks behind the
    proposed XML project desired that an ASF license be approved before
    their code is donated to that project.

    During this discussion, Ben Laurie had to leave the meeting for
    personal reasons.

    The following resolution was unanimously adopted by a vote of the
    remaining directors present (Brian, Ken, Roy, BenH, Sameer, Randy, Dirk):

      WHEREAS, Project Management Committees within The Apache Software
      Foundation have an immediate need for an approved text to be used as
      a generic template for a Software Copyright License; and

      WHEREAS, the Board's licensing committee will be engaged in a long-term
      process of defining appropriate licenses for future use, but is not
      expected to complete that work in time to satisfy the immediate need.

      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the software license template
      attached hereto as Exhibit A may be used by all Project Management
      Committees within The Apache Software Foundation, with the variable
      fields in square brackets filled by the associated Project Management
      Committee's specific information for the software in question.


    C) Project Management Committees

    Discussion was held on a proposal to clarify the bylaws relating to
    the composition of Project Management Committees.  Since the proposed
    change was incomplete, further discussion of this item was tabled until
    a complete resolution could be prepared and discussed on the list.

    At this point, Randy Terbush had to leave the meeting due to a time
    conflict.

    D) Jakarta Project

    Discussion was held on a proposal to create a project for development
    and maintenance of open-source Java Servlet-related software.  Roy
    submitted a resolution based on Brian's request to establish the PMC,
    consisting of those people closely involved in the existing jServ
    project and related projects at Sun and IBM.

    Ben Hyde had some concerns about the last paragraph in the resolution,
    where it tasked the PMC with the creation of a set of bylaws.  Brian
    clarified that the project bylaws specify how new developers are brought
    aboard, old ones retire, and the PMC chair elected by the project
    participants.  Roy observed that the Server project has them, called
    project guidelines, and that the intent of the resolution is to encourage
    the PMC to set their own guidelines with the appropriate frame of mind.

    The following resolution was unanimously adopted by vote of the
    directors present (Brian, Ken, Roy, BenH, Sameer, Dirk):

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it to be in the best interests
      of the Corporation and consistent with the Corporation's purpose to
      establish a Project Management Committee charged with the creation and
      maintenance of open-source Java Servlet-related software for
      distribution at no charge to the public.

      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a Project Management
      Committee, to be known as the "Jakarta Project Management Committee",
      be and hereby is established pursuant to Bylaws of the Corporation;
      and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the Jakarta Project Management Committee be and hereby is
      responsible for the creation and maintenance of Java Servlet-related
      software based on software licensed to the Corporation; and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the office of "Vice President, Jakarta" be and hereby is
      created, the person holding such office to serve at the direction of the
      Board of Directors as the chairman of the Jakarta Project Management
      Committee, and to have primary responsibility for management of the
      projects within the scope of responsibility of the Jakarta Project
      Management Committee; and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the persons listed immediately below be and hereby are
      appointed to serve as the initial members of the Jakarta Project
      Management Committee.

          Elias Bayeh, IBM                <ebayeh@us.ibm.com>
          Hans Bergstein                  <hans@gefionsoftware.com>
          James Davidson, Sun             <duncan@apache.org>
          Pierpaolo Fumagalli, IBM        <pier@apache.org>
          Craig McClanahan, MyTownNet     <cmcclanahan@mytownnet.com>
          Stefano Mazzocchi, Independent  <stefano@apache.org>
          Jon Stevens, Clear Ink          <jon@working-dogs.com>
          James Todd, Sun                 <gonzo@eng.sun.com>

      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that James Davidson
      be and hereby is appointed to the office of Vice President, Jakarta,
      to serve in accordance with and subject to the direction of the Board
      of Directors and the Bylaws of the Corporation until death, resignation,
      retirement, removal or disqualification, or until a successor is
      appointed; and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the initial Jakarta Project Management Committee be
      and hereby is tasked with the creation of a set of bylaws intended to
      encourage open development and increased participation in the Jakarta
      Project.


    E) Apache XML Project

    Discussion was held on a proposal to create a project for development
    and maintenance of open-source XML parser software.  The first item
    needed was approval of the proposed license agreement from IBM for the
    licensing of their existing XML parser code that will be the initial
    basis of the project.
     
    The following resolution was unanimously adopted by vote of the
    directors present (Brian, Ken, Roy, BenH, Sameer, Dirk):

      RESOLVED, that the Apache Software Foundation approves the license
      agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B for accepting selected
      donations of software from IBM Corporation.

    Establishment of an Apache XML PMC was next discussed, with 2 candidate
    resolutions being debated, the first establishing an "interim" PMC and
    the second formally creating the PMC and tasking it with further
    development of its membership and bylaws.  Of particular concern was
    staffing of the PMC, since many directors feel that the PMC should be
    larger and more representative of the XML community than the initial
    one proposed. However, time was of the essence.
     
    The following resolution was adopted by vote of the directors present,
    with five "yes" votes (Brian, Ken, Roy, Sameer, Dirk), one "no" vote
    (BenH), and no abstentions:

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it to be in the best interests
      of the Corporation and consistent with the Corporation's purpose to
      establish a Project Management Committee charged with the creation and
      maintenance of open-source XML parser software for distribution at no
      charge to the public.

      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a Project Management
      Committee, to be known as the "Apache XML Project Management Committee",
      be and hereby is established pursuant to Bylaws of the Corporation;
      and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the Apache XML Project Management Committee be
      and hereby is responsible for the creation and maintenance of XML parser
      software based on software licensed to the Corporation; and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the office of "Vice President, Apache XML" be
      and hereby is created, the person holding such office to serve at the
      direction of the Board of Directors as the chairman of the Apache XML
      Project Management Committee, and to have primary responsibility for
      management of the projects within the scope of responsibility of the
      Apache XML Project Management Committee; and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the persons listed immediately below be and hereby are
      appointed to serve as the initial members of the Apache XML Project
      Management Committee.

          Scott Boag
          Andy Heninger
          Ted Leung
          Stefano Mazzocchi
          Dirk-Willem van Gulik

      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Dirk-Willem van Gulik
      be and hereby is appointed to the office of Vice President, Apache XML,
      to serve in accordance with and subject to the direction of the Board
      of Directors and the Bylaws of the Corporation until death, resignation,
      retirement, removal or disqualification, or until a successor is
      appointed; and be it further

      RESOLVED, that the initial Apache XML Project Management Committee be
      and hereby is tasked with the creation of a set of bylaws intended to
      encourage open development and increased participation in the
      XML Project.


    F) Budgeting process

    Discussion on this item was tabled due to time constraints and the
    absence of the Treasurer.

 9. Announcements

    None.

10. Adjournment

    The next meeting was to be scheduled on-list, but was projected for the
