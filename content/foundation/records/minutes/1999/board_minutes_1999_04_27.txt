                     The Apache Software Foundation

                    Board of Directors Meeting Minutes

                             27 April 1999


 1. Call to order

    The meeting was held via a group teleconference hosted by IBM. The meeting
    was called to order at 10:07am PDT -0700, with Roy T. Fielding presiding.

 2. Roll Call

    A quorum was present, including: Brian Behlendorf, Roy. T Fielding,
    Ben Hyde, Jim Jagielski, Ben Laurie, Sameer Parekh and Randy Terbush. Ken
    Coar "arrived" late. Dirk-Willem van Gulik was unable to attend.
    
    Guests: Drew Wright (counsel)

 3. Minutes

    Minutes of the last meeting, available at:
    
        apachegroup-site/board/minutes/board_minutes_1999_04_13.txt
        
    were approved via unanimous consent.

 4. Officer Reports

    A. President.  [Brian]
    
    Brian reported in the status of our search for addition counsel. As of
    the date of the meeting, he had not found any lawyers available for
    pro-bono work. Brian reported that he still had a few "leads" available.
    
    A discussion was held concerning possibly drafting a project description
    for this additional counsel and what resources or services ASF could
    offer in payment.
    
    B. Treasurer.  [Randy]
    
    Randy reported that the formal Band and Merchant account for the ASF has
    been created with the National Bank of Commerce, 1248 O Street, Lincoln,
    NE 68508. This bank allowed for accounts to be opened with no balance and
    there are no fees for non-profit organizations.

    This effort will further be detailed in Agenda Item 6.A.

    Randy will distribute signature cards to the above named officers for
    their signature and return.

    C. Secretary.  [Jim]
    
    Jim reported that he had the capability to generate PDF files from other
    file formats. It was generally agreed that use of PDF files for minor
    documents was not worth the effort.

 5. Committee Reports

    A. Apache Conferences Committee.  [Ken]
    
    At the time this report was due, Ken was not available. It was tabled
    until the time that he joined the conference.
    
    AT THAT TIME, Ken reported that he had received, in Microsoft Word format,
    the latest proposal from LKE regarding ApacheCon. As of the date of the
    meeting, he had not had the opportunity to read the proposal. It was
    agreed to by all that Ken should forward the proposal to the Conference
    Committee, for their review and comments, and to the "core" team members
    for their information.
    
     
 6. Special Orders

    A. Banking Resolutions

    RESOLVED, that the Corporation open one or more deposit accounts with
    the National Bank of Commerce, 1248 O Street, Lincoln, NE 68508
    (the "Bank"); and be it further

    RESOLVED, that the officers named immediately below are authorized to
    sign checks and other orders for the withdrawal of funds from each
    such account in accordance with this resolution.

         Name                   Title

         Brian Behlendorf       President
         Jim Jagielski          Executive Vice-President and Secretary
         Randy Terbush          Treasurer

    NOW THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the issuance of checks or
    other orders for the withdrawal of funds from such accounts in excess
    of US$5,000 or its equivalent (except for checks between Corporation
    accounts) shall require the signatures of two of the above-named
    authorized officers of the Corporation; and be it further

    RESOLVED, that the standard form of banking resolutions provided by
    the Bank, reflecting the above signatory requirements as to each such
    account, hereby are in all respects approved, ratified and adopted
    with respect to each such account with the Bank, and the officers of
    the Corporation are hereby authorized and directed to certify to the
    Bank the approval, ratification and adoption of said resolutions and
    to file a true copy of the same in the minute book of the Corporation
    immediately following this Consent, and to execute such other
    documents and take such other actions as may be necessary in
    connection with the opening of each such account;

    The above RESOLUTIONS have been incorporated into
    apache-core/director-consent.txt

    B. Appointing additional responsibilities to officers and/or non-
       officers. 

       1) director of public relations
       2) director of membership relations
       
       The proposal was to assign the above responsibilities to present
       members. It was generally agreed that, at the present time, the
       assignments were premature due to (a) the desire of ASF to
       avoid the appearance of a "top heavy" foundation and (b)
       to wait until more projects and efforts are "folded" into
       ASF, giving these new people the opportunity for these
       responsibilities.

    C. Issues regarding the membership application form

       Roy has proposed that the license grant part of the membership
       application form be dropped in favor of a general contributor
       license form to be filled-out independent of the membership process.
       Also requires a few changes to the director consent resolutions.
       The idea was to make it easier for people to submit code and
       patches without their employers approval and authorization.
       
       The discussion was raised concerning the changes in
       apache-core/membership-application.txt in which the text which required
       the submitter to check 'Yes' or 'No' regarding their desire to become
       a member of ASF was changed to:
    
        "I have read and understand the Bylaws of The Apache Software
         Foundation and I wish to become a member in accordance with
         those Bylaws."

       There was concern about the possibility of ASF "declaring"
       people as Emeritus Members, since membership itself is something
       which must have been requested by the individual. It was generally
       agreed that all Emeritus members of the Apache Group would be
       asked if they would like membership in ASF and, if so, if they
       would desire active or Emeritus membership.
       
       The amended membership-application.txt (Exhibit A) was then approved
       by general consent:

          RESOLVED, that the Membership Application attached hereto as
          Exhibit A be and hereby are in all respects approved and adopted
          as the Membership Application of this Corporation, and said
          Application shall be made a part of the minute book of the
          Corporation along with these minutes.

       The Contributor License was further discussed regarding the
       form and format of the actual text and who would be required
       to sign the form. Drew's intention was that only the "core"
       members of ASF be required to sign and that for the "patch
       submitter," a simpler "point and click" consent, with text
       to the effect that "I, the submitter, agree and am authorized
       to submit this patch", would be for such interfaces as the
       Bug Database. The Board agreed to further refine the license
       and consider the best implementation for "day to day"
       development of The Apache Works.
     
    D. Adoption of the license agreement form (license-grant.txt)
    
    The issue was raised over whether Emeritus or active Apache Group
    members would decline to sign the license agreement form. Drew's
    comments were that the form is designed to transfer the license
    and code of Apache from the Apache Group to the ASF.
    
    It was generally agreed to add the clarifiation of "current or former"
    to the designation of the Apache Group member statement.

       The amended License Agreement Form (Exhibit B) was then approved
       by general consent:

          RESOLVED, that the License Agreement Form attached hereto as
          Exhibit A be and hereby are in all respects approved and adopted
          as the License Agreement Form of this Corporation, and said
          Form shall be made a part of the minute book of the
          Corporation along with these minutes.

    E. Adoption of the trademark assignment form (trademark-assignment.txt)
    
    See Next Agenda Item: F

    F. Adoption of the equipment use letter (equipment-use-letter.txt)

    Assets/Trademarks to be transfered from The Apache Group to The
    Apache Software Foundation (ASF) were discussed. Only Brian and
    Randy had such assets/trademarks to be transfered. Brian has the
    actual physical hardware, Randy has the Apache "feather" trademark
    and the various Apache domain names. Randy was concerned about the
    wording of the tranfer documentation; his concern was that it
    provided no protection from future suits brought against ASF or
    himself for possible trademark iinfringement issues. Drew's comments
    clarified the meaning of the documentation, which does, in fact,
    provide such protection. In essence, when the ASF takes over
    trademarks, it also "takes over" possible damages as well.

    The Equipment Use Letter (Exhibit C) was then approved by general consent:

        RESOLVED, that the Equipment Use Letter attached hereto as Exhibit C
        be and hereby are in all respects approved and adopted as the
        Equipment Use Letter of this Corporation, and said Letter shall be
        made a part of the minute book of the Corporation along with
        these minutes.

    The Trademark Assignment form (Exhibit D) was then approved by general
    consent:

        RESOLVED, that the Trademark Assignment form attached hereto as
        Exhibit D be and hereby are in all respects approved and adopted as
        the Trademark Assignment form of this Corporation, and said Form shall
        be made a part of the minute book of the Corporation along with these
        minutes.

    G. Adoption of the bill-of-sale/assignment form (BOS-and-assignment.txt)

    The Bill-of-sale/Assignment form (Exhibit E) was then approved by general
    consent:

        RESOLVED, that the Bill-of-sale/Assignment form attached hereto as
        Exhibit E be and hereby are in all respects approved and adopted as
        the Bill-of-sale/Assignment form of this Corporation, and said
        Form shall be made a part of the minute book of the Corporation
        along with these minutes.


    H. Appointment of a Vice Chairman of the Board
    
    It was generally agreed that the President serves under this function.

    I. Set dates for next two Board meetings
    
    The next board meeting is scheduled for Thursday, May 13, 1999
    from 10:00am PDT to 12:00pm PDT. The following meeting is tentatively
    scheduled for Thursday, May 27, 1999 from 10:00am PDT to 12:00pm PDT,
    depending on the availability of Dirk.

 7. Unfinished Business
 
 Brian stated that he was continuing the effort in the "reorganization"
 of the non-public groups and domains.
 
 The question was raised as to exactly when ASF was an "official"
 incorporation. Drew stated that at the point in time when all
 members have signed and submitted the Membership Application and
 the Member Consent, and when all board members have signed and
 submitted the Director Consent, ASF will officially exist.
 
 The possibility of using IRC instead of teleconferencing was
 suggested. It was generally agreed to "hold off" on this effort.

 8. New Business

 9. Announcements
 
 It was announced by Roy that he was leaving on vacation on Thursday,
 April 29. It was anticipated that the final forms for the incorporation
 of ASF would be available by then for him to sign.

10. Adjournment

    The meeting was adjourned at 12:00pm PDT -0700.

Re: Use of Equipment and/or Services


Gentlemen:

    I have volunteered to provide The Apache Software Foundation (the
"Foundation") use of certain equipment, space and/or services. I am
writing to outline our mutual responsibilities to ensure that this
arrangement will not create a misunderstanding or conflict in the
future. This letter supersedes any prior letter between us concerning
this arrangement.

    I will be providing the Foundation with use of the equipment,
space and/or services listed in Exhibit A to this letter. This
arrangement is a simple, revocable, at-will license, and is not a
lease. I cannot guarantee that this license will continue
uninterrupted during its term. For example, business plans may require
interruptions arising from relocation of the equipment, and may
require assignment of alternative space for the Foundation. In
addition, outages, whether for the maintenance or modification of the
equipment or otherwise, may require interruption of the Foundation's
license.

    Any equipment, space and services provided are provided on an
as-is basis, without warranty of any kind. I may find it advisable to
terminate this license in the future and may so terminate this license
in my sole discretion. Although I intend to notify the Foundation of
changes whenever possible, I am not required to provide any notice.

    Please note that any equipment of the Foundation located in any
space provided hereunder will not be covered by any insurance
maintained by me, and I cannot assume responsibility for any damage to
such equipment (including damage from my relocation of such equipment)
except damage caused by my willful conduct or gross negligence. I
strongly recommend that the Foundation maintain insurance on such
equipment.

    This letter is intended to set our expectations and minimize the
potential for misunderstandings and conflict. If the above is
consistent with the Foundation's understanding and the Foundation is
in agreement, please execute this letter in the space provided below
and return it to me for my files.



				Sincerely,



						



Agreed and accepted:

"Agreement") is made effective as of the ___ day of _______, 1999, by
and between ____________, a resident of _________________ ("Grantor"),
and The Apache Software Foundation, a Delaware nonstock membership
corporation ("Grantee").


P R E A M B L E
