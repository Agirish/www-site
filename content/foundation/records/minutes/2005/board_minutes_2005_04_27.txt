 4. Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Greg]

       Greg reported that the foundation was moving along "fine"
       with a good separation of concerns.

    B. President [Dirk]

       Dirk reported that he is following AxKit and how it
       is playing out (has never yet had a release under the
       ASF "banner," and currently extensively uses non-ASF
       infrastructure). Dirk indicated that he would also
       like to discuss some CLA-like mechanism for ASF
       officers who are not members.

    C. Treasurer [Chuck]

        No report.

    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]

       Other than the steady trickle of incoming iCLAs and CCLAs,
       there is nothing to report.

       Jim reminded the board that we are due for the annual
       ASF Member Meeting and the election of a new board.
       Jim was to handle the coordination and scheduling of
       the meeting on the members@ list.

    D. Apache Incubator Project [Noel Bergman]

       See Attachment D

       There was discussion over the continued growth of the
       ASF via the Incubator and whether some control or limit
       was required. The general consensus was that unless the
       Incubator Project felt that this was a concern, the board
       was premature is making it a concern at this point.

ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache DB Project

Torque did not have any releases this quarter but bug fixes, unit
tests, and refactoring continue.  User questions get asked and
answered.

OJB released 1.0.2 followed quickly by 1.0.3 to solve some bugs.  OJB
also switched to JIRA during the quarter.

The Jakarta and DB PMCs agreed to move the Jakarta commons sandbox
project "sql" to DB as "ddlutils" subproject.  As it is used primarily
by OJB and has its roots with Torque, it was felt it would be a good
place to have some collaboration between the groups.  This transition
is still in process.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Directory Project

There are no significant changes since last months report really.
Everything is operating smoothly.

Some significant notes on our present objectives ...

We are trying to get the site up to par with a TLP site outside of the
incubator before our next release.  That is in terms of quality.  We
all do not want to draw too much attention until everything is in
order for our users.  The 0.9 code is ready to go but the docs and
site are the only factors holding us back.  We really want to make
sure everything is right with this first release of apacheds outside
of the incubator.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Geronimo Project

The Apache Geronimo project has generally been fairly quiet due 
to concentrated effort at completing the J2EE 1.4 spec feature set, 
and testing via the J2EE TCK.

1) We are making good progress on the committer front with three new 
committers.  This was an issue we were going to focus on coming out of 
incubation, and we're starting to see dividends from that effort.  
We do still believe that it's more difficult than we would like for 
new people to engage on the codebase at the moment due to the complexity 
of what we are currently working on, but we think that once we get past 
certification, and can focus on other issues like usability and such.  
That phase of the project will create lots of opportunity for those 
that aren't hard-core spec geeks to get involved.  We have two 
individuals that have been offered committer status, have accepted, 
and are active :

   - Jeff Genender
   - Mark DeLaFranier

We also have on individual who has been offered committer status and 
is working through the ICLA and CCLA issues with his employer.  He 
still continues to participate during this process :

   - John Sission

2) We believe that we are now feature complete (or darn close) with 
the codebase, to the point that for the most part, TCK testing is 
driving the development now.

3) Certification testing with the TCK has been going on for some 
months now at a focused steady pace, and we are making fantastic 
progress.  We're now mired in the Swamp of Web Services Pathos, 
and finding our way out of the Dark Dungeon of Interop, but the 
efforts are well handled, the problems understood, and it's now 
just a matter of working things out to the end.  :)

4) We continue to collaborate with other projects as much as we 
can (due to laziness mostly...).  We are working with the Maven 2 
project as a good example of a complicated project to ensure that 
Maven 2 can support our build complexity, and continue to examine 
ways we can work more with the ObjectWeb projects.  Progress in 
solving the ASFs LGPL issues would help us a great deal, and continue 
to support and applaud progress in that area.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The Incubator continues to see good progress in a number of projects
and their communities, with more projects graduating to TLP status, or
to existing TLPs.

This quarter saw healthy discussion of what constitutes a healthy
community.  The issue came up in regard to Derby (the Derby PPMC has
exhibited a welcome response to addressing the issue), but really is
generic to all projects, incubator and otherwise.  As an aside, I try
to keep track of recent Incubator graduates, and am generally pleased
with how well they continue to do after leaving.

Derby is actively trying to expand the number and independence of
their Committers, with an eye towards graduating from the Incubator.

The Incubator PMC will take a look this quarter at what to do with
projects that have grown quiet.  Some sort of hibernation status is
one thought.

Resource related issues have eased somewhat.  Although, we still lack
a sufficent level of automation, things have improved considerably,
due in no small measure to Roy helping out with mailing lists, David
Crossley helping to keep the web site built, and others contributing
their time.

                           - 0 -

The list of projects in the Incubator is at
http://incubator.apache.org/projects/.  Attached are the STATUS
reports from the PPMCs that have provided one.  Other projects did not
submit a status report to the PMC, or submitted one too late for
inclusion in this quarter's report.


Status Report from the JDO PPMC
===============================

The Apache JDO project is chugging along. The 1.X reference
implementation, API spec (javax.jdo interfaces), and TCK have been
migrated to the ASF subversion repository, and the 2.0 API spec and
TCK are under development. Expert Group communication is being
migrated or mirrored to the ASF mailing lists as much as possible,
including the regular conference call minutes.

Two additional committers, Matthew Adams and Erik Bengtson, have been
added to the project this quarter, in addition to the initial project
committers. Both Matthew and Erik are members of the JSR 243 expert
group, as well.


Status Report from the Nutch PPMC
=================================

Nutch is nearly ready to attempt graduation.  Recently we ported our
wiki from Sourceforge, so now the project is entirely hosted at Apache.

All committers are active.  We disabled several components when we
moved to Apache, due to license compatibility problems, but nearly all
of these have now been resolved.  The Nutch Organization filed a
Software Grant with the Apache Software Foundation, formally giving
all Nutch software to Apache.


Status Report from the Jackrabbit PPMC
======================================

http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/
http://incubator.apache.org/projects/jackrabbit.html

Jackrabbit is doing well as a project and is attracting interest
both within other Apache projects (Lenya and Graffito in
particular) as well as from new folks in the Java community.
We added two new committers, Jukka Zitting and Dominique Pfister,
and have received sustained contributions from Serge Huber,
Edgar Poce, Angela Schreiber, Felix Meschberger, and others.

Jackrabbit's only problem right now is continued reliance on
JCP EG private discussions due to the unfinished nature of the
JSR 170 Content Repository for Java Technology API.  JSR 170 is
expected to be submitted for final draft status in early May,
after which all of the discussion can be moved to Apache lists.
We anticipate graduating from Incubator sometime soon after that.


Status Report from the Graffito PPMC
====================================

1) Any legal, cross-project or personal issues that still need to be
   addressed?

no

2) What has been done for incubation since the last report?

* The most important work was made on the Jetspeed 2 integration &
  building some JSR-168 portlets. There is a content tree view, a
  document viewer and an admin browser portlet. Futhermore, we have
  integrate an HTML editor (Kupu).
* Some work has been done for the security management (fine grain
  access control, permission management, JAAS support, ...).
* We have started raising awareness and promoting the project on
  some other Apache and non-Apache lists in order build further
  the community.
* New developers have started collaborating with the core team
  on Graffito work, especially JCR mapping tools.

3) Plans and expectations for the next period?

* Implementing our JCR mapping framework with Jackrabbit.
* XML editor integration.
* A Graffito implementation for the Jetspeed 2 page manager.
* Continue our work on the JSR-168 portlets (search & version management).
* Start a site demo with a Jetspeed integration
* We expect the committer base to expand during next period given the
  current developer participation on the dev mailing-lists.

4) Any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly for
   you?

None so far.


Status Report from the Agila PPMC
=================================

Agila is going slower than hoped for various reasons, but recent
addition of the BPEL engine Twister should help.

Matthieu Riou is bringing Twister, and we hope this can rekindle spark
and interest in the combined project.


Status Report from the Beehive PPMC
===================================

Beehive is in the home stretch of its 1.0-level release; we declared a
beta release in March, and are on track to deliver a 1.0 in the late May
timeframe.  Posting automated daily builds continues to be an challenge,
but otherwise infrastructure is well in place.  At this point we are
largely focused on fit'n'finish issues in the code, as well as a
polished set of samples and documentation.

The Beehive community added Bryan Che as a new committer in 2/05.  With
the beta release and open planning on features for the next version, we
are seeing increased dev/user list activity -- we anticipate that the
1.0 release will be even more significant in building the community, and
hope to graduate from the Incubator sometime soon after the 1.0 release.
Certain Beehive components have a very clear affinity with the Apache
Struts and AXIS projects, and those projects may play a role in
graduation (pending further discussion).

Status Report for WS sponsored incubation (Apollo, Hermes, Muse)
==========================================================================

- Reviewed and updated Status for Apollo/Hermes/Muse on incubator 
  svn/wiki.
- Apollo, Hermes and Muse are actively considering petitioning an exit
from incubation.
- Apollo and Muse participated in the OASIS interops for WSRF and WSDM
respectively
- Hermes is considering a name change to Apache PubSub
- Apollo is considering a name change to Apache WSRF
- Added two new committers to Apollo and one each to Muse and Hermes
- Working on getting Hitachi to help with Apollo/Hermes/Muse.

Status Report for Juice
=======================
- Juice is not active at all. We need to consider shutting down this 
  project
- Folks lost interest as our iCLA/CCLA process problems caused too much 
  delays.
  #1: One of the main developers did not get his apache id because i
      lost track of his iCLA and did not request root for id as soon 
      as his iCLA got registered.
  #2: We did get their CCLA a while back which had an extra addendum 
      (U of Memphis) but we took too much time for legal review. Got 
      resolved 2004-12-30 according to the svn:foundation/legal/STATUS
      file.

Status Report from Derby PPMC
=============================

- Recently, IBM posted a contribution of a JDBC network client driver.
The community voted to accept the submission, but there was some
question as to whether or not such a significant contribution is
covered by the original Derby CCLA or whether it will require a new
one.  This was resolved by IBM submitting an amendment to the original
CCLA/software grant listing the files in the new contribution.  The
amendment has been faxed to Noel and is being snailed to the ASF
secretary.

[Update: On 27-April-2005, the ASF received an addendum to the Derby
CCLA and Software Grant via the Incubator PMC Chair]

- The Derby logo vote was temporarily shelved due to voting irregularities.

- Derby has satisifed all requirements necessary to graduate from
incubation except for diversity of committership. Recent discussions
on general@incubator seem to point to this being the only barrier to
graduation that needs to be overcome. Jeremy Boynes was added as a
committer earlier this year, but he remains the only non-IBM
committer. New developers are getting up to speed, however, as
evidenced by the acceptance of recent contributions by non-IBM
developers Tomohito Nakayama and Shreyas Kraushik.

- mailing list activity continues to grow steadily, both in number of
subscribers and in overall activity. Recent stats show about 1000
posts to derby-dev in the last 3 months, around 2700 total in the nine
months since inception, and about 500 posts to derby-user since
inception.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache James Project

Nothing that needs board guidance here.  One new PMC member (just
ack'd by board today), no new committers, and no releases.

Developer talk is increasing and positive by both committers and
others, and we're sorting out a strategy for getting off of Avalon.
We'll be slowly refactoring the codebase into container-neutral POJO's
and will down the road decide what container/platform(s) we'll
support.  The evolutionary approach has gained a lot of support, and
seems to have much more chance at success than the revolutionary
alternatives.

Been a frustrating year or so, but looks like things are starting to
pickup again.

Attachment G: Status report for the Apache MyFaces Project

Latest News
===========
We are currently having an exciting discussion with Oracle.  Oracle
has expressed serious intentions to support MyFaces. They want to make
their ADF components open source and are willing to donate them to the

In addition to that, Oracle will provide assistance with two JSF
experts (Adam Winer and John Fallows). They will help us with the
integration and the support for the new components.  The exact roadmap
for the integration is not yet fully discussed, but we have come to an
agreement, that a step-by-step approach is the best solution in this
case.  Please bear in mind that - at the request of Oracle - this
information should be kept confidential until their legal department
has approved things. They also like to make some kind of announcement
at JavaOne (June 27 - 30). So, at the latest we will have an exact
plan then and - of course - we should not steal the show now. ;-)

Community
=========
We have a strong community and the user list
(users@myfaces.apache.org) is frequently used: about 10 new threads a
day, 3 replies at an average, almost no thread with no reply at all.

Management
==========
As resolved by the board the MyFaces PMC consists of the following
initial members:
  Manfred Geiler (manolito@apache.org)
  Thomas Spiegl (tomsp@apache.org)
  Martin Marinschek (mmarinschek@apache.org)
  Matthias Wessendorf (matzew@apache.org)
  Sylvain Vieujot (svieujot@apache.org)
  Grant Smith (grantsmith@apache.org)
  Bill Dudney (bdudney@apache.org)
  Anton Koinov (anton@apache.org)
  Travis Reeder (treeder@apache.org)
  Ted Husted (husted@apache.org)

Oliver Rossm?ller was already a PPMC member of MyFaces in
Incubator. Because of an unfortunate mistake he did not appear in the
board resoltion draft.  Oliver was voted into PMC ex post and is now
an official member as well.

Domain
======
I'm still owner of the myfaces.org <http://myfaces.org> domain and
would like to point it to myfaces.apache.org
<http://myfaces.apache.org> if there is nothing to be said against
this. It expires in february 2006 and we could discuss later if it
makes sense to renew.

Infrastructure
==============
The mailing lists have been successfully moved from Incubator to top
level.  Moving the depository from Incubator CVS to top level SVN has
not been done yet, but infrastructure is already informed about this
pending Task.  We have a current discussion about the future project
structure. FYI, MyFaces consists of some parts that need to be
separated and rearranged: the JSR-127 API, the base JSF
implementation, common classes, additional non-standard components and
extensions, a sandbox (not yet)...

Release
=======

We have successfully released our first top level release "MyFaces
1.0.9 (m9)", but there where legal difficulties we had to solve.  The
release ran through the ordinary process with 3 release candidate and
was voted "stable" by the community. Nevertheless, according to JSF
license restrictions we are not allowed to call our releases "final"
until we have passed the JSR-127 TCK. There was a discussion on how we
should label this stable release ("beta", "non-final", ...). IMHO, we
found a good tradeoff: Our current release is called "MyFaces
1.0.9(m9)". "m9" stands for "milestone 9". In addition to this label
there is a detailed explanation on our page.  Craig McClanahan and Ed
Burns from Sun where both involved in this dicussion and consider this
solution reasonable.

Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

This has been a busy quarter in the Struts community. We have completed
the refactoring of the Subversion repository into subprojects, and added a
new master build system using Maven. Two new subprojects have joined the
fold; Struts Shale is an alternative approach to web applications based on
JSF, and Struts Flow allows complex workflows to be implemented using
JavaScript. Our first proposal for a Struts subproject written in C#,
named OverDrive, has been introduced in our sandbox area.

On the people front, in addition to the change of PMC chair, one new
committer, Hubert Rabago, accepted an invitation to join us, and we
welcome back David Geary from emeritus to active status.

Attachment I: Status report for the Apache TCL Project

This quarter was not very eventful for the Apache Tcl world.

Release
-------

We released Apache Rivet 0.5.0, which may become 1.0 if there are no
problems with it.

People
------

No changes with the people involved with Apache Tcl.

Projects
--------

Some (very) casual/informal discussions with the person behind the Jim
interpreter about the potential for working with the ASF, but nothing
concrete.  It's a neat project - although it's just beginning, it's
already getting a community rolling.  We'll see in the future.

Attachment J: Status report for the Conference Planning

Conference planning for the 2005 event in Stuttgart is proceeding
apace.  We have lined up two days of tutorials and three days of
conference sessions.  There continues to be concern about the apparent
increasing focus on Java-specific technologies; I have heard comments
from some people that they're not interested in ApacheCon -- or really
in the ASF -- anymore because there's very little there for anyone who
codes in any other language, or uses technologies that don't involve
Java.

Activity on the concom proper is increasing gradually.  More and more
members are getting involved, as lurkers if nothing else.

A restricted RFP was offered to Full Circle Productions (Charel
Morris), E-vents (Jeffrey Wainhause), Software & Support Verlag, and
Terry Deguili's company.  The first three returned proposals; the
fourth declined to bid.  I expect to make a decision this Friday.

This RFP was specifically for managing a 2005 event in the US.  An
unrestricted RFP for ongoing future US conferences will be offered
this Summer, and the contract awarded *after* any US show in 2005.
This is intended to spur the 2005 contractor (whomever it might be) to
extra effort in order to advance their bid.

The ApacheCon host system, which was donated several years ago by AMD,
suffered a CPU failure and is now dead.  For the interim, the site was
moved to some old spare hardware provided by Bill Stoddard.  AMD has
been contacted about possibly donating a replacement system  At this
point it has been all but decided that the ApacheCon system will move
to the ASF colo where it can receive more distributed support.  Due to
issues of non-profit/for-profit, it has been concluded that the
ApacheCon site needs to be on completely separate hardware, so a
virtual machine on an existing ASF system is not an option.

Reports from multiple sources indicate that at least two of the major
sponsors of ApacheCon 2004/US are withholding payment, which
has had a direct effect on the payments to the ASF and to some
speakers.  The issues are between the sponsors and Security Travel.

Attachment K: Status report for the Security Team


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

Done over last quarter:
- release of 1.0.4 (jdk 1.4), 1.0.4 (jdk 1.3), and beta of 2.0
- getting very close to a final v2.0.
- discussed RogueWave's proposal for a C++ port/subproject of
  XMLBeans.  The PMC didn't see any blocking issues with it, but we've
  asked them to propose it on the dev list for a public discussion and
  vote.  If all goes well, we'll be asking the Incubator PMC to take
  them on.

Still on the todo list:
- Get XMLBeans charter agreed on and approved
- Work with XML community to define XML federation
