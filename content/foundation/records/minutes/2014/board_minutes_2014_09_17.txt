 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       There has been some discussion about the maintenance of PMC records,
       with a couple of people interested in streamlining the process to
       reduce duplication and chances for human error.

       Other than that, another quiet month with nothing else to report.

    B. President [Ross]

       I'm still struggling under the fallout from my recent personal trials
       but things are slowly coming back together. Essential items are being
       addressed but some key activities are falling behind. I thank the
       board for their patience.
 
       TAC: All arrangements have been made for ApacheCon with logistics
       being handled by Melissa.
 
       Trademarks: Lots of discussions about how best to scale the trademark
       activities. VP Trademarks has agreed to focus on updating policies to
       ensure that it is clear that PMCs can manage their project marks.
       Sally has done a fantastic job on the Powered By logos, these (along
       with usage guidelines) are now staged on the foundation's website and
       will go live very soon.
 
       Press: Sally has completed a period of work with CloudStack but I am
       behind on following up on this and ensuring the project is able to
       move forward.  This is a very high priority item for me moving
       forward. Plans are underway for our 15 year anniversary at ApacheCon
       Europe.
 
       Sally is keen to update the website for the 15th anniversary. However,
       given the current status of the budget it is felt that hiring a web
       design company is out of the question while recent interest from a
       group of volunteers has died down. Sally is looking at revamping the
       home page with a view to requesting budget in the next fiscal year for
       a full site redesign.
 
       Fundraising: Upayavira has restated his intention to step down as VP
       Fundraising. This was first discussed almost a year ago. I wish to
       express my thanks to Upayavira who agreed to stay on in the role while
       we focused on documenting the process and ensuring our EA was able to
       assist. Upayavira now feels this work is complete and has asked that
       we find a replacement. No date has been set for the changeover.
       Expressions of interest into the role are welcome. In the meantime I
       again ask for Directors and other interested parties to volunteer to
       assist Melissa in contacting existing sponsors periodically.
       Volunteers to the fundraising@ list please.
 
       We have two new sponsors (Bluehost and Samsung) coming onboard this
       month - both at Bronze level. We thank them for their support.
 
       Infrastructure: We have further discussed the status of contractors
       and are exploring options. At present we have not identified an
       acceptable approach beyond the previous recommendation to use Virtual
       Inc. services as the employer. However, we have not yet exhausted all
       possibilities. At present our two new contractors (US based) are under
       contract and being managed accordingly.
 
       Good progress is being made in infrastructure services but a high rate
       of failures again this month has detracted from this progress to a
       certain extent. Nevertheless, all targets for uptime have been met.
 
       Work is underway to move apache-extras services that have been lost to
       SourceForge.
       
       TODO Group: Some organizations have created an organization for 
       "companies committed to open source". I had an early morning call with
       a representative of that group this morning and possible the engagement
       of the ASF was discussed. At this time the group is discussing what the
       groups mission and scope will be. I hope to attend an event in SF next
       week to find out more. See http://todogroup.org/ and 
       http://tech.blog.box.com/2014/09/announcing-the-box-open-source-open-house/

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        A relatively quiet month for the Treasurer's Office.
        
        The Treasurer's Office worked with the EA and infra team to address
        credit card issues for hardware purchases.
        
        Virtual and the Treasurer's Office and the Audit team are trying
        to put together a call to discuss the next steps on the Audit.
        
        The EVP and VP, Sponsorship set up a mechanism to take Bitcoin as
        a donation currency. Great work!

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary is running well. During the dog days of August, 97 iclas, 
       four cclas, and two grants were received and filed.

       There still is some confusion regarding under what circumstances 
       a CCLA is required. 

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        * ApacheCon
            * Europe

                We continue to move towards ApacheCon Europe. Now that
                we are just 2 months out, we will be pushing harder on
                projects and speakers to promote their content and bring
                the registration numbers up. As of the 15th,
                registration numbers are:

                    Attendees: 44
                    Committer: 26
                    Student: 1
                    Speaker: 72
                    Sponsor: 4
                    Total: 147

                With much assistance from the Cassandra community, we
                have added a Cassandra mini-summit, with a full track of
                content. The Cassandra project, as well as our friends
                at DataStax, will be promoting this as though it were a
                stand-alone event. This is an experiment to see if
                having conference promotions under several different
                banners is effective in bringing a larger audience.

            * Austin

                We have "soft announced" ApacheCon Austin as of the
                15th. See http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/
                for the website and CFP. We will start shouting about it
                over the next few days, and if you want to leak the news,
                please feel free to do so.

        * BitCoin donations

           On August 26th, a query to the Fundraising list about whether
           we accept Bitcoin donations prompted us to create a Bitcoin
           account. This was mentioned on Reddit and several news sites,
           including http://s.apache.org/bitcoinnews and within the
           first 24 hours we had pulled in over US$2000 in Bitcoin
           donations. The rate has slowed down considerably since then,
           and our balance now is just under 7 Bitcoins, or US$3,300.

           In addition to the monetary benefit, this event got us quite
           a bit of very positive press on a wide range of news sites.

                 asked for the release five months ago.  We have moved the 
                 affected functionality to optional modules that are disabled 
                 on Java8.  If Commons does decide to actually create the

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

trademarks@ volume was lighter than usual this month, allowing catchup on some
outstanding third party questions.

Sally did an amazing job of developing and rolling out the new Powered By
Apache logo set and guidelines, including suggested logos for all Apache
projects.  These are a simple way that projects can choose to have users show
their support of Apache and the projects in a wide variety of contexts.

Along with DLAPiper's continuing assistance on tracking registrations and
legal advice, in conjunction with Jim I've gotten some excellent trademark
policy advice from Pamela Chestek, creator of ModelTrademarkGuidelines.org, in
terms of the most effective ways to craft our public policies.

Started work on updating brand policy contact us page, which starts the
process of explicitly pointing third party questions to capable PMCs who have
asked to handle more third party questions directly.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

See Melissa's report for much of the Fundraising activity.

A week or so ago I mentioned to Ross and Rich that I believe it is time for
me to stand down as VP Fundraising. The role has always included an element 
of sponsor liaison that I have generally neglected. Having established the 
basic mechanisms of sponsor tracking and renewal, which is now functioning
effectively in Melissa's capable hands, I believe it is now time for me 
to hand over the reigns to someone who can better fulfill the sponsor
relationship management aspect of the role. This is both in relation to
our existing sponsors, along with pursuing contacts that have been made at
various conferences, for example at OSCON by David, Rich and myself.

I have no specific timescale for standing down. My concern however is more
that the work that isn't being done is started, and that I cease to be an
impediment to it.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are under budget with no payments due at this time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally Khudairi received signoff
from Brand Management on the “Powered by Apache” mark and guidelines for
Apache project logos, and worked with Ross Gardler to have them uploaded to
apache.org (currently staged at
http://www.staging.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/). She also responded to a
request for graphics development for Apache TomEE winning a Duke's Choice
Award. Sally responded to some fundraising questions pertaining to
Platinum-level sponsor outreach. Sally was working with Shane on a blog post
on corporate guidelines on engaging with the ASF, which has now evolved to
showcase ASF operations/achievements as part of its 15th Anniversary
publicity. Sally's three month work period with Apache CloudStack had
terminated in July; she helped write and distribute issue the CloudMonkey™
v5.2.0 announcement on 28 August, and has assisted with several media queries.
No further developments have taken place in response to Sally's Outline for
CloudStack Marketing Plan sent on 24 June.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe: 

 - 11 September 2014 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™
   Cassandra™ v2.1
 - 02 September 2014 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Donations
   Accepted Using Bitcoin

IV. Informal Announcements: 3 items were tweeted on @TheASF, including a
project release extracted from announce@apache.org and posted by Joe
Brockmeier, who has offered to continue to monitor the announce@ list and
tweet newsworthy items to augment the ASF's official/formal news. Coordination
with the Linux Foundation to promote the event on @ApacheCon continues.

V. Future Announcements: Sally is working with two TLPs to announce milestone
releases. She also responded to a request for promotional guidelines from a
podling with a new release. Those PMCs wishing to announce major project news,
as well as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator, are welcome to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at
least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution. 

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 4 media requests. The ASF received 571
press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count of 576. Our
monitoring media hits for CloudStack has yielded a total of 581 mentions this
month vs. 567 last month. 

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst queries, and fact-checking
request for a Forrester report on Cloud computing. Apache was mentioned in 4
write-ups by Gartner, 3 reports by Forrester, 7 write-ups by GigaOM, 7 reports
by 451 Research/Yankee Group, and 3 reports by IDC. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is working with the Linux Foundation team on
celebratory activities for the ASF's 15th Anniversary at ApacheCon Europe. She
is also working with Melissa Warnkin on the ASF's booth, signage, giveaways,
etc.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: discussions with RedMonk
regarding a possible group of Apache-branded DevOps and DataOps events in the
UK have suspended due to (non-ASF) scheduling issues.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 10 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of the calendar year, and continue to receive
gratis news release distribution by Pressat (UK).

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
========== 
Chris Lambertus (cml)
Geoffrey Corey (coreyg)


Finances:
========== 
RAM for VMware hosts  $715 Replacement HDDs  ~$1700
Mac OSX Build Slave $730 
Puppet training $1300
Domains: $17


Operations Action Items:
========================


Short Term Priorities:
======================

## Code signing Mark Thomas successfully concluded his testing and we were
able to come to agreement with Symantec. The service has thus far been
deployed with Mark Thomas leading efforts to deliver signed code for Apache
Commons. The Apache Commons PMC is currently voting on release artifacts for
the first signed binaries. Post-completion of this test the service will be
available to any PMC requesting the service. 

## Build/CI environment. http://s.apache.org/hDu
### Yahoo has graciously increased the number of machines that they provide
(and provide colo services for) to a total of 20 machines this year. This has
tremendously reduced the pending queue size for our build services. 

### Cloud slaves Our RAX cloud environment is now being utilized by Jenkins to
deploy (and destroy) machines on demand in response to load. Additionally,
we’ve made a RAX account available to the Gora PMC for twice yearly testing
they plan to engage in. 

Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Monitoring We are beginning to get insightful information out of monitoring.
We now have a mail loop that provides information on the cycle time from
sending to mail reception. Additionally we now have started monitoring some
elements of host storage. Centralized logging is making slow progress but has
a plan with a time table. 

* Automation The base level framework for machine automation is complete; and
that work is expanding. As we begin to need to break services out we are
building them with puppet. Additionally work to programmatically have JEOS
machines for bare metal as well as virtualization and cloud targets is
progressing nicely with most of that work expected to be wrapped up by end of
month. 

* Technical Debt/Resiliency Some work has happened identifying long
complaining error conditions in a number of processes and resolving them;
currently focused on errors around backup scripts. 
  
General Activity:
=================

* Welcomed two new contractors, Chris Lambertus and Geoff Corey, to the fold. 
* We’ve dealt with a unusually high number of failed hardware issues this
month.
* Sourceforge has reached out to infra regarding migrating Apache Extras to
Sourceforge. 
* The machine that houses our US web server (for www.a.o and $tlp.a.o) as well
as mail-search and the moin-moin wiki has experienced tremendous IO load. Work
is ongoing to breakout those services and reduce total IO load for any given
machine. This has been noticeable to end users in the form of wiki slowness
and updates to project websites being slow on the US website. 
* repository.apache.org suffered a severe service degradation that resulted in
many projects being unable to publish artifacts to Nexus for several days. For
details see: http://s.apache.org/H2f
* We’ve found a number of processes that infra executes that appear to be tied
to being listed as a member in LDAP. We’re working to resolve that issue and
tracking it in INFRA-8336
 
Uptime Statistics:
==================

Targets remain the same in the last report (99.50% for critical, 99.00%
for core and 95% for standard respectively).
These figures span the previous reporting cycles as well as the
present reporting cycle (weeks 34-38). Overall, the figures have gone up
since the last report, and we are continuing to meet the uptime targets.

Type:                   Target:   Reality:   Target Met:
---------------------------------------------------------
Critical services:      99.50%    99.97%        Yes
Core services:          99.00%    99.77%        Yes
Standard services:      95.00%    97.46%        Yes
---------------------------------------------------------
Overall:                98.00%    99.16%        Yes
---------------------------------------------------------

For details on each service as well as average response times, see
http://s.apache.org/uptime


Detailed Contractor Reporting
=============================

* Daniel Gruno:
  Work done since past report:
  
  - Cleared 30 JIRA tickets. See those for additional details.
  - Helped introduce Chris to his new job. This included setting up his account,
    putting it into the correct staff groups, assigning some easy JIRA tickets
    to get started with and walking him through the process of resolving these
    tickets.
  - Fixed some mailing lists mistakenly marked as private. This seems to be a
    reoccuring problem, so we will need to tighten our mlreq page and make it
    harder to create a private list.
  - Created new mailing lists for Reef.
  - On-call duties.
  - Started work on the Infrastructure presentation for ApacheCon EU.
  - Discussed doing a "Git at the ASF" talk with David at ApacheCon, as we have
    a free slot.
  - Dealt with Freenode's security breach (mainly rerouting some IRC services to
    the EU and resetting passwords).
  - Started work on resolving the current issues faced by non-member staffers.
    This will likely take some time to finish, and involve several people. Our
    first priority should be getting a new ACL set up for browsing the mail
    archives, so root has acces to this data. This is a sensitive operation, but
    one that should be well covered by the confidentiality clause in staffers'
    contracts.
  - ELK stack is progressing, storage setup expected to be done this week, at
    which point we will be able to start pointing some of the heavier services
    to it.
  - Answered queries from Joe Brockmeier re Hadoop moving to Git and the new
    status page.
  - Helped EVP and fundraising with the new Bitcoin donation methods (and
    answered queries on that).
  - Added commit comment integration with GitHub. This is still a work in
    progress, and I plan to rewrite then entire integration system when time
    permits.
  - Moved some VMs around in response to prolonged downtime on Erebus due to
    disk replacements. This resulted in minimal downtime for services (a few
    seconds at most).
  - Finished work on the subscription service for our monitoring of local
    project VMs.

* Gavin McDonald:
  Work done since last report:

  - 68 Jira tickets closed.
  - 7 Jira tickets closed were Hardware related repairs - Disks, PSU and Memory
    The hardware situation is much better. Still a couple to resolve.
  - More Jenkins work done, Ansible issues determined but the slaves are 
    unreliable at present. Still have no OOB access to them and 9 times out of 
    10 if a reboot is needed the slave doesnt come back. This situation is 
    only tollerable for a certain perios and that is nearly up. David is in 
    talks to get more slaves available.
  - Buildbot has been worked on some more, it got left behind due to other work
    but is now getting some love once more. There is one major nag in that some 
    slaves (and seem to be only the new ones) are failing randomly with xml 
    corruption failures even though the checkout performs fine. Testing shows 
    that the xml isnt being returned (but only some of the time.).
  - There are plans to upgrade Buildbot Master this month.
  - There are plans to upgrade Confluence (accross several versions) this month.
  - On Call duties
  - Working through reducing cron mails


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

The main list has been quite quiet, whilst in the background Jan and Melissa
have been working wonders with our TA and applicants. Getting all the info
needed, flights are just about booked and paid for, Hotel accommodation is
nearing completion and AFAICT those that need conference tickets have them.
One or two stragglers remain but overall we are in good shape going into the
conference. Thanks also go to Nick for his work and letting us use his card
yet again!

Good work team!

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

ASF voting in the W3C TAG election caused a discussion about what
membership of W3C brings, and whether to the foundation and/or an
individual committer.  W3C members are organisations, not individuals, and
some roles at W3C are explicitly for organisation representation.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

A relatively typical month with no issues or actions required by the board.

One item of note was discussed during the last 4 weeks. It was the
recurring thread regarding modifying the CLAs for cases where there
is no copyright (the typical example is code from/by US Federal
Government employees). It was explained that (1) this has already
been addressed, both by the ASF and several government agencies that
such modification is not required and (2) regardless of whether copyright
exists within the US or not, it doesn't affect its existence outside
of the US, and the CLAs are designed to be valid in the larger, world-wide
arena. This should likely become a FAQ (if it isn't already).

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Allura Project  [Dave Brondsema]

Apache Allura is an open source implementation of a software forge, a web site
that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, wiki pages,
blogs, and more for any number of individual projects.

Project Status
--------------

Allura graduated to a TLP in March.  Development continues at a moderate pace.

Community
---------

* Latest PMC member added in July 2014
* Ongoing tickets & commits from the active developers and one new contributor.
* A few tickets and emails from users and potential users of Allura.

Community Objectives
--------------------

We are ready to move our tickets from SourceForge to the Allura self-hosted
site.  Scripting has been done recently, just need to execute and resolve any
issues that arise.

We would like to find and encourage new contributors to Allura.  We also want to
explore if other Apache projects would be interested in using Allura.


Releases
--------

Last release was Feb 2014.  We should discuss making our next release.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command line
tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web
documents.

Project Releases

The last release of Any23 (1.0) was on 13-May-2014.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Project activity has been reasonably slow however this is nothing new 
for Any23 generally.
Any23 is being used within the Eurosentiment [0] project for extracting 
structured reviews from websites. These review are then used to build
topical lexicon on a website-by-website domain-by-domain basis.

There is currently a thread out discussing if a project release should 
take place.

[0] http://eurosentiment.eu/

How has the community developed since the last report?

Lewis John McGibbney is actively pushing for Any23 to become a well
recognised software component within the W3C Data on the Web Best Practices
Working Group. Since then our new PMC member Stephane has also been active.
It is our underatanding that Any23 will not be represented at ApacheCon EU.

Changes to PMC & Committers

Stephane Corlosquet (scor) was added to the Any23 PMC recently with his
account being created Tue, 19 Aug 2014 04:28:51 GMT.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================
Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.

Issues
======
There are no issues that we believe currently require the board's attention.

Releases
========
There have been no releases over the last three months. The last releases
were:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.6 (16th July 2013)
 * apache-bloodhound-0.7 (23rd August 2013)

Community & Development
=======================
No new committee members have been added this quarter. The last new
committee members to be added joined in January 2013. 

As mentioned in the previous report, Apache Bloodhound was involved in GSoC
for a second year, and we were able to accept three students with three
PMC members able to take on the duties of mentorship. In contrast with the
previous year where we only had one successful student, this year all of our
students were able to complete their projects successfully.

Following on from GSoC, we are beginning to look at the possible path of the
students to graduate to the PMC. Up until now we have not made any judgement
on whether the work towards GSoC is enough to warrant an automatic promotion
to the PMC.

Work towards a new release is ongoing. Currently there are no issues that
have been identified as blocking and so a candidate release is likely to be
ready for the community to vote on within a week.

In June and July we experienced some issues with the project's VMs which
appeared to be a result of the distribution upgrades that were required on
6th June. After requests to improve the puppet manifests to avoid excess
work on the main VM, the situation looks to have been resolved. However,
problems are sometimes reported with one of the two demos running on the
second VM.

No changes in community.
Last PMC member added Q4 2013
Last committer added Q3 2013

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Alexander Broekhuis]

Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on
interoperability between Java and C.

Activity
Celix graduated in July, during the summer committers where mostly on
vacation, so not much has happened. Work has been picked up again.
Most graduation steps have been performed, the source and website have 
been moved to the new location and mailing lists have been migrated.
There are still some open tasks, Jira send mails to the old list,
the website doesn't generate properly etc, that need some time to fix.

Statistics:
* Last committer added: 2014-03-04
* Last PMC member added: 2014-07-17 (Since we just graduated,
    the whole PMC has been set up during graduation)

* Mailing list activity since graduation: 32 messages on dev
* Commits since graduation: 45 commits
* Last release: 2014-02-24: Apache Celix 1.0.0 release

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in Java,
Python, PHP, .NET, and Objective-C (and possibly other languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.


== Project status ==

The sub-projects OpenCMIS (Java) and ObjectiveCMIS (Objective-C)
published a release this quarter.
A major enhancement to the DotCMIS sub-project (.Net) has been offered,
but hasn't been provided, yet.
There is not much activity around the other sub-projects at the moment.

Another group offered a web interface implementation for CMIS. We will
discuss if we accept the contribution and form a new sub-project when
we have access to the source code.

There are no board-level issues at this time.


== Community ==

Steady traffic on the mailing list but no community changes.


== Releases ==

Last releases:

OpenCMIS 0.12.0    2014-08-21
ObjectiveCMIS 0.4  2014-07-25

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Hugo Trippaers]

DESCRIPTION
Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage 
large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.

ISSUES

None

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* The community is working on maintenance releases for both the 4.3.0 and 
  the 4.4.0 releases.
* The agreed release schedule is not met at the moment as we regularly identify
  quality issues in pending releases. This is an ongoing process, but slowly
  we are improving our QA processes and introducing more testing capabilities.
* Apache CloudStack CloudMonkey 5.2.0 was released on Aug 28 2014. Apache
  CloudStack CloudMonkey is a CLI tool for interacting with Apache
  CloudStack and is distributed separate from Apache CloudStack  
* Apache CloudStack 4.4.0 was released July 26 2014. Some issues were
  identified with this release after the release. The community decided
  not to market this release to a big audience and work on a maintenance
  release immediately.
* The community is working with The Linux Foundation to prepare
  the second European CloudStack Collaboration Conference
  (CCCEU). CCCEU will planned following ApacheCon in 
  Budapest from November 19 till 21. It will have a new format
  which will hopefully engage more users and developers.
* The CloudStack PMC was approached with a request to approve an outside
  organization being formed in order for companies to pool resources together
  to help promote Apache CloudStack. This included a specific request to use
  the term CloudStack within the name of the organization. The PMC voted to
  approve that request, but also consulted trademarks@ to get advice on how to
  handle the situation.
  The response led us to the decision to not formally approve the use of our
  mark, but to point the requester to the ASF's domain name policy.
  As a followup action, the PMC was asked to communicate its general agreement
  to the concept of a trade organization being independently formed to help
  promote our project. The PMC did that via an email to the "parent"
  organization that is currently being considered by these companies as the
  home for the CloudStack Alliance.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary Gregory]

The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java components.

The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
Apache and without.

The last report was June 8 2014.

No issues require board attention at this time.

Overall project health is good with four releases this period. The [csv]
component finally crossed the 1.0 finish line and [imaging] is very close to
1.0 as well but not active right now.

Releases:

    2014-07-10: Apache Commons Email 1.3.3
    2014-07-10: Apache Commons Logging 1.2

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Luciano Resende]

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects

Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

PMC changes
-----------

Jim Jagielski has been voted into the Community Development PMC on 2014-05-21.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

GSoC is over. Of the initial 42 students 36 passed the midterm
evaluations and 35 passed the final evaluations.

The ComDev PMC decided to send Suresh Marru and Ulrich Stärk to the
GSoC Mentor Summit in Mountain View in October.

We had one case of alleged admittance to the program of one person
using multiple identities but the case could be dismissed after a
video conference and proof of identity has been submitted.

ComDev & Events
---------------

The ComDev PMC is now a "home" for some of the ConCom
responsibilities. Most of the recent discussions on our dev mailing
list are about ApacheCon EU 2014.

Other
-----

Replacement for Apache extras is still an open issue. Ross offered to
put somebody willing to drive the effort in contact with folks at
Sourceforge but nobody stepped up to take the responsibility for
driving it.

Invoices
--------

We will shortly approach the Fundraising team to prepare the invoice
for GSoC travel reimbursement and mentor stipends.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex Installer 3.1.0 was also released on 7/14/14.
-Apache Flex SDK 4.13.0 was released on 7/16/14.
-Apache FlexJS 0.0.2 was released on 7/17/14.
-Apache Flex FalconJX 0.0.2 was released on 7/17/14.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer was released on 8/21/14.

ACTIVITY
Activity in Apache Flex is becoming more diverse. While there is still
work going on fixing bugs in the existing Adobe Flash Platform-dependent
code base, and on FlexJS, a version of Flex that is independent from the
Adobe Flash Platform, there has been more tangible activity working on
Maven support for the various releases, another release of the Installer
that better tracks why Apache Flex installs have a high failure rate, the
donated Tour De Flex was released, a release of a Spell Checking library
is in progress, and a committer and recently-added committer are working 
on TLF Table support in a GitHub fork.

Also, we reconfigured both the Flex SDK and FlexJS SDK install scripts to
use download servers that are not blocked in China, and had the install
scripts localized to Chinese, enabling what we hope will eventually become
a significant population of users. On our website, China is not too far
behind the US as the most frequent visitors.

Adobe is starting to shutdown some of its Flex-related web sites.  We 
had to reconfigure our installer to download some optional Flex 
dependencies from different servers, but installs of older Apache Flex 
releases are now broken.  One a good note, Adobe did install redirects 
from its version of Tour De Flex to ours, resulting in a significant 
boost in traffic and attention.

In the past three months we've continued to see:
- Continued JIRA activity (more bugs raised than resolved however)
- New committers and potential committers.

Code Donation Update
-Swiz donation is still pending. The donor has not filed the paperwork.
-Judah Frangipane donated the Radii8 code base. It is a tool to help
Apache Flex users design their UI.

COMMUNITY
-Chris Martin, Darkstone and Judah Frangipane were added as committers
-Latest analytics include around 2000 hits per day on the website during 
the work week (less on weekends). That's slightly down from before.
-There were more than 4,000 installs of 4.13.0 in the 6 weeks since its release.
-There were more than 120 installs of FlexJS in the 6 weeks since its release.
-There have now been more than 60,000 installs of the Apache Flex SDK.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Gump seems to create useful results for the few projects that use it.
This quarter showed more activity than usual with Gump learning to
deal with git submodules and vmgump being upgraded to Ubuntu 14.04.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

With Ant and the Antlibs migrated to git and the Antlibs using git
submodules it was necessary to add support for transparent handling of
git submodules, this has been implemented in July and seems to work
well enough.

Mark Thomas was kind enough to upgrade vmgump from Ubuntu 10.04 to
14.04 which freed us from the need of a hand compiled git and provided
us with a few more recent compilers and libraries.  Mark has been
added to the list of sudoers on vmgump.

vmgump's httpd has been added to the lists of services monitored by
infra "the pubsubified way".

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.  The most
recent addition to the PMC was in December 2006 when we added Sander
Temme.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

Argus appears to be brand new.  They don't have a working website yet (was
unclear if there was a pending ticket for it not), though mailing list is 
working and let me subscribe.  They do have a draft board report floating 
around their mailing list, which is a great sign for a brand new podling.


--------------------
Brooklyn

Brooklyn is a framework for modeling, monitoring, and managing applications
through autonomic blueprints.

Brooklyn has been incubating since 2014-05-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Performing our first release under Apache
  2. Grow the community
  3. More diversity of the committers/PPMC (currently biased towards
     employees of a single organization)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our community continues to grow slowly but surely, and has received
  contributions from new community members that are significant and
  highly interesting to our project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  No major changes from the last report; we are well-settled into our
  new home and commits are being made at a regular rate. Preparation for
  our first release continues.

  We neglected to mention in last month's report about the completion of
  a code grant for the "camp-server" component. This is a crucial
  component of Brooklyn, and deserves its place in Brooklyn, rather than
  an external dependency where we would have no control over release
  schedules and bug fixing. So we are grateful to the donor, Cloudsoft,
  for passing this component to Apache Brooklyn.

Date of last release:

  No releases under Apache yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No change since 2014-07-02.

--------------------
Drill

Description:

Apache Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of 
large-scale datasets that is based on Google's Dremel. Its goal is to 
efficiently process nested data, scale to 10,000 servers or more and to be
able to process petabyes of data and trillions of records in seconds.

Drill has been incubating since 2012-08-11.

In the previous reports, the following were listed as goals before 
graduation

  1. Complete the feature set
  2. Continue to attract new developers/contributors with a variety of
     skills and viewpoints
  3. Continue the outreach activities to build the early user community for
     the technology

These have been achieved and the podling has made several releases with no
more than minor issues that were related to changing requirements for 
notices in incubator projects. The next release (0.5) is currently being 
voted on.  Subsequent to that, the podling is likely to vote to request the
board to graduate Drill to TLP status.

Issues to Call to Attention of PMC or ASF Board:

  None

Fleece (currently renaming to Johnzon)

Implementation of JSR 353: JavaTM API for JSON Processing.

Fleece/Johnzon has been incubating since 2014-06-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Rename the project due to naming conflicts with "Fleece".
     New approved name is "Johnzon". Waiting for INFRA-8269.
  2. Expanding the community, increase dev list activity and adding
     new committers.
  3. Publish first incubator release.

  The Fleece project status page at http://s.apache.org/0m
  needs updating but that would be pending on #1 due to many items on
  the statuspage need to be re-visited once #1 is settled.
  Clutch needs also an update.

Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Community Developement:
Apache Kalumet 0.6-incubating version has been released.
However, due to some misunderstanding, the release vote has not been
completed by 3 IPMC.  Especially, some legal files issues have been raised.
We are preparing a 0.6.1-incubating release to fix the legal files and
submit to IPMC vote.  We are in the way of promoting the documentation
on the website.

Project Development:
We are preparing the 0.6.1-incubating (plan for September, 20) to fix the
legal files issues raised on 0.6-incubating release and have a complete
IPMC vote.
We are preparing the 0.7-incubating release with the development changes.

Local branches have been created containing:
- new model and REST API
- new webconsole (remove of Echo framework)
These local branches will be merged on the 0.7-incubating branch (master).

Before Graduation:
   - The documentation has been updated and aligned with the 0.6-incubating
   release. The documentation will be promoted on the website and "linked"
   in announcement e-mails as soon as the 0.6.1-incubating release has
   been voted.
   - The 0.7-incubating release will fix the graduation issue, especially
   in term of license (removal of Echo2 framework for the UI).

Post Graduation:
  - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept
  globally to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
  deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of:

None so far.

log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We need to release 0.11.0 as maintenance release.
  2. We probably need to decide what's an acceptable platform/compiler 
     list, sort out any remaining hiccups, and then move towards a release.
  3. We need to make a broader use of the ASF infrastructure
     (notably the CI, as well as improved management of the Jira
     site - notably with triaging), and establish a roadmap for
     the next releases.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  N/A

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No changes in team.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Mails suggest that there's work going on in the background by some 
  committers especially regarding the build process, but there hasn't been 
  any notable commit in the last weeks. The current trunk now fixes most of
  the important outstanding bugs and we are actively supporting the 
  project. Some minor changes have been applied for the website.

Date of last release:

  2008-04-03 was the official, pre-incubation 0.10.0

  Many post-0.10.0 commits exist on trunk which we intend to get out as 
  0.11.x.

interest.

--------------------
MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and 
Flink.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. increase the number of active committers
  2. increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list 
     activity

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

none

How has the community developed since the last report?

We have released our second release under Apache incubation. After we
added Apache Flink as an evaluation backend for MRQL, there was an
interest by the Flink community in our project, which may result in
collaboration between the projects and may expand our user community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

We have added support for Apache Flink. Now users can run MRQL queries
on a Yarn cluster using 4 different backends (Hadoop map-reduce, Hama,
Spark, and Flink), without having to change their queries.

--------------------
Optiq

Optiq is a highly customizable engine for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like
access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query
optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

Optiq has been incubating since 2014-05-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Migrate fully to Apache infrastructure (next: nightly builds).

 2. Re-organize code into org.apache.optiq namespace.

 3. Improve web site.

 4. Build an ASF community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 We are planning our first hackathon.

 There have been community discussions about the goals for a future
 1.0 release, in particular whether the project should be reorganized
 to allow projects to use the optimizer core without using SQL parser
 and code-generation facilities.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Adopting Apache infrastructure:

  * First release approved by PPMC and Incubator PMC
  * Web site

 We will push our and announce the release shortly.

 Apache infrastructure is extremely frustrating. The release has
 taken a lot longer than it should have because it frequently makes
 this newbie feel like an idiot. Questions are answered promptly but
 it is difficult to know what questions to ask.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Mark Miller]

The Apache Lucene project develops open-source search software.


TLP
---

We added one new committer in the last quarter: Tomás Fernández Löbbe George
Aroush went emeritus from the PMC.

We have closed down the OpenRelevance sub project. The project is dead,
mailing lists are currently removed. We have preserved the Wiki.


Lucene Core and Solr
--------------------

Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit.

Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core.

In the last quarter we made two releases of both Lucene Core and Solr:

 - 4.9.0 on 25 June 2014
 - 4.10.0 on 3 Sept 2014

The corresponding Apache Solr Reference Guide was released as PDF version,
generated from the Confluence Wiki:

 - 4.9 on 30 June 2014
 - 4.10 on 7 Sept 2014

The community is very active.

Security: There were two security issues reported:

 - An XXE vulnerability was reported against Apache Solr
   (CVE-2014-3529). The issue was caused by the bundled Apache
   POI library. Apache POI fixed the issue and released
   bugfix packages. An advisory was posted on the Solr web page
   about how to update the bundled libraries in existing
   deployments. The recent release of Apache Solr 4.10.0 is no
   longer vulnerable.
 - External search web pages, referenced by the Lucene/Solr
   site, were vulnerable to an XSS attack. Both providers,
   LucidWorks and Sematext, were contacted and they
   fixed the problem.


PyLucene
--------

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is almost
entirely an automated port, so this project will never require a lot of
developers.  The user community is active.

In the last quarter we made one release of PyLucene:

 - 4.9.0-0 on 17 July 2014


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

In the last month we have had a significant contribution from some interns at
Microsoft. After working through CLA/ICLA issues we were able to get their
code for a port of Java Lucene 4.8 into our official Lucene.Net repo. We are
actively working on getting tests to pass (with approx. 3/4ths passing). As
well as porting additional contrib packages for additional functionality.

We had some issues with the ICLA, and it was determined, with legal, secretary
and some board input, that we are not going to question CLA's and their
responses where they say they do not require employer CCLA's. 

== Releases ==

Working toward 4.8. Additionally we have a 4.3 port targeting portable common
library in the works.

== Statistics ==

Nuget package downloads: 
Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 85731 
Lucene.Net Contrib 3.0.3: 25325
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial: 3480 
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial.NTS: 842

== Additional Information ==

- We've gotten some support from Microsoft developers, it looks like there is
  a group in MSFT that is taking an active interest in this project (just an
  observation)
- We've had some questions about the health of the project on our mailing
  list, as well as a number of people asking how they could get involved
  (from website maintenance to porting code)
- A few of our committers are very active working to finalize the v4 port of
  Lucene.Net
- There have been ~50 new questions tagged as Lucene.Net since July
  (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lucene.net?page=1&sort=newest&pagesize=50)
- Overall, I feel we are doing ok, but as a team we need to get a new release
  out (last release was end of 2012) 

Our last PMC Member and Committer was added late 2013

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache OpenMeetings Project  [Sebastian Wagner]

This report was due for the board meeting in August 2014.

Apache OpenMeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white
board, collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using API
functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.

== Releases ==

Version 3.0.2 has been released. Version 3.0.2 is the second bugfix release
of Apache OpenMeetings. There is currently a vote running for 3.0.3 and it is
expected to be released some time in September.

== Activity ==

The constant activity in mailing list, jira and commits. 

The process of migrating OpenMeetings from Ant/Ivy to a Maven module build is
complete. Also the website at http://openmeetings.apache.org is re-build
using more or less the same content but using the Maven website templates.

Trunk is already version 3.1.x. Version 3.1.x reduces the amount of Flash
used again. While version 3.0.x is still using OpenLaszlo and the entire
conference room is using Flash, in version 3.1.x only the video containers
are Flash. The rest of the conference room is build using HTML5. Also this
version will build those Flash components using Apache Flex.

Infra team provided a demo server to the project. We are still in the process
of installing some of the SSL components of OpenMeetings.

The idea is to expand the automated testing in the next 6-12 months with a
Selenium test suite that runs against that server. And to integrated that
into the daily builds and release process.

== Community ==

There is constant activity in the mailing list however no new members have
been voted into a PMC role.

== Infrastructure ==

No outstanding issue. We have seen that there is some work ongoing to provide
a SSL certificate for Apache projects for code signing (INFRA-3991). We are
following that to integrate it into our build process.

== Board ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Joern Kottmann]


The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging,
named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.
These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing
services.

Development
------------------
The development team remains active, but the activity decreased over
the summer month. The 1.6.0. release is still not out but will hopefully
be finished this year. Most open issues for it are solved.

Community
---------------
The community remains active and there is good traffic on the lists.

There are no new PMC members and there have been no PMC/PPMC additions
since the project moved to Apache.

Vinh Khuc (May), Tommaso Teofili (April) and Rodrigo Agerri (March) have
become committers in the first half of 2014.

Releases
------------
The last release OpenNLP 1.5.3 was released on 15.4.2013.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]


Apache OpenWebBeans 1.x is an ALv2-licensed implementation of the "Contexts
and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform" specification which is
defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0).

OpenWebBeans 2.x will also implement the CDI-1.1 and CDI-1.2 (MR)
specifications(JSR-346) and also CDI-2.0 (JSR-365).

Board Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention this time.

Development

Development continues in trunk to implement CDI 1.2 as OpenWebBeans-1.5.x.

Members of the community also actively contribute to the CDI-2.0 JavaEE
specification which has been filed as JSR-365.
 

New Releases
OpenWebBeans 1.2.6 on 2014-06-22


Discussions.

Nothing which requires board attention.

We discussed that we will likely rename our trunk from owb-2.0.x to owb-1.5.x
as there is a new CDI-2.0 specification and we would like to have the OWB
numbers align with the spec version.


Community

Community activity is fine. We are working towards CDI-1.2 and are already
passing more than 900 TCK tests.

A short note: this is part of JavaEE7 but we don't have any licensing issues
as both the CDI spec and it's TCK are ALv2 licensed.

We are currently watching a new contributor who shipped very valuable fixes
and is working on TCK issues.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Gert Vanthienen]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF and Apache Camel.

With all the version upgrades and the JIRA notifications that go with it,
we decided to create a separate issues@ list to make it easier for people
to notice and contribute to the actual discussions at the dev@ list.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow over the
summer, but is picking up again now that we're planning to do new releases.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community

Since our last board report, we voted in 1 new committer, Wim Verreydt.
We also invited Krzysztof Sobkowiak to join the PMC.

Community Objectives

After the initial few 5.0.x and 5.1.x releases, the goal is to keep a
steady release schedule and keep up with new fix releases of our
dependency projects.

We're also working towards further 5.x releases and a 6.0.0 release to
provide our users with major version upgrades of Karaf, Camel, CXF, ...

Releases

- Apache ServiceMix 5.0.2 in June
- Apache ServiceMix 5.1.0 in June
- Apache ServiceMix 5.0.3 in July
- Apache ServiceMix 5.1.1 in July

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- No new releases since our previous 1.2.3 bugfix release on
  25 February 2014.  A 1.3 release may be on the horizon as an interim
  before 2.0, but most recent development work has targeted the 2.0
  branch.

Community & Project:

- Mailing list traffic remains steady compared to last quarter.

- Efforts towards a 2.0 distribution remain active on a separate dev branch.
  Changes are nearly complete, and we hope to make a 2.0 release this quarter or
  early next.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

Development:
Implemented Record based on ISO 19103 (Geographic
information - Conceptual schema language). This is Fortran-like
construct needed for the implementation of other ISO standards.
Implemented Feature model based on ISO 19109 (Geographic information -
Rules for application schema). Feature is aimed to be the container of
most data handled by Apache SIS. Update SIS implementation of ISO 19115
standard (Geographic information - Metadata - part 1: Fundamentals) from
version 2003 to version 2014[1]. Began the port of Coordinate
Transformation code from Geotk to Apache SIS.

Community:
Christina Hough has volunteered to translate the developer
guide draft from French to English[2]. This developer guide is still
very incomplete, but the existing parts explain in details the process
of mapping international standards to Apache SIS API. Some updates from
version 2003 to 2014 of ISO 19115 were contributed by Rémi Maréchal.
Some of above-cited SIS work required synchronization with GeoAPI[3]. As
of August 27th, Christina has finished documenting all of the user's guide.

Branding:
No activity

Issues:
No activity

Releases:
We can not release before the update to ISO 19115:2014 is
fully completed, because partially-completed works make some API
inconsistent. After the update will be completed, we will propose a
release.

Press:
The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) offered us to write an entry
for their blog after the ApacheCon. Unfortunately we missed time for
doing that.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Kevin A. McGrail]

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent
email filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited
bulk email, more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to
email headers and content to classify email using advanced statistical
methods. In addition, SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that
allows other technologies to be quickly wielded against spam and is
designed for easy integration into virtually any email system.

Releases
--------
3.4.0 was released on 2014-02-11.

Our rules releases have been restored publishing 63 rule sets.

The release of 3.4.1 is pending and expected on or about Sept 30th.

No other releases for this quarter.


Community & Development
-----------------------
The most recent addition to our PMC is Adam Katz added on 2013-01-30.

The most recent addition to the committers is Joe Quinn added on
2014-02-27.

We still have 3 contributors invited to submit a CLA on the project and
begin moving towards committer karma with commits passed through to
current committers to vet and apply showing good community development
health.

Our RuleQA dev list has been active and community support is good.

The project users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

The project dev list has been active with both committers and community
members contributing.

We still need to get our Jenkins build slave working under FreeBSD
instead of Solaris1 (Bug 6887).


Project Branding Requirements
-----------------------------
   IN PROCESS - Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent 
product logo on your site 

NOTE: Pending TM being added to one version of the logo to make
the announcement for the new logo 

No other Branding issues known but we look forward to the Powered by
Apache logo!

Issues
------
SA was asked to clarify a previous report item mentioned.

In SpamAssassin, the ASF software product is the hammer.

However, the SpamAssassin rules published by the project are the nails.

With SA v3.3.0, we separated the rules from the code to make it so we
could more readily use an update infrastructure donated by anti-spam
community members to deliver daily rule updates.

As spam evolves, one of the tools that has grown to heavy use is called
an RBL or Real-time Blocklist also know as a DNSBLs because the
underlying technology that has been leveraged to deliver the RBL
world-wide is DNS-based.

I have begun the framework at
https://raptor.pccc.com/raptor.cgim?template=RBL with the intention to
run this under the project if permitted.  My concern is that this is
less of a "software" and more of a support resource.  

As such, is this something that the ASF would support or would the board
frown on such an item?

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment.

The project is performing well and the development is going towards
version 1.0.

The Stanbol project is participating in this year's Google Summer of Code
(GSoC) program.	Initially we had 4 active projects. 3/4 GSoC project were
successful. One dropped before mid term because the student disappeared
right after the start.

The three successful projects are

  1. Enhancement Workflows. Enterprise Integration Patterns in
     Apache Stanbol (STANBOL-1008)
     Student: Antonio David Perez Morales
     Mentors: Florent André, Rafa Haro
  2. Integrate YAGO2 and AIDA NED with Apache Stanbol (STANBOL-1384)
     Student: Chalitha Perera
     Mentor: Rafa Haro
  3. Speech to Text Enhancement Engine for Apache Stanbol
     (STANBOL-1007)
     Student: Suman Saurabh
     Mentor: Andreas Kuckartz

All three projects have provided patches with the results. Those will
be integrated to the Stanbol code base with the help of the Mentors
and the Students.

Subscribers on the dev list: 217

No new committers or PMC members were elected.

Last new committer was
  Antonio David Perez Morales on Jan 14th, 2014

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Hiranya Jayathilaka]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

No new committers or PMC members were nominated this quarter. Latest
Synapse committer was elected on December, 2013. Latest Synapse PMC
member was elected on December, 2013. 

Releases
========

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on 
January, 2012.

We continue to engage with the Apache Axis2 community to get the 
necessary upstream projects and libraries released, so we can proceed
with a Synapse 3.0 release. The response from the Axis2 team has
been very positive, but the progress is somewhat slow. In the 
meantime we are discussing alternative ideas for speeding up the
Synapse 3.0 release.

Board issues
============

None identified.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Greg Reddin]

Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for modern Java
applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify the
development of user interfaces.

The Tiles project continues to move at a slow pace, but work is ongoing. In the
last quarter the project has produced one release:

 * Tiles-Request 1.0.5 GA

The community for Tiles remains the same.  The same one or two people
have been continuing to do much of the  development for Tiles. There
remains a little traffic in the users list and in the issue tracker and
these are responded to and/or fixed usually within a week or two. The
Spring community, and stackexchange.com, are the most active inputs to
the community.

We have not added any new committers or PMC members since 2012. Attempts
continue to build the active community. A paper was submitted to
ApacheConEU without any luck. Otherwise the community is small and slow,
but still present and active.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]

General:
  Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
  responsiveness on both dev and user lists.

Issues:
  The Apache Tomcat PMC continues to monitor the progress of the
  discussions with Oracle regarding regaining access to the TCKs.
  After a brief burst of activity at the end of April / beginning
  of May this appears to have stalled again.

Releases:
  * Apache Tomcat 8.0.9 - stable, 2014-06-26
  * Apache Tomcat 8.0.10 (not released)
  * Apache Tomcat 8.0.11 - 2014-08-26
  * Apache Tomcat 8.0.12 - 2014-09-06
  * Apache Tomcat 7.0.55 - 2014-07-29
  * Apache Tomcat Native 1.1.31 - 2014-07-08

Development:
  There was lots of development activity on Apache Tomcat 7
  and Apache Tomcat 8. We had first stable release of Apache
  Tomcat 8.

Community:
  Ian Darwin requested to step down from his PMC membership and
  went emeritus.

Security:
  CVE-2013-4444 - Important: Remote Code Execution
  In very limited circumstances, it was possible for an attacker
  to upload a malicious JSP to a Tomcat server and then trigger
  the execution of that JSP. While Remote Code Execution would
  normally be viewed as a critical vulnerability, the circumstances
  under which this is possible are, in the view of the Tomcat
  security team, sufficiently limited that this vulnerability is
  viewed as important.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache VXQuery Project  [Till Westmann]

Apache VXQuery implements a parallel XML Query processor.

ISSUES

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

STATUS

Apache VXQuery graduated from the incubator in July.
In the last month the activities were mostly around releasing the first 
non-incubating release (on Sep 7) and around performance measurements and
improvements.

COMMUNITY

All PMC members came in through graduation, all committers are PMC members.
The community is small but active.
Last committer (Steven Jacobs) was added in September 2013.

COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES

As the first non-incubating release is out we will again focus on completing
the engine and on growing the community. The next planned step towards
growing the community is to publish a paper on Apache VXQuery and thus
hopefully increase the visibility of the project.

RELEASES

Apache VXQuery 0.4 was released on Sep 7, 2014

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Whirr Project  [Andrew Bayer]

Apache Whirr is a library for running services like Hadoop or ZooKeeper in the
cloud.

Releases:
No new releases this quarter. Last release was 0.8.2, April 2013.

Community:
The PMC composition did not change, and we had no new committers since
the last report. The last PMC change was the addition of Andrew Bayer
in November of 2012, and the last new committer was Graham Gear, also
in November of 2012.

Issues:
Discussions were had with the jclouds PMC about merging the Whirr core
code into jclouds as part of moving Whirr to the Attic - doesn't sound
like that's going to happen. So it's probably time to move Whirr to
the Attic.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic,
component oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Released Wicket 6.16.0, 7.0.0-M2, 1.5.12, 7.0.0-M3, 6.17.0
- Nutch Google Summer of Code delivered admin interface using Wicket
- ApacheCon EU 2014 has 3 Wicket presentations
- No new committers or members were added in this period
- Fixed CVE-2014-3526
- Apache's Nexus repository availability spotty

Date last committer/PMC member added: 12 July 2013

Nutch GSoC

Fjodor Vershinin participated in the Google Summer of Code this year
and created an administrative interface for Apache Nutch using Wicket.

ApacheCon EU

Martijn Dashorst will present 3 sessions at ApacheCon EU in Budapest:

- Wicket Puzzlers
- Wicket and Java EE Sitting in a Tree
- Apache Wicket: 10 Years and Beyond

Apache's Nexus Repository

As a release manager I (Martijn Dashorst) have had a very tough time
attempting to prepare and release our project due to the spotty
availability of the Nexus repository. So much that it took a couple of
days investment on my part to circumvent connectivity issues (e.g.
INFRA-7984) during this release, but previous releases were plagued as
well by Nexus. The Nexus instability has become a liability for us even
though we release about once a month or two months: it usurps an
inordinate amount of time preparing and completing a release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of
REST style web services. The core server runtime is based on the
JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client
runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side
runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Community:
The Wink project has a small community which is not very active. We have
had discussions on how to increase community activity, and the initial
suggestion, that was to start working on JAX-RS 2.0 implementation didn’t
sustain itself for long. Having said that, I believe Wink is a mature project
with active users and we should not consider any retirement actions at the
moment. Last svn activity shows couple patches being applied towards wink 
website in August, but actually no code change since december 2013.

Releases:
* Last release was Apache Wink 1.4.0 which was released on September 15, 2013

Committers or PMC changes:
* Voted Gerhard Petracek was added as a Wink committer in August 2013.

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None

Apache Tuscany is an SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA.

ISSUES
- Community activity is very low.

RELEASES
- Last release was Tuscany SCA 2.0.1, 10/3/2013.

COMMUNITY ACTIVITY
- Last committer addition was Sebastian Millies, 12/4/2012.

- Mailing list traffic is low with 15 messages on the user list and 11
  messages on the dev list in 2014.

- There were no commits in 2014.

- A discussion thread was started on Aug 16 [1] on both user and dev lists to
  request community input on new development plans. Only one response so far
  from a PMC member suggesting a new release to pick up updated dependencies.

- The current PMC chair indicated on the private list his intention to step
  out of the PMC and asked for volunteers to replace him as he is too busy
  with other work. No response from other PMC members so far.

BRANDING
- The project needs to update logos with ™ and review the project DOAP file.
