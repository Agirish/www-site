 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Nothing specific to report this month.

    B. President [Ross]

       A very busy month, on many fronts. Apologies for the late filing. I'm trying
       to catch up. Here's the High and Low lights.

       EA has been chugging along ensuring we keep things moving. In her report
       Melissa indicates getting the Credit Cards has proven problematic. This
       morning I have had notification from her that Tom (Virtual) has indicated we
       should expect the cards in 7-10 days.

       TAC is wrapping up the EU activities and ramping up on the US activities. All
       is well.

       Trademarks has been busy evaluating the need to protect the ApacheCon
       conference from conflicting events organized by third parties. After some long
       (and often repetitive) debates an agreeable solution was found. Shane has now
       encoded the details in our event policy. However, I note the whole exercise
       will be have been pointless if we don't actually enforce it Relating to this
       the lack of any clarity around what a "blackout date" period is could cause
       problems should we ever wish to enforce those blackouts. While there is a
       little more clarity the current policy and MOU is still unclear.

       The trademark report also indicates there is a new trademark request relating
       to a training certification program. I am unaware of the details but note that
       Shane invites input on the trademarks list (and draw attention to the phrase
       "charging fees" in this context).

       Upayavira has finally hung up his hat over at Fundraising (though he's still
       helping with the transition). Jim and Hadrian have been in office for a month
       and the renewed (and doubled) energy is bearing fruit. See below for a little
       more on fundraising.

       Marketing has completed the usual activities (see report). In addition Sally
       is putting together the initial quarterly report. The first version of which
       will be retroactive in nature, but see below for further discussion. Sally is
       also working with Hadrian to send out "thank you" messages during the holiday
       season. Finally, I have asked Sally to work with me in crafting media campaign
       focusing on the ASF as a place for "Innovation and Collaboration" this will
       run prior to ApacheCon US and will be crafted to focus on a track I am
       chairing at the event. Note, this will not be an ApacheCon marketing campaign,
       it is an Apache Software Foundation campaign but will be designed to both
       ride-on and add-to the ApacheCon wave. It is early days (with only a handful
       of email exchanges at this point) so early feedback is on the high level
       messaging is welcome.

       Infrastructure, oh Infrastructure. Last month I took great pleasure in
       reporting that the team had had lots of opportunity to pay off significant
       technical debt. Not so this month (although progress is still being made). 

       I want to recognize that the infrastructure team responded extremely well to
       three significant outages. Whilst it would be good to have no outages (see
       technical debt) it is pleasing to see the team increasingly working as a team
       in the face of these outages. Full details of the outages are in the infra
       report all that we need here is for me to thank the team for "going the extra
       mile" to minimize impact on our projects.

       Greg has made some progress on the "contractors vs employees" solution, though
       as I understand it he has nothing significant to report at this point. I'll
       leave any fuller report to Greg.

       Lastly, as previously reported, VP Infra is keen to have a longer term view of
       where the ASF is heading so that he can make appropriate planning decisions.
       EVP arranged a two hour meeting involving VP Infra, VPs Fundraising, EVP,
       myself and the Chair in order to have an initial discussion about this. This
       was largely a brainstorming meeting. We focused mostly on how to properly plan
       for the consistent growth the ASF has been seen for a number of years (1.5 new
       projects per month with increasingly varied infra requirements) and how to
       ensure fundraising can provide income to support those plans. There were also
       some discussions about how to manage community growth and health across ASF
       projects, however given that those in the meeting were wearing their
       Presidents Committee hats these topics were not discussed in detail.

       Extensive notes were taken and will be shared in the raw form upon request.
       However, I would suggest that what is really important at this point is the
       immediate action items. The most important at this time (from a board
       perspective) is a suggestion to implement the budget planning adjustment
       suggested by some directors last year. That is to move out the budget planning
       so that our budget cycle falls six months after the board elections. 

       If the board are agreeable this will mean that the next budget for approval
       (May 1st) will be for eighteen months with the incoming board reviewing and
       potentially revising after the first six months. Subsequent budget cycles will
       be 12 months and will be set in the middle of the board term. I invite early
       feedback on this suggestion.

       If implemented this means the budget planning cycle will be:

       - Jan 2015 - Categorization of Infra services according to level of importance
       to our projects
       - Feb 2015 - Call to all committees for budget requests
       - March 2015 - Draft budget for board feedback
       - April 2015 - Approval of budget by the board
       - September 2015 - Revision of budget if necessary

       In parallel to this I propose to deliver, in partnership with VP Infra and VPs
       Fundraising a longer term (5 years), though less detailed, plan. The goal here
       will be to provide VP Infra with enough clarity to prioritize effectively
       whilst also giving the board an opportunity to review regularly. I propose
       that this longer term plan be approved alongside the budget as outlined above.

       I invite the board to provide initial feedback during the meeting but intend
       to raise this on the board@ mailing list shortly after the meeting.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


       Shane: We need the concept of "blackout dates" in the
       contracts even without being explicit. Still in process.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       The Treasurer’s office continues to work with Virtual to get the
       corporate credit cards up and running. A few more forms needed to
       be filled out and signed and we are awaiting the cards from Citizen’s
       Bank at this point.

       Chris and Tom Pappas from Virtual had a call to go over some
       outstanding loose ends and information to get the 990 process shored
       up. We are on track to get it filed on time with Virtual and the
       CPA. The President also assisted in this process by signing the
       engagement forms for the 990 to be completed by the CPA and Virtual.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The errors in the computer program that prepares incoming documents for
       processing by the secretary continued to impact timely receipt and
       acknowledgement of documents. The problem appears to have been resolved.

       In November, 85 iclas, 11 cclas, and four grants were received and
       acknowledged.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        We are in the ramp-up phase for ApacheCon North America, and
        I'm trying to gather a group of track chairs to shepherd
        content based on topic rather than specific project, as this
        makes it a lot easier to get people to attend. We are also
        trying to identify possible keynote speakers. Brian Behlendorf
        has confirmed that he will be keynoting. I'm also trying to
        contact as many of the early httpd crowd as possible to come
        celebrate httpd's 20th birthday. Brian is being very helpful
        with this.

        There has been discussion (as you will see in other reports)
        on the Trademarks list about event MOUs and blackout windows,
        and, for my part, I've been working with LF to encourage
        earlier planning, so that the blackout window becomes less of
        a big deal. Specifically, we're going to do our best to
        announce 2016 locations and dates at ApacheCon Austin. I don't
        yet know if this is actually feasible.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       I have started work on the contractor issue, but have nothing
       to report at this time.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, tm-registrations@, and board@) and following-up with
appropriate personnel Fundraising/Virtual:
•  Work still continues with Virtual re credit cards.  Citizens requested
additional paperwork/ID from Chris two weeks ago, which was provided. Virtual
is doing their part – Citizens needs to step up and get the cards issued!
•  Spoke with Tom and Lynsey on 12.11 re the cc situation.  Tom will be on the
board call and will answer any questions.
•  The credit card situation has gone on WAY TOO LONG, and we need a resolution
– we need credit cards in hand.  No more excuses, let’s get it done.
•  As of this writing, the sponsorship payments received since the last Board
Report are:  $20k WANdisco (re-instated sponsorship); $50k Comcast; and $10k
Cerner – final installment (upgraded from Bronze and paid six months early!).
•  CRM for Fundraising – should have a proposal within a week from Hot Wax
Media with their recommendation (they’ve been busy with traveling to/from
India, Thanksgiving, etc.).
•  Fundraising up-to-date at the moment; Jim and Hadrian transitioning into
their roles like pros! ApacheCon Europe:
•  TAC:  Final hotel bill (436,48 EUR) received on 12.2 – sent to Accounting
for payment
•  ACEU was a huge success – thanks to Rich for all of his hard work!! As
always, I had a lot of traffic at the booth! Everyone that I spoke with
thoroughly enjoyed the conference and the giveaways!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Updated large scale event MOU with feedback from counsel and many trademark
perspectives.  Renewed existing Hadoop-related MOU with updated terms. 
Updated the event policy with clarifications for blackout dates and trademark
attributions.

A third party is requesting trademark permissions to use an Apache project
logo for their training certification program.  Starting the process of
working with counsel to come up with a workable way to grant permissions. 
Feedback on our approach - charging fees, other requirements - appreciated on
trademarks@.

Several projects and members commented on the Corporate Recognition Best
Practices, which is helpful both to better explain the practices as well as
get feedback on more real-world applications of these type of guidelines for
Apache projects.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

The transition from Upayavira to Hadrian and Jim is progressing. Already
we have reached out to present (and potential) sponsors about the change.
There were some hiccups during the transition, but nothing of importance.

Hadrian is looking at ways to attract new sponsors and how we could run 
fundraising campaigns. Hadrian reviewed the fundraising@ threads for the 
past year and there are some good proposals we need to act on. Cleaning 
up our "Thanks" page is an example. Sally and Hadrian worked on a 
Holiday Thanks card project. We expect to send a digital Thank You cards 
to all sponsors this week.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
Andrew Bayer was added to root@

Finances:
==========
$758.48 Windows License
$761.27 Replacement Harddrives
$1607.78 Service contracts
$1247.95 AWS 

Operations Action Items:
========================
n/a

Short Term Priorities:
======================

Codesigning: 
------------
A number of projects inquired about codesigning at ApacheCon with
intent to sign up and request access to codesigning. 
In the last 30 days no releases have been signed. 

Machine deprecation: 
--------------------
The failure of the machine underlying the SVN master has caused some 
reprioritization of work and evaluating our older physical machines 
for the important services that run there. There is ongoing work to 
relocate the writable git service as well as the Bugzilla machines off
of the rapidly aging hardware. 
 
Long Range Priorities:
======================

Monitoring
----------
Work continues on monitoring, with several advances being made
The first is work with collectd that is being deployed to all of 
our puppetized-machines. This gives us insight into performance metrics
of the machine. Additionally, we've managed to get Dell's OMSA platform
for monitoring the underlying hardware deployed to a number of physical
hosts. This information is being utilized to monitor for things like 
failed disks, failed power supplies, and see other overall health
information like ambient and internal temperatures.

We've gotten a platform that integrates PagerDuty, Hipchat, and email
alerts for our Dell physical hardware that has OMSA installed.
You can see the code here: 
https://github.com/humbedooh/dsnmp 

We are also expanding the radius of hardware notifications from root@ 
to infrastructure-private. All of this while reducing that down to a 
single email per day. 

Automation
----------
We continue to make large steps forward in our automation efforts. 
The following services are now in configuration management. Several other
are currently in progress.
rsync.apache.org 
Git mirrors
Subversion master
status.a.o website

Additionally, some of our work from last months' work around 
getting the webserver into configuration management has been
adopted upstream. 
https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/pull/939

Resilience
---------
We now have a second critical service that we have the ability to 
easily replicate and redeploy. 

Technical Debt
--------------
We are encountering lots of touchpoints that are tied to specific 
machine names, specific file locations on specific machines and 
a large chunk of our time is spent in having to decouple this.

General Activity:
=================
This month has been extraordinarily taxing on Infrastructure, with
three large outages or service degradations occurring following 
ApacheCon. 

Several volunteers and contractors traveled to Budapest to attend 
ApacheConEU. In addition to a dedicated track around Infrastructure, 
an Infra hackfest table was manned where folks could come and ask 
questions or get help. Many folks took advantage of this. 

While at ApacheConEU, a number of volunteers and contractors met with 
folks from OpenOffice to talk about existing and future needs.
Details of this meeting can be seen in Andrea Pescetti's notes: 
http://s.apache.org/aooinframeetingreport

Git mirroring (including git mirroring to github) suffered some disruption
immediately following ApacheConEU. The 6+ year old machine that the 
service was running on was shared with 3 project zones, and as the number
of git mirrors has increased over time, service delays began increasing 
to the point that the service was non-functional. Initial attempts to 
restore service on machine were not successful over the long term and we 
ended up moving the service off of the affected host and into AWS. The
underlying machine that the service was running on has been deprecated. We
have sent the projects with zones there notice that we plan to shut down
the machine in the not too distant future. We have begun organizing 
replacement resources in lieu of the Solaris zones. 

The machine that ran the Foundation's SVN master suffered an outage caused
by a failure of the root filesystem array. The initial public reporting 
is at: 
https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/subversion_master_undergoing_emergency_maintenance
The post-mortem report from this event is at:
https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/svn_service_outage_postmortem
We were able to resurrect the service on new hardware with the 
configuration residing completely in configuration management. This should
minimize the time to recovery for future issues. 
The recovery took approximately 2 days to complete. 

We suffered a loss of all network connectivity to services in our colo facility
at Oregon State University Open Source Lab on 10 December. The outage lasted 
almost 2 hours. We are still working with OSUOSL, OSU, and NERO to figure out
what happened. A redundant (but disabled) network link was activated to 
bring us back online. 

While monitoring the newly provisioned webserver, we discovered that 
Cassandra is pointing users to a .deb package repository on the main 
webservers instead of utilizing the mirrors, as package repositories 
won't function with our current mirror offering. After some analysis
we found that this package repository was the source of 15% of all
traffic hitting our webservers.  Our initial thought was to block 
that traffic. Doing so would have had a large impact on folks. We
are currently researching options to provide package repositories 
so as to remove that load from our main webservers. 

Uptime Statistics:
==================
Unfortunately, uptime for critical services this month saw a sharp decline due
to the subversion outage. Also affecting uptime was the brief network outage on
December 10/11, as well as the migration of the git mirrors to a new location.
Overall, due to all other services behaving exemplary, we did experience a
slight increase in overall uptime by 0.03% compared to previous months. Thus,
the total recorded uptime for 2014 (weeks 27 through 50) is as follows:

Type:                   Target:   Reality:   Target Met:
---------------------------------------------------------
Critical services:      99.50%    99.84%        Yes
Core services:          99.00%    99.77%        Yes
Standard services:      95.00%    98.38%        Yes
---------------------------------------------------------
Overall:                98.00%    99.39%        Yes
---------------------------------------------------------

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

The Apache Travel Assistance Committee assisted 12 people in attending
ApacheCon Europe 2014 in Budapest. These were drawn from 9 different
countries, predominantly Europe, but with a few coming in from further
afield where their project(s) are strongly Europe focused and there was lots
for their project at the conference.

Questionnaires have been sent out to all attendees, and responses have now
been received from all. General feedback was positive, and Jan has kindly
agreed to sumarise them, hopefully for next month's report. We'll also try
to pull out some quotes for Sally. Feedback on the process is being fed into
the Austin planning.

We're still awaiting Virtual sending out the remaining wires for Budapest
costs. Once those have gone, we can finalise the Budapest costs in USD
(remaining costs are fixed in other currencies), and report. It's expected
to be slightly higher than originally planned, in large part because we
planned with hotel costs we thought was VAT inclusive but which turned out
to be ex-VAT. Still in budget though! We've learnt lessons on this for
Austin.

Applications for Austin have opened, and we've worked with Sally and PMCs to
get the word out. We have plans for additional publicity during the
applications period. Following some progress improvements agreed after
Budapest, we've been able to shorten the normal time period to fit with the
later-than-normal CPF close. We have enough committee members signed up to
cover all roles for Austin, with a little slack.

One person resigned from the committee after Budapest. We're very glad for
all Tony's hard work for TAC!

Apache Allura is an open source implementation of a software forge, a web site
that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, wiki pages,
blogs, and more for any number of individual projects.

Project Status
--------------

No issues needing board attention.  We would like to attract more
contributors, and we're working on getting into a more frequent release cycle
which may help.

Community
---------

* Latest committer & PMC member added in Oct 2014
* Ongoing tickets & commits from the active developers.
* A few email discussions with Allura users / deployers.

Community Objectives
--------------------

We completed the move of tickets from SourceForge to the Allura self-hosted
site.

We would like to find and encourage new contributors to Allura.  We also want
to explore if other Apache projects would be interested in using Allura.


Releases
--------

Last release was Feb 2014.  We are working on one blocker and then will
proceed with a new release.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command line
tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web
documents.

Project Releases

The last release of Any23 (1.1) was on 16-Oct-2014.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Project activity has been reasonably slow however this is nothing new 
for Any23 generally.
Work is nearly complete on the Any23 plugin for Apache Nutch trunk codebase
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-1129
Additionally Any23 has featured in a number of recent presentations at 
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory where the software is being evaluated 
for use within the Systems Engineering domain.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Since the Any23 1.0 release the release management process has included
emailing the announcement to a number of very active W3C lists. The 
intention here is to interest other developers and build the Any23 community
further. This strategy is gathering traction, usually with activity immediately
after the last two Any23 releases.
http://any23.apache.org/release-howto.html#Announce_the_Release
Any23 received contributions in the form of the donation of both
any23.org and any23.com domain names. We thank Richard Cyganiak for the
contributions and also Infra for accepting them. 

Changes to PMC & Committers

Stephane Corlosquet (scor) was added to the Any23 PMC on Tue, 19 Aug 2014 04:28:51 GMT.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache APR Project  [Jeff Trawick]

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
since 2007.

Releases

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Archiva Project  [Olivier Lamy]

Apache Archiva is an extensible repository management software that helps
taking care of your own personal or enterprise-wide build artifact
repository. It is the perfect companion for build tools such as Maven,
Continuum, and ANT.

Releases
--------

None since last report

Community
---------

We added a new committer: Sascha Voigt (17 July 2014)
We added a new PMC member: Jean-Baptiste Onofre (28 July 2014)

The new 2.x series releases tends to generate a bit more traffic mailing lists.

Development
-----------

On-going development is now geared towards the release of 2.2.x with
particular enhancements to LDAP support and fixing issues.

Issues
------

As some projects at Apache, Archiva was dependant on rsync services from people.a.o
to synchronize their Maven artifacts to Maven Central after a vote period based
on artifacts deployed to the Apache Archiva instance.
It looks to be now mandatory to use an external product call Nexus whereas Sonatype
still support this rsync synchronization.
Obviously the Archiva team will be happy to continue using his own dog food.
The issue has been reported here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-8762

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================
Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.

Issues
======
It is worth the board noting that there have been concerns raised about
the rate of development and the inability to create a release. While
there has since been a release, this is discussed below.

Releases
========
There has been one release over the last three months. The last releases
were:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.6 (16th July 2013)
 * apache-bloodhound-0.7 (23rd August 2013)
 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

Community & Development
=======================
No new committee members have been added this quarter. The last new
committee members to be added joined in January 2014. The last new
committers were added in May 2014 for the GSoC scheme.

Concerns have been raised on the private list about the rate of
development to the extent of a suggestion of moving the project to the
attic. This has not resulted in any great response but the reasons for
this are not clear. However, one outcome from this suggestion was that
a release was finally created and the vote passed smoothly.

It was also good to see demonstrations of continued interest from some
of the GSoC students.

It is clear that the rate of development has to increase again. Given
the recent progress, the situation will hopefully become clearer over
the next three to six months.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Ivan Kelly]

Bookkeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance
logging service. The project also includes Hedwig which is
a highly scalable Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper
and Bookkeeper with strong durability guarantees.

= Project Status =
Since becoming TLP (2014-11-19), focus has been on getting our
new infrastructure set up. There were some delays in getting the
mailing list up and running, but it's all resolved now. Subsequently,
everything that depended on the mailing lists was delayed. We are
current voting on a set of bylaws.

Development work has been low over the last month, but a lot of work
has been done to improve the documentation and accessibility of the
project (new website, new client tutorial, etc).

= Releases =
Our last release was 4.3.0, released on 2014-10-14. We are
currently in the process of voting for a release plan for 4.3.1 and
4.2.4.

= Community Status =
There have been no committers added since we became TLP (2014-11-19).
The last committer added, when we were a subproject, was Rakesh
Radhakrishnan on 24th July 2014.

50 subscribers in dev@bookkeeper.apache.org

Attachment K: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matt Benson]

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases. Last release was v0.5 in September 2012.

### Activity ###
The Commons Weaver quasi-dependency bottleneck has as long last been resolved
and BVal development has resumed. We continue to work with the Apache TomEE PMC,
who bundle our project and thereby provide a clear barometer for ease of
integration. I note the question on the agenda of whether we have enough
committers to make releases... I assume this refers to BVal, though it could
have referred to Commons as we did spend an unfortunate amount of time blocked
there. While the developer energy of most of the PMC is being expended
elsewhere, I believe we have strong enough representation amongst the wider
"ApachEE" (i.e. JEE at Apache) community to be handily able to garner the votes
for a release once we are satisfied with the state of the codebase.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.
Last PMC member added Q4 2013
Last committer added Q3 2013

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Cayenne Project  [Andrus Adamchik]

Apache Cayenne is a Java persistence framework. It takes a distinct approach to 
object persistence and provides an ORM runtime, remote persistence services, and 
a GUI mapping/modeling tool.

Project Status

* Cayenne 3.1 Final was released on September 29.
* Active 3.2 release branch was renamed to 4.0 to reflect a significant scope
  of changes.
* 4.0 development has been very active. We added a new fluent query APIs, and
  a new automated way to synchronize the ORM model with DB-schema and Java
  classes, made significant CayenneModeler UI improvements. More new features
  are likely to happen in the coming months.
* We are in preparations to release 4.0.M2.

Community

* dev@ list activity is higher than before, due to the active discussions of 
  the new 4.0 features.
* There seems to be a trend of declining activity on the user@ list though. 
  Not specifically in this quarter, more like a long-term trend, partially
  explained by good support provided on stackoverflow, partially perhaps by
  the project maturity.
* We receive steady contributions from two new developers.
* The last PMC member was added in December 2012.
* The last committer was added in May 2012.

DESCRIPTION
Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage 
large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.

ISSUES

CVE-2014-7807: Apache CloudStack unauthenticated LDAP binds, Dec 8 2014

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* The community is working on the next major release (4.5.0) of Apache CloudStack.
The first release candidate is available already.
* Ongoing efforts in fixing bugs and findings from static code analysis 
resulted in a number of bug fixes to existing branches. 
* Apache CloudStack CloudMonkey 5.3.0 was released on Nov 11 2014. Apache
CloudStack CloudMonkey is a CLI tool for interacting with Apache
CloudStack and is distributed separate from Apache CloudStack  
* Apache CloudStack 4.4.1 was released Oct 23 2014. This maintenance release
is followed by a second maintenance release numbered 4.4.2 at Dec 10 2014. Release
4.4.2 fixes the vulnerability reported in CVE-2014-7807
* The community enjoyed a very successful European CloudStack 
Collaboration Conference (CCCEU). CCCEU in Budapest. The new format including
a full day single room track and poster sessions seemed to work out well.
* The community is still struggling with way to improve quality and prevent master
from breaking. Multiple efforts including improved automated testing and work flow 
enhancements are being executed and/or proposed. There is no clear consensus other
than the generic agreement that the current situation leaves ample room for 
improvement.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications using 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Status

Current releases have been voted on according to the Apache vote policy. 

We have released Cordova CLI 4.0 which is the beginning of the independence
of platform versions from the cli version. For example, with the Cordova CLI
4.0 release, it includes the pinned platform versions at version 3.6.4
(except for cordova-browser, at 3.6.0). Each new platform release will
correspond with a tools release to update the pinned versions.

Since the last board report, Apache Cordova has had:

- over 2100 commits in its 52 Git repositories
- over 2800 emails in its dev mailing list
- over 4500 issues/comments on issues in JIRA
- 8 new contributors filed iCLAs specifically for contributing to Apache Cordova
- over 436,000 downloads of cordova from https://www.npmjs.org/package/cordova

Since the last board report, Apache Cordova has had 60 different releases. We
also released a new platform, cordova-browser.

releases, contributions to the Installer, Tour De Flex, the
Squiggly Spell Checking library, Text Layout Framework, Android
and IOS skins, and more.

In the past three months we've continued to see:
- Continued JIRA activity (more bugs raised than resolved however)
- New committers and potential committers.

Code Donation Update
- Swiz donation is still pending.  The donor has not filed the
  paperwork.
- Mahmoud Ali and Bruno Pacola donated the FlatSpark theme.

COMMUNITY
- Mahmoud Ali, Bruno Pacola, Curtis Aube, Neil Madsen and Jorge
  Yabra were added as committers.
- Tom Chiverton, Piotr Zarzycki, Chris Martin and Mihai Chira were
  promoted from committer to PMC member.
- Latest analytics include around 2000 hits per day on the website
  during the work week (less on weekends).  That’s about the same
  as previous report.
- There were more than 10,000 installs of 4.13.0 since its release.
- More than 20,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.
  Tour De Flex is a set of examples folks use to learn how to
  develop Flex applications.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

During this quarter we've added two new PMC members.

Gump seems to create useful results for the few projects that use it.
The FOP community has decided they no longer need the service provided
by Gump.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The Gump builds have been updated to run on Java8 which causes a few
builds to break (like the one of Google Guava) and forced us to
replace dependencies with pre-packaged binaries in two cases.


== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

Konstantin Kolinko and Mark Thomas joined the Gump PMC.

  3. More diversity of the committers/PPMC (currently biased towards
     employees of a single organization)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our community continues to grow slowly but surely, and has received
  interest and contributions from new community members.

  We had the opportunity to talk about our project at ApacheCon Europe
  last week, which has introduced Brooklyn to a wider audience within
  Apache.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code continues to be proposed and merged at a high rate. We are
  satisfied with our technical velocity.

  We are currently in the process of making our first release. As is
  common with incubating project's first releases, this involves several
  iterations and ongoing discussions with mentors and IPMC.

Date of last release:

  No release yet, but we have begun the process for our first release
  and aim to release as soon as we possibly can.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No change since 2014-07-02.

--------------------
NiFi

NiFi is a dataflow system based on the concepts of flow-based programming.

NiFi has been incubating since 2014-11-24.

Ripple

Ripple is a browser based mobile phone emulator designed to aid in the 
development of HTML5 based mobile applications. Ripple is a cross 
platform and cross runtime testing/debugging tool. It currently 
supports such runtimes as Cordova, WebWorks and the Mobile Web.

Ripple has been incubating since 2012-10-16.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

The community recently discussed the lack of growth in the project. 
Some members felt that retirement of the podling was appropriate. 
Others have stepped up to take over essential tasks and attempt to 
build a community. We have agreed with mentors to review this situation
in 6 months. It is possible that Ripple is no longer important as its 
functionality is potential being replaced by Cordova-browser.  Our 
original champion, Ross Gardler has also up to help evaluate the 
situation.  For Cordova-browser idea, there was also a discussion on 
the mailing list.  

How has the community developed since the last report?
No new committers since last June 2014. 

How has the project developed since the last report?

Sentry is a highly modular system for providing fine grained role
based authorization to both data and metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop
cluster.

Sentry has been incubating since 2013-08-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. Continue to grow the Sentry community
  2. Initiate graduation discussion with community and address any
     potential concerns raised
  3. Update project status page, website etc

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?
  None

How has the community developed since the last report?
  The community is growing. Several new members have started actively
  contributing to the project. New contributors made a significant
  contribution in patches as well as release activity. The user group
  meetup at NYC was well attended. Community members presented Apache
  Sentry at various community meetups around the world, include Hadoop
  group meetup in Hydrabad, India and ApacheCon Europe in Budapest, Hungary

How has the project developed since the last report?
  A number of new features implemented in the master codeline. The sentry
  community is working towards removing some of the non Apache dependencies
  in order to avoid any potential concerns for the graduation processes.

--------------------
Streams

Apache Streams (incubating) is a lightweight (yet scalable) framework for
ActivityStreams.

Streams has been incubating since 2012-11-20.

  The project provides a framework for abstracting away individual data
  schemas and API protocols from solutions built to collect, publish,
  process, and analyze digital activity data, as well as a community-
  driven process for determining best practice usage of the ActivityStreams
  specification with real-world datasets - valuing working, tested,
  adaptable, useful code over strict adherence to existing specs.
  Importantly, the project does not impose one execution framework -
  modules built to Apache Streams interfaces and coding standards may
  be instantiated within multiple JVM-based runtime containers, including
  popular ‘big-data' frameworks.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.  Establish and maintain a consistent release process.
  2.  Improve quality of code, tests, documentation, and examples.
  3.  PPMC must relieve project mentors of all responsibility for the
      project's adherence to the Apache Way and long-term viability.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

Tamaya

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and
EE environments.
Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. Project web site must be setup (ongoing).
  2. Establish a collaboration model within the community and ensure a
     common view on the main focus points.
  3. Improve code base for being ready for a first release around Q1 2015.

  Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?
  No.

  How has the community developed since the last report?
  Many of the committers have successfully filed the ICLA and also started
  to contribute, some of them already by doing first patches. Feedback in
  the community was overwhelming. We could also successfully place the
  topic at conferences as well as in the German Java Magazin and other
  events. Also interest of people during the Zurich Hackergarten in
  November was great and will definitely lead to additional committers
  early 2015.

  How has the project developed since the last report?
  The project setup is going quite well. Initial committers are onboarding,
  the initial code donation was successfully moved and other preconditions
  like the project name, IP clearance, Jenkins etc. were successfully done.
  Thanks to INFRA for their incredible support!

  Date of last release: Still getting started.

  When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Taverna

Taverna is a domain-independent suite of tools used to design and execute
data-driven workflows.

Taverna has been incubating since 2014-10-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. IP clearance to be signed by Univ of Manchester
  2. Move source code, wiki, issues to apache.org. Restructure git repos.
  3. Invite contributors who volunteered at October workshop

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Infrastructure bootstrapping takes a long time and requires a series of
  requests. E.g. Taverna incubator has been approved, but does not get a
  web-site without explicitly asking for it. Documentation for apache.org
  infrastructure assumes you are already a long-term committer.


How has the community developed since the last report?

  Transition of mailing list successful (? - can we get some numbers?).

  Most of the proposed initial committers have sorted CLAs
  https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/TavernaProposal#Initial_Committers
  and received apache.org account - see
  https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#taverna

  Many of the remaining initial committers have not been active in the
  recent years. We're following up these (and others) through private
  conversations. There's been some confusion with regards to the term
  "committer" - some were scared and thought it meant they had to make
  a commitment to work on the source code!

  Not much further development - worried that dev@taverna are scared away
  by the long-dragged bootstrapping which dominates the list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Source code is being restructured at https://github.com/taverna-incubator
  before being staged to import into git.apache.org

  Normal development continues at https://github.com/taverna/ - due to
  prepare the final 2.5.1 non-Apache release.

  Stian Soiland-Reyes was at ApacheCon in Budapest, fruitful discussions
  with mentor Andy Seaborne and Gavin McDonald from INFRA with regards to
  the transitioning of Taverna's existing source code repository, wiki and
  issue tracker (luckily git->git, confluence->confluence and jira->jira).

Date of last release:

  No release since incubation.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No new committers or PMC members elected since incubation.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  As noted the email list just been migrated and code repo setup, but
  already show good signs of activity on the email list.  Code
  activity seems good so far although it's still on it's own github repo.


--------------------
Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication. It
can be used like email, chat, or a document.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Making release.
  2. Growing community.
  3. Source fixes/improvements.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
  No


How has the community developed since the last report?
  After some spike in activity we had a slowdown.


How has the project developed since the last report?
  Some improvements were committed like full text search with Solr and some
  more need to be reviewed/merged. We are working on making an updated RC
  and plan to hold review/voting soon.


Date of last release:

  not yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Mark Miller]

The Apache Lucene project develops open-source search software.


TLP
---

We added one new committer in the last quarter: Gregory Chanan


Lucene Core and Solr
--------------------

Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit.

Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core.

In the last quarter we made two releases of both Lucene Core and Solr:

 - 4.10.1 on 29 Sept 2014
 - 4.10.2 on 31 Oct 2014
 
We have also started the process for a 4.10.3 release.

The community is very active.

Security: There was one security issue reported:

 - An XXS vulnerability was reported against Apache Solr
   (CVE-2014-3628). An attacker could inject javascript that is 
   executed via the admin ui because stored queries are not 
   escaped / sanitized. This will be addressed in the upcoming
   4.10.3 release that is currently being voted on.


PyLucene
--------

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is almost
entirely an automated port, so this project will never require a lot of
developers.  The user community is active.

In the last quarter we made one release of PyLucene:

 - 4.10.1-1 on 6 Oct 2014


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# 
and targeted at .NET runtime users.
 
== Summary ==
 
The PMC has recognized we have become stagnant and have not had a release in 
two years. We are actively working towards rebuilding and re-invigorating the 
community.
Cleaning up our PMC processes:
 - We realized several PMC members were not on the private mailing list
 - There was a typo in the moderation account for the mailing list 
   that wasn't realized
 - We had a roll call and all PMC members are now present and accounted for
 - Last PMC Member Added, Paul Irwin, October 2013
 
Working on our community / tooling:
 - We're actively brainstorming how to create better documentation around
   getting started with Lucene.Net as a developer, and getting invovled
   as a committer
 - With the help of our community members and some free licensing, we are 
   in the process of setting up a CI system for our tests
 - We're looking at possibly pulling in questions from stackoverflow to the 
   mailing list to expand visibility of those questions to the mailing list
   and hopefully spur conversation (SO questions look like 1 per 1-2 days
   or so at most)
 - Looking at a website refresh to go along with the documentation
Pushing hard on 4.8.0.
 - We were provided a contribution from MSFT over the summer of a significant 
   code port of the 4.8.0 Java code. We have been working to clean that up.
   Currently we have 300 failing tests to fix, as well as some additional 
   libraries that help users make the most of Lucene.Net (encoding codecs and
   contrib extensions)
   
We could use any advice or assistance on the above to help us build / rebuild our
community.
 
== Releases ==
Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012
Working toward 4.8.0

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Pinaki Poddar]

== Summary ==
   Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for relational and
   non-relational databases. For relational database, OpenJPA provides
   persistence for Plain Old Java Object (POJO).  OpenJPA is compliant to
   industry-standard Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0 version
   and runs in stand-alone JSE as well as JEE containers and many other
   lightweight frameworks, such as Tomcat, TomEE, Spring or OSGi.
   

 == Community ==
   OpenJPA developers had, over past several years, not only developed a
   general-purpose, stable software for complex Object-Relational Mapping but
   also ensured its stability across many released versions. OpenJPA has a
   solid user base and many have migrated their persistence provider to
   OpenJPA from more well-known provider in the past.  Current OpenJPA
   developer/committers actively maintain the code base as well as support
   via the mailing list users and the code service streams. 
   
   However, developer resource is shrinking as many senior committers are not
   active and new volunteers are hard to come by as new development
   opportunities are rare and hard to incorporate. Also lack of strong
   corporate interest/sponsorship is affecting future growth/expansion of the
   community.
   
   PMC members are exploring how to invigorate the project.
   
   We hope that the Board members may be able to share their experience on
   how to re-energize a matured project in its maintenance phase of life. 
      
      
   == Recent Work ==
   OpenJPA development team member Jody Grassel has upgraded Serp bytecode
   library to version 1.15 for Java 8 language features (e.g. lambda
   expression) and integrated OpenJPA with the upgrade. 
   As OpenJPA natively uses bytecode enhancement, supporting Java 8 has more
   than usual impact on OpenJPA.       

   Many requests have been received for upgrade to JPA 2.1 compliance.
   Prototype work for supporting JPA 2.1 features such as Store Procedure
   support has started.
   
   == Issues ==
   
   One of the nightly builds (2.3.1) artifact is missing [1] in the
   repository. 
   
   The issue is likely to be an infrastructure issue and is being tracked
   by [2]

and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform" specification which is
defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0).
OpenWebBeans 1.5.x also implements the CDI-1.1 and CDI-1.2 (MR)
specifications(JSR-346)
We will later also also implement CDI-2.0 (JSR-365) as OpenWebBeans-2.0.x.
 
Board Issues
There are no issues requiring board attention this time.

Development
Development continues in trunk to implement CDI 1.2 as OpenWebBeans-1.5.x.
We are finished with the SE parts and fully pass this TCK. We continue working
with the Apache TomEE team to also pass the EE part of the CDI-1.2 TCK.
Members of the community also actively contribute to the CDI-2.0 JavaEE
specification (ALv2 licensed) which has been filed as JSR-365.

New Releases

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe M. Chiasson]

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since 2014-07

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

The work to support the 2.4 branch has finally been fully merged back on
trunk, with the remaining few little issues mostly ironed out.

2 PMC members have already volunteered to be release managers for the
next release. With the holiday period coming fast, I expect to see the first
RCs coming out in early January.

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

No new Apache-Test releases since 2014-07.

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Apache-SizeLimit 0.97 was released on Apr 02, 2012

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since 2014-07.


--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Apache-Bootstrap 0.07 was released on Jul 13, 2009

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since 2014-07.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Apache-Reload 0.12 was released on March 31st, 2012

No new Apache-Reload releases since 2014-07.


-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

Apache-DBI 1.12 was released on June 12th, 2013

No new Apache-DBI releases since 2014-07.

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

Work on the httpd-2.4 branch has come to a standstill, as all work on that
branch completed and was merged into the trunk.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, except for the occasional
obscure bug report, or general user questions.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened since the last report.

February 2014.  A 1.3 release may be possible as an interim before
2.0, but development work last quarter has targeted the 2.0 branch.

Community & Project:

- Mailing list traffic remains steady compared to last quarter.

- Efforts towards a 2.0 distribution remain active on a separate dev
branch. Changes are ongoing, and we hope to make a 2.0 release Q1
2015.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Description
-----------
SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent
email filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited
bulk email, more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to
email headers and content to classify email using advanced statistical
methods. In addition, SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that
allows other technologies to be quickly wielded against spam and is
designed for easy integration into virtually any email system.

Releases
--------
3.4.0 was released on 2014-02-11.

Our rules releases have continued and with 73 rule sets published since the
last quarterly report.

The first release candidate for 3.4.1 was created today on Dec 16th.


Community & Development
-----------------------
The most recent addition to our PMC is Adam Katz added on 2013-01-30.

The most recent addition to the committers is Joe Quinn added on
2014-02-27.

The community has started the process to revive the SOUGHT rules project

However, we do not have any new people moving moving towards committer 
but do have commits and rules being discussed and passed through to
current committers to vet and apply showing good community development
health.

Our RuleQA dev list has been active and community support is good.

The project users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

The project dev list has been active with both committers and community
members contributing.

We still need to get our Jenkins build slave working under FreeBSD
instead of Solaris1 (Bug 6887).

https://builds.apache.org/job/SpamAssassin-trunk/ is offline and not working.

We are preparing to deprecate the zones2 server.

Thanks to Infra for the work on the SVN recovery!


Project Branding Requirements
-----------------------------
   IN PROCESS - Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent
product logo on your site

NOTE: Will announce the new logo along with the powered by logo.  Planned with
3.4.1 release.

Committee Record Review
-----------------------
We compared http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/spamassassin/trunk/CREDITS to
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt
and no discrepancies were found.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment.

The project is performing well and the development is going towards version
1.0. Some minor tasks are still to do. In the meantime the project is
preparing a 0.12.1 maintenance release.

The Stanbol project has participated at the ApacheCon EU with a talk by
Rupert Westenthaler about a possible new annotation model for Apache
Stanbol [1, 2 (slides)]. In this context Stanbol was offered the
possibility to send a member to the W3C group working on Open Annotation.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

DESCRIPTION

APACHE Storm is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-performance realtime
computation system that provides strong guarantees on the processing of
data.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* Version 0.9.3 has been released. This was the first release as a top-level
  project. The Storm incubator distribution area has been cleaned up as
  required.
* The developer and user lists continue to be active, and JIRAs are being
  created and addressed.
* Development activity continues on version 0.10 which will be the next
  major release (AKA the “security” release).


RELEASES

* The last release of Apache Storm was version 0.9.3, released
  on November 25, 2014. This was the first release as a TLP.


COMMUNITY

* Storm added 4 PMC/Committer members on September 27, 2014 (Note: These
  members were voted in during incubation, and added as PMC members post-
  graduation via board NOTICE).
* There were no new additions to the PMC since the last report.


ISSUES

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Hiranya Jayathilaka]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

No new committers or PMC members were nominated this quarter. Latest
Synapse committer was elected on December, 2013. Latest Synapse PMC
member was elected on December, 2013. 

Releases
========

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on 
January, 2012.

Our release process is still blocked by the absence of a compatible 
Apache Axis2 release. After our last board report, it was suggested that 
we consider the option of contributing our time and effort into Axis2, 
so we can get it released. This proposal was sent to our mailing 
list for discussion but it hasn't garnered a positive response from 
the Synapse community. I believe that the above proposal is based on 
the premise that at some point in the past, both Axis2 and Synapse projects 
were maintained by more or less the same people. But to my understanding
these committers are no longer active in either project. Currently 
active Synapse committers were all voted in within the last three years, 
and they are not Axis2 experts. And so far they haven't shown any 
interest in actively working on the Axis2 project. As it stands now,
we prefer to treat Axis2 as yet another external dependency on which
we can develop Synapse code.

To get around this hurdle, we have been looking into the possibility
of branching the current Axis2 trunk and doing a Synapse-specific 
release (current Axis2 trunk is stable enough for our purposes). But
this option also poses some challenges due to the long dependency
chain of Synapse and Axis2. As it turns out we also need releases
from several other projects such as Axiom, WSS4J and XmlSchema.
However, so far this is the only option that has succeeded in 
gathering any kind of momentum in the Synapse dev community.
Therefore, we will continue to explore this idea.

Board issues
============

None identified, although any feedback on how to handle the above
mentioned release problem will be much appreciated.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Tajo Project  [Hyunsik Choi]

Apache Tajo is a robust big data relational and distributed data warehouse
system for Apache Hadoop. Tajo is designed for low-latency and scalable ad-hoc
queries, online aggregation, and ETL (extract-transform-load process) on
large-data sets stored on HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and other data
sources. By supporting SQL standards and leveraging advanced database
techniques, Tajo allows direct control of distributed execution and data
flow across a variety of query evaluation strategies and optimization
opportunities.


Board Issues
=============
There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.


Current Activity
================
Recently, we are discussing 0.9.1 release (incremental release), including 
bug fixes and new features, such as HBase storage support, recap of timezone, 
and Hadoop dependency removal from TajoClient. For 0.9.1 release, we have 
resolved about 80 issues since last release in Oct 2014.


Releases
===============
- Apache Tajo 0.9.0 (major release) (October 21, 2014)
- Apache Tajo 0.8.0 (major release) (May 1, 2014)

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

DESCRIPTION

VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* The next release of VCL was pushed back due to an underestimate of the
  amount of work remaining. We plan to create a release candidate next week.
* Almost all of the development work is complete. Work is wrapping up to
  add NAT support and a few minor improvements.
* After this release, we will work to improve how the project handles
  release planning and management. It has been a very long time since our
  last release (12/12). Some discussion has started in the thread referenced
  as [1].

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic,
component oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- 7.0.0-M4, 6.18.0
- Nutch Google Summer of Code delivered admin interface using Wicket
- ApacheCon EU 2014 had 2 Wicket presentations and 1 isis presentation
- Jesse Long was added as a committer and PMC member
- New site discussions

Date last committer/PMC member added: 28 September 2014

ApacheCon EU

Martijn Dashorst presented 2 sessions at ApacheCon EU in Budapest:

- Wicket and Java EE Sitting in a Tree
- Apache Wicket: 10 Years and Beyond

In the aftermath good discussions with committers of other projects
arose, including Deltaspike and Isis.

New website

In the quest for a more 2014+ design for our current aging web site a
lot of activity arose to craft a new site. The new site will be
compliant with the branding guidelines. A preview can be found at

    http://dashorst.github.io/wicket-site

One of the discussions focused on the addition of the "Fork me on
Github" banner in the top right corner of every page. Community members
want a prominent link to github because they claim it attracts
contributions and because the tooling available at github is more
aligned with current open source contributors.

As Chair I voiced my concerns about linking to a non-sponsor,
commercial entity in such a prominent place (even the foundation
doesn't have such prominence). I find it rather difficult to convince
my community members of why this is wrong. Somehow it does not compute
that "Fork me on Github" is not a good message to send out and is in
fact a big banner ad for github.

In a discussion on board@ it seemed that some folks share my concerns
whereas others rather give projects leeway in how they approach such
links. The fact that both Project Thanks Pages and Product Support
Pages specifically mention that such links should not (including added
emphasis on the not) be (prominent) on the homepage, doesn't seem to
hold much if any weight.

Ultimately I removed the banner from the site. Having such a link on
every page is (according to me) against ASF policy if not in writing at
least in spirit (i.e. mark/linking policies).
