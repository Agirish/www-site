 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Nothing additional to report this month.

    B. President [Ross]

       Happy new year to all.

       It's been a predictably quiet month with the holidays. At least until
       early January.

       A recent situation with respect to how documents sent to CSC are
       are passed on to us. In short it appears there is only a single
       contact point for us. Worse, this is an individuals email address.
       This does not scale. In the light of a recent missed communication
       the contact address has been updated to my own @apache.org address.
       This can only be a temporary measure. I welcome input from the
       board on which address to use, perhaps board-private?

       EVP signed the contract for ApacheCon and planning is underway. Rich
       will provide an update. The Event in a Box has been costed. Originally
       I had planned to ask ComDev to own this and submit a budget request
       this month. However, given the need for two budget updates already this
       month I have chosen to delay this while we evaluate our current budget
       status.

       At the time of writing no fundraising report has been submitted. Our EA
       informs me that that there are no significant issues.

       At the time of writing no Brand Management report has been submitted. As
       per discussion on the board@ mailing list I submit a budget request from
       VP Brand Management as Special Order A.

       Infrastructure and Marketing are both progressing as usual. It is worth
       noting a significant number of hardware and software upgrades during the
       last month. As far as I am aware these upgrades were mostly uneventful
       from the perspective of our committers. My thanks go to the
       infrastructure team.

       At the time of writing no report has been submitted by the Travel
       Assistance Committee. As previously reported the committee is concerned
       that there is minimal time for coordinating TAC support for ApacheCon.
       I have asked our EA to provide whatever support she can.

       As previously discussed on board-private and in the last board meeting I
       submit a request for an increased Executive Assistant budget as Special
       Order B.

       It is worth noting that the two increased budget requests will take our
       FY13 budget over the expected sponsorship income for this year. We have
       plenty of cash available to absorb this deficit. However, as the
       foundation continues to grow so do our expenses. I have asked the
       treasurer if he can provide a quarterly report of budget vs. actuals. I
       will use these reports to inform the board of our status.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


       The board requested that the CSC contact should be
       operations@.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       Chris met with the Virtual, Inc. team as introduced by Jim and discussed
       what Virtual can provide to the ASF in terms of Treasurer services.
       Andy Freed, Virtual President, Terry Lowney, Virtual's COO and Greg
       Kohn, Vice President Client Services were in attendance. Virtual
       provides services including helping to prepare financials including
       board reports on a monthly basis for 40+ clients. The company has
       been around for 15+ years (staff of 40 people, based out of Boston
       with people all over the country) and has worked with small projects
       ($100K org) to bigger orgs ($10s of M every year). According to the
       team, they can scale their services in a way that makes sense for
       a particular organization (e.g., taylor their services). In terms
       of the types of contracts Virtual supports, they can do a Master
       Services Agreement that covers a full range of what they do (allows
       scaling services up or down), and Evergreen agreements with a 90
       day termination clause at any time (simple management agreement).

       In terms of costing, Virtual stated that they can do per service
       billing, e.g., at the core, they would look at the volume of
       transactions, and scope of work to be done (core service). They
       would also provide costed options to take on all accounts receivable
       and accounts payable; invoices and following up on sponsors, managing
       the bank accounts. Virtual stated that they could help evaluate
       what banking institutions make most sense for the organization and
       looking at value added services for finding the right bank and
       processes.  In terms of taxes, Virtual does not directly file 990N
       or prepare it, but they use a CPA firm to do so and to facilitate
       financial statement audits for many of their clients. The Treasurer's
       Office will follow up once specific costing for services can be
       quoted and is happy for feedback from the Board.

       PayPal monies continue to stream in. An initial $50,000 transfer was
       completed, and another transfer of the same amount has been initiated
       in a process to incrementally move money out PayPal and into our WFS
       accounts.

       The Treasurer's Office reached out to Phil Steitz to figure out how to
       check the Amazon Payments donations and include it in the financial
       report.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       December was a relatively light month for secretary, with 46 iclas,
       six cclas, and two grants received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       ApacheCon has been announced and the CFP is open. The event will
       be April 7-9 in Denver, with tutorials following April 10-11.
       Hackathon and BarCamp will happen as usual. Sally is helping me
       field questions regarding sponsorship and marketing, but LF is
       handling these things. Melissa has been very helpful in all of
       this, and she is getting the ball rolling for TAC for the event.

       The CFP closes February 1, and numerous people have stepped up to
       help review the proposed talks to help select the schedule.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       Nothing to report for January.

 7. Special Orders

    A. Increase Brand Management Budget

       The proposed budget change discussed here is recorded in
       Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

       Discussion:

       Greg: There are very few problems with open source marks.
       Shane: There is a very low cost for registering. It's money well spent.
       Greg: What's the cost/benefit?
       Shane: If/when a project runs into trademark issues, costs are hundreds
         of times more.
       Greg: No issue registering our major brands, but not smaller projects.
       Shane: We will not be able to register our marks if a company registers
         a possibly conflicting name.
       Doug: Seems like a relatively small amount of money to spend to get
         ahead of potential problems.
       Roy: If we do register, we have a fiduciary responsibility to actively
         (including legal process) defend them.
       Shane: Not necessarily.
       Roy: Agree with registering important marks, but not wholesale.
       Shane: Once we register, companies are less likely to infringe or
         challenge the brands. Registration makes it much easier to deal with
         companies.
       Jim: It's not a guarantee; we might still have to go to court to defend
         our marks.
       Shane: It makes it less likely that companies will challenge us.
       Jim: Registering actually ramps up our duties to police our marks.
       Doug: Registering our minor marks seems to be a good idea to reduce
         risk and effort to defend our marks.
       Brett: We appear to have consensus on registering our major marks.
       Shane: There are several proposals that could be implemented, grouped
         into seven items as above. We should start by approving the budget
         and work through details on the trademarks@ list.
       Brett: The fiscal year ends in April. Should these figures be pro-rated?
       Shane: Some expenses will be lower but some would be incurred
         immediately. I would like to approve a change for half of the
         proposed increase.

       VP Brand Management requests that the board approve an increase in the
       Brand Management budget of $32,000. This brings the total budget
       request for FY13 to $45,400.00.

       Special order 7A was approved by unanimous vote of the directors present.

    B. Increase Executive Assistant Budget

       President requests that the board approve an increase in the Executive
       Assistant budget of $15,500. This brings the total budget request for
       FY13 to $55,500.

       Special Order 7B, Increase Executive Assistant Budget, was
       approved by unanimous vote of the directors present.


 8. Discussion Items

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Greg: email to multiple PMCs to ask for dates on releases.
          Status:

    * Roy: Update the guidance for releases and communicate to all
           committers.
          Status: not done yet

    * Greg: discuss "extras" issue with OpenOffice PMC and see if there is
            anything to be done at the "ASF level"
          Status:

    * Brett: ask for community health information from Aries in next report
          Status: current report includes it

    * Chris: follow up on bringing on new committers and PMC members to DB
          Status: Not Started.

    * Brett: follow up with Click regarding the Attic or rebooting
          Status: not done

    * Jim: Ask Any23 PMC if they are ready to switch chairs
          Status: Will re-ping

    * Chris: Join camel-dev list to discuss console branding
          Status: done
          I joined the Camel list and got a DISCUSS thread going there which
          is converging on a suitable resolution led by PMC and community
          members in ActiveMQ regarding hawt.io and the console that was
          included. Relatively low stress and seems like the resolution will
          respect Apache branding and the community is leading the action
          taking so I'll watch and see it through.

    * Brett: Pursue a report for Stanbol
          Status: done

    * Brett: Pursue a report for Subversion
          Status: done

    * Brett: Remind PMCs to check their committee records
          Status: not done

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

I've been told that the Board would like a % breakdown of where I spend my
time.  This is tricky because every day and every month is different!! For
December, I'd say I spent about 50% Fundraising, 20% ApacheCon, 10%
Event-in-a-Box, 15% on emails, and 5% on Trademarks.  I'm sure these figures
are not totally accurate, but they are my best "guesstimate", and they will
vary every month.

    * Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@,
      trademarks@, treasurer@, comdev@, and board@) and following-up with
      appropriate personnel

    * Fundraising:
        * Fundraising still progressing very well.  I'm actively following up
          on the gold, silver, and bronze renewals that have been sent out; as
          well as sending out new renewals.

    * Sent Upayavira and Sally (per Upayavira's request) an email wrt the
      Platinum sponsorship renewal status.

    * ApacheCon:
        * Progressing well - Rich will provide more information
        * Weekly status calls with Ross and Rich
        * Event-in-a-Box:
        * Provided all the cost estimates to Ross and Rich; Ross has indicated
          that this is now in his hands
        * Contract renewal  - June's contract was never renewed due to Ross's
          busy schedule; we're in negotiations for the Dec renewal.
          December's contract has still not been renewed.

    * Trademarks:
        * Nothing new added to the manual this month
        * A lot of emails have come through to trademarks@, and Shane has been
          handling them immediately

    * Audit:
        * Stalled, no progress.  Jim can provide more details

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

UPDATE: requested addenda with details of budget request at bottom.

Board Issue: see President's report and Special Order A for a
request for additional budgeted funding.  See also the attached
memorandum in board@ email from DLAPiper counsel Mark Radcliffe
supporting this request.

Along with the usual branding questions we've been having many more
detailed questions about how Apache branding should (or should not) be
applied in much more esoteric cases.  A key question this month is
what Maven artifact group IDs should be used when third party vendors
provide patched versions of Apache software in various Maven repos.

Reviewed and approved new ApacheCon contract and sponsor prospectus
re: branding requirements.

Held a videoconference hosted by counsel at DLAPiper with several vendors
providing Hadoop-related products and services to get feedback on the
best ways to roll out new Hadoop and related product branding requirements
for third parties.  Feedback from the meeting and from DLAPiper counsel
show that this effort to ensure our ability to defend the Apache Hadoop
trademarks will be a long-term effort.

Met with DLAPiper counsel on ways to efficiently improve trademark
enforcement in general, as well as brainstorm on ways to provide better
training to our PMCS about brand management and awareness.  Brainstormed
specific ways that DLAPiper can better support our Hadoop and related
products brands.

Category Total                  : $78,135.00   (+583%)

Details:

1.Register/Record most incoming podling names in US  $6,760

- Register the product name of most/all incoming podlings in the US.
USPTO registration fee is $325 for each; est. up to 20 annually.
Obviously we will want to coordinate with Incubator to ensure we're
only registering podlings nearing graduation, typically.

- Record change of ownership of any previously registered podling names.
I.e. when an incoming podling has a registered trademark, we should
to legally record this change of ownership with the applicable
country registry of trademarks.  Recording serves as notice to third
parties of our ownership, and allows us to renew registrations.

USPTO recording fee is $65; other jurisdictions are $100-$500 est.


2. Register/Record selected key incoming podling names Intl. $4,000

- Where a podling has existing international registrations, record the
change of ownership internationally.

Approximate cost $100-$500 each; est. 1-2 podlings annually.

- If we have some podling with high popularity and vendors using it's
branding, we may want to register up to one podling/year name
internationally, probably in EU/CTM to preserve rights in those
first-to-file jurisdictions.

Approximate cost $1,500 ea. if done with a US registration.


3. Declarations/Renewals fees  $10,000.00

- Registrations require maintenance and renewals: in the US, you must file
8&15 declarations at 5 years or risk losing the registration; at 10 years
you must renew it.

US 8&15 declarations are $300 each.  US 10year renewals are $400.
International renewals are more expensive.

NOTE that we won't need much of this 3. budget for the next few years,
since we only have ~20 current registrations that are on track for
renewals soon- this will only really be needed when our
backlog registrations age to 5 years.  Obviously, we only renew
registrations for active projects.  This is an estimate for annual
costs about 4 years in the future, assuming a roster of ~100 registrations.


4.Separate Counsel legal fees  $16,000

While DLAPiper provides services pro bono, they sometimes have a conflict
of interest with a particular registration, requiring us to seek another
counsel's services.  Similarly, for many international jurisdictions,
DLAPiper arranges discounted (but not free) services from local counsel.

This is an estimate of annual expenses based on:

- Third party legal services dealing with non-US renewals or other
registration questions:
est. 4 cases x $2,000 est. = $4,000

- Third party legal advice dealing with office actions etc. in cases
where DLAPiper has a conflict:
est. 2 cases x $6,000 est. = $12,000

----
Note these backlog requests are temporary for approx. 2 year period, until
we catch up with existing project registrations we pursue.


5.Register most TLP in US       : $11,375.00

This would register many of the simple to register names of software
products that match our existing TLP project names.  A proposed list of
names to register as an example is:  (USPTO fee $325ea)

Accumulo, Airavata, Ambari, Archiva, Aries, Avro, Bigtop, Camel,
Cassandra, Cayenne, Chukwa, Clerezza, Continuum, Crunch, Curator,
CXF, Etch, Felix, Flume, Geronimo, Giraph, Gora, Hama, Hive,
Isis, Jackrabbit, jUDDI, Kafka, Karaf, Lenya, Lucene, Mahout,
ManifoldCF, Marmotta, Maven, Nutch, OFBiz, Pig, Pivot, POI, Sling,
Solr, Sqoop, Stanbol, Struts, Synapse, Tapestry, Thrift, Tiles, Tomcat,
TomEE, Turbine, Tuscany, Whirr, Wicket, Wink, ZooKeeper

Obviously, this is subject to change depending on the activity level of
various projects, and as PMCs request to be added/removed.  Note that
Traffic Server has already requested to be added.


6.Register selected TLP Int'l   : $15,000.00

A few projects have such active communities and pressures from vendors
attempting to leverage their brands that I believe we should register
their product names in selected international jurisdictions.


7.Registrations of APACHE       : $15,000.00

This would cover registering our house brand of APACHE in a number
of international jurisdictions and dealing with attendant issues.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Firstly, I would like to thank Melissa for her sterling work on Fundraising.
She now has a good grasp of our day-to-day fundraising work, which is
a great relief for me.

We have received a Bronze payment from Basis Technology.

We have also received a Gold payment from IBM. Thanks to Sam Ruby for his
help pushing this through.

Our next major task is renewals on some of our platinum sponsors.
-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain on schedule and under budget. We have just received an
invoice from one of our press release distributors, which has been forwarded
to the Treasurer and awaiting authorization by the President.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned. Sally
Khudairi completed renewal activities for several Sponsors, and will begin
the process for 2014 upon receipt of assignments from VP Fundraising
Upayavira. She is also planning to liaise with Fundraising regarding
sponsorship planning for ApacheCon.

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the newswire
service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during this timeframe,
however two announcements are forthcoming.

IV. Informal Announcements: no items were announced on @TheASF; one new post
was made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed. No new posts were made on
"TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: news regarding the upcoming ApacheCon is scheduled
to take place mid-January. No project-related announcements are currently
planned. PMCs wishing to announce major project news, as well as podlings
ready to graduate from the Incubator, are welcome to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks'
notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 6 media requests, and 4 notifications
for industry award submissions. The ASF received 422 press clips over this
time period, vs. last month's clip count of 861.

VII. Analyst Relations: Apache was mentioned in 3 reports by Gartner, 1
Forrester report, 3 write-ups by GigaOM, 14 reports by Yankee Group, and 9
reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is working with Rich Bowen regarding planning
the next ApacheCon, with current focus on communications and sponsor
outreach.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally has been
coordinating award nominations for a few Apache projects, as well as liaising
with the ASF's presence at several conferences and virtual events.

X. Newswire accounts: we have received a renewal notice for pre-paid press
releases with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire. We have 17 pre-paid press releases on the
PRNewswire account through May 2014, and have an ongoing distribution
opportunity donated by Pressat with no pre-established termination timeframe.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

New Karma:
==========


Finances:
==========


Board Action Items:
===================


Short Term Priorities:
======================

* Look into mac build slaves.


* Converge on git.apache.org migration to eris. (Step 1 is merge git ->
  git-wip on tyr)
  (opinions?)

* Investigate / negotiate external code-signing capability, currently in talks
  under NDA. INFRA-3991 is tracking the status, and a Webex call has taken
  place.

* Look into rsync backup failures to abi. Look into clearing out a lot of room
  on abi - currently 20GB left and 20GB+ a day gets backed up.

* Complete nagios-to-circonus migration for monitoring.

* Continue to experiment with weekly team meetings via google hangout.

* Explore the possibility of revamping the infra documents to have a more
  intuitive feel about them, improve readability.

* Confluence Upgrade. Upgrade from 5.0.3 to latest. Hopefully will be less
  painful this time around.
  (Support case closed, nothing useful came from it other than check the logs.)


Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Choose a suitable technology for continued buildout of our virtual
  hosting infra.  Right now we are on VMWare but it no longer is gratis
  software for the ASF.

* Continue gradually replacing gear we no longer have any hardware warranty
  support for.

* Formulate an effective process and surrounding policy documentation for
  fulfilling the DMCA safe harbor provisions as they relate to Apache
  services.


General Activity:
=================

* Confluence: Finally got it to upgrade to 5.0.3. Database edits and
  conversions were needed to make the transition. After a few days bedding in
  it seems to be performing much better than the previous version.

* Translate.a.o: Upgraded to 2.5.1-RC1 (that is a release). Severe
  compatibility issues. Reprogrammed part of LDAP connection, to make it more
  stable (and work).

* [2nd Jan 2014] - Jenkins Master was migrated to a much needed new server.
  This also eases the pressure from Buildbot Master since the split of hosts.

* Migrated SVN repositories to newer, larger, and hopefully quicker array on
  Dec 31st. The repository upgrades will now be done in the coming weeks once
  we have seen stability in the Infra repository for at least 1 week. We will
  then likely re-purpose the SSD in the old array and add them to the new
  array for improved caching. Total downtime for the move was 1h15m as the
  prep work had been undertaken for at least 2 weeks before.

* RE: Symantec code signing service - There are a handful of internal tasks to
  complete before we can move on.

* Migration and reinstallation of continuum-ci.a.o (was vmbuild.a.o) has taken
  place.
  [Final checks are in progress before announcing its GA]

* [5th Jan 2014] - blogs.apache.org was upgraded by the roller project

* Faulty gmirror disk on eris, liaised with OSUOSL and swapped out disk.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Andy Seaborne has joined the "CSV on the Web Working Group".

Currently, there are 13 ASF members with W3C accounts.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

The discussion regarding the suitability of Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 as a
Category A license is still on hold as we await the availability of the CC
General Counsel. FWIW, this issue can be seen as a continuation of, or
offshoot of, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-167.

Mark Thomas proposed a directed question regarding the ability for ASF PMCs
to continue to use, and validate against, expired TCKs. Upon reading the TCK
agreement, Section 10.3 appears to explicitly allow for such continued use
assuming we abide by all other conditions of the agreement, which does not
appear to be an issue. I have asked for our pro-bono legal counsel to verify
and comment. So far, we have not rec'd a response, so we are continuing to
act based on our understanding that such continued use is OK.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds
arriving at security@ in Nov/Dec. These continue to be dealt with by

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera is very quiet, almost dormant. There was a report of a security
issue last September which was dealt with (determined not to be a
problem as the vulnerabilities were only in test code) but other than
that no work has been going on. It might be worth thinking about
moving to the attic but while there are still a few PMC members
watching the lists I think its probably ok to keep the project alive
for now.

The last release was one year ago, the last committer / PMC member
addition was Nov 2011.

No board issues.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based

Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Releases
No new releases since the last report.
Version 1.4.4 was released on 8/23/2013.

Activity
The mailing lists have been active.  The dev list has increased by 3
subscribers to 215, and the user list has increased by 22 subscribers to

per month (though there has been an overall increase in commit count due
to our switch to git).

The feature freeze date for 1.6.0 has passed.  We are still working out bugs
in the new features and anticipate a release in about a month.  New
releases for the 1.4 and 1.5 branches will also be prepared in this
timeframe.

the last quarter.

There are no board level issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Gianugo Rabellino]

Apologies for a late (well, missing) report. We will of course volunteer
a new one next month. FYI, though, there have been no changes and no
activity on the Attic since the last report, other than a ping from
Chris. Silver lining: Henri seems to have some bandwidth again. :)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Scott Carey]

Apache Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

== Issues ==

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

== Community ==

There has been work across most language implementations, with a
steady stream of new features and enhancements.

In Q4 2013, 42 Jira issues were created and 32 resolved.

Mailing list activity is steady, with a few hundred messages total per month.

No new committers have been added since 4/2013.  Over the life of the
project around 150 people have contributed patches, but most only
contribute one or two, addressing their specific needs.  The majority
of patches are from non-committers, whose input is generally warmly
welcomed, but who don't tend to contribute more.  The project is
fairly stable and widely used, so this is perhaps a result of that.

No new PMC members have been added since 9/2012.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Chukwa Project  [Eric Yang]

Fediz 1.1 (Nov 4, 2013)

Committer/PMC:
No committer/pmc changes this period
Last committer change:  One committer added for July 2013 report,
discussion started for a potential new committer
Last PMC change:  2 new PMC members were added for our January 2013 report.

Community update:
There has been a lot of work on trunk to get 3.0.0 out the door.   We
did manage to get the first milestone out and there has been quite a
bit of feedback and bug reports against it (which is good).   We’re doing
even more work to try and get a milestone2 out soon to address those
issues as well as cleanup a few more things we’ve found.

The DOSGi subproject has also had some work to refactor how it’s built
and tested to better leverage the work done on the main CXF branches.
This should result in being able to keep DOSGi more up to date and easier
to build and maintain.



-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Myrna van Lunteren]

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

The Hadoop project reached a significant milestone, releasing Hadoop 2.2.0 as
the first GA artifact in that series.

Two development branches have merged to trunk: In-memory caching of HDFS
blocks (HDFS-4949) (29-Oct-2013) and the first phase in presenting
heterogeneous storage to applications (HDFS-2832) (13-Dec-2013). Development
of these features continues in trunk.

YARN continues to refine its resource model. Salient issues include modifying
containers (YARN-1197), delegating cluster resources (YARN-1488), and
improving its model for services (YARN-896). Work on improving high
availability in the ResourceManager (YARN-149), particularly YARN-1029, has
made very promising progress.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 36 podlings currently under incubation.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

    (None)

  People who left the IPMC:

    (None)

* New Podlings

  * DataFu makes it easier to solve data problems using Hadoop and
    higher level languages based on it.

* Graduations

    (None)

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

    Dec 16 Apache Sirona 0.1-incubating
    Dec 17 Apache Spark 0.8.1-incubating

  It took 6-21 days for the third IPMC vote to arrive.

    Apache Spark 0.8.1-incubating         Dec 11      Dec 17         6

* IP Clearance

  * Apache Celix received the donation of a shared memory implementation of
    the remote service admin specification from Thales Nederland B.V..

* Miscellaneous

  * The initiative to reform release voting yielded multiple breakthroughs
    during this report cycle.

    1. An experimental framework was approved whereby PPMC votes become
       binding for releases after the first if a release checklist is
       completed by the PPMC and approved by a Mentor.
    2. A concise checklist of release requirements was assembled, where
       each item is required by either ASF-wide policy or Incubator policy.
    3. Consensus was built for a controlled regime for relaxing policy on
       incubating releases under appropriate circumstances, potentially
       reducing the number of release candidates we force podlings to cycle
       through.

    All of this was achieved with significantly fewer emails compared with
    past reform attempts.

  * Exercising the new regime for controlled relaxation of policy, a bugfix
    release by Spark (0.8.1) which bundled jar files was approved by the
    IPMC after the podling presented a roadmap to eliminating them in the
    next minor point release (0.9).

    Project is off to a good start with lots of activity on the mailing list
    and in JIRA. One of the Mentors (Jake Farrell) is very active and there
    are no issues that need attention.

--------------------
BatchEE

BatchEE is a JBatch implementation with few utilities modules.

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Release
  2. Decide if BatchEE keeps integration with other frameworks or not
     (camel, etc)
  3. Provide some more samples

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community itself is almost the same (but was holidays ;) but we start to
  get some enterprise users :).

How has the project developed since the last report?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John Ament (johndament):

    BatchEE is a new podling, with a small team working on it currently.
    It's a fork of the RI for Java Batch from Java EE 7.  I think short term
    they should focus on getting a release out there to draw in community
    interest; which should help build the podling more and drive feature
    interest.

--------------------
Celix

Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on
interoperability between Java and C.

Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Publish a new release (see below)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Together with the donation of a new Remote Services Admin we have added
  Bjoern Petri as committer. The work being done on the GSoC project is
  mostly finished but still needs some finishing up before it can be added
  to the repository.

  If the code donated by Bjoern is added to the project a new release will
  be made. In this release we will try to solve all remarks of the first
  release.

  A discussion concerning graduation has also been started, if this goes
  well, we want to start the vote on the Celix list and then ask the IPMC if
  Celix is ready to graduate.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There is a new Remote Service Admin which can be used alongside the
  current one. There is also the GSoC project which can be added after the
  second release. Altogether most work has been done to be able to make a
  release. Issues have been solved/closed/updated etc.

Date of last release:

  16-12-2012


When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  2014-01-03 Bjoern Petri elected as committer (still needs to be added to
             the Celix group).
  2013-01-07 Roman Shaposhnik joins as a mentor.

    This podling is growing. They plan a release soon and let's see how that
    goes. When it comes time for graduation I have some concerns that this
    podling's community may be too small.

--------------------
log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.  It is a reboot of an
earlier, stalled logging project with a new collection of committers.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Triage on old, pre-incubation issues in JIRA and reported mailing
     lists with an eye towards initial re-release blockers
  2. Solving those blockers on a minimal set of platforms to permit
     initial re-release.
  3. Reengaging former user community, many of whom left as previous
     incarnation became dormant.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The committers are getting acquainted with each other and the foundation.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  This is our first report.

Date of last release:

  2008-04-03 was the official, pre-incubation 0.10.0

--------------------
MetaModel

MetaModel is a data access framework, providing a common interface for
exploration and querying of different types of datastores.

MetaModel has been incubating since 2013-06-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. More contributors to increase diversity of the community
  2. Make first release under ASF umbrella
  3. Set better guidelines for procedures by setting community by-laws

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We're working on making the first release under the Apache umbrella
  available. A first release candidate was rejected in the vote for
  technical reasons, but these where fixed by the second release candidate
  and a few JIRA entries to improve build-time validation.

  Various requests and questions are coming in through the dev mailing list.
  We believe this activity will further accelerate when our first release is
  available.

  We've been drafting a set of community by-laws, but open questions and
  discussions are still not settled, so this is only work-in-progress.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We've implemented various performance and concurrency related improvements
  to the working of MetaModel.

  Test suites have been improved to work properly on different locales,
  operating systems etc.

  Many minor changes to build configuration, license files etc., as a result
  of working towards a release.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Roman Shaposhnik (rvs):

    In general project seem to be on the right track with a healthy amount
    of community interaction happening over the mailing list and a strong
    desire to do a release. Two issues have caught my attention though:

    1. I am not quite sure what motivated a strong drive towards having
       by-laws this early in the game. In my experience the focus on by-laws
       can, at times, put a damping factor on community growth. IOW, what
       I've seen in the past is that communities try to come up with by-laws
       when the usual process of consensus building starts to fail. Nothing
       actionable here for the project -- just keep this in mind.
    2. The JIRA feels a bit empty for the project that has been developing
       for more than 6 month (grand total of 33 issues). At the same time
       the number of commits in the Git repo is on par with the development
       pace. What it tells me is that there's no strong correlation between
       JIRAs and commits. This raises a red flag of whether all of the
       changes that are committed get a proper community vetting before they
       go in.  I couldn't find any traces of the review requests either:
         https://reviews.apache.org/groups/metamodel/
       This in my opinion is a pretty big concern for the project.

--------------------
ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community in terms of committers
  2. Have regular releases
  3. Decide if we would like to be a top level project or join an existing
     project

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  -

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We received patches and issue reports from users, but no new developers.
  We're discussing on our dev list an initiative to take advantage of our
  next release to publicize the project and attract new developers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Minor issues have been fixed. We are also working on an adapter for the
  POI API that is not yet committed but will be soon. We are planning to
  have a release this month.

    ODF Toolkit has been incubating for a long time.  Activity on their list
    is in frequent, but active enough that it still is running.  Considering
    what the project is, I think the best resolution for this podling is to
    graduate as a sub project under something like OpenOffice or POI.

--------------------
Olingo

Apache Olingo provides libraries which enable developers to implement
OData producers and OData consumers. While starting with an initial
code base implementing OData version 2.0 it is also a clear goal to
start implementing a library for OData 4.0 once the OData standard is
published at OASIS. The focus within the community is currently on the
Java technology but it is up to the community to discuss if other
environments find interest.

Olingo has been incubating since 2013-07-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow community
  2. n/a
  3. n/a

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  - n/a

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Committers actively worked together to make the first release. Effort
    was coordinated by Jira and mailing list.
  - Committers actively working on making the second release. Effort is
    coordinated by Jira and mailing list.
  - Committers are in mailing list contact with mentors and infrastructure
    to extend infrastructure setup (e.g. Wiki).
  - Community has grown: Additional committers, new contributors (can be
    seen via Jira Issues, Mailing List), but the community is still
    homogeneous which needs to change for graduation

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - There is currently no feature development for OData 2.0 (stabilization
    phase for making the second release)
  - Documentation on web site is refactored and growing
  - There is feature development for OData 4.0 in a new repository. This new
    development will not be part of the second release

Spark

Spark is an open source system for fast and flexible large-scale data
analysis. Spark provides a general purpose runtime that supports
low-latency execution in several forms.

Spark has been incubating since 2013-06-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Pretty much the only issue remaining is importing our old JIRA
     into Apache (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6419).
     Unfortunately, although we've been trying to do this since June,
     we haven't had much luck with it, as the INFRA people who tried
     to help out have been busy and software version numbers have
     often been incompatible (we have a hosted JIRA instance from
     Atlassian that they regularly update). We believe that there are
     some export dumps on that issue that are compatible with the ASF's
     current JIRA version, but if we can't get this resolved in the
     next 2-3 weeks, we may simply forgo importing our old issues.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  It would be really great to get a contact who can sit down with us
  and do the JIRA import. We're not sure who from INFRA leads these
  tasks.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We made a Spark 0.8.1 release in December, and are working on a new
  major release (0.9) this month. We added two new committers, Aaron
  Davidson and Kay Ousterhout.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We made the Spark 0.8.1 release mentioned above, with a number of
  new features detailed at
  http://spark.incubator.apache.org/releases/spark-release-0-8-1.html.
  We also have some exciting features coming up in Spark 0.9, such as
  support for Scala 2.10, parallel machine learning libraries in
  Python, and improvements to Spark Streaming.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Alan Cabrera (acabrera):

    Seems like a nice active project.  IMO, there's no need to wait import
    to JIRA to graduate. Seems like they can graduate now.

--------------------
Stratos

Stratos will be a polyglot PaaS framework, providing developers a
cloud-based environment for developing, testing, and running scalable
applications, and IT providers high utilization rates, automated resource
management, and platform- wide insight including monitoring and billing.

Stratos has been incubating since 2013-06-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Diversify the community
  2. Clear trademark
  3. Start Graduation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Two new committers & PMC members have been added to the project. (In
  Stratos, committers are also invited to join the PMC). Seven Google
  Hangouts were held in order to educate the community about the project &
  the technical details/architecture in the project. Conduct a Cloud BarCamp
  on 28th October to enable the Stratos community members as well as other
  Apache cloud project community members to meet up & exchange ideas & build
  synergy. Community members have also written several blog posts. The
  project has also seen a number of new contributors who have started
  actively participating in the project.

VXQuery

A standards compliant parallel XML Query processor.

VXQuery has been incubating since 2009-07-06.

  There are no formal issues blocking graduation. The issue of off-list
  discussions that was identified by the mentors a few month ago has been
  addressed. While off-list discussions are still happening, (intermediate)
  results of those discussions are now regularly brought back to the list.

  While not a formal requirement, the current plan is to do a second
  incubator release before graduation to
  a) release the changes that accumulated while the first release was
     prepared and to
  b) have a release prepared by another RM.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

Apache Isis is a framework to enable the creation of software using
domain-driven design principles, being an implementation of the naked
objects architectural pattern


== Community ==

Mailing list activity has been steady; user mailing list subscriptions
continue to slowly increase month-on-month.  It is encouraging to see other
users start to respond to newbie questions on the mailing list, not just the
committers.

There have been no changes to the committers or PMC this quarter.


== Activity ==

Isis continues to be developed steadily, though it must be pointed out that
the vast majority continues to be done by myself, with a smaller amount by
Jeroen van der Wal (one of our committers).  This is primarily in support
of the development of an open source application that Jeroen and I are
building (Estatio [1]), for and on behalf of Eurocommercial Properties [2].
We have a note of thanks on our site to ECP [3].

ECP look set to continue funding through 2014, with new features planned that
build upon Isis' support for Restful Objects spec [4].

The two Google Summer of Coders we had have now (as could be expected) gone
somewhat quiet, though they did both vote on recent releases (see below).

In Nov I presented on Apache Isis at the Oredev conference in Oslo.  A video
of that session [5] and supporting tutorial [6] are both linked from the
Isis documentation page [7].

In Nov I also presented on Apache Isis at the London Java Community
open conference [8].


== Releases ==

This quarter we made two releases, v1.3.0 on 25 Oct 2013, and a follow-up
v1.3.1 on 7 Nov 2013.


== Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.   Sebastian Bazley
raised a ticket on us [9] with respect to using mirrors and providing MD5
hashes on our download page; this has now been addressed [10].

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

The Apache JMeter desktop application is a pure Java application
designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

JMeter 2.10 was released on Oct 22 2013. (just after our last report)

JMeter 2.11 was released on Jan 05 2014.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
the committers.

There have been no committers added since October 2011, when Philippe
Mouawad was added. There are a few regular contributors who may be
suitable candidates for committership, pending discussion by the PMC.

There have been no changes to the PMC since it was established in October
2011.

We have set up a Twitter account (https://twitter.com/ApacheJMeter)
This has 310 followers as of Jan 05 2014.

There are no board level issues at this time

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos]

JSPWiki is a Java-based wiki engine

=== Anything the board should be aware of?

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

=== Releases / Development

Last release on 15th May, 2013

Activity has increased this period, part because of public wiki
published, part because 2.10.0 release is being pursued. A release vote
for 2.10.0 was held, but didn't pass due to a couple of issues which
surfaced during the vote. Those have been fixed, but we have taken the
opportunity to include one contribution and fix other minor issues.

2.10.0 should be released this January.

Development has also been associated to the migration of wiki pages
from www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki (former www.jspwiki.org) to our new wiki.

=== Community

Last Committer: Glen Mazza (gmazza), on 04th Jan, 2013
Last PMC: Glen Mazza (gmazza), on 04th Jan, 2013

Activity has returned to it's normal levels at dev@j.a.o, whereas
user@j.a.o continues with more or less the same amount of (little)
activity.

We have received a couple of contributions, the Clean Blue template,
to be included on the upcoming 2.10.0 release and the EntityManager,
which should be looked at after 2.10.0. We also received a couple of
patches in this period, which have been incorporated into trunk.

92 (+0) people subscribed to dev@j.a.o, 175 (-1) people subscribed at
user@j.a.o

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Nick Wellnhofer]

The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for dynamic
programming languages. It is a "loose" C port of the Apache Lucene search
engine library for Java.

ISSUES

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

RELEASES

Version 0.3.3 was released on 05 Aug 2013.

We're working towards a new major release featuring C bindings, support for
compiled extensions, and Clownfish as a separate product. Clownfish is the
object system which Lucy is based on.

ACTIVITY

Development

    * Finished migration to immutable strings.
    * Low activity.

Mailing lists

User list subscribers: 90 (+2)
Developer list subscribers: 66 (+1)

Mailing list activity below average.

COMMITTER/PMC CHANGES

No new committers in the last quarter. The last addition was on 15 Feb 2013.

No new PMC members in the last quarter and since Lucy graduated from the
incubator in March 2012.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Grant Ingersoll]

Apache Mahout has implementations of a wide range of machine learning and
data mining algorithms: clustering, classification, collaborative filtering
and frequent pattern mining

Project Status
--------------

The project continues to have a large and active user base and the developer
base continues to grow, as well.



Community
---------

* On November 28th Frank Scholten was voted in as new committer.
* No changes to the PMC in the reporting period.

* With Suneel Marthi now working full time on the project there has
 been a flurry of patches reviewed and committed.
* The project has moved to Apache CMS, is in the process of tidying
 most of the wiki based documentation.
* After a small Hackathon in Berlin pre-Christmas activity has been
 steady even during the holiday season.



Community Objectives
--------------------

With most committers not working on Mahout full time there is always a
lack of time on lists as well as when it comes to dealing with patches
submitted quickly. The current goal is to grow the committer base to
deal with that issue.

As for students that would like to contribute the problem remains that
the most interesting work seems to be adding new algorithms and
implementations. It remains a challenge to motivate those interested in
contributing to work on getting existing implementations stable,
improving documentation and reviewing incoming patches.


Releases
--------

The community is actively working on getting the 0.9 release out the
door with just one scaling issue remaining the the k-means++ code newly
added as part of the 0.8 release (June 2013).

This is supposed to be the last release before 1.0.



Issues
------

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

An Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta has graduated from the Incubator in November 2013,
this is the second report as a TLP to the Board.

The traffic on the mailing lists was intense beginning of December,
however during XMas and New Year it got rather silent. In total, the
number of messages is at about the average of the recent months.

The upcoming release could not be finished before XMas and was rescheduled
for this month, the work on it will be taken up in the next days when
people return from their vacations.

Subscribers to the projects mailing list:
    dev@marmotta.a.o: 58 subscribers (+2 since last report, 12/2013)
  users@marmotta.a.o: 61 subscribers (+6 since last report, 12/2013)

Branding
  We're still using the "graduation logo" [1], but it is planned
  to switch back to the original in the following days.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Stephen Connolly]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build
lifecycle.

* General Information

  We have been making slow but steady progress on our compliance with
  the ASF source header policy. Of the 108 release roots, we now have
  only 30 release roots that still report issues using the Apache Rat
  tooling. One of the measures that we have been using for voting on
  releases is that the Rat report is either better or no worse than
  the previous release. Our intention is to start driving this more
  proactively once we get some community release momentum re-established.

  We are starting to see some traction from others with respect to
  resolving the confusion over the requirements of LICENSE and
  NOTICE files in source control: http://s.apache.org/0V

  Packt Publishing contacted the PMC with respect to the distribution
  of royalties. We informed Packt that the royalties are required to
  be added to the ASF account and our understanding is that this has
  been done.

Apache MINA is a network application framework which helps users
develop high performance and high scalability network applications
easily.

-- Community --
* One new committers (Manuel Sangoi, october 2013)
* No new PMC members (last addition: January 2010). We will vote the addition
of Jean-François Maury next month.

Users mailing list :

Jan 2013 : 442 subscribers,

Dev mailing list :
Jan 2014 : 385 subscribers,
Jan 2013 : 364 subscribers,

-- Current activity --

This is a very calm quarter, from the activity point of view. All the
committers are quite busy on other tasks or projects (new born baby, day job,
side project).

We do expect that the next quarter will see more activity.

* Apache MINA :
 * Very slow activity in the past three months.
 * MINA 3 is progressing, with a few tens of commits
 * MINA 2.0 deserves a new release, but we need some time to get it done

* Apache FtpServer:
 * No activity if the past 3 months

* Apache SSHd:
 * Guillaume has pushed many fixes last december

* Apache Vysper :
 * Nothing done

* Apache AsyncWeb:
 * No activity. This project is still dormant at this point.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache MyFaces Project  [Gerhard Petracek]

The Apache MyFaces project is an umbrella project of the
Apache Software Foundation for projects relating to the
JavaServer Faces (JSF) technology.

Community
---------
 * New Committers
   ** Dennis Hörsch (11/November/13)
   ** Paul Nicolucci (11/November/13)
 * No new PMC Members (since July 2011)
 * No new Contributors

The MyFaces community is stable. Besides working on new releases,
we discuss upcoming topics.

-> Community business as usual (nothing special to report).

Releases
--------
MyFaces (sub) projects with new releases since the last report:
 * MyFaces Core 2.0.19 (28/October/13)
 * MyFaces Core 2.1.13 (28/October/13)
 * MyFaces Core 2.2.0-beta (29/October/13)
 * MyFaces Test 1.0.5 (23/October/13)
 * MyFaces Tobago 2.0.0 Alpha2 (11/October/13)
 * MyFaces Tobago 1.5.11 (11/November/13)
 * MyFaces Trinidad Maven Plugins 2.0.8 (7/November/13)
 * MyFaces Trinidad 2.1.0 (19/November/13)

Wiki/CMS
--------
CWiki -> CMS migration (ongoing)

Issues
------
The release of MyFaces-Core is problematic due to
an inability to acquire a JSF TCK more recent than
February 2013. The February TCK is flawed and
we need a more recent version to pass the TCK.
Discussion continues on how we should resolve this,
but we probably do not have enough expertise to resolve
how to acquire a newer TCK or how to do a release without
the TCK within the MyFaces community.
We are considering talking with other projects who
might be in the same situation.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Julien Nioche]

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene™, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop
data structures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

No releases since the previous board report but quite a few bugfixes and
improvements, notably a more abstract document de-duplication mechanism
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-656) and the removal of
deprecated code.

Nutch 2.x should soon benefit from improvements being done in Apache Gora,
in particular GORA-117.

We are seeing contributions and bugfixes from new users.

COMMUNITY

No new committers/ PMC member since the previous report.

The traffic on the user and dev mailing lists is quite steady and
questions from new users usually get replied to reasonably quickly.

Julien Nioche gave a talk on Nutch at the Lucene/Solr Revolution EU
conference.

recovery as described by your process definition. It supports both long
and short living process executions to orchestrate all the services that
are part of your application.

STATUS
This reporting period was rather quiet. We have pushed our 1.3.6 release
between board report submission and board meeting and are happy to have
a new release. We've got some feedback and a couple of bug reports we
want to fix within the next reporting period.

RELEASE
Apache ODE 1.3.6 has been released.

DEVELOPMENT
Nothing important to report.

COMMUNITY
Nothing to report. Last committer was added on Dec 10, 2012, last PMC

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

Issues for Board Awareness
---------------------------

OpenOffice depends on code stored at Apache Extras for its binary
releases. It is unclear whether Apache Extras will adopt the same
policy as Google Code http://s.apache.org/hzJ but, if it does, this
will be a major problem for OpenOffice starting 15 January. In
earlier conversations on the Infra list this was determined to be
a ComDev issue and there were no public updates so far about it.

Community Development/Outreach Progress
---------------------------------------

The project added 6 committers (October: fanyuzhen, bourock, wlada;
November: knmc, joesch; December: hanya) and one PMC member
(November: fanyuzhen) since our last report in October.

The new committers span different areas of expertise: development,
QA, localization, documentation, extensions, user support in native
languages.

A new documentation effort for an end-users manual under the ALv2
license is progressing well on the OpenOffice Wiki, and materials
from an "OpenOffice for students" guide have been made available
and are being integrated.

The OpenOffice custom infrastructure (wiki, forum) is still in a
"minimal maintenance" mode, with many improvements waiting to be
implemented. A proposal to move forward in a way that is also
acceptable by Infra has recently received consensus; a team is
forming and we are looking forward to offer professional and
responsive infrastructure support to the project community members.

Experimental solutions to make website translation easier have
been tested. The first pilot languages are already online.

The localization community is growing, with 5 localizations
(Bulgarian, Danish, Hindi, Norwegian Bokmal, Thai) reaching 100%
since the last report.

There is a growing interest on the mailing list from new volunteers
who would like to help with simple core development tasks.

OpenOffice will co-organize a track (devroom) at FOSDEM, a
major European free and open source software conference, to be held
1-2 February 2014 in Brussels, Belgium. Several project developers
will be presenting their latest work and the upcoming features.

Community support forums remain popular with users, with an average
of over 100 posts per day. The community also reached consensus on
a new graphical identity, to be implemented as part of the pending
tasks.

The mailing lists for user support, localization, QA and marketing
are quite active. Activity in social media is progressing well. As
Apache OpenOffice is a client product, we continue to investigate
ways to direct users to appropriate support venues. The developer
(dev) list remains very active.

Product/Project Development Progress
------------------------------------

Apache OpenOffice 4.0.1, a maintenance release, was released on
1 October 2013.

A possible "language update" release of Apache OpenOffice 4.0.1 to
include the 5 additional languages now ready for release (Bulgarian,
Danish, Hindi, Norwegian Bokmal, Thai) is being discussed, with a
tentative release date in late January.

Version 4.1.0, with a tentative release date in early April, will
feature several improvements, including the IA2 accessibility work
and the replacement of outdated Mozilla code with the NSS libraries:
both are already merged to trunk and now being tested.

Activities that are still ongoing for the next release include:
the rejuvenate01 branch, to explore using native platform
capabilities and libraries for building; actions for an easier
installation and availability on mainstream Linux distributions; a
new localization process, now progressing in the l10n40 branch; a
redesign of the build approach, dropping the historical dmake.

The download trend remains very strong, with 85 million downloads of
Apache OpenOffice as of 31 December 2013.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Description
-----------
SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent email
filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited bulk email,
more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to email headers and
content to classify email using advanced statistical methods. In addition,
SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows other technologies to be
quickly wielded against spam and is designed for easy integration into
virtually any email system.

Releases
--------
Release of version 3.4.0 is still imminent.  The latest release candidates
were created Jan 11th and Oct 10th.

Our rules releases have been much more consistent with 62 nightly rule
collections published since 8/9 which is a perfect record!

No other releases for this quarter.

3.4.0 will be a major release.  It introduces over two years of bug fixes
and features including the Bayes Redis back-end (bug 6879), eDNS changes (bug
6910), Native IPv6 Support, numerous URIBL.pm changes/features and a small API
change in libspamc (bug 6562) with many other subtle changes.

Overall, this release has been tested in many production-level environments
for nearly a year.  It is highly recommended and stable.

Additionally, as the project continues to battle spam, we find we are
working quite often on rules and related anti-spam resources that are not
code such as real-time blacklists (RBLs).  I believe there is considered
value to the project, the foundation and the anti-spam community if we were
to spearhead these resources under the ASF umbrella.  I have begun the
framework at https://raptor.pccc.com/raptor.cgim?template=RBL with the
intention to run this under the project if permitted.

Community & Development
-----------------------

The most recent addition to our PMC is Adam Katz added on 2013-01-30.

Our RuleQA dev list has been active and community support is good allowing
the project to publish rules more consistently.  We have had virtually no
problems this quarter getting rules published nightly!

The project users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

The project dev list has been active with both committers and community
members contributing.

Still need to migrate our website to svnpubsub (Bug 6885), Need to migrate
our zones and zones2 server off of Solaris (Bug 6886) and Need to get our
Jenkins build slave working under FreeBSD instead of Solaris1 (Bug 6887).


Project Branding Requirements
-----------------------------
None.

One note, cPanel reached out to us about changing our logo and we used the
opportunity to greatly improve the branding of Apache SpamAssassin in this
product including properly calling it Apache SpamAssassin and linking back to
the project website.  http://go.cpanel.net/paperlantern shows the new version
of their interface where you can click on Apache SpamAssassin and see the
changes.

Issues
------
Bill from Sonic.net for donated resources believed resolved.

No other issues requiring board attention.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

The project missed to report on their regular schedule in December 2013,
therefore this report was prepared for January 2014.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment.

The project is performing well and new features are added on a regular basis.
The dev mailing list is actively in use. Requests from subscribers are handled
promptly.

The release process is still slow which means that the project was unable
to produce a release since Feb 2013. The reason seems to be that release
preparation is to time consuming and there are not enough committers that
are capable of performing a release.

As a consequence the current Stanbol users mostly rely on the latest versions
from the dev trunk or the already existing release branch. The project is
aware of this situation and is working on that issue.

Subscribers on the dev list: 210
No new committers were elected since June 2013.

No releases were published.
Last release was: apache-stanbol-enhancement-engines-0.10.0 on Feb 2nd, 2013

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

Apache Struts is an action-based Java web application framework.

The Struts team made two releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.15.3 - security fix release (2013-10-15)
* Struts 2.3.16 - improvements and bugfixes (2013-12-08)

In the last quarter we had to deal with a broken access control security
vulnerability. The issue was fixed in a timely manner, resulting in the
release of Struts 2.3.15.3

In this period we saw constant community activity on the mailing lists and
issue tracker, along with reasonable development activity.

In the last quarter we added Greg Huber (ghuber - 2014-01-06) as a new
committer. No new PMC members were added in this period.

As a notable addendum to the last quarter's report, the Apache Struts web site
was relaunched with a cleaned up and modernized design (2013-09-17).

In October, the Warsaw JUG organized Warsjawa conference featured a Struts
Hackathon lead by our fellow PMC member Łukasz Lenart.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

* Overview

  No board-level issues at this time.

  This is a make-up report for Nov 2013. Our last report was Aug 2013.
  We will report again next month (Feb 2014).

* Community

  No changes in committers or PMC makeup. Our last committer was added
  in July 2013. Our last PMC addition was March 2012.

  The developers continue to work towards a 1.9 release, and on
  supporting the 1.8.x series. The 1.7.x series receives security
  updates, and (sometimes) high-value functionality updates.

  We get about 200-300 messages per month on the users@ mailing list,
  and interaction is good. We have a broad set of people to support
  the community.

  The development list sees about 150-250 messages per month, and
  200-700 commits per month. Development is progressing smoothly.

* Releases

  In our last report, the community was preparing 1.8.2 and 1.7.12.
  Those versions were pulled, and (instead) 1.8.3 and 1.7.13 were
  released on August 30.

  We also released 1.8.4 on Oct 29, 2013, then 1.8.5 and 1.7.14 on
  Nov 25, 2013.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.7) has been released 2013-04-29.
  We made available numerous preview builds of the upcoming 5.4 release, the
  latest (5.4-beta-2) on 2013-12-23.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is high. Questions are answered with
  participation of not only the core contributors but also by the community
  at large. Discussion focuses especially around new features of the upcoming
  5.4 release.
  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.
  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4 which
  will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other new features.

  We have run a successful vote to switch development of Tapestry 5.4 to beta,
  which entails an emphasis on fixing bugs over adding new features. An
  initial beta release is forthcoming.

  PMC member Thiago H. de Paula Figueiredo ran a successful campaign on
  IndieGoGo to fund a month of dedicated Tapestry 5.4 development. These
  changes are underway.

  Interest recent work from outside of Apache includes an integration with
  Atomsphere (a websocket implementation) and a refresh of the Tapestry
  Jumpstart tutorial site to align with Tapestry 5.4.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Lance Semmens has been voted in as a committer on 2013-07-07.
  The last PMC addition has been Massimo Lusetti on 2012-08-27.

PMC and committer diversity

  PMC and committer diversity is good. To our knowledge no two committers share
  the same employer. Levels of contribution vary over time with Howard Lewis
  Ship being the driving force behind Tapestry's development and various other
  committers working on areas of their interest.

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org" - completed
 * "Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc." - completed
 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing
 * "Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in footers,
   etc." - completed
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo
 * "Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date" - completed

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Dave Meikle]

What is Tika?
=========================
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from, a
growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognised by IANA and other standards bodies.

Issues
=========================
There are no issues that need the boards attention.

Releases
=========================

The last release (1.4) was made in July 2013. Work has progressed on version
1.5 with a number of bug fixes and improvements. A discussion thread is
underway on creating a version 1.5 release candidate.

Community
=========================
The Tika PMC has voted to add Hong-Thai Nguyen as a committer and PMC Member,
with ACK to board earlier this week.  Prior to this the last Tika PMC and
Committer and PMC Member was added in July 2013.

Discussion has progressed around integrating Any23 components of value into
Tika. This is not in full swing yet however there is broad agreement on the
approach, with some initial patches being proposed and integrated.

Mailing list activity on dev@ was at 84, 155 and 28 messages in November,
December and January 2014, respectively. user@ was at 14, 10 and 0 messages,
during the same timeframe.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment BB: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based on,
but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java Enterprise
Edition Specifications.

Apache TomEE 1.6.0 was delivered mid November to a very appreciative
community.  Major thanks to the cooperation of both OpenWebBeans and OpenJPA
for preparing and releasing their cooperation getting their respective 1.2.1
and 2.3.0 releases out the door.  The release was an effort spanning multiple
communities.

Positive note for the release was we had the most votes from non-committers
we've ever seen on any TomEE or OpenEJB release.  There were several revotes,
but it ended up being just under the number of committer votes.  Both a sign
of the very long delay (the bad) from the previous release and people
transitioning involvement from the user list to the dev list (the good).

The community remains with the best intentions to release more frequently.
Lack of enough activity to split attention between multiple branches is one
factor.  With this in mind trunk remains at the stable 1.6.x branch with an
intent to deliver at least one point release before shifting to another major
feature version.  Longer term, bringing in more committers will be key.

The project voted in Mark Struberg as a committer in November.  Mark has been
instrumental in all release work in the last year with his involvement as a
committer on both OpenWebBeans and OpenJPA which are the most frequently
patched and most common SNAPSHOT dependencies of TomEE.

Last release was 1.6.0 in November 2013.  Last committer was added November
2012.  Last PMC addition was 2010-08-26.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the board's attention.


Community
=========

One new committer (and PMC) member joined our ranks, bringing us to a total

the last board report, which had 226 and 171 respectively. 405 changes were
committed to our git repository from 39 contributors. Although the number of
commits are very similar to last report, the number of contributors has
increased by over 50%. That is good news.


Events
======

Our first official Summit was held October 16-17, hosted by Yahoo Inc! This
was well received, and one of the outcomes was to aim for two summits per year
going forward. Hence, our next Spring Summit is planned for April 2014.

A mini-BarCamp is planned for January 20-21, in Zurich, Switzerland.


Releases
========

Two releases were made since the last report, including one new minor
release which is our currently supported stable release:
