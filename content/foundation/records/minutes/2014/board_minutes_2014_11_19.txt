 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Over the last few weeks, there has been quite a bit of activity
       celebrating the 15 year anniversary of the ASF. With such a long list
       of achievements, there is much that every contributor to the ASF can
       be proud of! We look to the future with excitement about what is still
       to come.

    B. President [Ross]

       Fundraising is our biggest concern this month. Nobody over there is picking up
       the dropped balls. Melissa is doing her best to keep things moving (and is
       doing a fantastic job). However, we need people to take ownership of
       relationships with individual sponsors. Especially our top level sponsors.

       Because of this lack of ownership in the last month it was unfortunate that a
       small number of invoices were sent out for renewals without anyone having
       contact the sponsor in advance. As can be expected this was not received well.
       I have reached out to the sponsors in question and apologized. I do not
       believe there is any harm done. However, as with (almost) every month I need
       to request that Directors volunteer to manage our relationship with one or
       more key sponsor if they are able to do so. 

       In order to make this relationship management easier VP Marketing will be
       producing an annual report with quarterly updates. Over the last year we have
       been changing our processes to ensure that data for such a report is easily
       accessible. At this point we believe that a report containing timely and
       detailed information from all presidents committees, plus the treasurers
       office will be relatively easy to create.

       There is no report from Fundraising this month. Other than the above I believe
       the renewal of $75k of sponsorship (3 sponsors) is the key item to report
       (thanks to Melissa for ensuring this keeps moving).

       I intend to appoint, immediately after this board meeting (assuming no
       objections), both Jim Jagielski and Hadrian Zbarcea as VP of Fundraising. The
       goal here is to enable Jim and Hadrian to act in tandem. Upayavira
       reports that titles to the sponsors are important, which is why I'm taking the
       unusual step of creating two positions rather than just expanding the
       committee. I feel that we really need the experience of Jim in budget planning
       and strategizing, but we also need the additional time and energy of Hadrian.
       Whilst I could, and until now have, taken on this role I want to move my focus
       away from Fundraising and towards other aspects that require attention
       (specifically focusing on the medium to long term plans rather than the short
       term implementation – as per my report last month). This setup is designed to
       allow me to do that.

       Brand Management is moving in the direction desired by the board (with my
       support). That is it is decentralizing in order to ensure a faster decision
       making process and also to enable VP Brand Management to focus more on broader
       policy issues (such as improving event branding policy which is underway) and
       edge cases. In this month’s report VP Brand management says:

       "Counsel confirms that we can legally delegate ability to provide project 
       brand use permissions to PMCs and their VPs directly; however they also 
       note that this may have risks - depending on how well PMCs manage this 
        - with our long-term ability to defend our brands."

       I look to VP Brand Management to try to ensure that our policies are clear
       enough to ensure that we are able to defend our brands appropriately and offer
       my support in doing so.

       Marketing and Publicity continues to proceed. The Powered By Apache logo's
       have been well received, a couple of projects that were missing in the initial
       round have been added. A series of three posts describing how the foundation
       works have been published (from the Chairman, President and EVP).

       Three designs proposals for a new home page (not a new site) were submitted
       for comment. Predictably there were many conflicting opinions, but all valid
       and helpful. Sally has collated this feedback and is working to include it in
       an updated design. I want to thank Sally for managing a very inclusive process
       in what could so easily have become a fruitless bike-shedding exercise.
       However, given the extent and range of feedback it is possible this work will
       not be completed until January.

       Infrastructure has had a less eventful month and thus VP Infra reports "This
       month saw us paying back large portions of technical debt." Last month both I
       and the Chair reported that VP Infra was asking for a longer term view on
       where the foundation is heading with respect to budget management and
       infrastructure expenditure specifically. As can be seen above in my discussion
       re fundraising my hope is to be able to turn my attention to this planning in
       the coming months as I start to ramp up on budget planning for the next FY.

       No report from the Travel Assistance Committee was submitted. However the EA
       report indicates everything is in order for ApacheCon EU.

       @Jim: discuss reporting responsibilities for VP Fundraising

       @Hadrian: discuss reporting responsibilities for VP
       Fundraising

    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        A press release for Virtual’s 15th year anniversary was coordinated
        with VP, Press and Marketing, and with the President. Treasurer’s
        Office was kept in the loop.
        
        Treasurer’s Office coordinated with Lynsey Chaplik from Virtual to
        process the forms for Apache Corporate Credit Cards. Form was
        submitted and cards should be available soon.
        
        Virtual is trying to coordinate a call to deal with the following
        open action items:
        
          1. Closing all of the Wells Fargo accounts 
          2. Obtaining credit
             card statements from some of the
             officers to correctly account for the expenses
          3. Engaging both the CPA firm and Virtual for the 2014 990 
          4. Valuing the Bitcoin donation 
          5. 6 month P&L review to forecast
             the remaining 6 months of 2015
        
        Treasurer anticipates a call in the next month or so to address the
        items.
        
        At the request of the EVP, Virtual and the Treasurer’s Office
        provided a one slide summary of Treasurer categories of expenses

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       A malfunction in the computer program that prepares incoming documents for
       processing by the secretary has contributed to delays in handling ICLAs,
       CCLAs, and grants. Apologies to everyone whose documents have been delayed.
       The problem may have been resolved. Secretary is working through the backlog
       of approximately 55 documents.

       In October, 60 iclas, one ccla, and two grants were received and processed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        ApacheCon Europe ended a short time ago. The attendee reception
        is going on while this meeting is occurring. We had just shy of
        300 in attendance. People seem very pleased with the event so
        far (as of this writing).

        On Monday evening, we had a birthday cake for the 15th
        anniversary of the Foundation. On a personal note, I was sorry
        that more of you were not present for that.

        It's now time to start working on ApacheCon Austin. Discussions
        in Budapest have identified some things that we might try to
        increase PMC participation in that event. We're also trying to
        reach out to the earliest participants in the httpd project,
        since ApacheCon Austin will be held on the 20th anniversary of
        the first release of httpd. Brian Behlendorf has agreed to do a
        keynote with his thoughts about the past, but more about the
        future, of the Foundation. We are now looking for additional
        keynotes.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       I have been tasked to shepherd the discussion/research on our
       practices around contracting with service providers. There is
       nothing to report at this time, but progress will occur and be
       reported for the December report.

I'm keeping this month's report short...

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, tm-registrations@, and board@) and following-up with
appropriate personnel Fundraising/Virtual:
•	Work continues with Virtual re credit cards.  Application has been submitted

end of the month.  A special thank you to Lynsey from Virtual for her
assistance!
•	You can refer back to my previous board reports re renewals, if you’d like. 
Due to the lack of response, I’ve sent out the past-due and upcoming renewals,
which one company did not take kindly to.  Ross will elaborate, I’m sure.

received a proposal from Hot Wax Media yet.
•	Knowledge transfer has initiated between myself and Hadrian/Jim wrt to the
Fundraising activities.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

A request for licensing a project brand for a larger, long lived 
event is generating some discussion as to what level of policy 
compliance is desired for major events.  I expect we will resolve 
these next month, continuing similar to past agreements.

Our registration application for the HADOOP mark in Korea has been 
preliminarily refused by the examiner due to a pre-existing HADOOP 
registration for a similar software product; we will work with counsel
and the Hadoop PMC to see what impact this has.  Note that Korea is a 
"first-to-file" country, meaning whoever successfully *files* a 
trademark first typically secures rights to it.

Counsel confirms that we can legally delegate ability to provide project 
brand use permissions to PMCs and their VPs directly; however they also 
note that this may have risks - depending on how well PMCs manage this 
 - with our long-term ability to defend our brands.
 
 
-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Fundraising activities continued normally. See Melissa's report for more details.

We are on track with the renewal reminders. Hadrian and Melissa had a couple of 
brainstorming chats on the tools and processes to use. They will continue in the 
coming weeks after ACEU. Records show a $75k income from the Sponsorship  
Program since the last board meeting.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: HALO Worldwide has purchased an expanded set of pre-paid press
releases with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire at a locked-in, discounted rate for a
24-month timeframe (expires end of 2016). The payments will be due in January
2015 (for the 2014-2015 Fiscal Year) and July 2015 (for the 2015-2016 Fiscal
Year). Sally Khudairi will be submitting the invoices for payment through the
Whimsy application once received. She has also secured a 15% discount off any
additional releases we may need to issue during this timeframe should the
pre-paid set run out.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally continues to fine-tune the
"Powered by Apache" mark with select Apache projects that are updating their
logos. She has also forwarded an initial set of three designs created by
HotWax Media for a new homepage in celebration of the ASF's 15th Anniversary.
Seeing that there is significant feedback to incorporate, there's a chance
that this project may need to be pushed to launch in January. Sally has also
worked with ASF Chairman Brett Porter, President Ross Gardler, and Executive
Vice President Rich Bowen on blog posts to highlight the Foundation for its
anniversary.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe: 

- 5 November 2014 --The ASF @ 15 --Sponsorship and Stewardship-- The Apache
Software Foundation's Sponsors Help Bolster 15 Years of Open Source Innovation
and Community Leadership
- 29 October 2014 --The ASF @ 15 --Chairman's Statement-- The Apache Software
Foundation Marks 15 Years of Open Source Innovation and Community Leadership
- 22 October 2014 --Announcing Apache™ CloudStack™ v4.4.1
- 21 October 2014 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™ Tajo™
v0.9


IV. Informal Announcements: 11 items were tweeted on @TheASF. In addition,
Sally continues to publish a weekly "News Roundup" of all news sent to
announce@apache.org and announce@apachecon.com, and continues to promote
ApacheCon and any co-located events, such as Cassandra Days and the CloudStack
Collaboration Conference.

V. Future Announcements: Sally is working with Rich Bowen on the third and
final executive blog post for ASF @ 15, and is also preparing a 15-year
summary press release. She is also working with an upcoming announcement for
Apache CloudStack. Those PMCs wishing to announce major project news, as well
as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator, are welcome to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks'
notice for proper planning and execution. 

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 6 media requests, and will be
contributing content to BlackDuck's OSDelivers and RedHat's OpenSource.com
blogs. The ASF received 2,799 press clips over this time period, vs. last
month's clip count of 1,655. 

VII. Analyst Relations: Apache was mentioned in 31 write-ups by Gartner, 5
reports by Forrester, 1 write-up by GigaOM, 6 reports by 451 Research/Yankee
Group, and 6 reports by IDC. We are in the process of fact-checking an
upcoming vendor report by Forrester on private Cloud software.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally has worked on graphics revision for Melissa
Warnkin to produce the ASF's booth, signage, giveaways, etc. She is also
preparing a marketing & publicity year-in-review snapshot for the State of the
Feather presentation at ApacheCon Europe. In addition, she is coordinating
promotion opportunities with the Linux Foundation team.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: none at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we now have 36 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and continue to receive gratis news
release distribution by Pressat/UK.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========

Joe Schaefer has resigned from Infrastructure Committee (and root@)


Finances:
==========

$250 for AWS


Operations Action Items:
======================== 
none

Short Term Priorities:
======================

* Wiki outages - As highlighted in the October Infra report we have been
  running into issues with the MoinMoin wiki. This degradation is caused
  by severe disk IO load on the machine that hosts this service. This is
  complicated by the fact that this same machine also hosts the US web
  mirror for the foundation and projects as well as the mail-archives
  service. Additional fallout has been that publishing website updates
  has tremendous delays for websites on the US mirror. We think that much
  of the sudden IO load increase is due to the machines ZFS-filesystem
  growing to ~90%. Because of Copy-on-write nature of ZFS, and the
  allocation switches that happen when a volume begins approaching
  capacity, performances several degrades. We evaluated all of the
  services on the host, and our initial analysis was that we'd be best
  served by separating the web sites for projects and the foundation.
  During the course of doing that, we've discovered that a large number
  of projects were distributing artifacts and publishing their website
  using a long-deprecated (February 2012 deprecation) method. This, and
  other factors, have complicated the process, but today I am happy to
  report that we now have an easily replicable webserver definition in
  configuration management that allow us to easily deploy any number of
  webserver hosts in short order, and paid off a large amount of
  technical debt in the process, as well as having the newer members of
  our team understand well the entire website process from checkin to
  publication. This has dramatically improved the wiki situation, though
  it has revealed some underlying issues with the wiki that will need to be
  dealt with. 


Long Range Priorities:
======================

Monitoring
---------- 
While we continue to work on monitoring, and have far to go, this
month yielded two major improvments. The first in disk capacity alerting, and 
the other in failed array management. This is not yet pervasive in our
infrastructure, but is a start towards that end. 

Automation
---------- 
This month resulted in a large step forward as a number of services
are 
now able to be deployed in an automated fashion and in configuration 
management. Many of these have been in-process for a month or longer. 
to include the following services:
* committers mail-relay
* all project and Foundation websites
* rsyncd.apache.org (mirror distribution)
* host provisioning dashboard
* inbound email MXes

Resilience
---------- 
The work done around automation has given us our first critical
services that we can easily replicate and deploy multiple. To give you an idea
of scale we can deploy an external email exchanger, completely configured, in
less 
than 10 minutes, or all of the project websites in about 3 hours (largely 
bound by having to download all of the site content) 

Technical Debt
--------------

This month saw us paying back large portions of technical debt. Of particular 
interest is the shuttering of legacy means of publishing releases and websites
that were deprecated almost 3 years ago. We also were able to decouple a large
number of very tightly bound services. 

General Activity:
=================

It is worth noting that part of the new monitoring systems we have in place 
keep an eye on the status of internal disks and disk arrays. On the 30th 
October we were notified into our HipChat room that the machines that 
services as our svn master had a bad disk in its array. One contractor 
went to the datacenter to replace the disk with a spare from our inventory
whilst another contractor configured and onlined the disk, re-adding it to the
pool. A hardware issue being notified to being replaced and back online
 all in the same day.

Code Signing
------------ 
Two more releases were signed this month, both from Tomcat. 

Three additional projects (Logging (Chainsaw), OpenOffice, and OpenMeetings)
are now setup and enabled to sign artifacts, though most are still testing. 

Uptime Statistics:
================== 
Overall, uptime has seen an increase in 0.30% compared to
last month, putting uptime for the october-november period at a record high
99.82% overall. The total recorded uptime stats since we started measuring it
are as follows (weeks 27 through 46):

Type:                   Target:   Reality:   Target Met:

Tony Stevenson
  - Working on several major priorities: 
    - eos - The main US webserver has slowly over time grown it's disk
      capacity
      usage levels - most recently growing over the threshold at which ZFS 
      suffers from significant performance penalties.  Disk capacity cant
        easily
      be increased and eos is scheduled for EOL so the short term goal was to 
      tidy up the data on disk. This was acheived by moving some of the older 
      static data to eris. See work by others on the overall status of
        retiring
      eos. Also see below commentary on a wiki migration PoC.
    - abi - The host in Traci.net (FL) that we have been using for an offsite 
      copy of data for a number of years had suddently become increasingly 
      unusable and jobs were failing. This was primarily caused by a failure
        in
      removing old data snapshots. This essentially stemmed from the period
      when hermes had to be rebuilt. A lot of triaging of old copies of data 
      had to be done this was done in conjunction with others notably cml@
    - hermes - Fixed a long standing issue with a faulty disk on the dungeon
      master that hosts hermes. Also worked on better manaaging the incoming
      mail queue as on occasion it backlogs and has a compound effect on 
      genuine mail delivery. 
    - chaos (host where ELK is to be part-deployed) this work was delayed
      until
      AC EU giuven the more urgent issues on eos and abi.
    - MX - After the unsuccessful attempt to migrate the MXes to new hosts run
      from AWS EC2, several lessons have been learnt and we have fixed all but
      one of these at the time of writing this report.  The last fix is more 
      complicated and needs significant testing to sign off, and then we need 
      to expose this change to the mailing lists affected so that they are
        kepy
      in the loop, though we are aiming for a completely transparent cutover
      when we came to implement it.
  - As part of the bigger piece of work to unpick all the services on 
    (and dependant upon) eos I have started work on setting up a PoC that will
    host the moinmoin wiki service (wiki.apache.org) in AWS EC2. This is
      making
    good progress and a data synchronisation should begin during AC EU
      allowing
    the team to see it working during the F2F on the Saturday after AC EU.
  - More puppet work creating new and adding 3rd part modules further
    extending
    the puppet managed aspects of our machines. 
  - secretary@ workbench issues, this was seemingly related to a corrupt mbox
    file on minotaur. Moving this aside and having clr@ manually process the 
    period allowed us to re-enable the automatic service, allbeit at a much
    slower frequency than before.

Attachment B: Report from the Apache Ambari Project  [Yusaku Sako]

Apache Ambari simplifies provisioning, managing, and monitoring of Apache
Hadoop clusters.
Since the last report in Aug 2014, the community has been focused on the
1.7.0 release which will include resolution of more than 1500 JIRAs; a release
vote should be called within a week.
A major infrastructure improvement was made to set up automated Jenkins
jobs for running automated checks and unit tests on patches posted as well as
post-commit unit test runs that push results directly to relevant JIRAs;
this has helped the community to maintain a code base in which unit test
breakages are rare exceptions rather than the rule.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Clerezza Project  [Hasan Hasan]

DESCRIPTION
Apache Clerezza is an OSGi-based modular application and a set of components 
(bundles) for building RESTFul Semantic Web applications and services.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASE
Latest release (partial-release-20130710) was created on 10.07.2013
The typhandlerspace-feature is being released
TODO: Put it in http://apache.org/dist/clerezza/

ACTIVITY
Various improvements and bug fixes in source codes including:
- Added support for other text encodings beside UTF-8 for
Resultset message body writers (CLEREZZA-929)
- Made Triple Collections as services optional (CLEREZZA-939)
- Improved Virtuoso (rdf.virtuoso.storage) based storage provider
(CLEREZZA-930, CLEREZZA-936, CLEREZZA-945)
Noteworthy to mention is that Clerezza Virtuoso provider is running in
production as of Monday 3th november 2014 for the Dutch government.
Currently the Virtuoso database already contains around 14,000 graphs
rising by approx. 150 graphs a day.

- Discussion around the release process, the preferred version would have 
been a self service GIT solution for many small repos, The working solution 
was an update to the maven release plugin so that we can easily release 
single modules.

COMMUNITY
Latest change was addition of a new committer and PMC member on 16.08.2013

INFRASTRUCTURE
- Website: updated download page


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it is based
around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is very similar to Cocoon
2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and designed to be easily used with
Java code (= no frameworks required!). On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal
of becoming the best available platform for RESTful webservices and web
applications.

Issues needing board attention: nothing


Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2012/10/21 (change of PMC chair)

Community

Traffic on users and devs list had been lighter then the last quarter. Some
users asked about different issues in the different versions of cocoon.
Various devs attended the questions and provided solutions.

We had again problems with a jira spammer "ROY Assink" which open/comment/...
on issues with spam messages, different PMC member removed the comment and
reverted the doing.

Releases

2.1.10 has been released on 2013/03/20.


Development
 None


Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:

  We need to release a new version of cocoon 3 and cocoon 2.2 but still no
    committer has stepped up yet to do so.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich Stärk]

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects


Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

PMC changes
-----------

Jim Jagielski has been voted into the Community Development PMC on 2014-05-21.

Since artifacts produced by ComDev are usually documentation on our website which is writable for
all Apache committers, we usually do not add committers to the ComDev project.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

GSoC is over. Of the initial 42 students 36 passed the midterm evaluations and 35 passed the final
evaluations.

Uli and Suresh attended the mentor summit and will soon start discussion on some topics that came up
in talks with fellow mentors and students at the summit regarding project participation within
Apache (which is low), visibility of GSoC within Apache projects, and lack of response from projects
directly approached by students that wanted to participate in GSoC.

ComDev & Events
---------------

The ComDev PMC is now a "home" for some of the ConCom responsibilities. Most of the recent
discussions on our dev mailing list are about ApacheCon EU 2014.

Other
-----

Replacement for Apache extras is making progress with feedback coming mostly from the OpenOffice
community. It is unclear to us what the next steps to be taken are and who is responsible for
driving them. While historically responsiblity for Apache Extras was with ComDev it now seems to be
with VP Infra but this is unclear.

Invoices
--------

Once all travel costs are known we will approach fundraising and treasurer to invoice Google for
mentor stipends and travel reimbursement.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Gerhard Petracek]

Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
(Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
which are missing in the CDI core spec.

DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like
Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly,
Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also on
simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

Community
---------
* No new Committers (since May 2014)
* No new PMC Members (since May 2013)

We receive contributions from the community on a regular basis.

DeltaSpike won a "Duke's Choice Award".

We have received the first donations from the Red Hat
documentation team. The documentation was converted to
AsciiDoc and moved to our Git-Repository
(integrated with the Apache CMS).

Releases
--------
* DeltaSpike 1.0.2 (17/August/14)
* DeltaSpike 1.0.3 (21/September/14)

Attachment M: Report from the Apache DirectMemory Project  [Raffaele P. Guidi]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Francis De Brabandere]

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that
allows developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application
development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow
highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of
compile-time-safety and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

The project keeps getting attention from new users, although at a slow
rate. We also see a lot of value in the fact that Empire-DB is easily
extendible which allows users to adapt it to their needs without the
need for a new release.

Changes in committers or PMC members

There have been no changes in committers or PMC members during the last months.

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

Releases

No releases since last report.
Latest release was Apache-Empire-db 2.4.3 released on 20/Aug/2014

-----------------------------------------

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:

  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  No activity on the user mail list.

  On the dev mail list there was a plea for help from a person who we have
  seen in the past, seeking assistance with one of the more recent parts of
  Forrest, the Dispatcher. Those who know a bit about this did not help, so
  it fell to our Chair to attempt assistance. Along the way the poster
  encountered a semi-related issue which was never fully resolved. Thanks to
  his persistence and followup, it seems that this may now be fixed.

  The only other activity on the dev mail list was one PMC member attending
  to an alert from our Gump server.

  While researching the issue mentioned above, it came to my attention again
  that there are a number of ASF projects that utilise Forrest for their
  project websites, but are having some difficulties. Rather than seek our
  assistance, they rant on their project mail lists and issue trackers, which
  spreads misguided and ill-founded comments.

  I reckon that this behaviour has done incredible damage to our project.
  
  I do not have the inclination to address this, so will just refer to some
  past attempts:

  http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2009/board_minutes_2009_11_18.txt
  Sent email to all ASF Forrest-using projects.
  Explained how the Forrest project manages our own docs.
  Explained the Anakia output plugin, to export content to basic xml format.

  http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2010/board_minutes_2010_11_17.txt
  Announce Markdown output plugin.
  Announce FAQ regarding Java 6+.

  http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2012/board_minutes_2012_08_15.txt
  Reminder to Forrest-using projects about Markdown output.

  At this quarter, one other PMC member responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are just sufficient people hanging around for us
  to potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Idle. 3 people have indicated presence, so has barely sufficient oversight.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  Tidied SVN to fix problems with svn:ignore properties that had Windows
  line-endings.

  As part of the dev list assistance, fixed the projectInfo plugin to enable
  resources to be found on Windows machines when using the Dispatcher Plugin
  (part of FOR-1108, FOR-1188).

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and
persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key
value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The last release of Gora (0.5) was on 20th September, 2014.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Consistent and encouraging. We see most activity happening
on the dev@ list which is normal. Additionally since the 0.5
release we've seen a number of communities that depend on
Gora upgrade. We've seen a number of issues identified
in use of Gora downstream and reported back to us. This is 
encouraging meaning that more people are adopting the software.
Work is ongoing to have Gora implemented within Apache 
OODT as an object-to-datastore abstraction for the OODT
FileManager component.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Damien Raude-Morvan  was elected as PMC member and committer
on 2014-08-03 (yyyy-mm-dd).

How has the community developed since the last report?

We have recently seen users of Gora within the Apache Giraph
community coming to our user@ list. This follows upgrade of
the giraph-gora component to the new 0.5 release.

Mailing list members are as follows
user@:    from 64 --> 64
dev@:     from 74 --> 73
commits@  from 27 --> 25

Changes to PMC & Committers

Nothing to report

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Roman Shaposhnik]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and codebases
wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 34 podlings under incubation this month. No projects are 
currently voting on graduation. The incubator added HTrace and Taverna
as two new incubating project.

* Community

  New IPMC members:



  People who left the IPMC:



* New Podlings

  Ignite
  Taverna
  HTrace

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  Drill
  DeviceMap
  Falcon

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

  Apache Calcite 0.9.1 (incubating)
  Apache Flink 0.7.0-incubating

* IP Clearance

  FlatSpark for Apache Flex
  Sling Resource Editor contribution

* Legal / Trademarks

  None

* Infrastructure

  None

* Miscellaneous

  HDT is currently discussing retirement.
  ODF Toolkit discussed retirement, ultimately decided to remain active for now.
  NPanday seems to have begun struggling once again. It is likely that IPMC will 
  recommend considering a retirement option.
  Ripple is struggling to build community and recently discussed whether it ought 
  to retire or not. Ross Gardler volunteered to step up as a Ripple mentor and
  report back on the path forward in six months. An additional issue with Ripple's
  Node.js-based artifacts is the lack of clear indication that they are coming
  from an incubating project and NOT a TLP. Ross is looking into fixing that as well.
  Slider's report didn't have a mentor sign off.

set of useful extensions for this specification.

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase the community
  2. Improve our documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 No, activity is somewhat low recently, but that is due most of the 
 involved people are also active in other ASF projects which needed
 some attention lately.


How has the community developed since the last report?
We got a few patches from both IBMers and 'new' community members.


How has the project developed since the last report?
BatchEE already gets used in real world projects. 
It is now also part of Apache TomEE-2.0 which will target
JavaEE-7 as soon as we get the JavaEE TCK. 
Please note that the TCK issue doesn't affect BatchEE as 
the JSR-352 spec and TCK are licensed under ALv2 (txs IBM!).

to target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer
or ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target repositories
that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then, there
have been eight major releases, including a 1.7 release on August 24, 2014, and a
point release 1.7.1 on September 22, 2014.  The next major release is scheduled for
December 31, 2014.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Alessandro Benedetti (abenedetti), on
October 10, 2014.


Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been very active, with a wide range of topics.  Most of our connectors
now have significant use cases and constituencies, and the connector family
continues to grow.  Dev list comments for this period centered around ManifoldCF 2.0
development, and backwards compatibility issues, as well as voting for the major 1.7
release.  There were plenty of people looking for integration advice as well.

Committer and external contributions have been significant this cycle.  I am unaware
of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

None known.

Branding
========

We have reviewed the site branding guidelines and believe we are now compliant with
these, with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  Hopefully we will be able to correct this issue
soon.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012 and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.

We successfully accomplish our first Google Summer of Code project
(Implementation of the LDP service for Apache Marmotta based on 
SPARQL 1.1, MARMOTTA-444). Unfortunately after the end of the program 
we have not managed to keep the student working and maintaining the 
alternative implementation his project provided.

Linked Data Platform 1.0 is moving to W3C Last Call, and Apache Marmotta
continues activelly contributing to the technology providing one of the 
reference implementations: http://s.apache.org/4RN

Apache Marmotta was presented in a half-day tutorial at the ISWC 2014. The 25
participants were introduced into "Marmotta as a linked data server", the LDP
1.0 implementation and SPARQL-MM extensions. http://s.apache.org/glR

Sept and Oct have been two very busy months on the users mailing list, with
questions about documentation but also bug-reports. We are trying to migrate
candidates to the dev-list for contributions and as candidates to grow the
community.

Subscribers to the projects mailing list:
    dev@marmotta.a.o: 73 subscribers (-3 since last report, 2014-08)

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

DESCRIPTION

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard.

A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014. We have extended the
coverage for the IETF JOSE specifications (that is strictly correlated to
OAuth 2) as JWS
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-36). The
current intention is to extend the coverage to the JWE part. 
Users activity is growing slowly but steadily (the user@ mailing list has got
new messages from new users). We got some feedback from some users about our
not too clear documentation.

Hence we are planning to improve this area.

COMMUNITY

PMC composition has not changed since graduation We have voted one new
committer since graduation (3rd March 2013)

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Qpid Project  [Gordon Sim]

Apache Qpid™ is a project focused on creating software based on the
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), currently providing a
protocol engine library, message brokers written in C++ and Java,
client libraries for C++, Java (including JMS), .Net, Python, Perl and
Ruby and a message 'router'.

* Releases:

Qpid 0.30 was released on 26th September 2014. Qpid Proton 0.8 was
released on 6th November 2014.

The most recent release of Qpid Dispatch Router, 0.2, was on 14th
April 2014.

* Community:

The main developer and user lists continue to be active. JIRAs are
being raised and addressed.

Tim Bish (already a committer on the ActiveMQ project) became a
committer on the Qpid project on 15th September. Božo Dragojevic
became a committer on 16th September 2014.

There were no new additions to the PMC since the last report. The last
addition to the PMC was Fraser Adams who joined on 6th March, 2014.

* Development

- CVE-2014-3629 was reported, a fix was made available and an
  announcement made

- The new AMQP 1.0 compliant JMS client work is going well. Tim Bish
  and Robbie Gemmell have combined efforts on this.

- For greater clarity, we changed our process a little for the 0.30
  Qpid release. This comprises several different components, though
  they all share the same svn tree at present. Where previously we had
  voted for the release as a whole, we now vote separately on each
  individual components sources, to ensure that every component that
  gets released has been sufficiently verified.

* Issues:

The Qpid PMC has voted[1] to change the Chair. See the resolution
submitted for the board's approval in 7A above.

users and to community involvement. Patricia Shanahan plans to follow 
up on this, and will report further next quarter.

ACTIVITY

There has been limited activity this quarter due to work and personal 
commitments. Some timing-dependent bugs have been fixed. Another test 
failure may be due to inappropriate test conditions.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

The Apache Santuario project is aimed at providing implementation of
security standards for XML.

There was one new release of the Apache XML Security for Java project over the
last quarter, 2.0.2. This was a minor release that fixes a couple of bugs with
the streaming XML security code introduced in 2.0.0, and contains a few
dependency upgrades. 

There were 21 commits to the trunk branch of the Java project in the last
quarter - so fairly quiet, but issues continue to be logged + fixed. There
are no issues or concerns to report to the board.

Last committer addition: Marc Giger, July 2012.
Last PMC addition: Marc Giger, April 2013.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other relevant
spatial needs.

Development: Completed developer guide translation from French to English. The
developer guide itself is still incomplete, but at least the versions in the
two languages now have the same content.

Completed the upgrade of metadata classes from ISO 19115:2003 to ISO
19115:2014

Code on branches break backward compatibility in some areas where the standard
changed in an incompatible way.

Code on trunk is backward compatible, but this forced us to sacrifice some
features from the new standards. Those new features are available on the
branches and will be merged to trunk at a moment not yet determined.

New contributor (Marc Le Bihan) started a refactoring of the “Shapefile”
reader as a partial JDBC implementation.

Marc Le Bihan added the ticket “DBase 3 - JDBC : Simple WHERE CLAUSE and
Integer, Double field  support” [1]

Community: 
Added Marc Le Bihan to PMC

Branding:
Preparing a talk for the next Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) meeting about
ISO 19115  upgrade applied to GeoAPI, with Apache SIS to be cited as a proof
of  concept.

Issues: 
None

Releases:
Targeting a release around December 10th. Waiting for the OGC meeting before
the release give  us a chance to perform last minute fixes if discussion with
other OGC members show that we  got some aspects wrong in our ISO 19115:2014
work.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, and Python as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status: 

This has been an eventful three months for Spark. Some major happenings are:

- We posted our 1.1.0 release in September, with contributions from 171
  developers (our largest number yet). Major features were performance and
  scalability optimizations, JSON import and schema inference in Spark SQL,
  feature extraction and statistics libraries, and a JDBC server.

- We recently cut a release branch and started QA for Spark 1.2.0, which
  is targeted for release in December.

- Apache Spark won this year's large-scale sort benchmark
  (http://sortbenchmark.org/), sorting 100 TB of data 3x faster than the
  previous record. It tied with a MapReduce-like system optimized for sorting.

- The community voted to implement a maintainer model for reviewing some
  modules, where changes in architecture and API should be reviewed by a
  maintainer before a merge (http://s.apache.org/Dqz). There was concern
  from some external commenters (Greg Stein, Arun Murthy, Vinod Vavilapalli)
  that this reduces the power of each PMC member (requiring a review from a
  specific set of people); we are looking to test how this works and possibly
  tweak the model.

Releases: 

Our last few releases were: 

September 11, 2014: Spark 1.1.0
August 5, 2014: Spark 1.0.2 
July 23, 2014: Spark 0.9.2 
July 11, 2014: Spark 1.0.1 

Committers and PMC: 

The last committers and PMC members were added August 12, 2014
(Joseph Gonzalez and Andrew Or).

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community has been working through some issues on features to be
  included (or not) in the upcoming 1.9 release. It has been
  difficult, and tensions have risen, but it appears the impasse has
  been resolved and focus on a release can resume.
  
  Regarding the above, it should be noted that the VP (Greg) declared
  a past veto as closed/not-applicable, with the intent of moving the
  community forward, and repairing the discussion/dynamic. The PMC
  members involved seem to alright with that decision, and certainly
  retain their rights/desires to reinstate a veto upon the changes and
  features, should they find them suspect for a release.

  Our last PMC addition was February 2014, and our last (non-PMC)
  committer was added in July 2013.

* Releases

  No releases have been made since our report in August.
  
  Current releases are:

Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in
enterprise environments, implemented in JEE technology.

Status

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.


Community

The mailing lists' traffic is again on rise, mainly because of recent release of
new major version 1.2.0; also the number of subscribers to user@ and dev@ has
slightly increased if compared to last quarter.

New and coming users are asking for support and reporting bugs; in some cases
patches are also provided, fact that can constitute ground for discussion about
inviting new committers.

We are currently in the process of fixing the bugs identified for 1.2.0,
planning the next maintenance release 1.2.1.

No actual plan has been made yet about next major release, except for some
sporadic discussions.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

Major news includes the conversion of the project from svn to git.
Motivation includes the number of pull requests has grown and forks of
the git mirror in Github are up to nearly 200.  Most of the "new
blood" showing up on the are more comfortable with git.  With new
faces arriving more and more frequently, we're hoping this helps them
contribute and helps us track and incorporate those contributions.
Time to start having some talks about adding contributors.

The project was given a Duke's Choice award from Oracle this JavaOne
and a Geek Choice award from ZeroTurnaround.  The growing popularity
is a strong contributing factor for the new faces.

Apache TomEE 1.7.1 was released this September and is a maintenance
release for the Java EE 6 codebase.  Work on Java EE 7 in TomEE 2.0
continues moving forward.  Hope of getting a Java EE 7 TCK still
remains.

Last release was 1.7.1 on 2014-09-15.  Last committer was added
November 2013.  Last PMC addition was 2010-08-26.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]
The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

The Xalan project will have a representative at ApacheCon EU 2014.

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can upgrade the project to address the newer XPath and XSLT standards.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature product.  There is little development activity other
than patch maintenance.

Discussion continues on how to implement XSLT 2 specifications in
the Java subproject.  Patch maintenance is still being done.

Quality assurance builds for the Xalan-C project are currently stalled.
We plan to pursue the build efforts after the ApacheCon EU 2014.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

Moving the original XML parent project to the Attic has caused some
frustration on the mailing lists, but these have mostly been overcome.
We still get messages posted to the old XML project with Xalan 
as subprojects.  Moderating these messages has helped.

Documentation links in the Xalan and subproject website pages are
corrected as the problems and issues become known.  There is still
some effort being made to have the web pages made easier to maintain.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

A potential security issue was reported to the PMC in early
November. It appears that it may have already been fixed and
are seeking confirmation from the reporter.

A couple defects were fixed in the XML Schema implementation.
Otherwise it has been relatively quiet.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 90 posts on the
j-dev and j-users lists since the beginning of August 2014.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

It has been a quiet three months with no development activity.

Mailing list traffic has been very low; roughly 35 posts on the
c-dev and c-users lists since the beginning of August 2014.

There was no news on the anticipated 3.2 release or discussion
of it this quarter. The latest release is Xerces-C 3.1.1
(April 27th, 2010).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development
activity over the reporting period.

XML Commons

Responded to a question regarding XML Commons artifacts on Maven
Central. No other activity over the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

No new committers in the last quarter. The most recent committers
were elected in July 2008 (Xerces-C) and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

No new PMC members in the last quarter. The last two additions to
the PMC were in May 2010.

Two committers (who are also PMC members) committed changes to
SVN in the last quarter.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache XML Graphics Project  [Chris Bowditch]

The Apache XML Graphics Project is responsible for software intended for 
the creation & maintenance of the conversion of XML formats to graphical
output & related software components. 

== Issues for the Board ==
No issues at present. 

== Community ==
Last new committer: Simon Steiner on 2014/04/11 
Last new PMC member: Luis Bernardo on 2013/03/04 

== XML GRAPHICS COMMONS ==
23 separate commits to SVN, most of which were related to the release,
but 2 were for general bug fixes. 

There was 1 release this quarter; Version 2.0 
The latest release is 2.0 (3 October 2014) 

== FOP ==
61 separate commits to SVN. This is a mixture of feature development;
Complex Script support in SVG and bug fixes. Luis Bernardo also created
a branch for a prototype implementation of fo:float. The next release is
currently dependent on the PDFBox v2.0 release. I note from PDFBox's
October Report this has been deferred, so we may need to try and refactor
our code to use the 1.8.x branch instead. The PMC still needs to discuss
this and decide. 

The FOP User list has a slow but steady stream of questions being raised
and answered; 90 e-mails in total. The FOP Team invested some time to
switch from using GUMP to the Apache Jenkins buildbot for continuous
integration. 

There were no releases this quarter 
The latest release is 1.1 (20 October 2012) 

== BATIK ==
23 separate commits to SVN. Some of these were related to the release, but
some are due to the development of Complex Script Support in SVG. We have
also been working towards a release. We ran the test suite and discovered a
large percentage of the tests are failing, so we are currently reviewing
the failures and trying to resolve them before we do the release. 

There were no releases this quarter. 
The latest version is 1.7 (6 January 2008)
