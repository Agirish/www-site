 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       I sent a notice to members, advising them that the Annual Members
       Meeting will be on May 27, and calling for nominations of new members
       and nominations for the 2014-15 board. This was sent via the members
       mailing list, with a separate notice sent to those members who are not
       subscribed to it.

       At the time of writing, we don't have a 2014-15 budget to approve for
       this meeting, so I've requested an update from Ross.

       ApacheCon recently completed, and while I wasn't able to attend, it
       sounds as if the event went well and was of great benefit. Many thanks
       to those who volunteered time to make it happen, and all the members
       of our community that participated!


       Jim volunteered to set up the voting tool for the Members'
       meeting.

    B. President [Ross]

       An eventful month...
       
       ApacheCon was a big success. I spoke to a number of conference 
       sponsors all were satisfied many were very happy. I spoke to many 
       attendees, some new, some old. The new faces were content, the old
       were pleased to see an ApacheCon with no burned out volunteers 
       tearing their hair out. Please see the EVP report for full details
       and join me in thanking Rich Bowen and his supporting team for a
       job well done.
       
       Upayavira and I met with the only ASF sponsor present at
       ApacheCon and discussed how we might better engage them. There were
       a number of suggestions but they mostly hinged around visibility into
       the foundations activities so that there is concrete information to 
       communicate internally to those signing off on the sponsorship budget,
       Upayavira has undertaken to hold quarterly conference calls with gold 
       and platinum sponsors during which he will present some basic metrics 
       on how the foundation is doing, raise any highlights, and invite
       questions. I will work with Upayavira, Melissa and appropriate VPs to
       gather this data (e.g. incubating projects, accounts, committers). It 
       is intended that the data will be compiled into an annual report for 
       broader circulation in one years time (to coincide with the 2015 
       members meeting). It is my belief that at least one director should
       be present at each of these calls along with either myself or the
       EVP.
       
       A second sponsor request was to have more visibility at open source 
       events for the ASF. Both in the form of booth presence (Melissa is
       willing and able to assist with this) and in the form of speakers
       representing the ASF. At this time I have no plan to deliver on this
       request. In the past the board (and I) have questioned the value of
       this work. This is an item that will be discussed with other sponsors
       in the coming months.
       
       There has been an important step in the audit process with agreement
       to request a contract from Virtual to manage the process. This is good
       to see. Thanks to the audit team for unblocking this.

       The EVP and two directors (Shane and Jim) met with representatives of 
       the CloudStack PMC to discuss specific infrastructure, marketing and 
       sponsorship needs that the PMC feels are not currently addressed by the
       ASF. At this time the requests are quite general in nature and thus we
       spent some time explaining why it is important for the PMC need to raise 
       specific concerns with the appropriate Committees and Officers. To date 
       the PMC has reached out formally to infrastructure and marketing and 
       informally (at ApacheCon) to fundraising. It is my belief that the PMC 
       is approaching these issues in an extremely constructive way and I 
       commend them for their efforts. I also wish to note that, at least in the
       general sense, these concerns are not unique to CloudStack. It is my
       belief that the CloudStack PMC genuinely wants to find a solution that
       preserves the Apache Way and I encourage the board to work with the PMC
       to find appropriate solutions as specific issues are identified.
              
       Melissa spent much of this month coordinating the last aspects of 
       ApacheCon and TAC, including staffing the booth at the event itself.
       There has been the usual work on the fundraising support activities.
       Now that ApacheCon is over and there is a lull before the real work
       for ApacheCon EU begins I am hoping that Melissa will be able to turn
       her attention to assisting the treasurer with the contract negotiations
       with Virtual and with documenting the existing practices. I plan to
       discuss new priorities with her and Rich (as EVP) in our regular meeting
       on Thur 17th April.
       
       We do not have a TAC report this month. However, I can report that I met
       a number of the TAC recipients at ApacheCon. They were all very grateful
       for the opportunity presented by the programme and extended their thanks
       to the foundation and TAC members specifically.
       
       Infrastructure was represented at ApacheCon by Joe and Daniel, with Sam
       being present for the first day. This, coupled with the fact that our
       two other contractors were otherwise engaged for the same period,
       resulted in a potentially incomplete coverage of our infrastructure
       needs. This was an unusual set of circumstances that all collided on a
       specific time period. This situation is unlikely to occur again.
       However, we should perhaps consider simple measures to flag such
       situations in the future.
       
       Shane was very active in ApacheCon discussions relating to directed
       sponsorships and their potential impact on our brand management. Shane
       continues to be engaged in those discussions on various mailing lists. 
       
       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.
              

    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       The Treasurer's Office has reviewed a proposal from Virtual, Inc
       to provide financial contracting services at the ASF. After a
       favorable initial review, the Office asked for broader feedback
       from the ASF board.  7 of the 9 directors and the ASF President
       replied back and all were favorable of the proposal and the potential
       for Virtual to help  provide their services to help the financial
       mission of the ASF.

       Based on the above feedback, the Treasurer's Office is recommending
       that we hire Virtual. I propose that Sam and I have a telecon with
       Sheila, their Business manager and request a draft services
       contract for review.

       The EA requested some financial reports on her income and the request
       was fulfilled by the Treasurer's Office.

       An ASF member covered the on-site expenses for ApacheCon NA 2014,
       and will be reimbursed when his request arrives and is approved by
       the President or EVP as soon as possible.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The office of secretary continues to run smoothly. 
       March was another slow month for documents.   45 iclas, five cclas,
       and one grant were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       ApacheCon North America 2014 was held April 7-9 in Denver,
       Colorado, USA. Despite the very late start, we had higher
       attendance than last year, and almost everyone that I have spoken
       with has declared it an enormous success. Attendees, speakers and
       sponsors have all expressed approval of the job that Angela and
       the Linux Foundation did in the production of the event. Speaking
       personally, it was the most stress-free ApacheCon I have ever
       had.

       Although I hope to have more detailed statistics prior to the
       board meeting, at the moment the attendee numbers are:

       Registered: 419
       No-shows: 36
       Speakers: 100ish
       Committers: 100ish

       We're still gathering feedback from speakers and attendees, and
       should have the results of that survey by the next board meeting.
       This feedback will inform any changes we make for future events.
        
       On the first day of the event, we announced 
       ApacheCon Europe, which will be held November 17-21 2014 in Budapest.
       The website for that is up at http://apachecon.eu/ and the CFP is
       open, and will close June 25, 2014. We plan to announce the schedule 
       on July 28, 2014, giving us nearly 4 months lead time before the
       conference. We have already received talk submissions, and a few
       conference registrations. I will try to provide statistics each 
       month between now and the conference.

       As with ApacheCon NA, there will be a CloudStack Collaboration
       Conference co-located with ApacheCon. We are also discussing the
       possibility of a co-located Apache OpenOffice user-focused event
       on the 20th and 21st, or possibly just one day.

       We eagerly welcome proposals from other projects which wish to
       have similar co-located events, or other more developer- or
       PMC-focused events like the Traffic Server Summit, which was held
       in Denver. I will begin pursuing project-specific and
       topic-specific tracks in a few weeks once I've gotten caught up
       on everything else.

       Discussion has begun regarding a venue for ApacheCon North
       America 2015, with Austin and Las Vegas early favorites, but
       several other cities being considered. We hope to have an
       announcement by early summer, so that this can get into the
       planning budgets of possible attendees.

 8. Discussion Items
        * Directed sponsorship
    
    Ross reviewed a small number of concerns with directed sponsorship:
      accounting overhead; somewhat less of an issue assuming we contract out
        some accounting tasks
      neutrality of PMC; mitigated if the PMC is very diverse and sponsors
        similarly diverse
    
    Ross mentioned that there are no specific proposals at the moment
    
    Ross proposed thinking about these four categories of items that could use
    directed sponsors:
    1. Items that don't cost much and are broadly applicable to many projects
    2. Items that don't cost much but apply to only a few projects
    3. Items that have high cost and apply to only a few projects
      directed sponsorships would mostly apply here
      would need to be managed closely by pmc
    4. Items that have high cost and are broadly applicable to many projects
    
    Ross suggested his thinking for category 4 above:
      Perhaps we should look at outside organizations to support some of
      these, e.g. Linux Foundation
    
    Shane: We should provide higher level of services for our projects, using
    either inside or outside funding
      We can do this more easily with pmcs that know what they need
    
    Roy: we're ahead of ourselves with regard to accounting overhead issues
    since we do not yet have help
      Don't see a need to break out into four categories
      Prefer to think about categories: 
        1. pmc can do by themselves; 
        2. pmc needs help with e.g. publicity
      If need is identified, projects could identify people to work directly
      with marketing/publicity 
    
    Ross: No problem with this approach for marketing/publicity
      The bigger issue is with infrastructure; maintaining different systems
      for many projects Infrastructure is not set up to provide much more than
      what they currently do
    
    Roy: Running infra at this level would need major increase in budget and
      support system
    
    Chris: Is the open office special fund relevant? 
      The project has some money earmarked for travel assistance
    
    Ross: This was a special case; OO project had this money before joining
    apache
      No additional funding is being accepted but can only spend based on the
      original intent of the donation
    
    Ross: I will continue to work with cloudstack on concrete proposals for
    infrastructure and marketing
      I will put together a broader plan for identifying ASF wide policies for
      board approval
      These policies will be informed by the ongoing discussions in various
      locations of the ASF
    
    Roy: If pmc really wants to market they can set up groups inside the project
      As long as pmc is deciding what to work on, they have the ability to do it
      Also, projects can ask for additional resources in marketing
    
    Ross: Prospective sponsors have asked for accountability for donations
    
    Chip: The Cloudstack project is looking for diversity of sponsors to help
      with infrastructure and marketing
    
      

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Roy: Update the guidance for releases to forbid shipping binary
           dependencies within a source package unless their source is also
           included (see board_minutes_2012_04_18.txt) and communicate to
           committers.
          Status: still not done

    * Greg: discuss "extras" issue with OpenOffice PMC and see if there is
            anything to be done at the "ASF level"
          Status:

    * Chris: follow up on bringing on new committers and PMC members to DB
          Status:

    * Brett: follow up with Click regarding the Attic or rebooting
          Status: followed up

    * Brett: Remind PMCs to check their committee records
          Status: not quite, sorry

    * Greg: ask about "pending discussion by the PMC" by JMeter
          Status:

    * Chris: follow up with Empire-db about steps to bringing on new blood
          Status:

    * Sam: Discuss with ComDev the vouching process. If ComDev decides to
           vouch for other  organizations, the decision should be made
           public. This might raise questions from others  about how to
           qualify for vouching and the ComDev PMC should be prepared to
           discuss criteria  that they use.
          Status: In progress.  Current status: http://s.apache.org/ubj

    * Bertrand: pursue a report for Cordova
          Status: Report present

    * Jim: pursue a report for Creadur
          Status: done

    * Shane: ask Curator if there a plan to attract new committers/PMC members?
          Status:

    * Doug: discuss bringing in new PMC members with OFBiz
          Status: not done

    * Jim: discuss service hosting issue (licensing, trademark, etc.) with
           SpamAssassin PMC.
          Status: not yet done (apologies)

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, and board@) and following-up with appropriate personnel

    ApacheCon:  90% (includes TAC)

        Very busy month; progressing well - Rich will provide more information
        Placed orders for this year's giveaways and shipped to the venue
        Shipped the Apache booth material to the venue
        Finalized the booth logistics with the venue
        Staffed the booth at ApacheCon and the Cloudstack Collaboration
          Conference
        Assisted with getting the BarCamp organized and set-up
        It was a very successful week, with 100% positive feedback from
          everyone that I spoke with

    TAC:

        Continued to work with the TAC applicants to answer all their
          inquiries prior to arriving in Denver, as well as on-site
        Followed through with the direct bill application to the Westin for
          the TAC'ers and staff lodging with the Westin’s Accounting rep.

    Fundraising:  10%

        Continuing to follow-up on renewals sent out
        Monitoring and preparing invoices for upcoming renewals
        Sam and Chris will work with Wells Fargo to add me to the account for
          “read access” so that I can monitor the incoming payments and
          follow-up on the past-due renewals more efficiently and effectively.
        Sent out invoices for the sponsors due for renewal
        Met with Upayavira at ACNA to discuss fundraising activities and
          processes in which to improve upon


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* Operations

trademarks@ volume and variety of questions continues to be
heavy.  In particular we have a number of new requests to make Apache
branded swag.

A key need is a way to ensure that our own /marks/list listings
of Apache marks is kept updated and includes sufficient information
to provide to third parties reviewing our trademark policies.  While
Ross has suggested tasking EA to begin this as a manual process (by
reading board graduation votes), an automated one that takes into
account future product releases is needed.  If we can't attract
volunteers for this kind of task, will work with president@ to find
appropriate infrastructure work to complete.

* ApacheCon / CloudStackCollab

I gave three presentations about Apache branding at both
conferences last week, to moderate audiences but with very good
feedback from attendees.  Posted on the conference site and:

  http://www.slideshare.net/shanecurcuru

It was clear both from hallway/after hours conversations and from
specific feedback on my talks that more education is needed, both for
PMCs (to best protect our brands) and for vendors who commonly engage
with Apache projects (to ensure they understand that Apache product
names are our trademarks, for example).

Recorded a podcast about Apache branding activities at ApacheCon:

  http://community.redhat.com/blog/2014/04/upstream-podcast-4/

Similarly, I had a number of conversations with the CloudStack
PMC about their desires for getting better support for branding and
marketing (and infra) activities; the result of which can be seen in
their monthly board report and emails to press@ / infra@

Met with Linux Foundation (LF) staff about ApacheCon and other
conference branding.  IMO branding at these conferences was great. 
LF is already producing the upcoming MesosCon, so we will need to
work on ensuring an improved event approval process to work with LF
events for our many Apache projects.

* Registrations

Registration of APACHE has succeeded in Switzerland!  While we
have made several registrations, this one has finished it's process,
mostly merely because of the timing of the paperwork.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Fundraising continues to move along. We are on top of sponsorship
renewals, with one platinum still up for discussion, but others in
reaching the PO stage.

Useful discussions were had at ApacheCon, both with those sponsors that
were present, and with the Linux Foundation. Ross has been asking "what
do we offer our high value sponsors?" The idea arose, that I propose to
follow through on, to offer quarterly conference calls with gold and
platinum sponsors. At these calls we will present some basic metrics on
how the foundation is doing, raise any highlights, and ask whether our
sponsors have any questions they wish to raise, either in public or in
private. Other than renewals, this will be the mainstay of our
relationship management.

There were significant discussions at ApacheCon about targeted
donations, which have been mentioned elsewhere. I continue to follow
these discussions, but have yet to form a clear opinion.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain on schedule and under budget. All vendor payments have
been processed on time with ongoing thanks to the Treasurer and Operations
teams.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned. Sally
Khudairi continues Sponsor renewal and general outreach activities with
Platinum-level Sponsors. The discussion regarding project-specific
marketing/promotional support that had begun in October continues, and Sally
is working with interested third parties as well as VP Brand Management where
needed. This issue has gained additional interest at ApacheCon, and Sally has
been asked by a TLP to to help develop a strategic marketing plan to help
bring visibility to the project.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org:

 - 08 April 2014: The Apache Software Foundation Announces the 5th
   Anniversary of Apache™ Cassandra™

tweeted 91 newsworthy items in advance and during the event. No new posts
were made on "TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: we're preparing to announce a project milestone this
week, as well as a ComDev-momentum update. PMCs wishing to announce major
project news, as well as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator, are
welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly
provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 17 media requests. The ASF received
2,259 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count of
3,030.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst queries, with interest in
future updates on several projects. Apache was mentioned in 13 reports by
Gartner, 6 reports by Forrester, 7 write-ups by GigaOM, 11 reports by Yankee
Group, 5 reports by IDC, and 6 write-ups by 451 Research. In addition, Chris
Mattmann will be featured on an upcoming episode of "Technology for Good",
run by GreenMonk, RedMonk's sustainability-focused division.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally successfully worked with the ApacheCon
producer, with particular focus on communications and sponsor outreach, as
well as handled some short-notice PR requests for the CloudStack
Communication Conference. Special thanks to Melissa Warnkin for running the
ASF promotional activities during the event.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally continues liaison
with a small handful of events that are requesting the ASF's presence as
speakers/presenters/sponsors/*, and is coordinating with Melissa on our
presence at OSCON.

X. Newswire accounts: we have renewed our pre-paid press release agreement
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire, and have 17 in our account through the end of the
calendar year. We have used all our remaining pre-paid press releases on the
PRNewswire account and will not be renewing the pre-paid press release
distribution via PR Newswire at this time, but will revisit our needs midway
through the upcoming fiscal year. We continue to receive gratis news release
distribution by Pressat (UK) with no pre-established termination timeframe.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

New Karma:
==========


Finances:
==========
No purchases/renewals for the month since last report.

Operations Action Items:
========================


Short Term Priorities:
======================

* Look into mac build slaves.

* Converge on git.apache.org migration to eris. (Step 1 is merge git ->
  git-wip on tyr) (opinions?)

* Investigate / negotiate external code-signing capability, currently in talks
  under NDA. INFRA-3991 is tracking the status, and a Webex call has taken
  place.

* Complete nagios-to-circonus migration for monitoring.

* Continue to experiment with weekly team meetings via google hangout.

* Explore the possibility of revamping the infra documents to have a more 
  intuitive feel about them, improve readability.

* Confluence Upgrade. Upgrade from 5.0.3 to latest. Hopefully will be less
  painful this time around. 
  (Support case closed, nothing useful came from it other than check the logs.)

* Port tlp creation scripts over to new json-based design on whimsy.


Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Choose a suitable technology for continued buildout of our virtual
  hosting infra.  Right now we are on VMWare but it no longer is gratis
  software for the ASF.

* Continue gradually replacing gear we no longer have any hardware warranty
  support for.

* Formulate an effective process and surrounding policy documentation for
  fulfilling the DMCA safe harbor provisions as they relate to Apache services.

* Institute egress filtering on all mission-critical service hosts.


General Activity:
=================

* New 3-year wildcard SSL cert purchased and installed for *.openoffice

* Thrift migrated to CMS with the aim of providing better support for similar
  sites.  Blog entry here:

      http://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/scaling_down_the_cms_to

* The number of confluence administrators was significantly reduced, this was
  to try and keep the list as small as possible.  Historically this permission
  level was required to operate and manage the autoexport plugin which has 
  since been deprecated. see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-7487
  
* An inter-project communication site was requested by the community at
  ApacheCon and is being looked into by infra. This will essentially be an
  aggregator of project development wishes/requests, and will most likely
  reside on wishlist.a.o.
  
* As a way of lowering the bar for and securing security reports, infra is
  looking into creating a system which, based on LDAP, accepts and encrypts
  security reports for projects. The exact setup and nature of this system is
  being discussed, primarily with members of the subversion PMC.

* Heartbleed happened: see
  https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/heartbleed_fallout_for_apache

* Two members of the infrastructure team attended Apachecon NA 2014 and had a
  few community sessions with committers to hear their concerns and attempt to
  address them.  Also met with Cloudstack members to discuss their widely
  publicized proposal for additional infrastructure needs surrounding project
  builds.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

Due to a new pluggable transparent mechanism allowing users to store
certain columns in RDBMS in an encrypted form, Apache Cayenne was
required to classify themselves in order to compliant with US export
regulations.  Unfortunately, the ASF crypto page has been "outdated"
for awhile concerning the new process; I advised them to continue with
the old process but I will work on updating the page to reflect the
current required (and hopefully more streamlined) process.

There was a long, but useful thread regarding the iCLA and its applicability
with non-copyrighted material (usually since the creator is a US government
employee). The end-result is the general consensus that this is a non-
issue.

JIRA questions are being handled in a timely fashion.

No open issues requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds
arriving at security@ in March. These continue to be dealt with by

of commits per month.

Testing is still ongoing for 1.6.0 and we have not begun voting on its
release yet.

Community
Sean Busbey was added as a committer and PMC member on 1/09/2014.

Over recent months we have engaged in much discussion regarding
codifying our bylaws, which has resulted in [1].  The initial version has
been approved by vote [2].  Since there was majority, but not resounding
approval, we are in the process of making clarifications and adjustments.
It is largely a recording of our previously accepted practices, with a
few exceptions, one of which is that we have added some structure around
release planning that we hope will tighten our release process for major
releases.

Also, we look forward to the first ever Accumulo Summit on June 12th [3].

-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]

Apache Airavata is a software framework to construct, execute, and manage 
long running applications and workflows on distributed computing resources.

== Releases ==

No releases were made during this reporting period. The community is working 
towards version 0.12 which got delayed due to major refactoring in integrating
with Apache Thrift for public API’s and internal component CPI interfaces. 
The latest Apache Airavata version (0.11) was released on January 1st 2014. 

== Activity ==

The mailing list, jira and commit activity remains very high.

== Community ==

Airavata has successfully engaged Google Summer of Code students in previous 
years and continuing to be attractive this year as well. 5 students have 
submitted proposals which are currently in review. In addition, the PMC 
has voted on a new architecture mailing which has worked out well. There is
a sudden increase of volunteers who are actively taking part in architecture 
discussions. These volunteers previously had trouble to keep up with dev list
traffic. We hope to recruit few of these active contributors into the PMC.  

== Committer/PMC Changes ==

During this reporting period, there are no changes to PMC. Last member was 
added on July 24th 2013. The PMC has voted on diverging from PMC=Committers 
to lowered the entry barrier. This has enabled the PMC to vote in 3 committers
in past couple of months. We hope the committers use these as a stepping stone,
feel motivated to hangout and get voted into the PMC. 
The community remains vibrant and we constantly are on the looks for new PMC 
members and committers. Airavata has migrated to git (with a mirror in github)
which seem to resonate well with new contributors. We are yet to unleash this
enthusiasm into code contributions. 

== Other Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Allura Project  [Dave Brondsema]

Apache Allura is an open source implementation of a software forge, a web site
that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, wiki pages,
blogs, and more for any number of individual projects.

second milestone release which resulted in an influx of issues as people 
started trying out the new things.

An external party sent a note to the security@apache list and our private 
list to describe a potential DOS attack.  We worked with them to clarify 
the issue, create a test case, ad debug/fix the issues.   As a result, two 
new CVE’s were issued.   The 2.7.11/2.6.14 releases (voting now, out 
shortly) will fix the issues and the CVE’s (along with 2 other CVE’s from 
last reporting period) will be made public at that point.

There was a note sent privately to a couple of the PMC members about the 
wording of the JAX-RS compliance with the JCP spec.   This was mostly due 
to the lack of TCK access for the latest JAX-RS 2.0 TCK.   We worked with 
that person to clarify the statement about lack of TCK access is the main 
reason for lack of official compliance.  

The lack of stability in the Jenkins build farm is an ongoing concern.   
Unfortunately, many of the Jenkins errors are being ignored due to the 
issues with Jenkins causing a lot of wasted time.   Also, turn around from 
Jenkins takes a lot longer than expected due to the large build queue that 
seems to always be there.  Not sure if additional build slaves are in the 
plans or not.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

The YARN execution platform continues to evolve by generalizing from the
specific requirements of the MapReduce framework. As one prominent example,
a development branch implementing a more general application history server
(YARN-321) merged to trunk and the 2.x release series. The operability and
robustness of the platform is also improved by recent attention to failover
and recovery in the ResourceManager and NodeManager components (e.g.,
YARN-1336, YARN-1815).

The HDFS subproject also merged two significant development branches to
trunk: rolling upgrades (HDFS-5535) and ACLs (HDFS-4685). Improvements in
the Common RPC layer, short-circuit reads, and 'hedged' reads (HDFS-5776)
evolve Hadoop storage toward more heterogeneous workloads and architectures.

DataFu

DataFu provides a collection of Hadoop MapReduce jobs and functions in
higher level languages based on it to perform data analysis. It provides
functions for common statistics tasks (e.g. quantiles, sampling), PageRank,
stream sessionization, and set and bag operations. DataFu also provides
Hadoop jobs for incremental data processing in MapReduce.

DataFu has been incubating since 2014-01-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building ASF community

    public mailing list no obvious issues that need attention.

--------------------
MetaModel

MetaModel is a data access framework, providing a common interface for
exploration and querying of different types of datastores.

MetaModel has been incubating since 2013-06-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finalize 4.1 release to demonstrate new functionality and evolution
     within Apache
  2. More contributors to increase diversity of the community
  3. Determine approach to technical documentation across different software
     versions

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We finished our first release and are seeing some initial interest from
  users. Mostly there are interactions to add new features or connectivity
  to new types of datastores.  For instance, it has been proposed to look
  into building connectivity to semantic web technologies, iRods, Apache
  Phoenix - and within the contributors group there has been some focus on
  adding HBase and Cassandra support.
  
  Discussions about community by-laws are not very active at this point. It
  does not seem to be top-of-mind for most community members, and also
  shepherd/mentor notes from January 2014 indicate that this is not
  important right now.
  
  We're improving on the point of registering JIRA issues and running
  patches through the review board. By now this is the approach taken every
  time, unless a commit is found to be very trivial.
  
  Still the core group of developers seems a bit small, but by focusing on
  broader connectivity and keeping the releases coming, we think we can
  attract a larger community to the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Apache MetaModel 4.0.0-incubating was released on Jan 21.
  
  We are working on new features for a 4.1 version. The 4.1 version will
  represent the point in time where Apache MetaModel starts to show
  significant new functionality when compared to the old eobjects.org
  MetaModel project.
  
  A new module for providing easy Spring framework integration has been
  implemented.
  
  Finishing touches are being made to a new module for connecting to Apache
  HBase.
  
  Various API changes are being planned and discussed.
  
  Many bugfixes and performance improvements has been implemented.

NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven.

NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.

In previous reports, we indicated that there was a regression that blocked
releasing the next version. This has now been resolved, and the only thing
that stands in the way is sufficient cycles to push it out. There have been
a small number of users (not yet committers) who've stepped forward to help
test when that happens, which might help build some much needed momentum.
However, as before, it's still a concern whether sufficient release votes
could be found as many of the existing PPMC are inactive. The last release
was made on 16 May 2011.

The steps that have been identified are:

- apply patches that have been contributed recently
- convert the website to svnpubsub so updated documentation can be published
- perform the release steps

The NPanday automated builds have been impacted by changes to the Windows
build infrastructure again, but this is probably something that needs to be
worked around on our end.

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. Grow the community in terms of committers
2. Have regular releases
3. Decide if we would like to be a top level project or join an existing
   project

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We've been struggling to get 3 +1 IPMC votes for our latest release
  candidate.  We're stuck at two +1 votes.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We issued a "call for volunteers" to our users list and got a good
  response: http://s.apache.org/4Vx

  Of course, it will be easier to grow the community if we can reliably
  conduct a release vote.

How has the project developed since the last report?

We've been trying to get a release out since February 11th.

Phoenix

Phoenix is an open source SQL query engine for Apache HBase, a NoSQL data
store.  It is accessed as a JDBC driver and enables querying and managing
HBase tables using SQL.

Phoenix has been incubating since 12/11/2013.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1) Make our customers successful and prove value of Phoenix+HBase over
     other alternatives
  2) Attract new committers and continue to get contributions from existing
     committers to the project
  3) Figure out a bundling strategy with HBase so that Phoenix is
     pre-installed in HBase distributions.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Continued growth of user/dev traffic on email list. James Taylor is giving
  a talk on Apache Phoenix at ApacheCon.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John Ament (johndament):

    Phoenix is a newer podling, however they are growing quite fast.  While
    there were some release issues, those were resolved quite quickly on the
    general list and new releases cut quickly.  Based on this I would
    strongly recommend that the podling consider graduation sooner than
    later.  Most of their status report is complete as well.

--------------------
Samza

Samza is a stream processing system for running continuous computation on
infinite streams of data.

Samza has been incubating since 2013-07-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Release a version of Samza.
  2. Pull in at least one more committer.
  3. Building expertise in the community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community development has been strong. Our mailing list saw an all-time
  high in March of 275 emails. Collectively, March and February had more
  emails than all prior months.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project is developing well. We're trying to stabilize the codebase,
  and have our first release. JIRA information:

Stratos

Stratos will be a polyglot PaaS framework, providing developers a
cloud-based environment for developing, testing, and running scalable
applications, and IT providers high utilization rates, automated resource
management, and platform-wide insight including monitoring and billing.

Stratos has been incubating since 2013-06-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Resolve name search issue
     https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-45
  2. Community diversity
  3. Start Graduation vote

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The Stratos PPMC would be glad if the name search issue could be resolved
  soon.  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-45

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Six new committers & PMC members have been added to the project. (In
  Stratos, committers are also invited to join the PMC).  Community members
  have written several blog posts.  Lakmal Warusawithana was unanimously
  elected as the potential Stratos PMC chair.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Stratos has developed a very active community. Community diversity was a
  concern during the last report as well, and it is being addressed by bringing 
  in a number of non-WSO2 committers & PPMC members.  There is lot of interest
  expressed from & participation from many people.  A single Stratos
  distribution with multiple profiles has been created.  The team is also
  working on creating a simple VM which will allow people to easily try
  Stratos out. This will bring down the barrier to entry most potential
  contributors are facing right now, since setting up Stratos is a bit
  tedious right now.  The project is actively working towards further
  diversification by attracting more non-WSO2 contributors. The domain
  stratoslive.com has been donated by WSO2 to the Stratos PMC.  The project
  seems ready for graduation.  A draft resolution towards graduation has been
  prepared & is being reviewed.  The community is thinking about starting a
  graduation vote in the near future.

Usergrid

Usergrid is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) composed of an integrated database
(Cassandra), application layer and client tier with SDKs for developers.

Usergrid has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the Usergrid community
  2. Further embrace the Apache methodology including using Apache 
     infrastructure to move Usergid forwards
  3. Make our first incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There are currently some issues with regards to licensing of existing
  Usergrid code. The community is however aware of this and are working
  towards suitable replacement(s). 

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The dev@ mailing list has seen increased amounts of traffic in recent
  months. As of close of March there are 55 subscriber to dev@. Individual

VXQuery

A standards compliant parallel XML Query processor.

VXQuery has been incubating since 2009-07-06.

  As stated in the last report, there are no formal issues blocking 
  graduation. While not a formal requirement, the current plan is 
  (still) to do a second incubator release before graduation (the 
  reasons to do this have not changed).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No change.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There has been a lot of progress
  - improving the performance of the system, and on
  - running VXQuery on a cluster.
  For most tests that we are running now, we see near-linear
  speed-up and scale-up.

  Source code has been moved from svn to git.

  The second (and hopefully last) incubator release is being
  finalized.

Date of last release:

  2013-12-06

continue to increase linearly month-on-month.  

A number of the committers are meeting up in Milan 2014 [1] to discuss 
future evolution of Isis framework.  An open invitation to others in the 
community has also been made [2] (though realistically given the size of the
community we don't expect very much if any take-up).

Any significant discussions made in Milan will of course be taken back to the
dev mailing list to ensure full involvement of other committers not present.

We are signed up for Google Summer of Code 2014 [3], and have had two 
submissions.  One of these is very good and there's a very good chance (based 
on our experience in GSOC last year) that this project will go ahead.


== Committers and PMC ==

There have been no changes to the committers or PMC this quarter
* last committer added: Oscar Bou, 19 Aug 2013
* last PMC change: Oscar Bou, 19 Aug 2013


== Activity ==

Isis continues to be developed steadily, and this quarter was noteworthy for
the release of a significant major open source application (Estatio [4]) 
based on Isis.  As mentioned in previous status reports, much of Isis' 
development over the last two years has been in support of building Estatio, 
for and on behalf of Eurocommercial Properties [5].  ECP have committed to 
continue funding through 2014, with new features planned that build upon 
Isis' support for Restful Objects spec [6].  (This will be one of the topics 
of conversation in Milan).


== Releases ==

This quarter we made two releases, v1.4.0 on 11 Mar 2014, and a follow-up
patch release v1.4.1 on 14 Mar 2014 [7].  


== Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Bayer]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

Project Status
--------------

jclouds has carried out one successful release (1.7.1) in the last quarter and
is currently in the process of releasing 1.7.2. A lot of work has also gone
into overhauling the jclouds website, the new version of which is now live.

The developer and user community is active, with an increasing number of
submissions from outside the usual committer group, and sustained activity by
the core team. The PMC is still looking to grow the committer base and has
identified some suitable candidates.

Community
---------

A slightly more detailed look at the project community. It should still be
brief, issues to think about include:

''When was the last committer voted in?''

2014-04-02 (Jeremy Daggett)

''When was the last PMC member added?''

2013-04-29 (initial composition of the PMC when jclouds entered the incubator)

There is regular activity on both the user and dev lists. Responses to
questions are generally fast, with multiple community members contributing.

Community Objectives
--------------------

What are the projects main plans and expectations for the community in the
next period?

 * Onboarding and mentoring new committers
 * Encouraging involvement and contributions by vendors of supported providers
 * Improving the user and new developer experience through revamped
   documentation
 * Finishing ongoing architectural changes in preparation for the next major
   version
 * Evaluate Google Summer of Code proposals and help students begin their
   projects

Releases
--------

Have there been any releases from the project in the last quarter?

 * 1.7.1 (2014-02-11)
 * 1.7.2 (ongoing)

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

== Project Description

Apache Jena is a Java framework for building Semantic Web
and Linked Data applications based on W3C and
community standards.

== Issues

There are no issues to raise with the board.

== Releases

Jena 2.11.1 released on 23/01/2014.

== PMC

PMC member last added: 26 January 2013
Committer last added:  16 August 2013

== Activity

dev@ list:     ~ 200 messages a month
users@ list:   ~ 200 messages a month

== Community news

= Contribution

The project has received a significant contribution from Cray of code to
work with RDF data on Hadoop.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-666

The project is assessing whether full IP-clearance process for this
contribution is appropriate.

= Google Summer of Code

The project is interested in running 2 GSoC projects this year.  We
received more interest than could be met; the number of mentors is the
limiting factor.

= Release Frequency

The project original planned to release roughly 6-monthly but in practice
has releasing nearer to 3-monthly.  We're now backing-off a little to try
to aim for regular 6-monthly releases if there are no major bug fixes
needed.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

The Apache JMeter desktop application is a pure Java application
designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

JMeter 2.11 was released on Jan 05 2014.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
the committers.

There have been no committers added since October 2011, when Philippe
Mouawad was added. There are a few regular contributors who may be
suitable candidates for committership, pending discussion by the PMC.

There have been no changes to the PMC since it was established in October 2011.

The JMeter Twitter account has 632 followers as of April 03 2014.

There are no board level issues at this time

Last release on 1st Feb, 2014

As an effect of releasing 2.10.0, we've had several JIRAs raised,
accompanied by their corresponding patches, 5 of them already
on trunk.

A 2.10.1 release is being discussed at dev@jspwiki.apache.org, which
should fix a couple of issues found after 2.10.0; this release will 
also add the ability of loading plugins from an outside directory.

Aside from this, there is work in progress on a new template / UI for
JSPWiki and on having portable binaries.

== Community

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Tim Williams]

Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF committers.

[STATUS]

We saw a good bit of activity around improving our processes and community this quarter, details below. 

[DETAILS]

== Community ==

We saw a cascade of problems this quarter.  Starting with a new Lab that
failed to attain three binding votes, we realized that we actually don’t want
that hurdle for new Labs and would rather just a pure lazy approval.  So, we
set about fixing our bylaws to approve labs with simple lazy approval.
Unfortunately, the bylaws change requires a ⅔ approval vote which caused us to
realize that we have too many inactive PMC members to achieve that success.
This caused us to set about cleaning up the PMC roster by asking folks to
voluntarily resign if they don’t feel they can be participate any longer -
obviously, welcome to come back too.  

We believe that cleaning up the roster will allow us to get the bylaws in
order and move forward.

Jan Iversen gave a presentation on Labs at a Fast Feather session at ApacheCon.

== Labs Statistics ==

- new: 0
- status changes (last 3 months): 0
- total number: 40
- active: 17
- idle: 14
- promoted: 3
- completed: 8
- labs with commits: panopticon, yay, penihip

No new PMC members in the last quarter and since Lucy graduated from the
incubator in March 2012.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Grant Ingersoll]

Apache Mahout has implementations of a wide range of machine learning and
data mining algorithms: clustering, classification, collaborative filtering
and frequent pattern mining

Project Status
--------------

The project continues to have a large and active user base.  While
the developer base has continued to grow, there is a very active
and healthy debate going on about where Mahout goes next.  Please
see the Issues section below for more details.



Community
---------

* Andrew Musselman was voted in as new committer.
* No changes to the PMC in the reporting period.

* The main issue concerning the community right now is the addition
of new contributions from 0xData and the integration of Mahout with Spark.



Community Objectives
--------------------

Our goal is to build scalable machine learning libraries. See the Issues
section below for the debate in the community about our objectives.


Releases
--------

In addition to an ongoing debate on Mahout's future, the community is actively
 working on integrating Mahout with Scala/Spark,  and bringing in new code and
 committers to update the core project.

A lot of work on improving documentation has been done. The project has 
 finished the move from the wiki to Apache CMS, redesigned the project
 website and is in the process of updating all pages.

Issues
------
The Mahout community is at a crossroads in terms of where
to go next.  While the project has a broad number of users and interested 
parties, most committers are trying to maintain the code base on a purely
part time basis, when the amount of work to sustain these users
clearly points to it needing to
be full time.  Furthermore, much of our original code base is written
for Hadoop MapReduce 1.0, which many in the community have come to realize
is not well-suited for solving the kinds of problems that Mahout has set
out to solve.  There have been several lengthy discussions and prototypes
going on to work out next directions along the lines of the Spark and 
0xData contributions (there are numerous threads on the dev@mahout.a.o
mailing list.)  

The PMC does not think this requires Board intervention at this time
as the debate is, as far as we can tell, healthy.  We do, however,
expect that this debate will take some time to resolve and may mean we
won't be shipping a 1.0 release any time soon.  We will keep the Board
apprised of our next steps as we work through the process.





-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Stephen Connolly]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

* General Information

  We have been making slow but steady progress on our compliance with 
  the ASF source header policy. Of our current 105 release roots, we now
  have only 23 release roots that still report issues using the Apache Rat 
  tooling. This is down 3 and 7 respectively compared to the last board
  report. One of the measures that we have been using for voting on
  releases is that the Rat report is either better or no worse than
  the previous release. Once we get more release roots compliant, we
  will configure Rat to fail those builds if they are no longer compliant.

  There has been no update to the LEGAL JIRAs concerning the confusion over 
  the the requirements of LICENSE and NOTICE files in source control: 
  LEGAL-26[4], LEGAL-27[5], LEGAL-31[6] and LEGAL-136[7]. 
  
  * JDK8  

  The team has started to verify if Apache Maven and all underlying projects
  are JDK8 ready. We've checked more than 50% of all the release roots. All 
  issues, either to be fixed by Oracle or by the Apache Maven Team, have been
  gathered under MNG-5551[1] with extra info on the wiki[2]

  We've spotted 2 blocking issues in the JDK which have already been fixed
  by Oracle. 

  There's still 1 regression which is planned to be fixed for JDK9.[3]

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache OpenMeetings Project  [Sebastian Wagner]

Apache OpenMeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white
board, collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using API
functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.



== Releases ==

Version 3.0.0 has been released! Version 3.0.0 is the first release that uses
Apache Wicket for roughly 50% of the UI. It is a HTML5 / Flash hybrid. The
conference room is still Flash, everything else is in Wicket. Further
advancing into HTML5 for the real-time components is planned as they become
available.

== Activity ==

There is constant activity in mailing list, jira and commits. 
The main focus in since the last report have been:
 - Release and review
 - Migrating to Maven

Maxim Solodovnik has migrated parts of the complex ANT/Ivy based build
process to Maven. Great effort has gone into this and we are excited to
further advance our build process into a fully Maven enhanced build, dev,
test and release process.

== Community ==



There have been a number of GSoC candidates but no project was selected this
year so far. Probably part of the problem was the lack of tailoring out some
suitable project scopes where mentors and students equally confident can
commit to.

== Infrastructure ==

We are still waiting on some resources for a demo server (INFRA-6906). We
would like to advance our project with Selenium Tests to establish a
regression testing suite. The demo server would be an integral part of that
enhancement.
We are also keen on the result of the Infra’s team effort to create a code
signing certificate from a trusted auth (INFRA-3991). 

== Board ==



There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

Issues for Board Awareness
---------------------------

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-190 was opened to
check whether we need to have uniform ADA (Americans with
Disabilities Act) statements for all the public websites of the
Apache projects.

Community Development/Outreach Progress
---------------------------------------

The project added 3 committers (January: rbd; February: clarence_guo;
March: astepukonis) since our last report in January. The new
committers are involved in QA, development, localization. No new
PMC members since November 2013 (fanyuzhen).

The OpenOffice custom infrastructure (wiki, forum) is still in a
"minimal maintenance" mode. Important fixes get applied timely, but
many improvements requested by the community have been in queue for
months. The infrastructure team internal to the OpenOffice project
is insufficient and cannot work effectively due to disagreements on
the system administration policy. The best option seems to
progressively standardize on the Infra processes and minimize the
amount of "non-standard" sysadmin work needed.

Experimental solutions to make website translation easier have
been tested. The first ones are already online and we are engaging
new volunteers.

A new documentation effort for an end-users manual under the ALv2
license is progressing on the OpenOffice Wiki.

The localization community is growing: OpenOffice 4.1, expected
mid-April, will be fully released in 38 languages, 6 of which
(Bulgarian, Danish, Hebrew, Hindi, Norwegian Bokmal and Thai)
are new with respect to version 4.0.

OpenOffice co-organized a track (devroom) at FOSDEM, a major
European free and open source software conference, in February 2014
and will have a dedicated track during ApacheCon Denver.

The mailing lists for user support, localization, QA are quite
active, the marketing list is moderately active. Activity in social
media is progressing well. The developer (dev) list remains very
active.

Community support forums remain popular with users, with an average
of over 100 posts per day.

In the previous report OpenOffice mentioned that the new policy
announced for Apache Extras http://s.apache.org/hzJ would have been
a major problem. But three months later no complaints were seen on
the dev list. It must be considered, though, that in the past months
the focus was mainly on consolidating the 4.1 release, so no
external libraries like the ones hosted in Apache Extras were
updated.


Product/Project Development Progress
------------------------------------

Apache OpenOffice 4.1.0, a release with some major improvements
including IA2 accessibility, OOXML compatibility, Mac OS X specific
features (64-bit application), replacement of outdated Mozilla code
with the NSS libraries, is currently in Release Candidate phase and
is expected to be approved mid-April. Apache OpenOffice 4.1.0-beta
was officially voted and released for public testing on 10 March
2014.

Activities that are still ongoing include: actions for an easier
installation and availability on mainstream Linux distributions; a
new localization process, now progressing in the l10n40 branch; a
redesign of the build approach, dropping the historical dmake;
implementation of export to OOXML formats.

The download trend remains very strong, with about 95 million
downloads of Apache OpenOffice as of 31 March 2014.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:
---------------

The project recently became a TLP and continues to grow in terms of community
size. We finished switching our infrastructure to spark.apache.org, including
recently importing our JIRA instance. We completed the vote on a 0.9.1 minor
release last week (it will be posted on April 9th), and we reached the
feature freeze and QA point for our 1.0 release, which is coming in a few
weeks. Apart from the new features coming in 1.0, a major update in the
community has been a change towards a Semantic Versioning-like policy, where
maintenance releases are clearly marked and API compatibility is preserved
across all minor releases (i.e. all 1.x.y will be compatible). This has been
put in action for both 0.9.x and 1.x.

Releases:
---------

Our last few releases were:

Apr 9, 2014: Spark 0.9.1
Feb 2, 2014: Spark 0.9.0-incubating
Dec 19, 2013: Spark 0.8.1-incubating
Sept 25, 2013: Spark 0.8.0-incubating

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

Apache Struts is an action-based Java web application framework.

The Struts team made one release in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.16.1 - security fix release (2014-03-02)

In the last quarter we had to deal with a security vulnerability in
commons-fileupload and a class loader manipulation issue. The issues
were fixed in a timely manner, resulting in the release of  Struts
2.3.16.1. Currently the team is about to release Struts 2.3.17, which
will include a major number of enhancements and bug fixes.

Within the reporting period the Struts 2 codebase has been successfully
moved to git. The team decided to adopt a git-flow based workflow.

In this period we saw slightly increased community activity on the
mailing lists and issue tracker, along with increased development activity.

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.
Last PMC member addition was on 2013-05-11, last committer addition on
2014-01-06.

The employer our fellow PMC member Łukasz Lenart, the Poland-based
company SoftwareMill, was kind enough to donate design resources to the
Apache Struts project. We are currently in the process of new logo and
unique web site design development.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.7) has been released 2013-04-29.
  We have made available the first beta build of the upcoming 5.4 release, 
  5.4-beta-3, on 2014-03-03, following a successful vote.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is high. Questions are answered with
  participation of not only the core contributors but also by the community
  at large. Discussion focuses especially around new features of the upcoming
  5.4 release.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4 which
  will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other new features.
  At this point we are primarily looking at fixing bugs (from our large backlog)
  and documenting the significant new features.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Lance Semmens has been voted in as a committer on 2013-07-07.
  The last PMC addition has been Massimo Lusetti on 2012-08-27.

PMC and committer diversity

  PMC and committer diversity is good. To our knowledge no two committers share
  the same employer. Levels of contribution vary over time with Howard Lewis
  Ship being the driving force behind Tapestry's development and various other
  committers working on areas of their interest.

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org" - completed
 * "Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc." - completed
 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing
 * "Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in footers,
   etc." - completed
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo
 * "Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date" - completed

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

 * We have been unable to run builds on the Jenkins CI server for some time. We
   have been waiting for Uli to investigate.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the board's attention.


Community
=========

No new committers were added since last report, leaving us with a total of 35
committers. We do however expect a number of new committers and PMC members to
get voted on in the near future. Our last committer was added on 11/7/2013.
Activity on mailing list is normal, and we are seeing normal, steady growth in
mailing list subscribers:

    users@ - 416 subscribers (up 3.5% since last report)
    dev@ - 274 subscribers (up 4% since last report)


In Jira, 222 new tickets were opened and 241 were resolved or closed since
the last board report, which had 215 and 115 respectively. 450 changes were
committed to our git repository from 39 contributors. The number of unique
contributors is identical to last report (also 39).

Events
======

At ApacheCon 2014, we are represented with a full day track dedicated to
Traffic Server. In addition, the spring 2014 ATS Summit is being held at the
same conference venue, Thursday and Friday. Many thanks to the ACNA organizers
for helping us planning this summit! Dinners are planned for the community
both on Wednesday night and Thursday night.

Releases
========

One new release was made since last report, and it's worth repeating that all
ATS releases are considered stable.

    Apache Traffic Server v4.2.0 (released 3/19/2014)

The v4.2.x family of releases is also a LTS branch, and this release marks
the EOL of all v4.1.x releases. The v4.2.x version will be supported until
v6.0.0 is released, roughly May 2015, and we expect a number of releases to be
made in the next year. Our normal release cycles continues of course, with the
next stable release being v5.0.0.

Upcoming releases include

   * Soon: v4.2.1, fixing a few critical cache related issues
   * May: v5.0.0, which starts our new major release cycle.

The release of v5.0.0 will also see the end of life of the old v3.2.x
releases. No further releases in the v3.2.x family is expected, we will make
public announcements of this in the near future. We know the ASF is still
running some servers on v3.2.x, and we'd be happy to provide resources to help
a smooth migration to a newer version.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Hugo Trippaers]

DESCRIPTION
Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and
manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available,
highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing
platform.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

As this is an out of cycle report, and we just reported last month,
this report does not include all of the typical elements.

The CloudStack community has just held its Collaboration Conference
in Denver, and would like to report that the event was a success. The
fact that it was co-located with ApacheCon for the first time was a
significant improvement on past events. Primarily, this is because it
offered an opportunity for the CloudStack community to better
integrate into the larger ASF family (and for ASF community members to
learn more about CloudStack). We would like to thank the board, the
executive officers and specifically Rich for his support.
