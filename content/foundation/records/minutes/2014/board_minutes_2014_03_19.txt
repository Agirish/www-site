 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       At the last board meeting, we agreed on May 27 and 29 as the dates for
       the Annual Members Meeting. I will send out the formal notice to
       members and call for nominations of new members and the board in the
       next couple of weeks, once we're inside the required 60 day period.

       ApacheCon is coming up soon. Unfortunately, I'm not able to attend
       this year, though I'm interested to hear which other directors will be
       present. Given the timing, I don't expect there's a need for the board
       to formally meet face to face.

    B. President [Ross]
       
       ApacheCon is progressing well, see EVP report for details. Given
       the extremely short timeline on this event
       I think we can consider this a success. It looks to me like 
       we will have an event that is at least as good as, if not better,
       than most previous events. When we add to this the lack of drama
       created by the producer I would like to think this is the start
       of a healthy relationship that will, over time, develop a
       valuable conference model that brings value to all parties.
       
       Our EA has been (mostly) consumed by ApacheCon items this month.
       We did discuss a difficulty Melissa has with respect to visibility
       into sponsor payments. It is difficult for Melissa to establish
       whether a payment has been made or not and thus to establish
       whether she ought to send a nag mail. On occasion this has been 
       held up when our volunteers with access to this information are
       otherwise engaged. With the excellent work VP Fundraising and 
       Melissa have put into creating a process for managing sponsorships
       this is now the most common bottleneck. I believe our treasurer is 
       looking into options with respect to providing Melissa with timely 
       access without adding additional overhead to the role of Treasurer. 
       I look forward to a solution in the future.
       
       The Audit has not progressed significantly. As this was (once again)
       a priority for this year I'm disappointed with the progress since
       I personally undertook to see this through. I intend to explore 
       the blocker over the next month since I have
       finally landed in my own home now, so no more moves for many
       years (I hope). 
       
       Trademarks continues to increase its demands on Shane whist
       Shane continues to look for ways to streamline the process. 
       Our EA has indicated that she is keen to help out with the 
       process but still feels a little unclear as to where the
       boundaries lie around what she can safely do to help. I 
       hope to discuss this with Shane at ApacheCon in April. From
       my perspective if we can free up even an hour a month of
       Shane's time this will be productive as Shane is doing such
       a superb job of refining out policies and practices in the
       little time available.
       
       There is no report from VP Fundraising at the time of writing.
       However Upayavira and I did touch base earlier this month and
       discussed the state of Fundraising. Whilst Upayavira himself is
       mostly engaged elsewhere it seems all sponsorship renewals are
       under control thanks to the support of (mostly) Melissa and 
       Sally. Upayavira's role seems to be one of oversight at present.
       
       Infra report no significant surprises this month but note that
       the new Git features have been well received. 28 projects have 
       adopted them in the first month, which has resulted in a tenfold
       increase in git related traffic on various apache.org email 
       lists. As we enter budget planning season I have specifically
       asked infra to consider whether they ought to make a one-off
       investment in some specialist support that will allow them to
       better scale resources as the foundation continues to grow. This
       suggestion was well received as some members of the infra team
       feel there is an element of fire-fighting that can sometimes
       slow longer term projects.
       
       TAC reports 26 applications, of which 15 were funded at an
       estimated cost of $32k. This is both more applications and
       approvals in the past. The process was quicker than in the past
       though not without it's hiccups. Especially with respect to 
       paying for flights. Thanks to Nick Burch who stepped in to
       solve the problem by offering his personal card (which was the
       reported fall-back position last month). I can confirm that
       Nick was promptly reimbursed for this expense. Melissa reports
       that she will seek to make recommendations for streamlining the
       process for future events now that she has been a core part of
       the TAC team.     
       
       
       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       The Treasurer's Office worked with Phil Steitz to get Amazon Payment
       account data in the purview of the monthly data collection process.
       This is the first month that will include a tag for Amazon payments.

       Remittance to a TAC committee member for fronting the payments for
       ACNA 2014 flights was completed.

       Chris has been in touch with the contractor company for treasurer
       services referred by Jim. Treasurer's Office has requested feedback
       from the board and will arrive at a decision soon. Jim is awaiting
       the decision from an audit perspective as this will affect the way
       he proceeds with the audit.

       The President's Office inquired to see the difficulty in providing
       account access for WFS and other financials necessary for sponsorship
       in-transit payment inquiries.  The Treasurer's Office is considering
       how best to respond to the request.

       Finally, the last request for transfer out of PayPal is in transit,
       completing an activity desired years ago, to completely move the
       bulk of ASF money out of PayPal and into WFS. Thanks to Upayavira
       and Sam and others for their help in making this happen.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       February was a short and relatively light month for incoming 
       documents. 42 iclas, two cclas, and four grants were received 
       and filed.


    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        With ApacheCon now less than a month away, registrations are
        progressing well, but rather behind my hopes. We were coming up
        on 300 registrations when the Early Bird price expired. (I'll
        hopefully update numbers prior to the meeting.) This is ahead
        of where we were at this point last year, but still
        disappointing given the expanded scope of the event. More
        importantly, however, the producer is happy with the numbers,
        and I view this event as an investment in the next event, so if
        they're happy, I'm happy.

        Everyone has been very helpful, with everyone I've asked for
        assistance immediately stepping up and helping out. I'm looking
        forward to doing this again, but with more lead time.

        Meanwhile, we're still looking at venues in Europe, the
        difficulty being that the OpenStack Summit in Paris hasn't
        announced dates yet, and so we have to avoid both options that
        they have announced, which greatly reduces our available venues.
        Dates we are currently looking at are December 7 in Prague or
        November 16 in Rome. Each of these have drawbacks, and we hope
        to have something decided by the end of this month.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, and board@) and following-up with appropriate personnel

    ApacheCon:  90% (includes TAC)
        Very busy month; progressing well - Rich will provide more information
        Researched items for this year's giveaways (to be used for ACNA,
          OSCON, ACEU and community events throughout the year) and awaiting
          shipment.
        Assisted Rich with helping "spread the word".  Please forgive the
          inundation of emails received on March 5th - I misunderstood Rich's
          instructions and sent an email for each Project and Track to comdev@
          rather than to dev@PROJECT.  Well, on the plus side, ya can't say we
          haven't gotten the word out!! ;)
        Currently working on the booth logistics

    TAC:

        Sent all rejection and acceptance letters out
        All flights and hotel reservations have been made and sent to the
          successful applicants
        All documentation required for the applicants needing a visa have been
          sent.  4 out of the 5 needing a visa have successfully received it;
          the 5th has a visa appointment the week of March 10th.
        I've submitted a direct bill application to the Westin for the TAC'ers
          and staff lodging (rather than doing a wire transfer) - awaiting
          approval on that from the Westin.
        Fielded a very large amount of inquiries from the TAC'ers.  A handful
          of folks were full of questions and uncertainty on what to do and
          how to proceed; with a little TLC, I was able to guide them through
          the entire process and ease their nerves.

    Fundraising:  10%

        Continuing to follow-up on renewals sent out
            Working with the Treasurer's Office for a solution for me to gain
              visibility into payments.  This will alleviate some of the
              workload on their end, as well as enable me to gain the
              information needed in a more timely manner for following up on
              the past-due invoices.
            Sam has fixed the info in svn so it is now readable.  Sam and
              Chris will determine what is needed from WF in order for me to
              gain read access into the account so that I can have "real-time"
              info (the info in svn is only posted after Chris writes his
              board report).
        Sent out invoices for the sponsors due for renewal
        A great big thank you to Sally, who has been in communications with
          our Platinums.  As a result, we've obtained a PO# for Google's
          Platinum renewal, and I've submitted the invoice through their
          online portal (invoice is showing as approved; just awaiting
          payment), and I've sent out the Yahoo! renewal.  She is awaiting
          responses from Microsoft (they just came off of vacation, so she's
          giving them adequate time to catch up) and Facebook.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

trademarks@ traffic continues to grow and bring up new issues.  It's 
been very helpful to have a couple of members really step up to help 
and thoughtfully answer various questions; David Nalley has been 
especially helpful in this regard.

Started a discussion on ways to improve services that trademarks@ 
and the ASF offers to our projects, although there's limited feedback 
so far there on some new ideas.

I updated the Project Independence requirements in response to issues 
raised recently with the focus of the page:

  http://community.apache.org/projectIndependence.html

Had a brief but productive call at DLAPiper request; they have a number 
of specific documents almost ready to offer to help improve and simplify 
our brand policing and education activities that I'm looking forward to.

DLAPiper submitted a US registration for LUCENE.

DLAPiper is submitting an international registration for HADOOP covering 
EU and several key first-to-file countries.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

As noted by Ross in his President report, I am glad to report that the 
VP Fundraising role has become an oversight one. Melissa is handling most
of the renewal work, and Sally is handling the higher value sponsors.
Phil is handling thanking our PayPal/Amazon donors.

The work required for the VP Fundraising appears to have dropped to a 
much more manageable level for a volunteer, thanks to the work of the
above named.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain on schedule and under budget. All vendor payments have
  been processed on time with ongoing thanks to the Treasurer and Operations
  teams.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned. Sally
  Khudairi continues Sponsor renewal outreach activities, and has secured
  confirmation from select Platinum-level Sponsors. The discussion regarding
  project-specific marketing/promotional support that had begun in October has
  resumed, this time with the Trademarks/Brand Management team as lead.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
  newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org:

- 27 February 2014: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Announces Apache™
  Spark™ as a Top-Level Project
- 03 March 2014: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™ Open Climate
  Workbench™ as a Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: five newsworthy items were announced on @TheASF,
  and nine new tweets on @ApacheCon feed. No new posts were made on
  "TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: we're awaiting clearance on a project milestone
  announcement that we began work on in January. PMCs wishing to announce major
  project news, as well as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator, are
  welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly
  provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 8 media requests. The ASF received 3,030
  press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count of 1,519.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 3 analyst queries, and secured Chris
  Mattmann as co-host of the GreenMonk hangout/broadcast following our
  announcement of Apache Climate (GreenMonk is RedMonk's sustainability-focused
  arm). Apache was mentioned in 6 reports by Gartner (as well as an upcoming
  Webinar on Apache Hadoop 2.0), 4 reports by Forrester, 7 write-ups by GigaOM,
  8 reports by Yankee Group, and 4 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally continues to liaise with the ApacheCon
  producer, with particular focus on communications and sponsor outreach. She is
  also working with Melissa Warnkin on promotional items for the event.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally is liaising with a
  small handful of events that are requesting the ASF's presence as
  speakers/presenters/sponsors/*.

X. Newswire accounts: we have renewed our pre-paid press release agreement
  with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire, and have 17 in our account through the end of the
  calendar year. We also have 7 remaining pre-paid press releases on the
  PRNewswire account through May 2014, as well as ongoing distribution donated
  by Pressat with no pre-established termination timeframe.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

New Karma:
==========
mdrob added to infra-interest.


Finances:
==========


Operations Action Items:
========================


Short Term Priorities:
======================

* Look into mac build slaves.


* Converge on git.apache.org migration to eris. (Step 1 is merge git -> git-wip on tyr)
  (opinions?)

* Investigate / negotiate external code-signing capability, currently in talks
  under NDA. INFRA-3991 is tracking the status, and a Webex call has taken place.

* Complete nagios-to-circonus migration for monitoring.

* Continue to experiment with weekly team meetings via google hangout.

* Explore the possibility of revamping the infra documents to have a more 
  intuitive feel about them, improve readability.

* Confluence Upgrade. Upgrade from 5.0.3 to latest. Hopefully will be less
  painful this time around. 
  (Support case closed, nothing useful came from it other than check the logs.)

* Port tlp creation scripts over to new json-based design on whimsy.


Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Choose a suitable technology for continued buildout of our virtual
  hosting infra.  Right now we are on VMWare but it no longer is gratis
  software for the ASF.

* Continue gradually replacing gear we no longer have any hardware warranty
  support for.

* Formulate an effective process and surrounding policy documentation for
  fulfilling the DMCA safe harbor provisions as they relate to Apache services.

* Institute egress filtering on all mission-critical service hosts.


General Activity:
=================

* The new GitHub features have been well received, with 28 projects already
  onboard with the new features in February alone. As a result, the number of
  github related messages on the public ASF mailing lists have risen from 304
  in January to 3,616 in February, with expectations to exceed 5,000 in
  March. There has been a discussion on whether to transition from opt-in to
  opt-out on these features, but for the time being, it remains opt-in. 

* Instituted a weekly cron to inform private@cordova about the current list of
  committers not on the PMC, which should be the empty set.  Currently about a
  third of the pmc is impacted with no indication that this will ever be
  addressed by the chair- the requisite notices have already been sent to
  board@.

* Discussed the current state of affairs with our build farms as they relate to
  TrafficServer's needs.  We intend to address this with increased funding in
  next year's budget.

* Received a report about several compromised webpages hosted by VM's
  associated with OfBiz.  In the process of working with the PMC to correct
  this situation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

The Travel Assistance Committee exists to help those that would like to
attend ApacheCon events, but are unable to do so for financial reasons.

Overall Activity since last report

With ApacheCon NA 2014 quickly approaching things have been in full swing.
Announcements regarding TAC funding opportunities were disseminated around
16th January 2014. Announcements were sent to pmcs@, committers@, the TAC
website and the Linux Foundation in an attempt to reach a wider audience.
Announcements were also made on social media channels.
From the above, TAC received some 26 applications which is a noticeably
larger figure than received in recent times. Based on judging by various
TAC members and a subsequent judges call, an estimation was made that
applicant reported flight costs, hotels, subsistence and conference fees
we're likely to total ~$32k for 15 successful applicants.
Further to the dissemination of acceptance and rejection letters, work has
been focused around the booking of flights, accommodation and Visa
referrals for successful TAC applicants.

How has the community developed since the last report?

No new members have joined TAC since last reporting.

Other content:

Based on feedback we received from ApacheCon 2013 in Portland, we have
arranged a 'Welcome Dinner' (as oppose to Breakfast) for TAC'ers. This way
we can ensure everyone is comfortable with the accommodation as well as the
ApacheCon experience prior to the first day of the conference.

N.B. We would also advise board@ to see the TAC section of the Post
Executive Assistant's Report. This contains a substantial amount of
information based on work undertaken by EA.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

Somewhat slow but steady stream of posts with the one regarding "why is LGPL
on the Not Allowed List" receiving the honor of most posts. There is nothing
that requires board attention at this time


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds
arriving at security@ in Feb. These continue to be dealt with by
the security team.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom Syndication
Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera is very quiet, almost dormant. There was one bug report recently, 
no one has had a chance to investigate it yet, other than that there has 
been little activity in the project. It might be worth thinking about 
moving to the attic but while there are still a few PMC members watching
the lists I think its probably ok to keep the project alive for now.

The last release was one year ago, the last committer / PMC member 
addition was Nov 2011.

No board issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Michele Mostarda]

Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command
line tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety
of Web documents.

Project Releases

The last release of Any23 (0.9.0) was on 3rd November 2013.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Project activity has been very quiet again. There has been one 
proposed fix for a new RDFa compliant parser and some community
members have been trying this out very recently.
Some other issues have been fixed and the process of proposing parts
of the codebase to the Apache Tika community is the main focus.
One issue which is currently being worked on (and nearly complete)
is to migrate the 'mime' module over to Apache Tika. Please see
the below Jira ticket.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-1208.
Due to interest/committer resources from within Any23 progress
on this issue is slower than preferred HOWEVER it is NOT dead
in the water.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Chris Mattmann was added back to the PMC on Wed, 15th May 2013.

How has the community developed since the last report?

There has been no community development since we last reported.

Changes to PMC & Committers

As of 17/03/2014 (dd/mm/yyyy) the community is currently VOTE'ing 
on a PROPOSAL to change the Project Chair from Michele Mostarda 
to Lewis John McGibbney.



-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache APR Project  [Jeff Trawick]

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
since 2007.

Nothing was released this quarter.  APR 1.5.0 and APR-util 1.5.3 were 
released November 18, 2013.

Community
---------

New PMC members: none
The last new PMC member was added in November of 2013.

New committers: none
The last new committer was added in March of 2013.

Ten bugs were opened during the reporting period, with some
sort of developer followup (closure or discussion) on four bugs.
(Additionally, a number of bugs that had been left open after 
being fixed in older releases have been cleaned up.)

Mailing list activity has been very quiet this quarter, with no
release activity and limited discussion of bugs.

Development
-----------
Development has been very light this quarter.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Roman Shaposhnik]

Apache Bigtop is a software related to a system for integration,
packaging, deployment and validation of a big data management
software distribution based on Apache Hadoop.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache Bigtop was version 0.7.0, released on Nov 5, 2013
* Bigtop 0.8.0 is the next release scheduled for Q2 of 2014, based on Hadoop 2.3
  - release is delayed from originally planned Q1 of 2014 because of the scope
    of the changes

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report:
     https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?filter=12326778
  (since last board report, Dec 2013)
* Bigtop 0.8.0 is the next release the community is working on
* Groovy language runtime environment has been added to Bigtop
* Latest version of Hadoop 2.3 is being added to Bigtop

COMMUNITY

No changes

* Currently there are:
- Total of 115 subscribers to the developer list
- Total of 132 subscribers to the user list
- Total of 24 subscribers to the announce list
- Total of 25 committers
- Total of 20 PMC members

ISSUES

* The Apache Bigtop PMC has voted to recommend 
     Konstantin Boudnik <cos@apache.org> 
  be appointed to the office of Vice President, Apache Bigtop
* PMC has voted on and approved establishing term limits for
  the position of PMC Chair. Adopted: a position of an Apache Bigtop Chair
  gets elected for a year. After a year passes it is expected of the active
  Chair to start a [DISCUSS] email thread on private@bigtop.apache.org asking
  PMC members to nominate themselves for the next year. It is perfectly
  acceptable for the active chair to nominate him or herself. There is no
  limit on the number of terms that one person can server as an Apache Bigtop
  Chair. Each term, however is limited to one year.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================
Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.

Issues
======

There are no issues that we believe currently require the board's attention.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last releases
were:

* apache-bloodhound-0.6 (16th July 2013)
* apache-bloodhound-0.7 (23rd August 2013)

Preparation of a new release is expected within around a week.

Community & Development
=======================

Two new committee members have been added this quarter:

* SaintGermain (1st January 2014)
* Antony Semonella (9th January 2014)

Bloodhound is once again looking to become involved with GSoC this year and
the community has prepared a number of sample projects for students interest.
This has already seen six students discussing projects on the dev mailing
list who all seem to have been engaged with promptly in order to hold their
interest. We have three PMC members who have put themselves forward for
mentorship. This has also being used as an informal opportunity for those
mentors to discuss GSoC with local students which may benefit projects beyond
Bloodhound with potential students.

Development effort has increased again after a slow January but the mailing
list traffic has remained healthy with new contributors appearing fairly
regularly. This activity has obviously been boosted significantly by the GSoC
related discussions. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]

Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools.

Our last release (1.4.15) happened in November. Development and community
activity (mailing lists, bug reports, etc.) has been low since then. Our last
committer/PMC changes happened in October.

In February, we discussed and agreed to move to git as our primary
version-control system, as well as "turning on" the improved GitHub integration
(https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/improved_integration_between_apache_and).

We have no issues that require board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matt Benson]

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases.

### Activity ###
Development has proceeded at what can charitably be termed a crawl for the past
year while BVal's team have been expending their volunteer energies elsewhere.
A large obstacle has just been removed, however, in the form of the Apache
Commons Weaver component, which has just seen its 1.0 release. This project had
been one of the aforementioned time/energy sinks and was developed for the
express purpose of solving one of BVal's long-standing design problems; speaking
on behalf of the PMC I am hopeful that we can now resume a respectable
development velocity and finally make our 1.0 and 1.1 (implementing,
respectively, the same versions of the Java Bean Validation specification)
releases in the near future.

### Community  ###
No changes in community. Romain Manni-Bucau was added to the PMC during the
previous quarter after having been elected a committer the quarter before that.

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Chip Childers]

DESCRIPTION
Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage 
large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.

ISSUES

The board has a resolution on it's agenda for this meeting to change
the Apache CloudStack PMC chair (special order B).

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* The community is finalizing our Apache CloudStack 4.3.0 release. This 
  release was delayed from the community's initial target for a release date, 
  due to an issue with how we were treating a specific dependency during the 
  default build of the software. This issue was identified by the PMC and has 
  been resolved. We are actively testing our latest RC now.
* The project was informed that the Citrix-hosted realhostip.com DNS resolver
  service will be going offline this summer. It is currently used by 
  CloudStack installations as a default installation configuration option. 
  Best practice for production installations include changing this to a 
  local solution, however we are aware that many installations do not make
  this change. We will be informing our user community of this news during 
  our 4.3.0 release announcement, and have already committed a patch that 
  removes the need for this external service from 4.3.0 onward.
* The project is about to go into feature freeze for Apache CloudStack 4.4.0.
* The documentation has made the proposed transition from the publican 
  docbook format to .rst format. It is too early to tell if this had the 
  desired effect on lowering the barriers for user contributions.
* The community is working with TLF to organize the upcoming CCC14NA 
  conference in Denver, with the event obviously being co-located with 
  ApacheCon NA.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Continuum Project  [Brent Atkinson]

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security,
and integration with popular build tools and source control management
systems.

The heightened activity cited in the last report resulted in a temporarily
build to address the remote execution vulnerabilities in Apache Struts 2 
that lead to vmbuild being compromised and subsequently disabled by the
infrastructure team. The build has been running on vmbuild without incident
since January, 7 2014.

The last release was Continuum 1.4.1, on January 7, 2013. A release including
fixes for the previously mentioned vulnerabilities is still pending.

As expected, there has been low volume on the mailing lists and in the issue
tracker.

There have been no new committers since last cycle. The last committer was
added December 8, 2010 and the last PMC member was added on September 2, 2012.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex SDK 4.11.0 was released on 10/28/13.
-Voting is in progress for SDK 4.12.0
-Apache Flex Installer 2.7.0 was also released on 10/28/13.
-Voting is also in progress for Installer 3.0.0 which has the new
 capability to use Ant script syntax to drive the install process.

ACTIVITY
Activity in Apache Flex continues to be in two main areas:  improvements
to the existing Adobe Flash Platform-dependent code base, including the
releases listed above, and prototyping ways to create a version of Flex
that is independent from the Adobe Flash Platform.  There is another group
working on Maven-related tools for the existing code base.

In the past three months we've seen:
- Continued JIRA activity (more bugs raised than resolved however)
- More committers becoming active again.
- Fewer new folks contributing and eventually becoming committers.

Other highlights:
-Over 70 bugs have been fixed in 4.12.0.
-Three committers will be giving presentations on Flex at ApacheCon 2014.

Code Donation Update
-FlexUnit was donated but has yet to be formulated into a release.
-Swiz donation is still pending.  The donator has not filed the paperwork.
-BlazeDS donation paperwork was submitted but the code is not yet in the
 repo because it was discovered that some pieces were missing.  We hope to
 get the missing pieces soon.  The missing pieces are stuck in IP review at
 Adobe.

COMMUNITY
-One person who has been helpful on the mailing list and in JIRA was
 invited as a committer and declined.
-No other candidates for new committer or promotions of committers to PMC
 in this reporting period.
-A non-committer claims to be starting on a book about Apache Flex.
-Latest analytics include over 3000 hits per day on the website during the
 work week (less on weekends).
-There were more than 14,000 installs of 4.11.0 since its release.
-It feels like there is more interest from users based on activity on
 users@.
-Slight decrease in activity-level and number of committers working on SDK
 repo but more activity and committers working on FlexJS.
-Several Apache Flex committers will be presenting at the 360 Flex
 conference in May

TRADEMARKS
-The new version of Flex is going to be called FlexJS.  We have begun
 associating the TM symbol with FlexJS per advice from trademarks@
-This site is hopefully in compliance with Apache trademark policy
 http://www.madeinflex.com/terminos-legales/

INFRASTRUCTURE
* I'm still hoping to find time to resolve INFRA-4380 (attachments in old
Flex bugs).

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Gump seems to create useful results for the few projects that use it.
Activity spiked when JUnit dropped Ant build support, very little
activity apart from that.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The JUnit team decided to drop the Ant build and switch to "Maven
only".  Gump used Ant to build JUnit and the migration caused a few
hiccups along the way.  Three different people modified a few
descriptors over a period of several days until things were back to
normal.  No other activity.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.  The most
recent addition to the PMC was in December 2006 when we added Sander
Temme.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Hive Project  [Carl Steinbach]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Apache Hadoop. It
provides SQL to query and manage data (in the form of tables and
partitions stored in HDFS or external systems) and provides a
metastore containing metadata information about the stored data.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Two talks about Allura were accepted for ApacheCon.  A few small patches
  from new contributors.  A guide for new contributors was written.  One
  person has expressed interest in participating in the GSoC with Allura.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Justin Mclean (jmclean):

    IPMC has voted for graduation and just started a vote on
    general@incubator.

--------------------
BatchEE

BatchEE projects aims to provide a JBatch implementation (aka JSR352) and a
set of useful extensions for this specification.

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Build a Community
     We really need to work on this. Mark Struberg will hold a talk 
     about BatchEE on JAX in early May 2014 in Mainz

  2. Ship stable releases
     This looks good so far. We are pretty close on getting 
     a first release out.

  3. Establish an ASF culture. 
     We also need to work on this front. The committer circle does fine
     on the technical side but we really need to raise attention about 
     the importance of structural things like not pulling in too many
     foreign dependencies and shipping board reports in time.


Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None yet. We still have to work on a few things but nothing critical.  I
  will make sure we raise issues if we cannot solve them.


How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community does not yet grow much in terms of committers.  There are
  quite a few interested users though and the project gets used in
  production projects already.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have missed reporting for 2 consecutive months due to time constraints
  of the involved leaders. We will report the next 3 month to show our
  commitment

Date of last release: 

  none yet. We are preparing to release 0.1-incubating within 
  the next 2 month.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?
  
  We still have the initial set of committers.

DataFu

DataFu provides a collection of Hadoop MapReduce jobs and functions in
higher level languages based on it to perform data analysis. It provides
functions for common statistics tasks (e.g. quantiles, sampling), PageRank,
stream sessionization, and set and bag operations. DataFu also provides
Hadoop jobs for incremental data processing in MapReduce.

DataFu has been incubating since 2014-01-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building ASF community
  2. Release
  3. Remaining incubator paperwork

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  More contributions have been received from Jian Wang, who has also 
  been voted in as the newest committer and PPMC member.  A talk
  is planned at the Apache Pig meetup to be held on March 14th.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Three JIRAs have been opened, four have been closed.  The project has 
  migrated from Ant to the Gradle build system, which will make it easier 
  to add libraries for Hive, Crunch, etc.

Date of last release: 

  None. Second month of incubation.

DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images
and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.
smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that data, APIs
will also be created to use and manage it.

DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make a release 
  2. Get more contributors 
  3. Grow the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  DeviceMap's activity is very low and has actually gone down in the last
  few months.

  The next step is probably for the podling to consider whether it can
  reasonably expect to grow a community and get more active, or whether it's
  not active enough to graduate as an Apache project.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No changes.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Minimal changes only.

Date of last release:

  None yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Roman Shaposhnik (rvs):

    I will agree that the community activity is very low and the trend is
    not positive. I would encourage mentors to probe around the question of
    potential retirement.

--------------------
Apache: Project Drill

Description:

Apache Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of large-scale
datasets that is based on Google's Dremel. Its goal is to efficiently
process nested data, scale to 10,000 servers or more and to be able to
process petabyes of data and trillions of records in seconds.

Drill has been incubating since 2012-08-11.

Three Issues to Address in Move to Graduation:

  1. Continue to attract new developers and and early users with a variety
     of skills and viewpoints
  2. Continue to develop deeper community skills and knowledge by building
     additional releases
  3. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among
     multiple project members
 
Issues to Call to Attention of PMC or ASF Board:

  None
 
How community has developed since last report:

  Community awareness and participation were strengthened through a meeting
  of the Bay Area Apache Drill User Group in San Jose sponsored by Yahoo!
  This event expanded participation to include many new to Drill and
  particularly those interested as potential users (analysts rather than
  developers).  

  Speakers included Drill project mentor Ted Dunning from MapR, Data
  Scientist Will Ford from Alpine Data Labs, new Drill committer Julian Hyde
  from HortonWorks and Aman Sinha, MapR Drill engineer.

  Additional events include:

  • Two new Drill committers accepted appointment: Julian Hyde (HortonWorks)
    and Tim Chen (Microsoft).
  • Drill has a new project mentor, Sebastian Schelter.
 
  Mailing list discussions:

  Subscriptions to the Drill mailing lists have risen to 399 on dev list and
  308 on the user list and 508 uniques across both lists.  There has been
  active and increasing participation in discussions on the developer
  mailing list, including new participants and developers. Participation on
  the user list is growing although still small; mainly activity takes place
  on developer mailing list.

  Tuesday mornings 9am Pacific Time to keep core developers in contact in
  realtime despite geographical separation.

  Community stays in touch through @ApacheDrill Twitter ID, and by postings
  on various blogs including Apache Drill User http://drill-user.org/ which
  has had several updates and through international presentations at
  conferences.

  Viability of community is also apparent through active participation in
  the Bay Area Apache Drill User group meeting in early November, which has
  grown to 440 members.

  Sample presentations:

  • “How to Use Drill” by Ted Dunning and Will Ford, Bay Area Apache Drill
    Meet-up 24 February

Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Community Development:

  Apache Kalumet 0.6-incubating version has been released.

  We are in the way of promoting the documentation on the website.

Project Development:

  We are preparing the 0.7-incubating release.

  Local branches have been created containing:

  - new model and REST API
  - new webconsole (remove of Echo framework)

Before Graduation (most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation):

  - The documentation has been updated and aligned with the 0.6-incubating
    release. The documentation will be promoted on the website and "linked"
    in announcement e-mails.
  - The 0.7-incubating release will fix the graduation issue, especially in
    term of license (removal of Echo2 framework for the UI).

Post Graduation:

  - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept globally
    to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
    deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of:

  None so far. 

Date of the last release: 2013-11-25

log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We probably need to decide what's an acceptable platform/compiler list,
     sort out any remaining hiccups, and then move towards a release.
  2. We need to release 0.11.0 as maintenance release.
  3. We need to make a broader use of the ASF infrastructure (notably the
     CI, as well as improved management of the Jira site - notably with
     triaging), and establish a roadmap for the next releases.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  N/A

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The committers are still getting acquainted with each other and the
  foundation. There's only little need for support currently, but
  from time to time it looks like "old users" notify about themselves.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have applied a lot of bug fixes which were collected in the last
  years in JIRA and fit to a maintenance release, tested on different
  platforms and started to discuss about changes in the used build
  system because of different problems.

Date of last release:

  2008-04-03 was the official, pre-incubation 0.10.0

  Many post-0.10.0 commits exist on trunk which we intend to get out as
  0.11.x.

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, and Spark.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list
     activity
  2. recruit more developers, committers, and PMCers
  3. have at least one more incubator release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  none

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Nothing to report. No new developers. No new committers.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Roman Shaposhnik (rvs):

    A reasonably sized community. Given that it has been incubating for
    about a year now, I'd encourage graduation activity. A few more releases
    would be a good first step.

--------------------

Phoenix is an open source SQL query engine for Apache HBase, a NoSQL data
store. It is accessed as a JDBC driver and enables querying and managing
HBase tables using SQL.

Phoenix has been incubating since 12/11/2013.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1) Perform initial release out of apache incubator followed up quickly by
     two new releases
  2) Make our customers successful and prove value of Phoenix+HBase over
     other alternatives
  3) Attract new committers to the project

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We've been waiting more than two months for our Github issues to be
  imported into our Apache JIRA.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Lots of user/dev traffic on email list and general interest. Received a
  nice patch from an external contributor to replace our CSV loader with the
  Apache Commons CSV loader that's under development.

  No new committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * IP Clearance is complete.
  * Vote is in progress on dev list for on our first release. Prior RC was
    sunk due to the license and notice files not being correct.
  * Working in parallel toward 3.0 and 4.0 releases as well.

--------------------
Storm

Storm is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-performance realtime
computation system that provides strong guarantees on the processing of
data.

Storm has been incubating since 2013-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Growing the community and adding Committers/PPMC Members
  2. Release on a regular basis
  3. Lower the user/developer entry barrier by improving documentation,
    examples, and integration options.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
   
  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have voted in 2 additional Committers/PPMC Members. Since our first
  Apache release, community and committer involvement has increased and we
  hope to continue that trend. 

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We successfully executed our first Apache release. We have migrated the
  storm-project.net website and github wiki to the podling website. To
  support our initial and subsequent releases, we also migrated the Storm
  build system from Leiningen to Apache Maven.

Date of last release: 

  2014-02-22

--------------------
Streams

Apache Streams is a lightweight server for ActivityStreams.

Streams has been incubating since 2012-11-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Growing the active developer community  
  2. Making a secondary incubator release
  3. Develop concrete use cases and providing tutorials for users

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?



How has the community developed since the last report?

  Since the last report we have admitted a new committer Carol Hansen, who
  has provided an interface for streams. We have started discussions on
  modules to possible incorporate into Streams, which Steve Blackmon has
  spearheaded. We have also received pull requests from outside developers
  and started a migration from svn to git. Discussions have also begun on
  schema clarification which is a pressing issue as the project becomes
  standardized.  

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A substantial commit was made by Steve Blackmon including a Twitter
  Firehose attachment and a Apache Storm. It has laid the ground work for
  additional attachments. A Lucene connector and Elastic Search connector
  are being planned.

Date of last release: 

  2013-01-09

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Tajo

Tajo is a distributed data warehouse system for Hadoop.

Tajo has been incubating since 2013-03-07.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Apache Tajo graduation IPMC vote has been passed.
     (http://markmail.org/message/qq4mxzgc4h5ripkr)
  2. 
  3. 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Some committers have presented Tajo project in some conferences and
  meetups.  Especially, Keuntae Park, one of the committers, will present
  Tajo in ApacheCon.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have resolved more than 200 issues since the last report.  There have
  been real users of Tajo project.  They are giving many feedbacks obtained
  from real use cases.  We are improving Tajo from their feedbacks.
  Recently, we have started the works on multi-tenancy.

Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication.
It can be used like email, chat, or a document.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make a release
  2. Expand the community
  3. Decide on future path (application framework, or web application)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Around the time of the last report, there was discussion on the list about
  shutting down the project due to a lack of activity.  Since then, we have
  had 3 new developers submit patches adding new features to Wave, pointing
  out bugs, and picking up older features that stalled before completion.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Several major patches adding support for MongoDB, full text search, and
  date filtering to Wave have been submitted for review.
  Some of the older ideas (e.g. the email bridge robot) have been picked up
  by new developers.

Date of last release: 

  N/A

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Uwe Schindler]

The Apache Lucene project develops open-source search software.


TLP
---

No new PMC members were added in the last quarter.  The most recent PMC
member addition happened in April 2013.

We added three new committers in the last quarter: Areek Zillur, Benson
Margulies, Anshum Gupta.

We ack'ed two mentor requests for Google Summer of Code 2014.  The following
committers will be available to mentor GSoC students: Michael McCandless,
David Smiley


Lucene Core and Solr
--------------------

Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit.

Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core.

In the last quarter we made three releases of both Lucene Core and Solr:

 - 4.6.1 on 28 January 2014
 - 4.7.0 on 26 February 2014

The corresponding Apache Solr Reference Guides were released
as PDF versions, generated from the Confluence Wiki:

 - 4.7 on 4 March 2014

The community is very active.


Open Relevance Project
----------------------

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene and others
tools for judging the quality of search and machine learning approaches.  The
community is not very active, but we don't expect it to be very high volume
either as it is a niche area.


PyLucene
--------

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is almost
entirely an automated port, so this project will never require a lot of
developers.  The user community is active.

In the last quarter we made one release of PyLucene:

 - 4.6.1-1 on 14 February 2014

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache MRUnit Project  [Brock Noland]

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
 * The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 1.0.0, released on
 * May 21, 2013. This was MRUnit's first release since graduation in May 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
 * Voting on release 1.1.0rc0 is now open
 * Development activity continues as can be seen from the following
report: http://s.apache.org/QMa
 * 4 JIRA's was resolved since the last report.
 * Mail traffic is largely on the DEV list. Messages since Jan 1st:
dev 20, user 14

COMMUNITY
 The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
 the last report.


Currently there are:
 * Total of 38 subscribers to the developer list.
 * Total of 80 subscribers to the user list.
 * Total of 10 committers
 * Total of 10 PMC members

ISSUES
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

*Releases*
* "Apache OFBiz 11.04.04" has been released in February 18, 2014: this is
 a bug fix release of the 11.04 branch
* the stabilization of the latest release branch 13.07 is mostly complete
 and we are preparing to issue the first release out of it (13.07.01)
* we are also backporting bug fixes to the other active release
 branch 12.04: soon we will probably issue one release for it

*Community and Project*
* no new committers or PMC members have been added in this quarter; the
 last committer was Paul Foxworthy (paulfoxworthy), invited in
 November 2012; the last PMC member was Erwan de Ferrieres (erwan),
 invited in December 2009
* mailing list traffic and commits are lower than in the past years but they
  are still relevant
* ApacheCon 2014: OFBiz will be represented by a presentation by me 
  ("Development of a Groovy based DSL for Apache OFBiz") and by a tutorial by
  another member of the PMC, Anil Patel ("Introduction to Developing
  Application for Apache OFBiz Framework")
* there is an ongoing discussion, within the PMC/committers group and in the
  community, about the current status of the OFBiz project; over-simplifying
  the two positions are the following:
1) the ones that are worried by the fact that the project's progress is slower
    than in the past (several historical committers are indeed less active) and
    push to get more committers and PMC members onboard
2) the ones that believe that slowing down is natural in a project that is
    reaching a stability phase and, considering the great complexity of the
    OFBiz codebase, it is important to only invite contributors that 
    clearly demonstrate a deep knowledge of the framework in order to maintain
    and improve its quality and stability over time
** it is my personal belief that addressing the concerns of both groups is
    important and I will try to encourage and facilitate a constructive
    discussion about these topics; hopefully, the project will establish
    the right rules and mechanisms to enlarge the committers base and 
    maintain a high quality code

*Infra/Legal*
We have no issues.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparison of remote 
sensing observations to climate model outputs.  

Project Activity:
OCW just graduated from Incubator at the last Board Meeting. Recent
development has been focused on improving the evaluation UI and expanding
toolkit functionality through new metric additions. Most of the mailing list
interaction has been focused around the recent graduation of the project
along with other changes being made, such as the transition to using git.

Other Activity:
Michael Joyce and Maziyar Boustani will be giving a presentation on OCW 
at ApacheCon 2014.

Issues for the Board:
None

When was the last release:
2013-10-11

When was the last committer or PMC member elected:
2013-06-21

Any legal concerns?
LEGAL-193 was opened because there is code that lacks proper licensing 
that was integrated into the OCW codebase some time ago. The author of 
the original work has been contacted with regards to attaching an 
explicit license to their work so it can be integrated into the project.
We're waiting for a response back.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.

Status:
Still slow but pretty steady traffic these last three months.  It appears
there were several new people starting Pivot projects, so there were spikes
in the User list traffic.  There have definitely been some things brought
up that could use some development attention in the coming months, as well
as some ideas for future development (integration with Piccolo2D among them).

There is still development going on for the 2.1 version, although I think
the 2.0.4 (maintenance) version is probably stable.  There have been only
four new issues opened in JIRA since the last report, and three were
resolved.  So, basically the product seems to be pretty stable and the
PMC are busy with other things at the moment.

Issues:
None that I know of.

Releases:
Last release was 2.0.3, published 01 Aug 2013.

Branding/Naming issues:
None.

Legal issues:
None.

Infrastructure Issues/Needs:
We have been trying to figure out what's happening with the Apache Extras
site (hosted on Google Code).  ComDev was looking into things as of October
and Luciano said in early January that they were still waiting on Google
contacts for an answer.  I can't follow the email discussion which is on
a "members-only" mailing list.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Gert Vanthienen]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status

We have lost a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality
are being maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

In the past month, we've had a discussion on the users@ mailing list about
the status of the project and whether or not ServiceMix is offering any added
value over directly using the related projects. We did get quite a bit of
positive feedback and as a result, we now have more activity again in JIRA 
as well as on the mailing lists.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community

Since our last board report, we added 3 new people to the PMC: Dan Kulp,
Jonathan Anstey and Willem Jiang. The last committer was added in November 
2011.

Community Objectives

The main goal at the moment is getting the Apache ServiceMix 5.0.0 release
out, in which we will drop support for a few features considered obsolete to
ensure it's easier to keep a steady release schedule in the future.

Releases

- Apache ServiceMix Specs 2.4.0 in January
- A set of 22 OSGi bundles in January
- A set of 67 OSGi bundles in February
- A set of 59 OSGi bundles in March

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- We published a 1.2.3 bugfix release on 25 February 2014, 7 days ago.  A 1.3
  release is still on the horizon as an interim before 2.0.

Community & Project:

- Brian Demers graciously fixed the user-reported CVE-2014-0074 and pushed out
  the 1.2.3 hotfix.

- A new Shiro plugin for Apache ActiveMQ has been contributed to (and accepted
  by) the Apache ActiveMQ team.  This allows all aspects of ActiveMQ to be
  secured by Shiro - a nice addition! The plugin is scheduled to be available
  in the upcoming ActiveMQ 5.10 release.

- Efforts towards a 2.0 distribution have picked up on a new dev branch.  We
  will still likely need a 1.3 interim release, but that has been slow-going
  as of late.  Hopefully we can release 1.3 next month.

- User mailing list continues to be quite active.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Description
-----------
SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent email
filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited bulk email,
more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to email headers and
content to classify email using advanced statistical methods. In addition,
SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows other technologies to be
quickly wielded against spam and is designed for easy integration into
virtually any email system.

Releases
--------
3.4.0-rc6 was released on 2/5/14.

3.4.0 was a big release introducing 2+ years of fixes and features. It was
released on 2/11/14.  Thanks to Sally Khudairi and the press team for their
help in announcing this to the world (http://s.apache.org/G6b).

Our rules releases have been fairly consistent with hiccups caused by both the
new 3.4.0 release and a need for more masscheckers.

The release of 3.4.1 is imminent.

No other releases for this quarter.


Community & Development
-----------------------
The most recent addition to our PMC is Adam Katz added on 2013-01-30.

The most recent addition to the committers is Joe Quinn added on 2014-02-27.

We also have 3 contributors invited to submit a CLA on the project and begin
moving towards committer karma.

We cleaned up
https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#spamassassin fixing two
users with name problems (Henrik and Doc)

We also cleaned up the PMC by removing the following PMC members who are now
considered emeritus by the project and which the board approved unanimously:
    - Theo Van Dinter
    - Matt Kettler
    - Daryl C. W. O'Shea
    - Daniel Quinlan
    - Dale 'Doc' Schneider
    - Malte S. Stretz "

Our RuleQA dev list has been active and community support is good allowing the
project to publish rules more consistently.  

The project users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

The project dev list has been active with both committers and community
members contributing.

We have migrated our website and dist to svnpubsub.

We are waiting on CentOS VM to transfer our zones and zones2 server off of
Solaris (Bug 6886) 

We are working on getting our Jenkins build slave working under FreeBSD
instead of Solaris1 (Bug 6887).


Project Branding Requirements
-----------------------------
James Thompson at cPanel, Inc. drew and donated a new logo for the project.  

The website was revised considerably with the new logo and the new release of
3.4.0.  Therefore, here is a report on Project Branding Report Checklist:

    DONE - Project Website Basics : homepage is project.apache.org

    DONE - Project Naming And Descriptions : use proper Apache forms, describe
product, etc.

    DONE - Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
www.apache.org included

    DONE - Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
footers, etc.

    IN PROCESS - Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo
on your site - NOTE: Pending TM being added to one version of the logo to make
the announcement for the new logo.

    DONE - Project Metadata : DOAP file checked in and up to date

    DONE - added Read PMC Branding Responsibilities


Issues
------

As the project continues to battle spam, we find we are working quite often on
rules and related anti-spam resources that are not code such as real-time
blacklists (RBLs).  I believe there is considerable value to the project, the
foundation and the anti-spam community if we were to spearhead these resources
under the ASF umbrella.  I have begun the framework at
https://raptor.pccc.com/raptor.cgim?template=RBL with the intention to run
this under the project if permitted.  I would like feedback if this is
possible or if it needs to be run outside of ASF.

No other issues requiring board attention.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

The project recently became a TLP and continues to grow in terms of community
size. We switched all our infrastructure out of the incubator and to
spark.apache.org domains / repos (though the old site still needs a redirect).
We have a new minor release being finalized for later this month, and a Spark
1.0 release targeting end of April. Recent activity includes new machine
learning algorithms, updating the Spark Java API to work with Java 8 lambda
syntax, Python API extensions, and improved support for Hadoop YARN.

Releases:

Our last few releases were:

Feb 2, 2014: Spark 0.9.0-incubating
Dec 19, 2013: Spark 0.8.1-incubating
Sept 25, 2013: Spark 0.8.0-incubating

Committers and PMC:

The last committers and (podling) PMC members were added on Dec 22, 2013.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Greg Reddin]

Apache Tiles is a templating framework for modern Java applications.

General:

This has been a very slow quarter for Apache Tiles. There have not been any
software releases or PMC changes in this quarter. There have been a few threads
on the user@ mailing list, but even that traffic seems to have slowed down for
the time being. The ongoing slow pace of the project continues to be something
to keep an eye on, but I don't believe it is a cause for concern at the moment.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]

General:
  Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
  responsiveness on both dev and user lists.

Issues:
  There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Releases:
  * Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC10 - alpha, 2013-12-26
  * Apache Tomcat 8.0.1 - beta, 2014-02-02
  * Apache Tomcat 8.0.2 (not released)
  * Apache Tomcat 8.0.3 - beta, 2014-02-11
  * Apache Tomcat 7.0.48 (not released)
  * Apache Tomcat 7.0.49 (not released)
  * Apache Tomcat 7.0.50 - 2014-01-08
  * Apache Tomcat 7.0.51 (not released)
  * Apache Tomcat 7.0.52 - 2014-02-17
  * Apache Tomcat 6.0.38 (not released)
  * Apache Tomcat 6.0.39 - 2014-01-31
  * Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.38 (not released)
  * Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.39 - 2014-03-11
  * Apache Standard Taglib 1.2.0 (not released)
  * Apache Standard Taglib 1.2.1 - 2014-01-02

Development:
  There was lots of development activity on Apache Tomcat 7
  and Apache Tomcat 8. Recently some work has been done on
  new NIO2 connector.
  There was the first release of Apache Standard Taglib 1.2, an
  implementation of JSTL 1.2 (JSR 052). It is the first release
  of a tag library, after migrating Apache Taglibs project from
  Apache Jakarta to Apache Tomcat several years ago. It is the
  first release that implements JSTL 1.2 specification.

Community:
  There were no changes in community since the last report.
  We have organised a day long Tomcat Summit for ApacheCon.
  Topics for discussion are currently based around future development
  direction but any attendee is welcome to add their own topic(s).

Security:
 * CVE-2013-2067 - Important: Session fixation
   FORM authentication associates the most recent request
   requiring authentication with the current session.
   By repeatedly sending a request for an authenticated
   resource while the victim is completing the login form,
   an attacker could inject a request that would be executed
   using the victim's credentials.
 * CVE-2013-2071 - Moderate: Information disclosure
   Bug 54178 described a scenario where elements of a previous
   request may be exposed to a current request. This was very
   difficult to exploit deliberately but fairly likely to happen
   unexpectedly if an application used AsyncListeners that
   threw RuntimeExceptions.
 * CVE-2013-4590 - Low: Information disclosure
   Application provided XML files such as web.xml, context.xml,
   .tld, .tagx and .jspx allowed XXE which could be used to
   expose Tomcat internals to an attacker. This vulnerability
   only occurs when Tomcat is running web applications from untrusted
   sources such as in a shared hosting environment.
 * CVE-2013-4322 - Important: Denial of service
   The fix for CVE-2012-3544 was not complete.
   It did not cover the following cases:
   chunk extensions were not limited
   whitespace after the : in a trailing header was not limited
 * CVE-2014-0050 - Important: Denial of Service
   It was possible to craft a malformed Content-Type header for
   a multipart request that caused Apache Tomcat to enter an
   infinite loop. A malicious user could, therefore, craft a
   malformed request that triggered a denial of service.

Trademark:
  Detailed status:
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/tomcat/trademark-status.txt
  We have received a request from Canonical to use the Tomcat logo to
  identify their Tomcat installation bundle for JuJu, their virtualised
  platform. We intend to grant them permission to do so (with some
  constraints).

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* Development progress was a bit slow over the holidays and January but is
  picking up.

* Work has been completed to improve support for cluster reservations which
  are distributed across different management nodes.

* Work continues to fix some minor issues. We hope to create a release late
  spring or early summer which will include support for new features
  including provisioning on OpenStack, Windows 8.1 images, and nested
  hypervisor provisioning.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Whirr Project  [Andrew Bayer]

Whirr is a library for running services like Hadoop or ZooKeeper in the cloud.

Releases:
No new releases this quarter. Last release was 0.8.2, April 2013.

Community: 
The PMC composition did not change, and we had no new committers since the last
report. The last PMC change was the addition of Andrew Bayer in November of
2012, and the last new committer was Graham Gear, also in November of 2012.

Issues:
The project attempted a release vote last month on 0.9.0 and no one
voted. We will be trying again shortly, but the project looks to be
moribund, sadly.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic,
component oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Wicket is 10 years old
- Wicket 7 is moving along
- Promoted experimental modules to non-experimental
- Released Wicket 6.13.0, 6.14.0, 1.5.11, 1.4.23
- Fixed CVE-2013-2055, CVE-2014-0043
- No new committers or members were added in this period

Date last committer added: 12 July 2013

10 year anniversary

From what we could gather from our archives, long time committers'
memories and creator Jonathan Locke, Wicket was conceived somewhere in
april 2004. It was not called that but when it was open sourced in
august 2004 the project was named Wicket. The project tried a start at
codehaus, but moved to sourceforge quickly when it took very long to
get resources allocated. The next couple of years Wicket grew into a
nice community and after a rather short courtship moved to Apache and
is still a healthy, if mature community. 

Most first timers are still listed on the PMC and still have their
commit bits, even if their involvement has grown silent over the years.

While Wicket was grown by an exceptional community of developers, I'd
like to thank especially Jonathan Locke, for his creation of Wicket and
his foresight to invite a community to take over the project and take
Wicket further than we all could have imagined.

Wicket 7

Our development branch is still being worked on but reaches the point
where we can release betas. One thing worthy of note is the addition of
a new feature that loosens some of our strict rules of matching markup
hierarchy with a Java component hierarchy. This solves one of the most
hated 'features' since 1.0.

Experimental modules

We added some experimental modules in the beginning of the Wicket 6
timeframe, promising to graduate them when reaching maturity. The time
came for several modules to graduate from experimental to core module:

 - Bean validation support
 - CDI 1.1 support
 - Native websocket support

Other experimental modules will remain either experimental or will be
'sunsetted'.

Releases and CVEs

Several maintenance and security releases have been performed, solving
two CVE's across our full range of releasable code: 1.4, 1.5 and 6.x.

CVE-2013-2055 allowed access to web templates stored with a Wicket
application. This is fixed in 1.4.23, 1.5.11 and 6.8.

CVE-2014-0043 allowed querying for the existence of particular classes
in the classpath by issuing requests to special urls handled by Wicket.
This only affects applications using 1.5 or 6.x and users are advised
to upgrade to 1.5.11 or 6.14.0

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Junqueira]

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed systems.
 
Bug-fix release 3.4.6 has been voted this week and we are in the process
of publishing it.

Trunk is still under development for an eventual 3.5.0 release. A couple
of important improvements on the way for 3.5.0:
 
- One important new feature in 3.5.0 will be the ability to reconfigure
a ZooKeeper ensemble. This feature was discussed a long time in
ZOOKEEPER-107 and we have converged and committed it;
- We are also focusing on a number of improvements over the code that
performs recovery. In particular, we are targeting an implementation that
avoids sending and taking unnecessary snapshots, which reduces time to
recover in the presence of crashes.
 
Also, the release is supposed to address scalability, jdk7 and openjdk support,
maven build/rel, testing and audit logging. There are other various patches
we are working on related code cleanup and refactoring.
 
Note that the status of releases hasn't changed since the last board report.
3.5.0 release date is not defined yet. 
 
No infrastructure issues.
 
Community:
 
Mailing list activity is moderate and the number of patch reviews and
commits has dropped significantly. 
 
* 10 active committers representing 8 unique organizations. No change to
the list of committers.
*  9 active PMC members representing 7 unique organizations. No change to
the list of PMC members.
* 421 subscribers on dev (up from 408 since December 2013).
* 927 subscribers on user (up from 891 last quarter).
* 1891 jira issues have been created to date (58 more since December
2013)

========
Apache BookKeeper (subproject)

Bookkeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance logging
service. The project also includes Hedwig which is a highly scalable
Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper and Bookkeeper with strong
durability guarantees.

We are currently working towards the 4.3.0 release, which is in its
final phase now. We project that it will be released early in April.
This release includes a lot of improvements to the bookie on-disk
performance, a new statistics framework, and protobuffer protocol
support along with numerous bugfixes.

We will also release a bugfix release on the 4.2 branch, 4.2.3, in the
next fortnight.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Lenya Project  [Richard Frovarp]

The Apache Lenya CMS is a Cocoon based XML/XHTML content management
system.

Development:

Last release: 2.0.4 on 2011-03-14

Community:

Last change to community was PMC addition in October 2011.

Activity:

The main question from the board was project activity.

The project has experienced a downturn in activity over the past 12-18
months. Activity has dropped to near zero.

Casual observation of participation indicates that there are enough active
PMC members to act on the needs of the project. However, an inquiry as to
those that were willing to participate actively in the project on votes if
necessary only resulted in two PMC members showing interest. This means that
there may not be enough PMC votes to take action on the project. The last
vote required of the PMC was October 2011.

If interest in PMC members does not pick up before the next reporting
quarter, the Attic may be the best course of action. There currently are no
committers or contributors that could be promoted to PMC status.
