 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Last month, I asked all PMCs to review their committee records, and
       highlighted some known issues. Overall, I believe the records are in
       good shape. Thanks to the PMCs that responded quickly to the request.
       I was also encouraged that some took the opportunity to think about
       inviting new members they'd noticed were not listed.

       I updated the reporting guidelines for PMCs to include more detail
       about how the reporting process works, and to address some regular
       comments made [http://svn.apache.org/r1628351]. I intend to send them
       with a reminder to the PMCs this month.

       Opportunistically, I was able to meet with Ross and David Nalley while
       in San Francisco last month, which is described in the President's
       report. I also attended a meeting of the TODO Group while there,
       though have nothing to report from it.

       I was contacted by a project looking to join the ASF, and directed
       them to the Incubator proposal process. I've not received any further
       response.

       As Sally reports, I've been writing an introductory blog post for the
       series she is planning - a draft is on the press list for anyone that
       wants to provide input.

    B. President [Ross]

       Melissa, as EA, continues to ensure the foundation continues to tick over from
       day to day. Notable items this month are the completion of all TAC
       arrangements for ApacheConEU. Melissa explicitly calls out Jan Iversen and
       thanks him for his contributions to the process.

       EVP, myself and Melissa have explored a number of CRM options to replace the
       many calendars and spreadsheets spread across the foundation that Melissa
       works with. It is felt that a full blown CRM is overkill for our needs,
       however Melissa is exploring a custom option with the Apache OfBiz project.
       Melissa is driving this exploration at her own pace in response to her own
       level of frustration in each area. Her first area of focus is therefore
       Fundraising which works to a specific timeline and requires good records of
       past communications.

       Brand Management reports a quieter month which has allowed public policy
       documents to be updated to ensure PMCs are given the ability to approve
       non-controversial trademark use. I've not had the time to review these updates
       yet, but will do so in the coming month. Feedback from interested Directors is
       welcome. I have, however, observed at least three cases in the last month in
       which a faster resolution of a request was possible by referring the enquiry
       to the appropriate PMC.

       At the time of writing there is no Fundraising report. Our EA continues to
       ensure fundraising actions are completed, some details are in the EA report.
       Upayavira has asked for volunteers to take on the role of VP Fundraising, to
       date we have two strong candidates.  I would like to thank Upayavira for
       staying on for nearly a year when I requested that he document the processes
       and ensure Melissa is up to speed before stepping down. Fundraising is now in
       a good shape as a result.

       Marketing and Publicity has conducted more of the "usual" activities, but
       there are a few items of note. Firstly the Powered By Apache logo's are now
       available (http://apache.org/foundation/press/kit/). All PMCs are encouraged
       to use these logo's. Enquiries should be sent to press@apache.org. Secondly,
       Sally is working with a number of people across the foundation to bring
       together a series of blog posts to showcase ASF operations/achievements as
       part of its 15th anniversary. Finally, a new homepage for the foundation site
       is in progress - no firm date for a draft is available at this time.

       Infrastructure has launched a code signing service in trial mode. Two projects
       having successfully shipped signed artifacts. Two more projects are in the
       process of entering the trial. The long term work on improving monitoring of
       our services continues as does the process of automating our infrastructure.
       There have been many reactive demands on the infra team this month with
       significant problems with a services and many security alerts. As always -
       thanks to David and the team for keeping the foundation servers alive.

       The Travel Assistance report is missing at this time. However, see above
       comments from EA report.

       VP Infrastructure, our chairman and I met over coffee recently. The main topic
       of conversation was the need for us to get a handle on how to manage and scale
       our infrastructure as the foundation continues to grow. There are many aspects
       to this, some of which have been discussed before. However, the core
       discussion point was having the board set expectations for Infrastructure from
       a strategic planning perspective. David feels that he is making decisions
       today that will affect the foundation for three years plus and he does not, at
       this time, feel he has sufficient information to make such decisions.

       We also met with the ToDo group. No immediate action is expected on the part
       of the ASF. All three of us are on their announcement list and connected to
       key folks should anything come up for us.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        Discussion of BitCoin donations continues.  A very useful resource
        was passed along regarding the SFLC and their interpretation of
        BitCoin and things to look out for:
        
        http://s.apache.org/guK
        
        Regarding the Audit, after a very productive call with the President,
        Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Tom from Virtual and Brian the CPA
        on retainer for the audit and helping us work 990 tax submission,
        we decided that we will not audit 2014 accounts and will instead
        focus on a correct 990 for 2014. We will push the full audit off
        until April 30, 2015. Williams Overman Pierce, LLP will prepare our
        990 return for the year ending April 30, 2014 and they have already
        filed a form 8688 for us providing a 3 month extension to submit
        our taxes.
        
        There is an open inquiry to the Treasurer’s Office to handle TAC
        reimbursements on the ground for students/etc.  attending ApacheCon
        EU 2014 in Budapest. The Treasurer just replied to the inquiry and
        is working with Virtual to figure out the best practice for remittance.
        
        Various requests for sponsorship status have been promptly dealt
        with by the EA and by Virtual.
        
        Getting a new set of ASF credit cards is near complete, in coordination
        with the ASF President, the EA and Virtual.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The office of secretary is running smoothly. In September 53 iclas, six cclas,
       and two grants were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        Most of my time this month has been spent on ApacheCon EU.
        
        ApacheCon EU is one month away. We currently have about 170
        registrations, which is somewhat below what we wanted at this
        point, but we do tend to get a surge towards the end.

        We are working with numerous Meetup groups in Budapest to get
        the word out about the event, and are providing space to some of
        these groups to hold meetings during the event.

        Cassandra and Spark have both stepped up to fill some of the
        open slots in the schedule, and are working hard to bring an
        audience for those talks. Many other projects, particularly in
        the Big Data space, are working hard to get the word out about
        the event.

        One of our keynotes has been withdrawn, and we will be replacing
        it Bror Salmelin, the adviser for Innovation Systems at the
        European Commission. We also have keynotes from Hugh Howey,
        bestselling author of Wool, and David Nalley, VP Infrastructure
        at the ASF.

        ApacheCon North America is moving along. The LucidWorks people
        have agreed to colocate their event with ApacheCon this year,
        and Cloudstack will be running their event at ApacheCon again.
        we're talking with other projects about doing the same, and I'll
        be focusing more on this event as soon as we're done with
        Budapest.

 8. Discussion Items
    Greg: discuss Kevin's proposal to contract services to third party
    Ross: possible down side: knowledge of how infrastructure works would transfer outside foundation
    David: would make it difficult to move away from third party in future
      don't know how much it would cost so can't estimate cost effectiveness
      might affect volunteers if third party would be responsible for performance of volunteers
    Kevin: has experience with combination paid staff/volunteer
      bigger issue: don't want to run afoul of labor laws
    Ross: two kinds of infra: core and other; perhaps outsource only core
      preparation underway to clean up SLAs for contractors
    Greg: good direction
    Ross: more discussion with Kevin will follow
    Greg: concerned about legal contractor status
    Kevin: foundation has outgrown infra as was set up years ago
    Ross: need to continue this discussion
    Tom: Virtual can also provide some services
    
    Action: Greg to coordinate response.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Brett: Remind PMCs to check their committee records, report on dates
          Status: committee records: done, finally. Will follow up. Will be

                  changes to guidelines

    * Rich: Ask Axis whether the community is really healthy? Seems Synapse is
            asking

          Status: done. Hasan replied on board@ that such releases are simply
                  releases of one or a few of the many modules that Clerezza
                  contains. Nothing to worry about.

           new PMC members

          Status: Began conversation with Alex Harui about the email
          thread in question, and the concerns raised in it. Agree that
          the subject line of the thread was way over the top, but the
          concerns raised in the thread were, I think, legitimate ones.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

A quieter month than usual.

We made good progress updating public policy documentation to allow
per-project approvals for many permissions requests, including a centralized
Contact Us page for third party questions.

Sally and the press team rolled out the Powered By Apache set of per-project
logos which look great.  Some projects may wish to request changes to their
logos (in some cases, to include just a graphic logo and not wording); they
should contact press@ with specific requests and be sure to help update the
underlying graphics.

Two podlings are in the process of changing branding due to feedback or issues
during the PODLINGNAMESEARCH process.  While this in some cases may result in
additional website and infra related work if a change is made, it is difficult
to see how it can be avoided to ensure that the ASF both respects pre-existing
third party trademarks, as well as ensuring our ability to defend our
top-level project marks in the future.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
none

Finances:
==========
Domains: $85


Operations Action Items:
========================
None

Short Term Priorities:
======================

Code Signing
------------
The code signing service is now live. Two projects have successfully shipped 
signed artifacts. Two more projects are in various stages of signing up, being vetted
or testing out the service.  

Long Range Priorities:
======================

Monitoring
----------
Work has been ongoing to provide monitoring of the underlying hardware many of our 
services depend on, this is still in the early exploratory stages and remains ongoing
Work building on our existing base of service status monitoring to provide insight,
is also ongoing. 
 
Automation
----------
Much progress has been made around automation, multiple services are now fully defined
in configuration management, though we still have much to go. 

Resilience
----------
Exploratory work to evaluate our ability to recover from disaster is underway, but is
still early.

Technical Debt
--------------


General Activity:
=================

The primary US web server that provides foundation and project websites in addition
to mail-search and the moin-moin wiki has been problematic this week. Specifically
we're running into multiple problems occurring at once resulting in tremendous
IO overhead, and leading to very slow responses or outright failures. 

This has been a very busy month from a security perspective. Our Bugzilla instances 
went through multiple rounds of patches in response to 5 related security issues. 
Additionally, we've spent much time responding to Shellshock. 

Uptime Statistics:
==================


Detailed Contractor Reporting
=============================

* Geoffrey Corey

  - Get acquainted with ASF's system and services layout
  - Resolved 7 JIRA tickets
  - Clean out ASF's server racks and old hardware/spare parts at OSU
  - Inventory spare hw at OSU
  - Learn how to do TLP requests
  - Learn how to do svn to gi migrations
  - Setup AOO's mac mini build slave
  - Learn ASF's puppet infrastructure
  - Deploy NTP puppet module
  - Learn how svpubsub and svnwcsub are setup and used, create a puppet module for it
  - Learn how to use AWS to begin migration of TLPs off eos to fix IO issues

* Gavin McDonald

 - Worked on 44 Jira Tickets, closing 30.
 - Infra commits SVN - 59
 - On Call duties.
 - Work with coreyg liasing with hardware to be removed.
 - Installed 2 new machines at OSU, DRACs configured, ready for OS installs
 - Resolve queries from IRC, HipChat and Email (no jira tickets)
 - Work through more Cron noise.
 - Worked with Intervision and organised Warranty renewals/declines.
 - Updating many Ubuntu machines/vms for Bash vuln.
 - Worked on and continiung to work on upgrading the FreeBSD machines. There is much
     work involved as we are breaking free of Tinderbox based updates and going 
     direct to the official repositories. At the same time packages/ports are being
     updated (forcibly) to the new pkg system. The machines done so far are showing 
     no ill signs as of yet but we havent forced an upgrade of all packages, just a 
     few essential ones. I expect as more machines are done, we'll start to see 
     some things break. This is an unavoidable one way trip that we'll deal with.
 - Started looking into automating jira project key renaming, in support of dealing 
   with when projects rename themselves. The Jira cli plugin looks promising, but 
   doesnt seem to support renaming yet (but offers project cloning and deleting).
   Investigating the API directly but that too seems to lack support thus far.
 - Worked on improving Buildbot slaves stability.
 - Worked on improving Pass rate of builds, liaising with projects as neccessary.
 - Restored RAT reports for projects and the RAT master summary pages.
 - In our cwiki, added the ability for projects to access Intermediate HTML for 
   diagnosing formatting issues in PDF exports. (https://cwiki.apache.org/intermediates/)
 - Github to Buildbot to HipChat integration, testing github commits to infra repo

* Chris Lambertus
Tickets:
  * Closed N (I don't know what N is) tickets.

Outages:
   * Troubleshooting and resolution for the vmware host outage.
   * ongoing, www.a.o/mail-search/moin-moin troubleshooting

Puppet/Automation
   * Learning puppet
   * Implemented dovecot and SNMP modules

Monitoring:
   * Researched ways to monitor existing hardware that runs FreeBSD.
   * Began needs analysis and some PoC work around monitoring with
Circonus, collectd, SNMP, etc.

Disaster Recovery
   * Initial research into current state and how we might improve our
disaster readiness.

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

W3C continues to discuss a "webizen" programme to allow individuals
to have a formal stake in W3C.  There is a general sense that
"something" would be a good idea, there are different, changing details.

It does not affect the Foundation directly. It might be interesting to some
committers eventually.

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

Apologies for lack of report last month; I used to trigger the commit
on receiving the 2nd reminder.

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds
arriving at security@. These continue to be dealt with by the security
team.

Some press and researchers believed there was a new Apache worm, but
it wasn't:
http://bighacks.net/chroot-apch0day-apache-exploit-explained/

The Bash vulnerabilities CVE-2014-6271(etc) are being actively
exploited via Apache httpd, most commonly where sites have CGI scripts
written in Bash.  (The exploit conditions does limit the number of
affected servers)

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
and Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

Project Status
--------------

The project has been moving along at a steady pace in the past quarter, at a
similar velocity to the previous two quarters, although in the final weeks
before this report things have quieted down quite a bit. Since the last board
report there have been 32 new issues logged in Jira, with 27 of them being
closed in that time.

Similar to the previous board report, the majority of recent work has been
focused on minor improvements and bug fixes.

There was a minor hiccup in releasing version 0.11.0, when the released maven
artifacts were correctly pushed to Nexus, but not synced to Maven Central. This
was noticed by a user (reported on the user mailing list), and turned out to
be an infrastructure issue resolved in INFRA-8333.

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Community
---------

Community activity has continued to be in line with recent quarters, with an
average of several mails on the developer list per day and an average of a

One committer added this period (Jan Bernhardt)
One PMC member added this period (Andriy Redko)

Community update:
With the release of the 3.0.x versions of CXF, there has been a stead 
stream of questions and reports from users as they upgrade.  The 
community has done a good job resolving issues and trying to push 
new versions out.   3.0.2 has been slightly delayed as we worked with 
other communities (Santuario, WSS4J) to resolve some security issues 
that will be made public after 3.0.2/2.7.13 is released. 

CXF will be well represented at ApacheCon EU with 5 or 6 talks 
scheduled to be about CXF.


Security update:
2 new CVE numbers have been requested and assigned.

-- Overall activity in the past quarter --

There has been relatively little activity this quarter. The mailing list
has been somewhat active but it would appear the bulk of the PMC no
longer has the resources to dedicate the required attention (e.g. there
are still contributions pending approval).

-- Last committers and PMC members elected --

Change of PMC chair 29 May 2013
(Marios S. Andreou takes over from David Lutterkort)

Tomas Sedovic (August 2012) and Dies Koper (December 2012) voted in as
committers.

Dies Koper was voted into the Deltacloud PMC in July 2013.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Pierre-Arnaud Marcelot]

The Apache Directory Project provides directory solutions entirely written
in Java. These include a directory server, which has been certified as
LDAPv3 compliant by the Open Group (ApacheDS), Eclipse-based directory tools
(Apache Directory Studio) and a client API that can be used to communicate
with any directory server (Apache LDAP API).

-- Comment for the Board on a question on our previous Board report --

Greg Stein and the Board asked us about the lack of new PMC Members over the
last six years (since October 2008).

The good news is that we have one new PMC Member (Lucas Theisen) to report
this quarter.
Lucas, who was invited as a committer in January, has proven to be a
valuable member for the project.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

The 2.6 release has branched for release. In addition to bug fixes, it adds
several new features and refines existing work in the 2.x release series.

Among the notable work in YARN: improvements to its fault tolerance and
support for rolling upgrades (YARN-556, YARN-1336), timeline/history server
(YARN-1530), log handling (YARN-2443), admission control/planning
(YARN-1051), support for long-running services (YARN-913), node labels
(YARN-796), and large container allocation (YARN-1769).

Among the notable work in HDFS: tiered storage in archival (HDFS-6584),
in-memory replicas (HDFS-6581), inotify support (HDFS-6634), extended
attributes (HDFS-2006), encryption (HDFS-6134, HADOOP-10150), and a native
client implementation.

In MapReduce, a native collector (MAPREDUCE-2841) offers improved
performance to many deployments.

Work started earlier in the 2.x branch- particularly related to security,
encryption, and high availability- continues apace.

Optiq (currently renaming to Calcite)

Optiq/Calcite is a highly customizable engine for parsing and planning queries
on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access, and in
particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data not
residing in a traditional database.

Optiq/Calcite has been incubating since 2014-05-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete renaming to Calcite.

  2. Re-organize code into org.apache.calcite namespace

  3. Create a product worthy of a "1.0" label.

  4. Improve web site

  5. Build an ASF community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We held our first meetup, a hackathon hosted by MapR. It was well-attended,
  and we attracted a number of new contributors at various skill levels,
  who produced a number of contributions that have since been committed.

  Julian Hyde spoke to over 200 attendees at the Seattle Scalability meetup
  on how Apache Hive uses Apache Optiq to do its cost-based optimization.

  In September, there were 72 messages on dev@, 38 commits, 36 issues created,
  30 issues resolved.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We completed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-51
  and concluded that Optiq was not a viable name.
  We agreed (via PPMC vote and consensus on dev) that Calcite was suitable new
  name, and logged https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-56,
  which has been approved by legal. Now we are part way through renaming;
  see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-8413

  We expect to have a release candidate for apache-calcite-0.9.1-incubating
  to go to a PPMC vote this week.

Usergrid

Usergrid is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) composed of an integrated database
(Cassandra), application layer and client tier with SDKs for developers.

Usergrid has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make another incubating release (most likely 1.1)
  2. Continue to grow the Usergrid community
  3. Document and streamline the Usergrid release process

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
None


How has the community developed since the last report?
The community continues to develop in a positive fashion.  Usergrid was
represented (indirectly) at this years CassandraSummit in San Francisco.
Various mentions of UG at that event, amongst the other community events which
the UG PPMC put together are building the user base.  The #usergrid IRC
channel continues to see people come and go with people being directed to the
mailing lists whenever issues cannot be addressed in a more direct/instant
manner.

How has the project developed since the last report?
The project has come on leaps and bounds post release of Usergrid 1.0
(incubating).  The development (PPMC) team worked very well together, and with
the IPMC to ensure that the 1.0 release went smoothly. The release procedure
was slightly longer than we would have liked however lessons have been learned
and positives have been taken from the process as a whole.  Procedural nuances
have been ironed out and we look forward to a 1.1 release in the near future.
In addition we have been documenting material on the Usergrid Incubation
status page.  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/usergrid.html 
Final note, KUDOS to Rod and Dave from the Usergrid PPMC who acted as release
managers.

We have had a talk and a tutorial accepted at ApacheCon EU [1], [2]
and also a talk at Agile Testing/BDD Conference (UK) [3].

We did have one student in this year's Google Summer of Code 2014 [4],
while he passed his mid-term eval he unfortunately got way-laid and so
we had to fail him for the final eval.

We have had some useful feedback from the community in terms of identifying 
several security issues [5], [6], now addressed and slated for the next release.

However code contributions from the community are meagre (to the point of
non-existent).  One reason is the relatively small size of the community;
another likely cause is the complexity and size of the framework.  We have 
two strategies to mitigate this.  

First, we are retiring unused/redundant components and refactoring and
simplifying the remaining code.  The long-term plan is to refactor Isis into 
a fully JEE7-compliant web architecture, but this will take time.

Second, (and taking inspiration from Apache Wicket's wicketstuff.org companion 
website [7]) we are further slimming down Isis by moving some components out 
of the framework's codebase and into a new "Isis Addons" isisaddons.org 
website [8], hosted on github [9].  The key criteria for moving components 
are if it is functionality that is not part of the framework proper (eg sits 
"on top of" the framework), and/or is likely to require changing at a 
different velocity to the framework.

We hope that these smaller components will attract contributor attention as 
well as building up into a useful library of for the community to use
"out-of-the-box" (thus increasing Isis' broader appeal).


== Development and Releases ==

Isis continues to be developed steadily.  As previously highlighted, most of 
the recent development has been performed by one committer (namely, myself), 
with much of this work sponsored by Eurocommercial Properties NV (see 
previous reports).

However, some additional new development is now being performed by Martin 
Grigorov, himself a committer with Apache Wicket (Isis uses Wicket in its 
web UI).  This work is also being sponsored by Eurocommercial Properties NV.

This quarter we made one new release, v1.6.0 on 28 Jul 2014 [10].

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Hervé Boutemy]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

* General Information

  * SSL was enabled for central during August and Maven 3.2.3 was released
    to use https by default in super POM [1].

  * Description of central repository position in Maven ecosystem has been
    updated to match latest evolutions [2].

  * A lot of plugin releases are done to define common 2.2.1 minimum Maven
    version requirement. We expect in the near future to update the minimum
    requirement to Maven 3.0 (JRE 5), which will permit to make some cleanup
    in plugins code, then Maven core.

  * JDK8 compatibility status: latest informations available in our wiki [3].

    [MCOMPILER-228] identified as JDK 8 bug, fixed in JDK1.8.0_40

  * Compliance with ASF source header policy

    8 plugins have been fixed this quarter.
    Only maven-eclipse-plugin, wagon, surefire and a few components are not yet
    compliant (on 106 release roots).
    We're preparing to enable rat check on every build in next maven-parent
    POM, to ensure full compliance from now on.

  * Update requirements of LICENSE and NOTICE files in source control

    Currently no change cause there is no real guide line nor a definitive
    decision made by the ASF.

  * Source download link requirement

    The site.xml descriptor for all plugins has been changed accordingly to
    reflect the requirements based on MNGSITE-152 [4].
    This means that every new release contains appropriate download link [5]
    and an Apache License link [6].

    Every release which has been reported this quarter contains already those
    links.

    Issue closed: this report is the last one with status on this topic.

* Community

  * Karl Heinz Marbaise joined the PMC (2014-08-25)

  * No new committer this quarter (last added on 2014-03-17)

  * ApacheCon Europe: we don't have any talk, but a few developers said they
    were attending, then expect to meet and discuss about Maven future plans.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache MRUnit Project  [Brock Noland]

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 1.1.0, released on
* June 8, 2014. This was MRUnit's second release since graduation in May 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* 0 JIRA's was resolved since the last report.
* Mail traffic is largely on the DEV list. Messages since July 1st: dev 20,
  user 4
* There is one on-going vote for a new committer

COMMUNITY
* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since the
  last report.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Julien Nioche]

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler 
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene™, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop 
datastructures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

We released Nutch 1.9 in August which fixed 
several important bugs and added quite a few improvements.

There has been no releases of the Nutch 2.x branch since the previous 
report. We are still planning to release 2.3 soon and are waiting for 
a few JIRA issues to be resolved first. The next release will benefit 
from improvements made to Apache Gora.

We succesfully completed our first participation in GSoC and the Nutch
2.X branch now comes packaged with a self contained Apache Wicket-based
Web Application. - See more at [1].

COMMUNITY

There has been no change in the composition of the PMC and committers 
list since Talat Uyarer joined the PMC and committers on 31/03/2014.

The traffic on the mailing lists is at a steady level.

We got 1 talk and 1 workshop accepted for ApacheCon EU. The workshop 
will be conducted by 3 Nutch committers [2].

Nutch and related projects (Tika, Hadoop, Lucene) will probably get used
in a new DARPA project called Memex where 3 current and 1 emeritus
Nutch committers will be involved [3].

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes 
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services, sending
and receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error recovery as 
described by your process definition. It supports both long and short living 
process executions to orchestrate all the services that are part of your 
application.

STATUS
In this reporting period we made some progress towards a 1.3.7 release and 
had a very successful Google Summer of Code project. Fang Zhen could complete 
his project on time and provided a valuable contribution, the OModel 
refactoring, that is now subject to be merged into our master branch. Due to
two memory leak reports, we decided to delay the 1.3.7 release and move it to 
the next reporting period.

RELEASE
No releases in this reporting period.

DEVELOPMENT
The development in this period focussed on bug fixing and some infrastructure 
improvements.

COMMUNITY
Nothing important to report. Last committer was added on Dec 10, 2012, last

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache OpenMeetings Project  [Sebastian Wagner]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AL: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

### Issues for Board Awareness

The Apache OpenOffice community is currently focusing on attracting
new volunteers in code development. This is working well for the
initial involvement and simple code contributions, but we need to
have more resources available for the second step, i.e., mentoring
more significant code contributions. This may require a shift of
internal responsibilities in the project, which in turn may result
in slower activity in some areas.

### Community Development/Outreach Progress

The project did not invite new committers or PMC members since the
last report. The latest committer addition is from May 2014 (tal)
and the latest PMC addition is from November 2013 (fanyuzhen).

Thanks to a recent effort focused on new code volunteers, we are now
seeing many more patches and contributions coming from new
volunteers, but at the same time we are witnessing a reduced level
of activity (in terms of both contributed lines of code and e-mails
to the dev list) from more experienced developers. This will need to
be monitored closely, as the project needs both new and experienced
developers for a smooth progress.

The OpenOffice custom infrastructure (wiki, forum) is still in a
"minimal maintenance" mode. The infrastructure team internal to the
OpenOffice project is insufficient and mostly inactive. Apache Infra
has been providing support and (when possible) timely notifications,
thus easing the task of the internal team.

Several volunteers are getting involved by updating our many native
language websites with the more recent approach (editing the HTML
files rather than working through the CMS).

A new documentation effort for an end-users manual under the ALv2
licence is progressing more slowly than expected on the OpenOffice
Wiki, even though new volunteers show up regularly.

The localization community is growing: OpenOffice 4.1.1, released
21 August 2014, is fully released in 41 languages, 3 of which
(Catalan, Valencian AVL, Valencian RACV) are new with respect to
version 4.1.0.

A survey to know about existing volunteers and their unexpressed
potential (i.e., reasons that may limit their contributions to fewer
fields than the ones they could actually be active in) was launched,
with the aim of analyzing and presenting results by ApacheCon EU.

OpenOffice will have a dedicated track at ApacheCon Budapest, with
talks spanning all the main project areas. But most of the project
committers will not attend the event despite the good location
and promotion, probably a symptom that we need to investigate
other event formats in addition to ApacheCon.

The mailing lists for user support, localization, QA are quite
active, the marketing and documentation lists are moderately active.
Activity in social media is still good. The developer (dev) list
remains very active in terms of messages posted. Community support
forums remain popular with users, with an average of over 100 posts
per day.

### Product/Project Development Progress

Apache OpenOffice 4.1.1, a bugfix release introducing stability and
security fixes, as well as new languages, was published on 21 August
2014.

Activities that are still ongoing, but at a slower pace than
expected, include: actions for an easier installation and
availability on mainstream Linux distributions; a new localization
process, now progressing in the l10n40 branch; a rewritten OOXML
filter, allowing import and (later) export.

The download trend remains very strong: Apache OpenOffice reached
120 million downloads at the end of September 2014.

- enhance the parser
- code cleanup
- enhance rendering
- enhance font handling
- reduce memory footprint

We hoped to release the new major release in the late summer but reality 
proves us wrong. It'll take some more time.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made no releases in the last quarter.

Within the last quarter we saw major development activity for the
upcoming release of Struts 2, which will be a major feature and bug fix
release with more than 140 issues addressed. A test build is available
and currently under community review.

We haven't made too much progress regarding a possible security fix
release for the critical vulnerability in the already EOLed Struts 1
distribution, as reported in the last quarter. We have published a
workaround solution as well as a test builds based on a hardened
commons-beanutil library, but we are still undecided on whether we can
manage to provide a full featured release.

We are about to release a fully reworked web site, including a brand new
Struts logo [1]. The design  was kindly provided by Software Mill, a
polish software development shop our fellow PMC member Łukasz Lenart is
working for.

In August Struts committer Christoph Nenning gave a talk about Struts 2
at JUG Munich, Germany.

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.
Last PMC member addition was on 2013-05-11, last committer addition on
2014-01-06.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.7) has been released 2013-04-29.
  We have made available the a series of beta builds of the upcoming 5.4 release, 
  (most recently, 5.4-beta-22, on 2014-10-10), following successful votes. 
  A release candidate is expected in the coming quarter.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is high. Questions are answered with
  participation of not only the core contributors but also by the community
  at large. Discussion focuses especially around new features of the upcoming
  5.4 release. There are also frequent announcements concerning third-party
  libraries developed entirely outside the Tapestry team.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4 which
  will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other new features.
  At this point we are primarily looking at fixing bugs (from our large backlog)
  and documenting the significant new features.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 2014-04-25.
  The last PMC addition has been Massimo Lusetti on 2012-08-27.

PMC and committer diversity

  PMC and committer diversity is good. To our knowledge no two committers share
  the same employer. Levels of contribution vary over time. 

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org" - completed
 * "Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc." - completed
 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing

   etc." - completed
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo
 * "Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date" - completed

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Massimo Manghi]

Apache Tcl is an umbrella for Tcl-Apache integration efforts. Current
projects are

 * Rivet
 * Websh

Board issues:

 Apache Tcl records were found to have some discrepancies. More
 specifically it was found out that for 3 of the long time PMC
 members no notification record was ever sent to the board.
 We voted to verify every decision made by the PMC and the vote
 result sent to the board.

Community:

No new committers were added. Last committer and PMC member joined
Apache/Tcl in Sept. 2012. We have just voted to invite George
Petasis to join our PMC and we are waiting for the 72 hours time
before formal invite to elapse.

Current number of subscribers to our public mailing lists are

rivet-dev@: 46 subscribers
websh-dev@: 18 subscribers

 + no bug reports filed in this quarter for both Rivet and Websh

Releases:

 + Rivet: we released version 2.2.0 on June 16th, as already said
in our last quarterly report. Starting with July mod_rivet core
functions were radically redesigned and rewritten in a new
experimental module. Currently this code has reached a good
maturity level and last week was finally able to pass our tests.
The goal is to move to a new module version that could overcome
the severe limit imposed on the current stable module which runs
only with the prefork MPM of the Apache HTTP web server.

 + Websh is maintained but no new artifacts were released after
3.6.0b5 (2009-09-24)

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Wookie Project  [Scott Wilson]

Apache Wookie develops software related to implementation of the W3C
Widgets family of specifications.

ISSUES
As mentioned in July’s report, activity in the project has declined
dramatically and the community has not grown in the last year or so.  This
trend has continued, though this might have been exacerbated by the summer
period where there is less activity anyway. The reasons for this remain the
same, in particular the lack of non-proprietary adoption of the W3C widget
specification. 

If this trend continues the team will give consideration to either moving the
project to the attic or subsuming it into RAVE.

RELEASES
Wookie 1.0 was released on 24th February 2014.

ACTIVITY
Work is still being undertaken on Wookie 2.0.

COMMUNITY
Our last committer added was Steve Lee on 21st February 2013.
