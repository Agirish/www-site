 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The last month has been on the quiet side, possibly owing to summer
       vacations. Nothing new to report from my end.

       While I didn't complete it in time for this meeting, I've picked up
       on working to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the board list, as
       discussed in June and July.

    B. President [Ross]

       I'd like to thank the board for their understanding during the last
       month as I dealt with personal issues at the expense of Foundation
       issues. I'm still somewhat behind but catching up.

       OSCON has been and gone. Unfortunately I was not able to attend as
       previously planned, however, there seems to have been no shortage of
       folks to step in and do the work necessary. A big thank you to all
       those who helped with the Booth (Shane Curcuru, Upayavira, Roman
       Shaposhnik, Justin Erenkrantz, J. Aaron Farr, Louis Suarez-Potts,
       David Nalley). Melissa makes a special mention of Dennis Hamilton
       who went above and beyond to help with the booth.

       Our D&O insurance has been renewed, with some difficulty completing
       the appropriate financial information (thanks to Sam who helped out
       here). 

       EA contract has been renewed for another six months. No change to
       the terms.

       There was a significant effort from the Fundraising team,
       coordinated by Upayavira at OSCON. A full report has been submitted
       and while we need more time to see if we can deliver significant
       results from these efforts it is with great pleasure that I can
       report that we believe that a new sponsor will be reported next month
       as a result of their meeting with the team at OSCON. I believe
       fundraising is in a far better position today than it has been for
       some time. My thanks go to Upayavira for driving this. Please see
       the full report for details of the interactions at OSCON (a special
       thank you to Rich Bowen and David Nalley who supported many of these
       meetings). 

       One of the areas that I have fallen behind on during my recent
       personal issues is the directed sponsorship policy requested by the
       CloudStack PMC. This is something I intend to address ASAP. However,
       VP Trademarks has agreed that the PMC should be allowed to manage
       its own marks in accordance with the trademark policies and VP
       Marketing has provided a marketing/promotional strategy to the
       PMC. Furthermore, I have agreed with Virtual that they will be able
       to track such directed sponsorships. It is my belief that the
       barriers CloudStack felt were present have been removed. All that
       remains is for the PMC to take advantage of this (admittedly,
       without a policy the PMC may be wary of making a proposal).

       Trademarks still continues to be a problematic area where our
       existing policies are limiting the effectiveness of our brand
       volunteers and PMCs. It is my belief that since Fundraising is now on
       track and will soon be delivering results from its restructuring and
       effective delegation model, I now hope to work closely with VP Brand
       Management in the coming months so that we can improve projects
       ability to manage their own brands in the same way that multiple
       people are helping on fundraising.

       Marketing, in conjunction with Brand Management and Fundraising has
       created a "Powered by Apache" mark. This will be a part of a broader
       attempt to raise awareness of the inclusion of our software in other
       software out there.

       Infrastructure continues to benefit from the energy of a new
       VP. David is building on the foundations laid by Sam and is
       delivering results. However, the greater level of direction provided
       to our infrastructure team has brought into question our ability to
       use contractors based in the US, it is believed that the IRS might
       classify them as employees. David continues to explore this since
       whilst we do not currently have any US based infra contractors we
       may be bringing some on-board soon. We are working with Virtual
       Inc. to evaluate the problem and identify a solution.

       There is no report from TAC at the time of writing. Melissa,
       however, reports that she has been assisting with preparations for
       ApacheCon EU. There have been some complications but she believes
       all blocks will be removed soon.

       Virtual have indicated that the Audit is currently at a standstill
       because of the limited amount of data available to the
       auditors. Setting up a call between myself, Chris and Sam to try and
       unblock this in September then a quarterly call after that. 

       Finally please see Special Order B for the FY14-15 budget. I request
       that the board approve this budget which incorporates the three
       month interim budget approved in May.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        The Treasurer's office has worked with Virtual over the past month
        to transition more of the operational functionalities of the Treasurer
        role. In particular, Virtual is now responsible for handling
        operational monthly payments to contractors and for invoice and
        Bill remittance.
        
        Virtual has worked with VP, Fundraising, the EA and the President's Office
        to provide Current balances and sponsor funds analysis and projected
        income, which was used both by VP, Fundraising at OSCON for situational
        awareness to sponsors, and to feed into the President's 2014-2015
        budget request.
        
        The Treasurer's Office worked the ASF Audit Lead and President to
        provide a retainer for our CPA conducting the ASF financial audit.
        
        Virtual now has guest access to WFS Financials both Checkings and
        Savings, allowing for statement download and for balance sheet
        generation. Access to Amazon Payments and PayPal have also been
        provided.
        
        Sam Ruby has started to populate Treasurer content at
        http://treasurer.apache.org/.
        
        D&O Liability Insurance was remitted and the Treasurer's Office is
        working with the EA and the President to process the D&O renewal.
        
        An issue regarding the ASF meeting the public funding test is being
        discussed amongst ASF audit participants and the President's Office
        and the Treasurer's Office in reference to a suggestion made during
        OSCON.
        
        The EA and President's Office and Treasurer's Office are discussing
        a review of disbursement of ASF credit cards, and expect a disposition
        soon that may include issuing new credits and moving to a new credit
        card provider.
        
        Virtual is now providing the income and expenses roll up for the
        Treasurer's Report.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       July was a busy month for secretary. 58 iclas, five cclas, 
       and three grants were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        We have announced the schedule for ApacheCon Europe (Budapest,
        November 17-21, 2014) and registration is open. We currently
        have 118 people registered. 

        We have also announced our keynotes, including Douglas Carswell,
        Member of Parliament (Great Britain), Hugh Howey, bestselling
        science fiction author, and David Nalley, VP of Infrastructure
        of the ASF.

        We are in the process of planning the less formal aspects of
        ApacheCon EU, including evening events, the ApacheCon Jam
        Sessions, Lightning Talks, Fast Feather Track, and so on.

        We have tentatively agreed to do ApacheCon North America in
        Austin, Texas, on the week starting April 12th. In the coming
        weeks we expect to sign contracts for that, and the CFP should
        be sent out in the next 30 days.

        This evening (August 20th) David Nalley and I are leading an
        evening session at LinuxCon North America, in Chicago, where
        CIOs and CTOs of local businesses will be attending to learn
        about the Apache Software Foundation, with an emphasis on
        sponsorship opportunities. This event is being covered out of
        the President's discretionary budget, in the absence of a
        fundraising budget at this time.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, tm-registrations@, and board@) and following-up with
appropriate personnel

OSCON:	
•	Setup booth, staffed it, and tore it down
•	As per usual, we had very heavy booth traffic Fundraising/Virtual:
•	Worked w/Virtual to obtain contact at AmEx for credit cards
•	Working with AmEx on obtaining information on credit card options
•	As of this writing, I’m awaiting further information from AmEx on the
possibility of obtaining cards that are tied to the Foundation for financial
responsibility, rather than to the primary card holder personally and the
Foundation.
•	Participated in bi-weekly call with Virtual; working with Lynsey on current
sponsors and invoicing procedures ApacheCon Europe:
•	In communications with Nick and Jan I re assisting with TAC (this should be
in full speed by EOW/early next week
•	Participated in a conference call with a potential new vendor for European
events
•	Introduced Angela to Christian Grobmeier for a possible collaboration for
t-shirts for European events

Trademarks:
•	Coordinating with Shane re TM issues
•	Created a trademarks tracking s/s – captured all of the trademarks issues
(that I’m aware of) and sent to Shane – awaiting comments/further information
from him MISC:
•	Misc changes and additions to the Lands’ End online store 
•	Coordinated with Helene (our travel agent) to change the hotel reservation
for the Infra F2F from Joe’s name to Rainer Jung (the res was non-cancellable
and non-refundable)
•	Ordered Flowers for Ross and family; ordered gift card for Jake Farrell
•	EA contract renewed
•	D&O insurance renewal completed and submitted


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

trademarks@ continues as busy as ever, even during the summer with OSCON and
several long-overdue vacations for myself, so both daily operations and
process improvements are running slower than planned.

Similarly, discussion on the backlog PODLINGNAMESEARCH escalated quickly
during a week I was mostly offline, which led to some unfortunate responses. 
Thanks to Henri in particular for pulling together constructive criticism and
opinions on the remaining open issues.

I attended OSCON to help man the ASF booth along with our EA Melissa and a
host of volunteers, including David Nalley, Justin, Upayavira, Rich, and
especially Dennis Hamilton. Virtually everyone who visited the ASF booth was
immensely thankful for the work we and all Apache projects do.  The variety of
questions from attendees was incredibly varied, everything from "Oh, you have
more than one project" to "How much do you get paid for working at Apache" to
"How can I get this Apache Foo bug fixed?"

We've begun using tm-registrations@ as a working list to manage the details of
Apache product name registration applications with the EA and counsel, and
DLAPiper has begun using this list.  I'm also working with DLAPiper to
continue to push more of their responses to tm-registrations@ or trademarks@
wherever possible instead of vp-brand.

Counsel have reported back on several legal issues related to registration
applications or questions, needing additional direction for applications being
made or planned that have been requested by Apache projects.

Used board concall to host meeting with Sally and a third party alleging abuse
of Apache trademarks by a third party in their hiring process. 

Interesting queries this week include a blogger asking permission to use
logos; a new Hadoop & Spark conference asking for a long-term partnership;
notice that OpenMRS has adopted a modified version of our trademark policy;
and a request to look into third party use of Apache marks in a negative sense
in AdWords.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

 == Metrics == An impromptu discussion was held between myself, Rich,
 David, Roman and Jesus and Manrique from Bitergia about possibilities for
 using their metrics technology. After consideration and discussion with a
 sponsor, my conclusion is that that data is far more detailed than we
 need, and that the system already built by Daniel Gruno is very close to
 what we need, and is based upon the same data as I had considered using
 before I saw the details of what Daniel has produced.

 Hopefully, we can extract data from Daniel's system to produce an annual
 report, perhaps with quarterly or half-yearly intermediate reports. The
 aim here needs to be to identify the impact of the Foundation on the
 world, and thus the benefit that a sponsor's contribution is bringing
 about. The data should be used to show trends of decrease or increase that
 can be used as the basis of some commentary.

 The idea of a 'health of the community' report was suggested by a
 sponsor. It was recognised though that whilst this could be incredibly
 valuable, it could be quite challenging to put together in a useful way.

 It would be good, also, to find an appropriate way to send this annual
 report to prospects, as it might help them with their decision making.

 == Small Donations == Whilst not directly discussed much here at OSCON, I
 have considered further our possible use of Hopsie, and I am inclined to
 make use of their service.

 It does involve spending foundation money that could be used elsewhere.
 However, the amounts are small, and we will easily recoup it. More
 importantly, this could give us a relatively straight-forward means to
 provide greater opportunities for individuals to contribute to the ASF. In
 time, it could give us the ability to to launch campaigns with fixed
 budgets targeting individuals.  In a way that might sound
 counter-intuitive, I do believe it important that we give individuals the
 opportunity to give to us should they choose to - we could do much better
 in this area.

 == Concalls and Sponsor communication == I discussed my quarterly concall
 idea with a sponsor. Her opinion was that every six months, and
 keeping it short, to 30 minutes, was likely to suit the target audience.

 She also suggested a 'sponsor' mailing list that we could use to push
 updates to sponsors. I have considered this previously. With a 'reply to
 sender' set, this could work well.

 == LinuxCon Dusseldorf == The idea arose in one of our conversations
 that we attempt to put on a "CIO Forum" at LinuxCon in
 Dusseldorf. We would invite CIO types to a presentation that explains the
 benefit of the ASF to the world and the benefits of sponsoring us. Rich
 will be there, and for me to get to Dusseldorf wouldn't be too
 expensive. Rich will talk with Angela to see if this is possible.

 [Rich: Joe Brockmeier and David Nalley think that we could still pull this
 off for Chicago. The conversation was with Leslie Hawthorne from
 Elasticsearch. I have passed this conversation to them for now, because
 I'm out of the office this week and can't really make much progress on
 that, as it would take valuable time away from drinking homebrew on the
 front porch.

 However, I will resume the conversation with Angela regarding Dusseldorf
 as soon as I'm back from vacation.]

 == Immediate Actions == 
  [ ] Rich to discuss CIO Forum with Angela

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are under budget with no payments due at this time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally Khudairi finalized the
“Powered by Apache” mark  for Apache project logos (creative services donated
by HotWax Media), which was launched during OSCON. Sally is awaiting signoff
from VP Brand Management Shane Curcuru in advance of sharing with Apache
Members and PMCs. She is also working with Shane on a blog post on corporate
guidelines on engaging with the ASF, which will be part of a larger spotlight
on ASF operations. The three month period of working with Apache CloudStack on
project-specific marketing/promotional strategy and support has now
terminated; Sally continues to engage with the project until an organization
is selected to run the PR/marketing activity.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe: 

 - 30 July 2014 --The Apache Software Foundation Exceeds 2 Million Code
   Commits
 - 22 July 2014 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™ Tez™ as a
   Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were tweeted on @TheASF, and is
coordinating with the Linux Foundation on @ApacheCon to promote the event.

V. Future Announcements: Sally is working with two TLPs to announce new
milestone releases. PMCs wishing to announce major project news, as well as
podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator, are welcome to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks'
notice for proper planning and execution. 

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 3 media requests, and coordinated several
interviews during OSCON. The ASF received 576 press clips over this time
period, vs. last month's clip count of 335. Our monitoring media hits for
CloudStack has yielded a total of 567 mentions this month vs. 1,089 last
month. 

VII. Analyst Relations: Apache was mentioned in 3 write-ups by Gartner, 1
report by Forrester, 7 write-ups by GigaOM, 6 reports by Yankee Group, 6
reports by IDC, 4 write-ups by 451 Research, and 2 opinion pieces by RedMonk. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: we have promoted reminders for the CFP for ApacheCon
Europe under the usual channels, and are working with the Linux Foundation
team on coordinating publicity/outreach efforts. In addition, Sally will be
working again with Melissa Warnkin on the ASF's presence (booth, giveaways,
etc.) at ApacheCon Europe. 

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Discussions continue with
RedMonk regarding a possible group of Apache-branded DevOps and DataOps events
in the UK. Sally completed the ASF tearsheet for distribution at events in
Europe as requested by Jan Iverson. 

X. Newswire accounts: we have 12 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of the calendar year, and continue to receive
gratis news release distribution by Pressat (UK).

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========

Finances:
==========
RAM for VMWare host:        $690.79


Operations Action Items:
========================

Short Term Priorities:
======================

* Code signing
  Mark Thomas has successfully concluded his testing of Symantec Application 
  signing service. Subsequent to that, he's identified a workflow that should 
  work for our many projects. Conversations with Symantec on pricing are
  ongoing. 

* Response timeframe targets:
  It was agreed to set up three distinct timeframes for responding to incidents;
    1) For critical services, incidents should be responded to within 4 hours
    2) For core services, incidents should be responded to within 6 hours
    3) For standard services, incidents should be responded to within 12 hours.
    
  The response need not be a resolvement of the issue, but needs to include one
  or more of the following steps;
    1) Acknowledging the incident through internal channels (See PagerDuty
       et al)
    2) Communication of the incident to the involved/affected people in
       accordance with the new communications plan laid out by the VP.
    3) Delegation of the issue to a member of infrastructure whenever possible
    4) Tracking of the incident (method depends on the duration and gravity of
      the incident)


* On-call rotation:
  At the f2f meeting in Cambridge, it was decided to introduce an on-call
  rotation between contractors. Each week, a contractor will be assigned as
  being on-call, and will be responsible for either resolving, delegating or
  communicating about outages, account-, mailinglist- and tlp-creations, as well
  as planned changes, and security issues. To the extent that this is possible
  (not counting sleep), incidents must be responded to within the new target
  timeframes, as explained in the previous paragraph.
  
  In the time since going live with both an on-call rotation and tracking
  response time in the response timeframe, the responses have been 
  dramatically faster than the service level expectations. As we build up
  staff numbers and spread geographically a bit, the expectations may change. 

* Improved response for and analysis of Java services at the ASF: At the
  previously mentioned f2f meeting, contractors were introduced to a detailed
  course of analysing and reporting incidents with Java applications run by
  infrastructure. We expect this new information to be extremely valuable in
  reaching and maintaining the target uptime for Java services. The staffers
  would like to extend a very big thank-you to Rainer Jung for his services in
  this matter.


Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Monitoring
  ** Uptime monitoring and responsibility:
     In addition to the previous board report, a new service level agreement was
     made between infrastructure staffers, increasing the targets for uptime on
     critical and core level services, as described below in the statistics
     paragraph. Ensuring that services meet the new targets have been made one
     of the cornerstones of infrastructure's work. The monitoring of public
     facing services has been outsourced to a third party (free of charge), and
     we will be focusing on having Circonus produce metrics for our inwards
     facing services/devices, such as LDAP, PubSubs, SNMP etc.

  ** Unified logging:
     Experiments with unified logging is proceeding as planned, with more and
     more hosts being coupled into the new logging system. A filtering
     mechanism for the lucene-based backend has been created, allowing anyone
     to use the logging service based on their LDAP credentials. As such,
     anyone with access to a specific host (as defined in LDAP) will be able to
     pull logs from the unified logging system. We are confident that this will
     make debugging and analysis easier, to the point that we are disabling
     older alerting/information systems and using the logging system to fetch
     information that would previously have been sent via email to root@.

* More virtualisation; Better use of what resources we have:
  It was decided to move towards more use of virtualisation for many critical
  and core services, including our main web sites and wikis. This will allow
  us to better respond to incidents and resolve them without affecting other
  services. Furthermore, it is our belief that we can free up resources by
  switching to a virtualised environment, thereby possibly getting more
  space for the crammed-up project/service VMs.

* Automation 
  ** Cloud-based dynamic build slaves have been in progress for a bit. Much of
     the work around this has been driven by Dan Norris. Building on a framework
     of repeatable builds he and Gavin McDonald have been successfully spinning
     up on-demand build slaves with our RackSpace account. This also relates to
     our goals around configuration management, and configuration of the machine
     is in Puppet. Expect to see this service go into production in the next
     week or so. 

  ** Puppet - the scope of puppet deployment continues to edge forward. Gavin 
     McDonald attended training just before the Infra F2F meeting. 

* Technical Debt and Resiliency Work around uptime monitoring and actually being
  able to better understand where the pain points are, coupled with some of the
  knowledge we gained at the Infra F2F has allowed us to focus on long term
  adjustments rather than hasty short term restoration of service. You should
  see this reflected in the uptime statistics

General Activity:
=================
- A face-to-face meeting between infrastructure members was held in Cambridge,
  UK.
- 27 new committer accounts created, 8 new mailing list (TBC)
- 3 projects were promoted to TLP
- 193 JIRA tickets resolved (since last report)
- A new status site was launched by Infra at status.apache.org
- PagerDuty has donated a gratis account for up to 10 users to ASF Infra

Uptime Statistics:
==================
Due to new a SLA between contractors, the targets for critical and core services
have been updated to reflect the new criteria (99.50% for critical and 99.00%
for core respectively). This represents an overall increase of 0.57% uptime
across the board. These figures span the previous reporting cycle as well as the
present reporting cycle (weeks 29-33)

Type:                   Target:   Reality:   Target Met:
---------------------------------------------------------
Critical services:      99.50%    99.94%        Yes
Core services:          99.00%    99.81%        Yes
Standard services:      95.00%    96.83%        Yes
---------------------------------------------------------
Overall:                98.00%    98.99%        Yes
---------------------------------------------------------

    IRC.

* Tony Stevenson - Comments

  Hipchat: 

  For a long time I have been thinking about trying to find a better way to
  engage with some of our users. Also, I was hoping to find a way that we could
  get a better feed of information that was more relevant and pertinent.

  We have hooked it up to JIRA, Github, Pagerduty, and PingMyBox. These all
  provide near realtime information that we can act on.

  The more modern service, perhaps will be seen to be a move on from some of our
  older roots. Which might appeal to others. With the move we have also seen the
  SNR improve significantly enabling better communication across the team.

  The alerting with Hipchat allows people to be notified of communcations that
  involve them, via push messages to a phone/tablet etc. Also once you return
  online from an offline state you see all the history. The history is
  searchable.

  You can join us, here, https://www.hipchat.com/gw4Cfp7JY

  Private channels can also be created, for those who need a channel that need
  to control access. Think #asfmembers etc

* Dan Norris

Sam Ruby has been nominated by IBM for the upcoming TAG election.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

A relatively typical month with no issues or actions required by the board.

Two issues of note have popped up during the last few weeks, and the intent
is to reach consensus and closure in short order. The 1st has to do with
the exclusivity requirement of the Apple App Store, and how it affects
official distribution of Apache software via that vehicle. The second is a
relatively recent thread regarding an individual taking ASF code and simply
relicensing it, and whether that is legal or not. It has been explained
that as long as the conditions of the ALv2 are followed, relicensing is
allowed.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera is very quiet. There are occasional emails and bug reports,
which sometimes take a little while to get actioned. The most frequent
activity is dealing with misfiled bug reports - Abdera is top in the
project list in the ASF JIRA system and the default project choice so
often gets bug reports for other ASF projects. While the code is not
being actively developed there are still a few PMC members watching
the lists so i don't see any problems with keeping on in this quiet
state for the time being.

The last release was over one year ago, the last committer / PMC member
addition was Nov 2011.

No board issues.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]

Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools.

We've had 4 minor releases since our last board report in March:  1.4.16 (May

relatively low. Our last committer/PMC change happened in October 2013.

We have no issues that require board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Jonathan Ellis]

Cassandra is a distributed database providing massive scalability,
high performance, and high availability.

Releases:

2.0.8         29 May 2014
2.0.9         30 Jun 2014
1.2.17        30 Jun 2014
1.2.18        3 Jul 2014
2.1 rc1..rc6  May-Aug 2014

Development:

2.1 is feature complete with optimized repair [1] and off-heap
memtables [2] joining user-defined types [3] and collection indexing
[4].  Counters have been rewritten [5], and compaction has been tuned
to be page-cache-aware [6].  

We have required more release candidates than expected.  I believe 
that this is due to increased efforts around QA rather than worse
code quality than previous releases.

Community:

Joshua McKenzie was added as committer on 29 Jul 2014.

Aleksey Yeshchenko was added as PMC member on August 7 2014.

P.S.: I apologize for the late report.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it is based
around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is very similar to Cocoon
2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and designed to be easily used with
Java code (= no frameworks required!). On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal
of becoming the best available platform for RESTful webservices and web
applications.

Issues needing board attention:
 None


Changes in the PMC membership:
 None.
 Last modified: 2012/10/21 (change of PMC chair)

Community

Traffic on users and devs list had been lighter then the last quarter. Some
users asked about different issues in the different versions of cocoon.
Various devs attended the questions and provided solutions.

We had again problems with a jira spammer "ROY Assink" which open/comment/...
on issues with spam messages, different PMC member removed the comment and
reverted the doing. r.assink.ra@gmail.com is the mail and he now has opened
another account
https://mail-search.apache.org/members/private-arch/cocoon-private/201406.mbox
/%3C53AA6DB8.7010003@apache.org%3E we consulted infra whether there is
possibility to get his e-mail address permanently disabled but that is not
possible so we need to block the user every time new.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Robert Burrell Donkin]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software
related to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions.
Any language and build system are welcomed.

Status
------
We failed to submit our report last time, but reported a month later (in June).

There has been quite a lot of activity in the project since our last
report, in all of our sub projects. There has been discussions around
platform and coding standards.

We have had one release candidate for Apache Rat 0.11, which
unfortunately failed. A second release candidate is currently being
voted on.

One person has volunteered to step up as PMC chair, but a vote for
this has not yet been started.

Community
---------
The last committer was elected in August, 2012.
In September 2013 Phil Ottlinger was elected to join the PMC.
Gavin McDonald has expressed that he wants to resign from the PMC, but
this request still needs to be processed. We will deal with this once
a new PMC chair is in place.

Releases
--------
No releases since last report.
Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

Community Objectives
--------------------
Release Apache Rat 0.11
Vote for a new PMC chair
Release Apache Whisker 0.1

Attachment M: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Gerhard Petracek]

Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
(Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
which are missing in the CDI core spec.

DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like
Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly,
Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also on
simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

Community
----------------
 * No new Committers (since May 2014)
 * No new PMC Members (since May 2013)

We receive contributions from the community on a regular basis.
DeltaSpike was nominated for "Duke's Choice Award 2014".

Red Hat extended its support and donated some resources
of their documentation team to review and improve our documentation.

Releases
-------------
We finally agreed on releasing v1.
The adoption we have seen so far is exceptional.

 * DeltaSpike 1.0.0 (14/June/14)
 * DeltaSpike 1.0.1 (13/July/14)

  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  No activity on the user mail list.

  The only activity on the dev mail list was one PMC member attending to an
  alert from our Gump server. Another PMC member (not the chair) forwarded
  the ApacheCon CFP.

  The Chair replied to feedback from the previous Board report, and included
  the private@f.a.o list (see 2014-05-22).

  At this quarter, four other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Idle. 3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  Clarified some project notes about the PMC member election process to
  reflect recent changes. Thanks again sebb.

  Enable 'java' to be found on a modern Mac.

  Fixed the Lucene search results to properly show the "note" when zero hits
  are returned.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Report from the Apache Giraph Project  [Avery Ching]

Giraph is a Bulk Synchronous Parallel framework for writing programs
that analyze large graphs on a Hadoop cluster. Giraph is similar to
Google's Pregel system.

Project releases

1.1.0 - We have continued delayed this release until Roman finds some time to
work on it.

Overall project activity since the last report

The project continues to develop at a steady rate.  We have added Phabricator
support for increasing the number of review tools available.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Our status is the same as the last report. Maja Kabiljo became a PMC member
here on 4/22/2014.  Pavan Kumar became a committer on 4/22/2014.  I think we
are getting closer to adding a new committer in the near future (i.e. by the
next report).

New community development

Apache Giraph was presented by Claudio Martella in June at
http://2014.budapestdwforum.com/.  We will also be presenting in
http://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/curriculum/agenda2014/.

Mailing list members

We continue to see steady mailing list growth.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and
persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key
value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The last release of Gora (0.4) was on 24th April, 2014.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Has been quite steady this quarter with mailing list activity
remaining on dev@. We have had contributions from new community
members and also some discussion on list about moving on with
the 0.5 release. We also added support for both MongoDB and
and Apache Camel.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Damien Raude-Morvan  was elected as PMC member and committer
on 2014-08-03 (yyyy-mm-dd). The NOTICE thread has been passed
to the board and we look forward to formally inviting Damien
very soon.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Since last reporting Gora has been present at the HBase
London Meetup where various community members were able
to present Gora developments. In addition, Gora now features
in the DARPA Open Catalog therefore a number of new community
mambers have been recruited there due to increased promotion
of both Gora and Apache technologies in general.

--------------------
Brooklyn

Brooklyn is a framework for modelling, monitoring, and managing
applications through autonomic blueprints.

Brooklyn has been incubating since 2014-05-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Performing our first release under Apache
  2. Grow the community
  3. More diversity of the committers/PPMC (currently biased towards
     employees of a single organisation)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No major changes - the community is still small, but is attracting a
  new names on the mailing list and IRC channel, including some code
  contributions.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Development is in full progress and we have settled in to our new
  home at the Incubator, and are preparing to make our first release.

Droids

Droids aims to be an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows to
create and extend existing droids (robots).

Droids has been incubating since 2008-10-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Activity
  2. Name Search

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None. The previous goal of conducting the name search was not met due to
time availability. Outlook is much more promising this quarter.

How has the community developed since the last report?
  No change. Name search is one big outstanding piece to complete, and it is
  rather intimidating.  It is hoped that one of the more experienced individuals
  will have time to complete it this quarter.  That should help with
  participation once the final name is known.


How has the project developed since the last report?

  No change.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Rename the project due to naming conflicts with "Fleece".
     Proposed name is "Johnzon".
  2. Expanding the community, increase dev list activity and adding
     new committers.
  3. Publish first incubator release.

  The Fleece project status page at http://incubator.apache.org/projects/fleece
  needs updating but that would be pending on #1 due to many items on the 
  status-page need to be re-visited once #1 is settled.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * Project have to be renamed because of naming conflicts with "Fleece".
  * Waiting for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-53

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * There have been several patches submitted from a current non-committer
    and we’re hoping to be able to mentor that person toward becoming a
    committer.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Several issues were reported an fixed (mainly core performance and 
    API compliance enhancements).

Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Community Developement:
Apache Kalumet 0.6-incubating version has been released.
However, due to some misunderstanding, the release vote has not been
completed by 3 IPMC.  Especially, some legal files issues have been raised.
We are preparing a 0.6.1-incubating release to fix the legal files and
submit to IPMC vote.  We are in the way of promoting the documentation
on the website.

Project Development:
We are preparing the 0.6.1-incubating (plan for July, 14) to fix the
legal files issues raised on 0.6-incubating release and have a complete
IPMC vote.
We are preparing the 0.7-incubating release with the development changes.

Local branches have been created containing:
- new model and REST API
- new webconsole (remove of Echo framework)
These local branches will be merged on the 0.7-incubating branch (master).

Before Graduation:
   - The documentation has been updated and aligned with the 0.6-incubating
   release. The documentation will be promoted on the website and "linked"
   in announcement e-mails as soon as the 0.6.1-incubating release has
   been voted.
   - The 0.7-incubating release will fix the graduation issue, especially
   in term of license (removal of Echo2 framework for the UI).

Post Graduation:
  - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept
  globally to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
  deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of:

None so far.

NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven.

NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.

Since the last report in July:
 - the build issues on the Windows Jenkins slaves were resolved
 - further JIRA issues have been cleaned up to prepare for the release
 - Konstantin Boudnik was formally added as a mentor for the project

While some progress was made towards getting the release out, there is 
still more work to do as time allows.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Ship the changes on trunk as a release and make it easier for new 
  users to get up to speed when interested in the project
  2. Get a critical mass of committers/PPMC members that can respond to 
  contributors, apply patches, nominate committers, and vote on releases
  3. Provide guidance on how to get involved in contributing

The incubator is already aware of the low level of activity, that many of 
the PPMC are now disengaged. There continues to be interest in a new 
release from users, and new interest from some in making contributions that
continue to be followed up.

Date of last release:

  2011-05-16

The last committer was added on 2011-04-19. There have not been any PPMC 
additions since inception.

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. Grow the community in terms of committers
2. Have regular releases
3. Decide if we would like to be a top level project or join an existing
   project

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?


How has the community developed since the last report?

  We issued a "call for volunteers" to our users list and got a good
  response: http://s.apache.org/4Vx

  Of course, it will be easier to grow the community if we can reliably
  conduct a release vote.

Optiq

Optiq is a highly customizable engine for parsing and planning queries on 
data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access, and in
particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data not
residing in a traditional database.

Optiq has been incubating since 2014-05-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Migrate fully to Apache infrastructure (next: web site and
     nightly builds).

  2. Re-organize code into org.apache.optiq namespace.

  3. Regular releases.

  4. Build an ASF community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need
to be aware of?

 None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 We have added our first post-incubation committer, Vladimir
 Sitnikov.

 We are planning our first hackathon.

 There have been community discussions about the goals for a future
 1.0 release, in particular whether the project should be reorganized
 to allow projects to use the optimizer core without using SQL parser
 and code-generation facilities.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Adopting Apache infrastructure:

  * Gained access to Nexus and started publishing (on-demand, not
    nightly) snapshot builds.

  * Web site in progress.

 Working on first release under the Apache incubator,
 apache-optiq-0.9.0-incubating.

Date of last release:

 No releases yet under the Incubator.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building a user community
  2. Getting those users to contribute their work back
  3. Improving the application to make it easier to use

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No


How has the community developed since the last report?

We're getting some independent users/developers on our list, including some
initial minor contributions and some bug reports. As an example, we have 
some contributed logos ... which is now going to trigger a competition/vote
for a slider logo.

The main external developer adoption is not in actual contributions for the
core slider engine, but from a few people writing slider application-
packages to deploy their own applications. This is a good first step -
we have to work with them to get them through this process, note and 
address issues they have -as well as encouraging them to contribute a bit
themselves. There's a tradeoff there: we don't want to dismiss all issues
with "file a patch with the JIRA" -maybe there's an intermediate step of
"let's work on this, can you take this branch and verify it works for you?"


How has the project developed since the last report?

 1. We're still fast-iterating through releases.
 2. We're testing slider against the forthcoming Hadoop 2.5 release, to 
 help validate that release.
 3. We're debating when - in August - to make the leap to only building 
 against Hadoop 2.6

The switch to 2.6 will mean that this code would be developer only, as it
would only work against non-production Hadoop clusters. Yet we need this 
for the forthcoming features: the Credential provider, service registry, 
Yarn node labeling and other features we need to integrate with.

That's a fairly exclusionary move for potential users: the current plan is
to make a release in sync with Hadoop 2.5, which will be the last Hadoop
2.4/2.5 compatible version. Yet it not only gives us those new features,
it helps tune those features and find bugs in their implementation. As an
example, one fix in Hadoop 2.4 is related to an Application Master failure
and restart problem which we'd found, a problem which, if we'd switched to
Hadoop 2.4-SNAPSHOT earlier, would have been found and fixed in the 2.4 
release.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed pub/sub system for efficiently collecting and
delivering a large number of messages to both offline and online systems.

Development
===========
We continue to stablize two main features for the 0.8.2 release. The first one
is Kafka-based offset management, which allows consumer offsets to be stored
in a more scalable way. The second one is the new producer, which provides
better performance and a cleaner api. We expect to release 0.8.2 in a month or
two. We also finalized the api and the design for the new consumer and started
the development. This feature is intended for the 0.9.0 release.

Community
===========
Lots of activities in the mailing list. kafka-user has 422, 560, 429 emails in
May, June and July, respectively (up from 388 in Apr). kafka-dev has 789, 610,
1357 emails in May, June and July (sligtly higher than 1272 in Apr). We had a
Kafka meetup in June. We last elected two committers in Oct. 2013 and are
actively grooming new potential committers.

Releases 
===========
0.8.1 was released on Mar 21, 2014 and 0.8.1.1 was released on Apr 29, 2014.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been seven major releases, including a 1.6 release on April 30,
2014, and a point release 1.6.1 on Jun 1, 2014.  The next major release is
scheduled for August 31, 2014.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer and PMC member we signed up was Muhammed Olgun (molgun), on
May 31, 2014.  We also voted in another committer, Mingchun Zhao (mingchun),
on the same day.


Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been active, with a wide range of topics.  Most of our
connectors now have significant use cases and constituencies, and the
connector family continues to grow.  Dev list comments for this period
centered around voting for the major d1.6 release, people looking for
integration advice, etc.

Committer and external contributions have been significant this cycle.  I am
unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

None known.

Branding
========

We have reviewed the site branding guidelines and believe we are now compliant
with these, with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other
Apache products that don't have any such marks.  Hopefully we will be able to
correct this issue soon.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012 and has graduated from
the Incubator in November 2013.

In May 2014, Apache Marmotta v3.2.1 was released.

After a very busy April, the development activity has dropped in the
last quarter. On the other hand, July was a very busy month on the
users list with several inquiries from new members of the user
community. Questions are answered timely, mostly by the core dev-team.

W3C has published LDP 1.0 as Candidate Recommendation, the Marmotta
community is actively developing the official test suite at GitHub,
early testing Marmotta with the goal of having listed our platform as
reference implementation of LDP 1.0.

GSoC 2014 is progressing according to the plan. It looks our student
will meet all goals of the project. We hope to keep him engaged within
the community, as he showed some good evidences in this regard.

Subscribers to the projects mailing list:
    dev@marmotta.a.o: 76 subscribers (+6 since last report, 2014-05)
  users@marmotta.a.o: 83 subscribers (+7 since last report, 2014-05)

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Tammo van Lessen]

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services, sending
and receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error recovery as
described by your process definition. It supports both long and short
living process executions to orchestrate all the services that are part of
your application.

STATUS
Although this reporting period was rather quiet, we made some progress
towards a 1.3.7 release. We brought a couple of improvements into the code
base, which fix some bugs, improved the build/ci system etc. Unfortunately
we had to fail one of two GSOC students because a lack of dedication or
skills. The other student, Fang Zhen, is making very good progress and
came up with a decent solution for one of your major issues, the OModel
serialization problem. We're looking forward to merge his work soon into
trunk and make a beta release from that. The goal to end the 1.3.x stream
and continue with trunk, which allows us again to add new features.
We expect to cut a 1.3.7 release within the next reporting period.

RELEASE
No releases in this reporting period.

DEVELOPMENT
The development in this period focussed on bug fixing and some
infrastructure improvements. Also our GSOC student Fang Zhen turned out
to be skilled developer and is developing a major contribution for ODE.

COMMUNITY
Nothing important to report. Last committer was added on Dec 10, 2012,
last PMC member was added on Jun 28, 2013.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard.

A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd. The current focus is on
extending the coverage for the IETF JOSE specifications e.g. JWS, JWE  (that
are strictly correlated to OAuth 2). 
Users activity is growing slowly but steadily (the user@ mailing list has got
new messages from new users). We got some feedback from some users about our
not too clear documentation.

Hence we are planning to improve this area.


COMMUNITY

PMC composition has not changed since graduation. We have voted one new
committer since graduation.

ISSUES

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Yegor Kozlov]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Qpid Project  [Gordon Sim]

Apache Qpid™ is a project focused on creating software based on the
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), currently providing a
protocol engine library, message brokers written in C++ and Java,
client libraries for C++, Java (including JMS), .Net, Python, Perl and
Ruby and a message 'router'.

* Releases:

Qpid 0.28 was released on the 3rd June 2014.

The last release of Qpid Dispatch Router, 0.2, was on 14th April
2014. The last release of Qpid Proton 0.7 was on 29th April, 2014.

* Community:

The main developer and user lists continue to be active. JIRAs are
being raised and addressed.

Andrew MacBean became a committer on 1st June 2014. There were no new
additions to the PMC since the last report. The last addition to the
PMC was Fraser Adams who joined on 6th March, 2014.

* Development

As well as ongoing fixes there has been a focus on the management UI
and security requirements in the Java broker. Work on the c++ broker
and client has been focused around AMQP 1.0 enhancements. An ActiveMQ
NMS implementation using AMQP 1.0 has been built on top of the .Net
Qpid.Messaging client.

In Qpid Dispatch Router, there is now support for more dynamic
configuration. The addressing model has been expanded to allow
aggregation of disparate brokers.

The proton library has been moving to a more event driven design as a
result of feedback received. It is believed that this will make it
easier to use and allow extra functionality to be offered within the
proton toolkit itself. Javascript support for proton is also being
developed.

Qpid 0.30 is now in alpha with a first beta due shortly. During this
cycle we have identified the need to adjust our procedure a little to
better cope with the evolution of the codebase. Previously we had a
single vote on a single release that covered several different source
bundles. The details are still being discussed but it is likely that
we move to having multiple distinct votes on specific source bundles,
with these perhaps eventually diverging into independent cycles
matching the different needs that different components have. An update
on this will be included in the next board report.

* Issues:

There are no items requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  Evgeny Kotkov was added to the Subversion PMC in February 2014 (this was
  apparently left out of previously reports).  No change in committers, our
  last new committer was in July 2013.

  An Elego hosted hackathon was held in Berlin from June 16th - 20th.  We had
  approximately 11 developers attend.  In Berlin we discussed issues with the
  upcoming 1.9.0 release and started planning future features for 1.10.0.
  There will be another hackathon August 18th - 22nd in Sheffield, England,
  with around 8 developers expecting to attend.  We hope to finish up on
  1.9.0 issues with that hackathon and spend more time working on changes
  planned for 1.10.0.

  Beyond our work towards the 1.9.0 release, we continue to support the 1.8.x
  series.  The 1.7.x series receives security updates, and (sometimes)
  high-value functionality updates.

  We continue to get around 200 messages per month on the users@ mailing list,
  with most questions being answered.  Often times by non-developer community
  members.

  The development list continues to see between 150-250 messages a month, and
  around 200 commits per month.  The commit rate has slowed slightly as we
  work towards stability on trunk for a 1.9.0 release.  Development can still
  be considered healthy.

* Releases

  Work toward 1.9.0 is progressing but no further alpha has been produced
  since our last report.  However, we do anticipate a branch sometime in
  the near future and our normal stabilization period following that.  Which
  typically includes betas and release candidates.

  Since our report in May, Apache Subversion 1.8.10 and 1.7.18 were both
  released on August 11th.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiricco]

Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities
in enterprise environments, implemented in JEE technology.

Status

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.


Community

The mailing lists' traffic has quite revamped during the last quarter, mainly
due to increasing activity towards upcoming new stable release 1.2.0.

We are receiving contributions from external user for deb packaging.

We have successfully handled a new security flaw (CVE-2014-3503).

Last committer addition (Andrea Patricellil) is dated March 2014.
Last addition to PMC (Guido Wimmel) is dated April 2014.


Releases since last report

     * 1.1.8 (Jul 3rd, 2014)

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Tez Project  [Hitesh Shah]

Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application
framework which can be used to process arbitrarily complex DAGs
of data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set of
data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.

ISSUES

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

STATUS

Apache Tez graduated from Incubator in July 2014.
The initial activity was mostly around migrating the infrastructure
which was done promptly by the infra folks and with minimal
disruption to the community.  There has been a lot of momentum on
finishing up the API clean up and local mode implementation
completed to help improve usability of Tez.  These are the 2
main objectives for the upcoming 0.5 release.

RELEASES

0.4.1-incubating was released on July 15, 2014.
  - This was the last release as an Incubator podling.

COMMUNITY

Auth: 31 PMC members and committers (as of Aug 06, 2014).
One vote in progress to add a new committer - Jonathan Eagles.
Jira: Last 30 days: 120 jiras created, 104 resolved.
Mailing Lists: user@ - 123, dev@ - 137 subscribers.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment BC: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

Major project news is the release of TomEE 1.7.0, which was a very
long release cycle an large community effort. First branch was July
1st.  First vote was July 13th.  One month late was the final passing
vote.  Thank you notes have been pouring in from users, which is
fantastic to see.

As usual releases from some of our sister projects were required,
including OpenWebBeans and OpenJPA.  Requests for those releases
started in April.  We were able to get a release from OpenWebBeans,
but not OpenJPA.  This happens and we dealt with it by creating or own
OpenJPA 2.4.0-nonfinal release.  With only 70 commits on trunk in the
last 12 months it's clear the community needs significant help.  I've
engaged the private list to see how we can help.  I mention to the
board for purposes of transparency as most board reports sound
"business as usual" even when the community is slowly shrinking.  Self
awareness can be hard.

TomEE trunk is now dedicated to TomEE 2.0 and Java EE 7 efforts, again
to much fanfare.  Resources for implementing Java EE 7 will be
extremely tight.  Adding new committers and focusing community on
passing the Java EE 7 TCK, assuming we get one, will be key.  I
couldn't predict when we might reach certification even with a TCK.

Both Tomcat and TomEE were jointly awarded a "Geeks Choice" award from
ZeroTurnaround in a local developer pool.  This is a nice confirmation
of interest from outside Apache.  The banner is now displayed on our
website front-page.

Last release was 1.7.0 on 2014-08-15.  Last committer was added
November 2013.  Last PMC addition was 2010-08-26.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache VXQuery Project  [Till Westmann]

Apache VXQuery implements a parallel XML Query processor.

STATUS

Apache VXQuery graduated from the incubator in July.
The first activities as a TLP were mostly around the migration of the
infrastructure (with great support from infra). There is also some
development activity around performance measurements and improvements.

COMMUNITY

All PMC members came in through graduation, all committers are PMC members.
The community is small but active.
Last committer (Steven Jacobs) was added in September 2013.

COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES

After the infrastructure is migrated the next step is to create the first
non-incubating release.

RELEASES

Apache VXQuery 0.3-incubating was released on May 19, 2014

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our 
subprojects use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the 
XSLT libraries.

RELEASES

- Xalan Java (2.7.2) 23-Apr-2014
- Xalan C/C++ (1.11) 29-Oct-2012

COMMUNITY ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature project with little development activity.  We are tying
to encourage previous committers to participate in maintenance efforts.

The Oregon State University senior student projects have been completed.
Steven Hathaway was one of the mentors. Jan Iversen was the other mentor.

The development email has little volume.  The Xalan library still has a 
significant presence in commercial software products.

Discussion continues on how to implement the newer XSLT and XPath standards.

Our PMC is planning to have a representative at ApacheCon EU 2014.

NEW COMMITTERS

We have a new committer, Samuel, who is willing to become an active PMC member.
He has made significant contributions to both of the Xalan subprojects.

ISSUES

There are no issues that need board attention at this time.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

There was some initial discussion on having a new release and plans
to merge the XML Schema 1.1 code on to the trunk.

A new contributor has been helping enhance the new XML parser
configuration for the JAXP secure processing feature and recently
submitted a patch for review.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 80 posts on the j-dev

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

A few minor bugs were fixed for JIRA issues that were reported by
the community.

Mailing list traffic has been very low; roughly 45 posts on the
c-dev and c-users lists since the beginning of May 2014.

No news about when the 3.2 version will be packaged. The latest
release is Xerces-C 3.1.1 (April 27th, 2010).

over the reporting period.

XML Commons

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development or
mailing list activity over the reporting period.

to the PMC were in May 2010.

Three committers (who are also PMC members) committed changes to
SVN in the last quarter.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache XML Graphics Project  [Chris Bowditch]

The Apache XML Graphics Project is responsible for software intended for
the creation & maintenance of the conversion of XML formats to graphical
output & related software components.


== Issues for the Board ==
No issues at present.

== Community ==
I asked the PMC to consider a new Chair, as I have been in the role for
over 2 years now. The PMC voted that I should continue in the role, and
I have agreed to do so for a while longer. We have identified a potential
new contributor/committer and the PMC also voted to increase the minimum
Java version to 1.6, starting from the next release

Last new committer: Simon Steiner on 11/04/14

Last new PMC member: Luis Bernardo on 04/03/13


== XML GRAPHICS COMMONS ==
8 separate commits to SVN, of which 6 were general bug fixes, 1 was check
style related, and the last was to ensure compatibility with Java 8. A
release is planned in the next quarter

There were no releases this quarter.

The latest release is 1.5 (20 October 2012)

== FOP ==
116 e-mails on fop-user mailing list this quarter; a few questions asked
by users and answered by committers. Some new bugs logged and several
patches have been submitted and processed. 85 separate commits in total
to SVN. A vote to merge the finished font merging code into trunk passed
in the last few days. Discussions have started on release planning.
However, since an optional component of FOP has a snapshot dependency on
PDFBox 2.0, we are unsure whether to release FOP now and the component
later or to release both once PDFBox 2.0 is available.

There were no releases this quarter

The latest release is 1.1 (20 October 2012)

== BATIK ==
Mailing list activity remains light; 23 e-mails to the user list this
quarter. A few bugs have been reported in JIRA, and there have been
discussions about merging the CMYK colour branch into trunk. There were
3 commits made by PMC members during this quarter; 2 of which were
community supplied patches being processed. A release is planned in the
next quarter

There were no releases this quarter.

The latest version is 1.7 (6 January 2008)
