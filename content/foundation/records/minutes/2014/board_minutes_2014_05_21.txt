 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       While some discussion about directed sponsorship and expanding project
       resources continued this month, the recent focus has been on immediate
       needs and the budget, as covered in the President's report.

       We have also been busy with preparations for the Annual Members
       Meeting, which will be held next week. We have a very healthy number
       of nominations for both new Members, and for the Board of Directors.

       This being the last meeting of the current board, I'd like to thank
       you all for your time, effort, and service to the Foundation, and for
       the privilege of being able to serve you as Chairman. It has been an
       honour!

    B. President [Ross]
    
       It's a big report this month, so here's a bullet summary of the 
       key items (not exhaustive, see below for completeness):
       
       - Proposed interim 3-month budget (Special Order G) which shows
         a surplus. Full year budget (available in SVN) shows a deficit.
       - Working with VP Fundraising to address the budget deficit moving
         forwards
       - Infrastructure requires immediate action (and budget) to minimize
         the likelihood of further outages (included in budget)
       - VP Marketing working with CloudStack PMC to develop a long-term 
         outreach strategy that can be used by all TLPs
       - Working with VP Marketing and VP Fundraising to develop better 
         materials on "what we do"
        
       And here's the details... 
        
       Budget
       ------
       
       The most important item this month is the approval of a 2014/15 
       budget. I am, however, requesting that the board approve a 
       3-month interim budget (May - July) rather than a full 12 month 
       budget. There are a number of reasons for this:
       
       1) proximity to the election of the next board
       2) significant exceptional infrastructure costs
       3) a need to examine directed funding and additional marketing 
          activities
          
       Given point 2) and the uncertainty of point 3) I think it is
       prudent for the current board, which is meeting this month for the
       last time, to only pass an interim budget. Please see Special Order 
       G. This interim budget shows a surplus based on a majority of sponsors
       being due for renewal in this period, but the FY budget shows a 
       significant deficit.
              
       I've worked with all officers to create an appropriate budget and
       believe both the three month interim and proposed 12 month budget
       reflect a balance between immediate needs and prudent budget controls.
       
       Deficit
       -------
       
       It should be noted that the proposed FY budget shows a significant 
       deficit. This is well within the foundations cash reserves and provides 
       an immediate cash injection to address some of the issues reported by
       VP Infrastructure (see Attachment 5). We have also seen a significant
       increase in administration costs relating to the scaling of the
       foundation. These include an increase in the treasury budget 
       (appointment of Virtual) and our Administration budget (as approved 
       in Jan 2014).
       
       In order to address this deficit myself, VP Infrastructure and VP 
       Fundraising have been discussing options. One such option (in kind
       donations of equipment for infrastructure) is outlined in VP
       Fundraising's report (Attachment 3). Another option that has been 
       discussed previously is targeted donations (although these would
       not address immediate and pressing infrastructure needs). Beyond 
       discussion we are actively working to ensure that there is an 
       increased visibility into where sponsorship money goes and what our 
       projects produce as a result of the foundations existence. This will
       enable us to build a strong outreach for existing sponsors as well as
       providing valuable materials when seeking new sponsors.
       
       Infrastructure
       --------------
       
       Our new VP Infrastructure has had a difficult month. There are 
       extensive details in the Infrastructure report (Attachment 5). I will
       observe that it seems we have been running our infrastructure on much
       too tight a budget. This has resulted in a number of outages. I fully
       support the proposed remedial action which includes a) replacement
       of existing hardware b) appropriate maintenance and monitoring and c)
       increased automation and related skills development. I urge both the 
       current and future board to support the significant budget increase 
       requested by VP Infrastructure.
       
       Targeted donations
       ------------------
       
       In recent months there have been many discussions about targeted 
       donations for project specific infrastructure requirements and project 
       marketing efforts. It seems that project specific infrastructure is
       likely to be on hold until current remediation activities are 
       complete. With respect to project specific marketing VP Marketing has
       been working with, and continues to work with, the CloudStack PMC with
       a view to developing a long-term outreach strategy that can be used by 
       all TLPs in choosing a tactical plan that best suits their specific
       marketing/visibility needs. It is expected that this strategy will
       highlight any necessity for project specific marketing funds and I
       propose to revisit this topic once the strategy is delivered.
       
       Foundation Marketing
       --------------------
       
       The community have also discussed the need for ASF wide marketing 
       activities. This has been further discussed between VP Marketing,
       VP Fundraising and myself. It is my belief that the initial focus needs
       to be on a) providing valuable information to our existing sponsors 
       about what we do, how we operate and spend their money and b)
       enabling our PMCs to drive appropriate marketing campaigns. Whilst there
       is value in marketing the ASF itself I feel that a focus on ensuring
       that we support our projects first is the appropriate action. Once 
       infrastructure is stable and provides the services our existing projects
       require, PMCs are equipped to develop and recognize marketing potential 
       within our existing structure and fundraising is firing on all cylinders 
       such that we are not showing a budget deficit then I would like to 
       revisit this topic, but for now my personal focus remains on 
       infrastructure, PMC marketing capabilities and fundraising.
       
       EA
       --
       
       This month has been a relatively quiet month for our EA in the absence
       of a conference to organize. Melissa has used this time to further improve
       the fundraising processes and to follow up with a number of sponsors
       due for renewal (supported by VP Marketing).
       
       Brand Management
       ----------------
       
       Brand Management has been a "normal" month. Again our VP is indicating
       that a number of routine questions are incoming and that these can
       be addressed with clearer documentation and policy. I have encouraged
       the VP to work with our EA to take some of this load.
       
       TAC
       ---
       
       TAC provides a useful summary of their work for ACNA and some increased
       effort to raise awareness of the TAC process. This awareness raising is
       a useful part of the discussion around marketing the ASF and making
       sponsors aware of the value they bring to the foundation.
       
       With respect to budget TAC had requested an increase to allow them to
       cover two smaller events in addition to the two ApacheCon events. However,
       I declined to include the budget for the smaller events, just as I
       declined to include my own Event-in-a-Box proposal to ComDev. My intention
       is to secure at least one additional sponsor highlighting these items as
       additions that their sponsorship will help fund (not necessarily as
       directed sponsorship, although that is a possibility as we progress with
       discussions around that topic).
       
       And Finally...
       --------------
       
       Finally, I would like to thank the outgoing board for their service
       to the foundation. I'm sure many will be back again next month, and 
       even those who don't have a seat are likely to still be watching over
       the shoulders of those who do.
       
       Thank you for last year, lets look forward to many more.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       The big news is that we have officially signed and executed an
       agreement with Virtual, Inc. to provide end-to-end financial
       management for the ASF, as a contractor approved by the Board
       assisting the Treasurer.  Virtual will have a representative Guest
       on the board call, Tom Pappas, who will attend and observe the
       Treasurer report and the initial portion of the meeting before the
       committee reports. The Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer are working
       with Virtual to make sure there is a smooth on boarding and that
       Virtual is provided with access to all material needed, and that
       we carefully consider and document their suggestions. At this point
       in time due to schedule flexibility and a general East coast favorable
       calling time, calls with Virtual and Apache are being attended by
       Sam Ruby, Assistant Treasurer, and Sam is taking point on managing
       the connection with Virtual, in coordination with Chris. Jim is
       meeting with the CPA to discuss the audit now that Virtual is on
       board and the Treasurer's Office expects that Jim can report out
       on any progress there during the board call and also via audit@apache.org.

       The Treasurer's Office is correcting an error made in the original
       1099 filed for our EA Melissa. The Treasurer expects to have that
       form in the mail NLT Thursday May 22, 2014. Apologies to the EA for
       the delay.

       Questions about our accounting mechanism were posed by VP Infrastructure
       and answered promptly by the Treasurer's Office.

       The HALO contract renewal is coming up and VP Press and Marketing
       has reached out to the President and Treasurer's Office to proceed
       on this. Treasurer's Office has requested an invoice from VP Press
       and Marketing so it can go into our Bills/received folder for
       approval by the President and/or EVP.

       We will be transitioning our banking services from Wells Fargo
       to Citizens Bank. We expect the transition to take place over
       the next few weeks. There is a safety deposit box that Roy
       will clear out shortly.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

    Secretary is running well and the volume of documents has picked up. 
    In April, 77 iclas, two cclas, and two grants were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

    Planning for ApacheCon Europe is moving along, with several keynotes
    selected and 25 papers in the CFP system. The CFP ends in a little
    more than a month, so the time to start pushing hard to get papers
    in is upon us and we should start seeing a lot more planning
    activity in the next few weeks.

       Discussion:

       Publicity looks like it's enough for the entire year. Right. It's an up front
       payment of a retainer plus a monthly fee.

       Trademarks shows registering all podlings before graduation. The line item 
       should be for registering "key podlings".

       Special Order 7G, Approve the Interim 3 Month ASF Budget, was
       approved by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, and board@) and following-up with appropriate personnel


ApacheCon - TAC:  
 • Received final hotel bill from The Westin; submitted in svn, Gav approved,
   awaiting payment from Chris

Fundraising:
 • Created new task sheet in the Sponsorship spreadsheet to streamline the
   process of renewals and follow-ups
 • Received acknowledgements from Yahoo! and Pivotal on invoices submitted;
   completed vendor form for Pivotal’s AP System; issued revised invoice to FB
   to include their PO# 
 • Sam and Chris will work with Wells Fargo to add me to the account for “read
   access” so that I can monitor the incoming payments and follow-up on the
   past-due renewals more efficiently and effectively.

OSCON:
 • Submitted application for a non-profit pavilion booth; application has been
   approved; process has begun to complete the exhibitor application and
   contract
 • In discussions with Sally re giveaways

MISC:
 • Created and shared an Infra Vacation calendar that I will be maintaining
 • Participated in a ConCall with Sam and Virtual, Inc. for introductory
   purposes pertaining to Sponsorship issues
 • Sorted out the 1099 error with Chris; Chris to send an amended 1099


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

The volume and variety of questions and issues on trademarks@ continues 
to be heavy, and in particular continues to show that more education 
and clearer policy documentation is needed, both for our project 
communities as well as a more clearly presented and easily approachable 
set of policy documentation for users and potential corporate sponsors 
or donors as well.

Telecon with the Apache CouchDB project to discuss branding issues and 
enforcement ideas; the project has some great energy with new code 
merges and will be working on an improved and better articulated brand 
for CouchDB overall.

Budget request submitted to president@.  Note that while our actual 
spending is still well below budget for last year, this is partly due 
to delays in billing and processing time from counsel, so I expect to 
get a number of bills soon.

Registrations

Responded to a number of questions to APACHE registration issues in 
various jurisdictions.

Preparing registrations for SERVICEMIX and ACTIVEMQ at project request.  

Working with counsel on securing a coexistence agreement and/or 
opposition to a third party registration of an Apache product name.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Melissa continues to hold the task of managing renewals, either
contacting sponsors directly, or asking myself or Sally for assistance
where necessary.

Given expected increase in financial demands from Infrastructure,
fundraising effort is expected, in a manner that the ASF has not,
certainly in the last few years, attempted.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain on schedule and under budget. All vendor payments have
been processed on time with ongoing thanks to the Treasurer and Operations
teams. The contract with HALO Worldwide has been renewed for FY 2014-2015 with
a remuneration increase due to expanded scale (not scope) of work.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally Khudairi met with both VP
Fundraising Upayavira and VP Brand Management Shane Curcuru to review current
issues and address future goals. Sally is continuing Sponsor renewal and
general outreach with Platinum-level Sponsors. She has also agreed to observe
and assist with project-specific marketing/promotional support with Apache
CloudStack, and will be developing a long-term outreach strategy that can be
used by all TLPs in choosing a tactical plan that best suits their specific
marketing/visibility needs.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org:

 - 17 April 2014 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces 100 Million
   Downloads of Apache™ OpenOffice™

IV. Informal Announcements: 9 items were tweeted on @TheASF, and 2 on
@ApacheCon post-event. The ApacheCon producers uploaded an unprecedented 166
presentations (a record, both quantity and timeframe) on "TheApacheFoundation"
account on YouTube, which also includes presentations from the CloudStack
Collaboration Conference.

V. Future Announcements: we are preparing two project-related announcements
and one TAC statement to be issued by the end of the month, if not sooner.
PMCs wishing to announce major project news, as well as podlings ready to
graduate from the Incubator, are welcome to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks'
notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 22 media requests, and worked with a
small handful of reporters on the ASF's role in the Open Source ecosystem. We
experienced a sharp increase in immediate requests for comment regarding the
Heartbleed security bug. We were also alerted to many instances of
misattribution to the ASF's involvement in the vulnerability, and sent
correction notices to editors/publishers. Sally also issued a cease/retract
request to the president and legal counsel UK-arm of a VoIP service provider
that had alerted its consumers of the "Apache Heartbleed Flaw". The ASF
received 1,200 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count
of 2,259.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 4 analyst queries, and have been
discussing a possible Apache-themed speaker/community event in the UK with
RedMonk. Apache was mentioned in 3 reports by Gartner, 2 reports by Forrester,
8 write-ups by GigaOM, 5 reports by Yankee Group, 4 reports by IDC, and 4
write-ups by 451 Research. In addition, Jonathan Ellis will be featured in an
upcoming issue of Hadoop Magazine dedicated to Apache Cassandra.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: hats off to the Linux Foundation Events team and
Melissa Warnkin for their efficiency, professionalism, and follow-through in
advance of, during, and post-event.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally is coordinating with
Melissa on the ASF booth at OSCON's Non-profit Pavilion. As Sally will be
unable to attend OSCON this year, Shane will be participating at the Expo in
her stead. Upayavira will also be attending OSCON to conduct Sponsor outreach
and provide booth coverage.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 16 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of the calendar year, and continue to receive
gratis news release distribution by Pressat (UK) with no pre-established
termination timeframe.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========

Andrew Bayer (abayer) was granted jenkins admin karma.

Finances:
==========

Infra spent or authorized to spend almost $3300 thus far in the new fiscal
year; all related to replacement hardware or service for hardware.

Operations Action Items:
========================

None

Short Term Priorities:
======================

* OSU Hardware failures We have a number of hosts that have degraded or dead
hardware in our Oregon colo. This is mixture of machines that are in and out
of warranty and involves machines that host both core services and less
important machines. Status is being tracked at:
https://pad.apache.org/p/osustatus

* Outage recovery Coming out of our outages we have substantial number of
remediation items. In some cases the service has been restored but is not back
to pre-outage levels of operation.

* Builds.a.o Stabilization of Jenkins is a primary concern. Much work has
happened from volunteers and contractors alike (see comments below in general
activity as to improvement.) We are still suffering from service failures
every couple of days at this point.

Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Monitoring Our monitoring still lacks the level of insight to provide
operationally significant information. Work continues on this front. Our new
monitoring system (Circonus) should come online in the next few weeks; but
much remains to be instrumented for it to be truly useful.

* Automation Slow progress continues on rolling out configuration management
in efforts to make our infrastructure better documented and more easily
reconstructed.

* Technical Debt Work is ongoing to prioritize services infrastructure
provides and to set expectations and service levels around the services.

* Resiliency I wish that I could say that much work has occurred here; but
most of the month has been focused on outage recovery. The beginnings of that
work has taken place in working to restore a stable platform.
(see the note around hardware at OSU)

General Activity:
=================

Infrastructure suffered three major outages in this reporting period. The
first involved the Buildbot host and a disk failure. CMS and Buildbot project
build were down for several days while the machine was rebuilt. The second
outage was the blogs.a.o service. You can see the details and remediation
steps that are being taken here: https://s.apache.org/blogspostmortem The
third was a 4 day outage of our mail services. You can see the results of the
post-mortem here: http://s.apache.org/mailoutagepostmortem As of this writing
there is still a significant backlog of email being processed.  At current
rate, we expect the backlog to be cleared by May 16th.

The Buildbot host aegis lost a disk also and the machine was rebuilt over a
few days, changing from Ubuntu to FreeBSD 10. The CMS and project builds were
down whilst this happened. At the same time the Buildbot Master version was
upgraded to the latest release which caused some tweaks to the code and
project config files.

Infra has noted an increased level of concern regarding the CI Systems and in
particular the Jenkins side of builds. Some projects are concerned about the
level of support that Infra gives these systems. A combination of factors over
the last months has seen a decline in support - other higher priority services
taking up time, a decline in volunteer time, an increase in projects using the
systems and in parallel an increase in build complexity, all making for a
decline in available resources due to slave increases not happening in a
scaled manor to match. All this is being resolved as we speak and improvements
are being made; and there are many plans for the short/medium and long
term. The work done already is showing progress. In example on 2 May the
average load time for builds.a.o was 72.69 seconds and the average number of
builds in the queue was 65. On 13 May the average load time is down to 1.86
seconds and the average number of jobs in the queue is less than 4. Much work
remains to be done. For data see: http://people.apache.org/~hboutemy/builds/

Plans to address existing issues: 
==================================

As has been noted infra ran into a number of problems bringing a number of 
key services back into use. There are a number of planned steps that are
either remedial or work around building a more robust foundation. All of
these tie back into the long term priorities you see above.  

Below are things I have requested one or more contractors: 

* SLAs - We're dividing up services into various criteria. Failures happen, 
but our level and rapidity of response as well as the degree to which we
engineer for failure must be measured against how critical the service
is. The current plan is to submit the finished work to the President for 
review and discussion with an audience he deems appropriate. 

* Prioritization of hardware replacement - New hardware doesn't guarantee
against an outage. However, continuing to test the mean time between 
failure for underlying hardware tends to increase risk on average. Along
with this prioritization; I've asked that each of the services being
replaced be done by a person who isn't the 'primary' for that service. 
That list is not yet complete, but is being worked on. 

* Documentation - Currently the quality varies from service to service. 
Some of our documentation is clearly out of date, some is decent. My
experience is that most documentation suffers from bitrot in any
organization. However; I've requested multiple folks to bring our docs
for various services up to a usable state. I've also requested for
folks other than those who produced or will be producing the documentation
to review the documentation and use it to ensure it is accurate and adequate. 

* Backups - In general, our backups, where they've been happening, have been
sufficient. We've already had work around documenting restoration from backup
get committed to our docs in SVN. Additionally short term tasks have been 
handed out about establishing, verifying, or restoring backups as well as
checking that against the services and documentation. There's also tasks in 
place to work on speeding up our restore timelines.  

* Automation - We possess a lot of operational automation (scripts and other
tools that allow us to create or subscribe to lists, create users, etc.) We 
have bits and pieces of infrastructure automation - but it's not widespread.
In the three outages we've experienced catastrophic failure of the hardware
resulting in the need to rebuild the service from scratch. Virtually all of 
the moving pieces involved manual processes from OS installation to service
configuration. That dramatically increased our time to recovery; as well as 
being prone to user error. To that end; I've requested the following: 

  - Consolidate the number of platforms we support for core services. We 
    currently have Solaris, Ubuntu, two major versions of FreeBSD. I've 
    asked for a single version of Ubuntu and a single version of FreeBSD
    to be adopted across all of our non-build and non-PMC infrastructure. 

  - Deploy an automated OS installation tool -  During the mail outage we 
    had to get smarthands in the datacenter to burn a OS install DVD and
    deploy a fresh operating system twice. This meant that a ten minute
    task turned into more than hour in each case. I've set the criteria 
    that we be able to deploy our installs over the network and control
    booting and other functions via an out-of-band management tool such
    as IPMI. We must also be able to host our own package repositories. 

  - Configurations management -  We currently have puppet deployed but it
    isn't widely used within our infrastructure. Puppet permits you to 
    declare state in it's domain specific language that controls how a 
    machine is configured; what software is installed as well as collect
    data on the machine itself. Puppet also enforces state; and this 
    enforcement is, quite frankly, better than documentation. Even if a
    machine is completely destroyed, by having done the work in puppet we, 
    know the exact state of the machine and can deploy that exact 
    configuration back to a new machine in a matter of moments. To that end 
    I have planned the following items:

        - Training - Most of the infra contractors have not used puppet in 
          anger. Beginning in the next few weeks; they'll make use of some
          gratis online training from Puppetlabs with plans for attending 
          a hands-on class within 6 weeks. (budget-willing) 

        - Mandatory use for new services. I've asked that all new work and
          services being stood up must be done using puppet. 

        - Service restoration. For core services that have failed recently. 
          we've either updated documentation or have tasks to do so. I've 
          requested tasks for translating that into puppet manifests to
          dramatically reduce our mean time to recovery. For services that 
          will move to new hardware; if that involves the recreation of the 
          service I've asked that be done via config management as well.  

        - Base OS deployment. The base OS deployment at the ASF is very
          well documented. In the case of FreeBSD it's ~26 individual
          manual steps that must be executed every time. In conjunction 
          with work on an automated OS install; I've asked that all of the
          base OS deployment and configuration be automated via puppet.

  - Monitoring - put simply, our monitoring does not currently provide enough
    insight. In example, we did not know about the failing hardware underlying
    our mail service. According to our monitoring, things were fine. This isn't
    to say that knowing about it would have prevented the outage, but I would 
    at least like the advantage of timely knowing about it. As mentioned 
    elsewhere; when smarthands were working on our equipment they noted
    that many of our servers were complaining about hardware problems. 
    Monitoring is largely grunt work; knowing what to monitor for each service
    is something that the contractors can rattle off. Actually setting up 
    monitoring is a large time sink. We currently have a volunteer doing a good
    chunk of work; and my plan is to temporarily (3-6 month timeframe)
    supplement that with an outside contractor who is already familiar with
    our monitoring system and puppet. 

None of the above prevents failure. It might give us an edge in detecting that
a failure is about to occur, or permit us to drastically reduce our time to
recovery; but it does not actually keep bad things from happening. The longer
term piece of this puzzle is to begin engineering our most important services
to be more redundant or more fault tolerant. Most of our services are not
setup this way. Our first target is going to be the mail service; we are doing
this for two reasons. First our experience with the mail backlog and the hoops
we had to clear to empty that backlog suggest that we aren't very far from the
limits of our current architecture. Second, as you've seen in the past few
weeks, a mail outage is absolutely crippling for the Foundation. 

That said, please understand, that the problems we have, are not going to be
solved in the short term. By the end of the quarter I hope to be able to
report that we have a good start on these initiatives, but this is a long term
effort. Unless luck intervenes it's almost inevitable that we'll suffer
another outage this year.  Hopefully we'll be in a better place to respond to
those outages as we go forward.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Gianugo Rabellino]

There has been an increase in activity at the Attic with WS-MUSE being 
retired, and ESME, XMLBeans and stdcxx all being partially moved to the 
Attic. Retiring the XML project has been identified as still having items 
to complete.

The process of moving projects to the Attic has been simplified by 
splitting into two stages - retiring the project publicly, and freeing up 
infrastructure resources. My hope is that this will decouple the essential 
parts of moving to the Attic from the clean up.

In moving XMLBeans to the Attic, we've noticed that one commit has 
occurred after the board removed the PMC in July. This commit does not 
appear to be of concern[1] and SVN has now been made read only for XMLBeans.  

The project has put a resolution in front of the board to change the chair.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it is based
around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is very similar to Cocoon
2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and designed to be easily used with
Java code (= no frameworks required!). On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal
of becoming the best available platform for RESTful webservices and web
applications.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2012/10/21 (change of PMC chair)

Community

Traffic on users and devs list had been busier then the last quarter. Some
users asked about different issues in the different versions of cocoon.
Various devs attended the questions and provided solutions.

We had problems with a jira spammer "ROY Assink" which open/comment/... on
issues with spam messages, different PMC member removed the comment and
reverted the doing.

Releases

2.1 has been released on 2013/03/20.


Development
 None


Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:

  We need to release a new version of cocoon 3 and cocoon 2.2 but still no
  committer has stepped up yet to do so.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Luciano Resende]

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects.

Project Status
--------------
We have submitted via the ASF President, a budget that includes GSoC income
and expenses as well as money related to helping with small events (Event in a
Box).

Other then that, there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

PMC changes
-----------

A new PMC member is being discussed/voted, but the latest official addition 
has been Suresh Marru on 2013-04-26.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------
It’s GSoC time again, we have been accepted as a Mentoring Organization 
and were given 42 slots for this year program.

Ulrich Stark has volunteered as GSoC Admin and has been doing an excellent 
work handling all the Organization registration and mentoring registration 
and validation with the respective PMCs and working trough the students 
proposals and rankings.

Related to GSoC, the Stratosphere project which just joined Apache 
and had also been accepted as a mentor organization for this year GSoC 
will be receiving the GSoC mentor stipends and travel costs for their 
attendance at the mentor summit via the ASF organization.

Also, there has been some discussions related to vouching for other open
source organizations that are new to GSoC, and currently the consensus with
the Community Development PMC seems to be not to vouch for external
organizations.

ComDev & Events
---------------
The ComDev PMC is now a "home" for some of the ConCom responsibilities. In the
last few months, Rich Bowen has been leading the organization of ApacheCon
Denver and based on all the reports I read from different members, this was a
very successful conference, with 43% more registrants compared to ApacheCon
2013. We are now working on the ApacheCon Europe which is going to happen in
Budapest in November 17 to 21.
 

Others
---------------

There have been some Apache PMCs that have brought to the attention of the
Community Development PMC that Google has changed the rules for Google Code,
which is where Apache Extra is hosted, and there is going to be issues related
to new downloads. We have had some discussions around the topic and we are
going to evaluate the possibility of finding a new home for Apache Extras.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment P: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
(Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
which are missing in the CDI core spec.

DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers
like Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server,
JBoss Wildfly, Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also
on simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

Project Status:
Bugfixing goes on in the current code base.
Community is stable and active.

Releases:
last release: 
deltaspike-0.6 on 2014-03-20
deltaspike-0.7 on 2014-05-03

We still hope to ship 1.0 pretty soon.

* IP Clearance

  Adobe donated BlazeDS to Apache Flex.  BlazeDS was promised by Adobe prior
  to entering the Incubator, but the donation was not cleared by Adobe until
  after graduation.
  
  In a separate proceeding, Adobe also donated selected popular articles
  from the Adobe Developer Connection, plus the FlexPMD project, a version
  of FDB that supports ActionScript Workers, the Tour de Flex app, the
  Squiggly spell-checker library, the MXMLC specification, a prototype of a
  code coverage tool and the Mobile Trader demo app.

  Both donations contained extraneous files which were detected on review by
  IPMC member and Flex PMC member Justin Mclean.  Alex Harui, who was
  managing the donation, promised to remove the files before import.

* Miscellaneous

  ODF Toolkit has adopted the Alternate Release Voting Process.

  DeviceMap has failed to report for two months now.

  NPanday shows signs of concern. It consistently misses reporting 
  deadlines and even when reports arrive they don't seem to be signed
  off by a mentor. On top of that, the development activity seems to 
  be quite low. IPMC will have to figure out what to do about it.

BatchEE

BatchEE projects aims to provide a JBatch implementation (JSR-352) and a
set of useful extensions for this specification.

BatchEE entered the incubator on 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Get more contributors/committers
  2. Get more adoption
  3. Get more activity on the list maybe

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have 3 active committers.

  We also started to get some external contributors even if it is still a
  bit shy.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Project seems to start to be stable and some nice feature enhancements
  have been done.  People are starting to use BatchEE in production.

Date of last release:

  We shipped our first release (0.1-incubating) on 2014-04-06

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No new committers yet, but one contributor is on our radar.

--------------------
Blur

Blur is a search platform capable of searching massive amounts of data
in a cloud computing environment.

Blur has been incubating since 2012-07-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. It is unclear if we can get the Trademark assign document provided by
     trademarks@ signed by Near Infinity.  The company no longer exists.
  2. Another Release
  3. Community Growth

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Other than the issue with the Trademark assignment listed above, no.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Can not get mail stats due to Apache Mail outage.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Apache Blur has become more stable over the past few months and we are in
  position to release a stable version.

Date of last release:

  2013-10-09 (However we are currently in the voting process now for a release.)

--------------------
Celix

Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on
interoperability between Java and C.

Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We believe Celix is ready for graduation, the only thing left is making
     sure all project metadata and (administrative) tasks are up to date.
  2. Nothing
  3. Nothing

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Since the last report Celix has gained two committers (Bjorn & Erik),
  making the Celix community more diverse. Also a 1.0.0 release has been
  released. Combined we believe that Celix is ready for graduation. One
  downside is that in the last month activity on Celix mailinglist has been
  slow, but we expect some increase in activity when we start graduation.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Two donations were mades and added to Celix. A shared memory
  implementation for remote services and the an implementation of the event
  admin specification. The event admin implementation was done in a GSoC
  project.  And a 1.0.0 release, focussing on stability, has been made.

Date of last release:

  2014-02-24
  2012-12-16

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  2014-03-04 Erik Jansman elected as committer.
  2014-01-08 Bjoern Petri elected as committer.
  2013-01-07 Roman Shaposhnik joins as a mentor.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Project looks pretty normal; report in readied, traffic on the mailing
  list is ok. I don't see any particular cause for concern. Celix might need
  to update the project site to reflect recent additions of the committers.

--------------------
Droids

Droids aims to be an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows to
create and extend existing droids (robots).

Droids has been incubating since 2008-10-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Activity
  2. Name Search

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None. The goal is to complete the name search this quarter.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No change. Name search is one big outstanding piece to complete, and it is
  rather intimidating.  It is hoped that one of the more experienced
  individuals will have time to complete it this quarter.  That should help
  with participation once the final name is known.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  No change.

Hadoop Development Tools

Eclipse based tools for developing applications on the Hadoop platform

Hadoop Development Tools has been incubating since 2012-11-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We have to define and implement an effective approach to manage the
     "client connections" to multiple clusters.
  2. Migrate the existing functionality from master to make next releases.
  3. Build Community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  - None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - 36 mail exchanges have happened over the dev list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  HDT is off to a slow start, it appears partially due to some licensing
  issues.  Now that they have their first release out, I hope that they can
  continue to create more iterative releases and provide a great tool.

--------------------
Ripple

At the moment the project is discussing its future. So far
almost no community could be grown and it is being discussed
if the project should become a sub-project of Apache Cordova.

The pros of this solution would be:

 - Cordova is a consumer of Ripple
 - Cordova is an active project and has a functional PMC

One con of this solution is that Cordova cannot guarantee
the success of the project. Also, the current Ripple code base
cannot be released, as there are some things to sort out (from
legal perspective, like the images cannot be redistributed).

Both communities have discussed this option and also the option
to move to GitHub. So far no agreement could be reached.

Phoenix

Phoenix is an open source SQL query engine for accessing NoSQL data
stores such as Apache HBase. It is accessed as a JDBC driver and
enables querying and managing HBase tables using SQL.

Phoenix has been incubating since 12/11/2013.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1) Continue to make our users successful and prove the value of
     Phoenix+HBase over other alternatives.
  2) Continue to attract new users, contributors, and committers to the
     project.
  3) Become the defacto standard for accessing data stored in NoSQL stores.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Both dev and user traffic is strong on the mailing list (780 and 187 mail
  messages respectively). Work is underway by an engineer from Huawei to
  add a new secondary indexing strategy called local indexing to Phoenix.
  James Taylor gave a talk on Apache Phoenix at ApacheCon. Eli Levine and
  James Taylor gave a talk on Phoenix at HBaseCon. James will also give a
  talk at Hadoop Summit. Good discussions took place at the HBase
  Hackathon on how to commonize the type system between Phoenix, HBase,
  Hive, Impala, and Kite, as well as on how Continuity's transaction support
  (soon to be open sourced) may be plugged into Phoenix. An interesting
  discussion is underway on how Phoenix can be leveraged to get SQL
  support for the Apache Accumulo project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  meant to be a public UDDI registry, both running in the OpenShift cloud.
- Website is transitioned to SVNPubSub: http://juddi.apache.org/

Scout 
- No release this period, not really any development took place.
- Very low volume of JAXR related questions on the mailing list. 

Last PMC addition and new committer April 3, 2013 (Alex O'Ree)

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]
Apache Kafka is a distributed pub/sub system for efficiently collecting and
delivering a large number of messages to both offline and online systems.

Development
===========
We released Kafka 0.8.1 and 0.8.1.1, which include a few improved admin tools
and new features like log compaction. We are currently stablizing the new
producer, which provides better performance and a cleaner api. We are
finalizing the api and the design for the new consumer.

Community
===========
Lots of activities in the mailing list. kafka-user has 480, 450, 388 emails in
Feb, Mar and Apr, respectively (slightly less than 538 in Jan). kafka-dev has
1120, 1047, 1272 emails in Feb, Mar and Apr (slightly less than 540 in Jan).
There were three Kafka related talks in ApacheCon 2014. We last elected two
committers in Oct. 2013.

Releases
===========
0.8.1 was released on Mar 21, 2014 and 0.8.1.1 was released on Apr 29, 2014.

Infra
===========
The recent Apache mail server issue impacted many projects. I am sure there
will be some post-mortem on how to prevent this in the future. Could the 
post-mortem results be shared with all PMCs?

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been seven major releases, including a 1.6 release on April 30,
2014.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer and PMC member we signed up was Graeme Seaton (graemes), on
March 2, 2014.  Other contributors have been approached, but have also
declined to accept consideration for possible committership.  The most recent
of these encounters took place in September, 2013.


Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been active, with a wide range of topics.  Most of our
connectors now have significant use cases and constituencies, and the
connector family continues to grow.  Dev list comments for this period
centered around voting for the major 1.5 release, people looking for
integration advice, etc.

Committer and external contributions have been significant this cycle.  I am
unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

None known.

Branding
========

We have reviewed the site branding guidelines and believe we are now compliant
with these, with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other
Apache products that don't have any such marks.  Hopefully we will be able to
correct this issue
soon.

In April 2014, Apache Marmotta v3.2.0 was released. The next 
maintenance release (v3.1.1) is expected in the upcoming weeks.

Traffic on the lists is stable. We have been approached by 
"OverLOD Surfer", a research project, to discuss synergies, common
goals and ways to collaborate.

For the 2014 GSoC Program, Marmotta received 3 project proposals of
which one was finally accepted: 
  Qihong Lin: "Implementation of the LDP service for Apache Marmotta
  based on SPARQL 1.1",
  http://s.apache.org/rE
  inspired by MARMOTTA-444
Of the other two, one was withdrawn by the student, the second was
not evaluated because only two mentors signed up from the Marmotta
community.

Subscribers to the projects mailing list:
    dev@marmotta.a.o: 70 subscribers (+10 since last report, 2014-02)

No new committers have been added since Nov of 2011.

There has been some discussion of the project’s health on the dev@ and users@
mailing lists, which has led to an effort to update the project’s build
architecture, in hopes of removing at least one barrier to participation.  The
PMC is curious if there are any Apache resources to aid in community building.

Greg Trasuk has requested that the community nominate a new PMC Chair. 
Discussions on a replacement Chair are under way.  The board should expect a
resolution to change the Chair at the next board meeting.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

The project is closing out the work for its 1.0.0 release, which will be a
major milestone introducing both new functionality and API compatibility
guarantees across the 1.X series. We’ve had one release candidate posted and
are working on the next after a period of heavy QA. The project continues to
see fast community growth — over 100 people submitted patches for 1.0.

Some of the major features in 1.0 include:
- A new Spark SQL component for accessing structured data within Spark
  programs
- Java 8 lambda syntax support to make Spark programming in Java easier
- Sparse data support, model evaluation, matrix algorithms and decision trees
  in MLlib
- Long-lived monitoring dashboard
- Common job submission script for all cluster managers
- Revamped docs including new detailed docs for all the ML algorithms
- Full integration with Hadoop YARN security model
- API stability across the entire 1.X line

Releases:

Our last few releases were:

Apr 9, 2014: Spark 0.9.1
Feb 2, 2014: Spark 0.9.0-incubating

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

* Overview

  No board-level issues at this time, since our report in February.

* Community

  No changes in committers or PMC makeup. Our last committer was added
  in July 2013. Our last PMC addition was March 2012.
  
  The Subversion Live conferences hosted by WANdisco were held in
  early May. An elego-hosted hackathon will be held in Berlin in
  June, and a hackathon hosted by WANdisco is being assembled for
  August. Historically, these have been well-attended and well-
  regarded by the Subversion committers.

* Releases

  In February, the community began preparing an alpha release of
  1.9.0. That alpha had several problems and was pulled. 1.9.0-alpha2
  was eventually released on April 14, 2014. Discussions are being
  held regarding finalizing "trunk", branching, and beginning the
  release process. Much of the discussion will occur at the above-
  mentioned hackathon in June with summaries posted to the list for
  non-attendees to participate (as is typical with Subversion
  hackathons and the face-to-face discussions).

  Since our report in February, Apache Subversion 1.8.9 was released
  on May 14, and 1.7.17 was released on May 19.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiricco]

Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities
in enterprise environments, implemented in JEE technology.

Status

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.


Community

In the last quarter the traffic on user@ and dev@ ML was rather low - while
private@ was instead higher than usual, due to new committer / PMC member
votes and security flaw handling.

We have successfully handled our first security flaw (CVE-2014-0111) and
added a security page to the project's website.

Last committer addition (Andrea Patricelli) is dated March 2014
Last addition to PMC (Guido Wimmel) is dated April 2014.

Releases since last report

     * 1.1.6 (Feb 22nd, 2014)

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Tajo Project  [Hyunsik Choi]

Apache Tajo is a robust big data relational and distributed data warehouse
system for Apache Hadoop. Tajo is designed for low-latency and scalable ad-hoc
queries, online aggregation, and ETL (extract-transform-load process) on
large-data sets stored on HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and other data
sources. By supporting SQL standards and leveraging advanced database
techniques, Tajo allows direct control of distributed execution and data
flow across a variety of query evaluation strategies and optimization
opportunities.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based on,
but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java Enterprise
Edition Specifications.

Significant work was done by the project around formalizing desired policy and
documentation for security vulnerabilities.  To date all of these have been in
sibling projects and not in TomEE or OpenEJB specifically.  Regardless users
have come to expect TomEE have the same responsiveness, specifically for
Tomcat vulnerabilities.  This work was done actually a month or so before the
Heartbleed incident fortunately enough and the project was able to turn that
around very quickly after it was released by Tomcat.  This quarter saw two
security vulnerability releases, TomEE 1.6.0.1 and 1.6.0.2, each about a month
apart.  Note frequent releases have been a concern in several prior board
reports.  It's very good to see a marked improvement in this area.

Primary focus on trunk has revolved around supporting Java 8, which has
required patches and releases to a handful projects.  Trunk will be released
as TomEE 1.7.0, hopefully within a month.  After this release the community
plans to change trunk to TomEE 2.0 and begin work towards Java EE 7 (with or
with out a TCK -- hopefully with).

Community activity has increased since last quarter.  Patches have been
committed from around six new faces hailing from various parts of the world.
Most having seen some presentation or been a user for a while and encouraged
by seeing others make the jump and start committing.  I'll note once again, my
personal observations are individual committers tend to come in at least
groups of two.  Seeing others ask the basic questions on how to contribute
often has a way of emboldening others to do the same -- when they do as well,
it tends to snowball.  Good to see the right "ingredients" in play for some
community growth.

Conversation about growing the PMC and legal oversight was pushed to the dev
list again.  Good opportunity to teach how Apache works as a legal entity for
the new people getting involved and clarify for existing committers.  I'd
expect to see some additions there.

Last release was 1.6.0.2 on 2014-05-12.  Last committer was added November
2013.  Last PMC addition was 2010-08-26.
