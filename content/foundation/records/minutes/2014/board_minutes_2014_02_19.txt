 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The main topic of discussion on the board list over the last month has
       been release practices. As it progressed, it was good to see that
       ongoing operational concerns were handled separately from discussion
       about how to do more frequent releases within the bounds of current
       ASF policy. Releasing open source software to the public is one of the
       most fundamental things we do, so it is important that it is handled
       diligently.

       We're getting closer to the time where we need to prepare for the
       Annual Members Meeting, so I've started to canvas dates. Currently the
       first week of June seems the most feasible, but I've included a
       discussion item in the agenda to decide.

       The ASF received an invitation to participate in the "2014 Future of
       Open Source Survey", which Sally has taken forward with the PMCs.

    B. President [Ross]

      An extremely busy month for me personally which has kept me away from
      many of my ASF duties.
   
      The EA contract was renewed as previously agreed. A new renewal date has
      been entered into the calendar. With Melissa's help we are in the
      processes of updating our Director records with CSC. Please note that
      Melissa is now providing an approximate breakdown of her time. As is
      appropriate Melissa is in full control of her time allocation, this new
      reporting is intended only to inform the board for budget monitoring as
      requested.

      ApacheCon proceeds thanks to continuing significant effort from Rich.
      Due to my personal issues this month I have not been as helpful as I had
      hoped but it seems Rich has, as always, taken it in his stride. See the
      EVP report for more detail.
   
      I am yet to make significant progress on reporting budget vs actuals.
      The treasurer has provided some initial data exports but I have been
      unable to find the time to process it. Since I need to create a new
      budget for the following year I propose to build this reporting into a
      new spreadsheet that I develop during the preparation of this budget.
   
      Trademarks remains very busy and Shane has indicated that he is falling
      behind a little. I have encouraged Shane to continue to work with
      Melissa to identify areas in which she can help. I also note that an
      Member has also offered to help.
   
      Fundraising is also progressing well though it is notable that this is
      taking up a reasonable chunk of both Sally's and Melissa's time. Like
      trademarks we need to acknowledge this role is not one that a volunteer
      can be expected to fill. Unlike Trademarks though VP Fundraising appears
      to have been able to find sufficient tasks that can be handled by
      contractors. I believe this is mainly due to the less legally sensitive
      domain. However, I grow increasingly concerned that more support from
      Officers in managing key sponsor relations is necessary.
   
      Marketing progresses with its usual rhythm. No exceptional items to
      reports.
   
      Infra also reports nothing exceptional this month. I do note the ongoing
      improvement of GitHub integration at the specific request of committers.
   
      I engaged with the Cordova PMC with respect to their release process.
      Initially this engagement was only as a member attempting to help them
      understand the lay of the land. However at the request of a number of
      Directors and Infra I subsequently made a formal request (cc board@ and
      infra-private@) to ensure releases after 2.8.1 are formally voted upon.
      Joe has been working with the PMC to define a suitable process which
      does not introduce unnecessary work. I will conduct any necessary sanity
      checks with the board to ensure the final solution is acceptable. For
      now the PMC has acknowledged the need to address this issue (see Cordova
      report) and Joe reports that he is satisfied with progress to date.
   
      TAC has, once again, failed to submit a report (and due to my own
      lateness they have not had a prompt from me). However, Melissa reports
      progress has been made towards planning for ApacheCon.
   
      Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       The Treasurer's Office processed repayment for some items related 
       to the Dublin Meetup and also processed payment to NASDAQ Global
       Newswire in coordination with VP Press, Marketing and the President.

       The Treasurer and the President identified how a statement of actuals could 
       be provided to the President quarterly.

       Over the past month, the office has periodically provided information 
       to the EA on sponsors and their incoming payments.

       We have processed a payment to the EA and set up her new payment 
       amount to reflect her updated contract and raise.

       The Office dealt with an inquiry from the Apache OOo PMC regarding 
       reimbursements for FOSDEM 2014.

       We are actively coordinating with Virtual, Inc. to obtain a quote 
       for their financial services.

       We are working with EA and Nick Burch to handle wire transfer for 
       initial payments for TAC flights for ACNA 2014.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       January was an average month after the December doldrums.  There 
       were 60 iclas and three cclas received and filed. 

       The board subscription list received some overdue maintenance. 
       LDAP subscriptions to pmc-chairs have been synchronized with PMC 
       chairs in committee-info.txt. All but three PMC chairs are 
       subscribed to board.


    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        ApacheCon North America 2014 will be held in Denver Colorado,
        April 7-9, with tutorials and a co-located Cloudstack event to
        follow on the 10th and 11th.

        Since the last meeting, the ApacheCon call for papers has come
        and gone, and we have, as of Monday, February 17th, selected a
        schedule of talks for the event, and notified the selected
        speakers. We are still receiving answers back from those
        speakers and adjusting the schedule for the people who have
        declined, or want their talks moved to avoid other conflicts.

        Members of the Apache community were amazingly helpful in the
        process of selecting the content, and I think we have a really
        solid schedule for this event.

        As compared to years past, the conference will have much more
        content, with 10 tracks on Monday and Tuesday, and 9 on
        Wednesday, and the Cloudstack Collaboration Conference on
        Thursday and Friday. Additionally we have a day and a half
        of tutorials, and numerous evening events.

        It is now LF's responsibility to market the event and draw in
        the registrations. I expect to have a report on registrations
        for the next board meeting. The lead time is very short, and
        they have their work cut out for them. Any way that we can help
        promote the event will be important to augment their effort.

        Meanwhile, we are looking at venues in Europe for November, with
        Budapest and Rome being considered. And we are also very
        tentatively looking at the possibility of doing an event in
        Brazil, although that is unlikely to be in this calendar year.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, and board@) and following-up with appropriate personnel

    ApacheCon:  70% (includes TAC)

          being sent directly from the vendor to Michael Stehmann in Germany
          for OOO's 2014 events, as well as for distributing amongst others in
          the EU.  By doing so, this will reduce our shipping costs
          tremendously). 
        Researched items for our giveaways (will be placing an order within a
          week or so)
        Sent email for a volunteer to edit the website to update the ApacheCon

        Sorted FedEx invoice for a shipment sent to Lewis McGibbney and
          committed to svn for processing
        Prepared package to Michael Stehmann for FOSDEM (Rich graciously
          agreed to take with him so we could avoid the $176+ in shipping
          costs...thanks again, Rich!!)
        Completed the annual report questionnaire received from CSC.  Sent to
          Ross for review of a couple of missing bits of information
        Contract renewal - signed on Jan 20
        Weekly status calls with Ross and Rich

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

This was a very busy month on trademarks@, and there are a number of 
open questions still being worked on.  There have also been a number of 
good discussions about clarifying our policies - both for PMCs as well 
as for third parties - and about improving the Project Independence 
guidelines.

Incubator PMC and trademarks@ was contacted by a third party about our 
use of the Apache Sentry name for our security-related product.  
Discussions are continuing.

My two talks on Brand Management were accepted for ApacheCon Denver, and 
also one brand talk at the following CloudStack Collab that week. Phew!

The Apache Hadoop PMC created trademarks@hadoop.a.o privately archived 
mailing list; plans are to use it for better coordination of various 
Hadoop-related brand policing.

Met with counsel for the CLOUDSTACK matter, and met with a representative 
from UKFast to work on a settlement to ensure our registration in the EU 
can continue and to ensure that UKFast recognizes our marks.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

At the request of Upayavira, this month’s report is being written by Melissa.

Melissa has been continuing to follow-up on the renewals that have been sent
out.  As a result of her persistence, some that we thought were “dead”, she
has revived.

We have received a Bronze payment from Cerner.  

As of the writing of this, we’re awaiting an update from the Treasurer’s
office on any new payments.

Melissa has reached out to Sam to request the Tax#/EIN# be added to the quotes
and invoices.

Facebook has sent a Supplier ACH Enrollment Form, which Melissa has completed
and sent off to them.

In the process of adding “thank yous” to individual donors on the “Thanks”
page of the website.

The renewals for Yahoo! and Citrix will be going out soon, as they are up for
renewal the first week of April.

Although we’ve been making great progress, it’s clear that we still have a lot
of work ahead of us.   I’ve (me, Melissa) actually been contemplating a better
invoicing/accounting system to keep track of this.  I think it would be in our
best interest if we purchase an invoicing/accounting system.  We might have to
pay for a program, but it would be totally worth it in the long run.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain on schedule and under budget. All vendor payments have
been processed on time with thanks to the Treasurer and Operations teams.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned. Sally
Khudairi completed Sponsor renewal outreach activities for several
organizations, and has secured confirmation from select Platinum-level
Sponsors.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org:

- 11 January 2014: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Release of #Apache™
  #SpamAssassin™ 3.4.0

IV. Informal Announcements: six newsworthy items were announced on @TheASF; one
new post was made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed. No new posts were made on
"TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: one project milestone announcement is planned to take
place by the end of the month. PMCs wishing to announce major project news, as
well as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator, are welcome to contact
Sally at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least
2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 9 media requests, and 2 notifications for
industry award submissions. The ASF received 1,519 press clips over this time
period, vs. last month's clip count of 422.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst queries. Apache was mentioned
in 17 reports by Gartner, 7 write-ups by GigaOM, 13 reports by Yankee Group,
and 3 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is liaising with the ApacheCon producer, with
particular focus on communications and sponsor outreach.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally continues
coordinating award nominations for a few Apache projects, as well as liaising
with the ASF's presence at several conferences and virtual events.

X. Newswire accounts: we have renewed our pre-paid press release agreement with
NASDAQ GlobeNewswire, and have 17 in our account through the end of the
calendar year. We also have 9 remaining pre-paid press releases on the
PRNewswire account through May 2014, as well as ongoing distribution donated by
Pressat with no pre-established termination timeframe.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]


New Karma:
==========


Finances:
==========


Board Action Items:
===================


Short Term Priorities:
======================

* Look into mac build slaves.


* Converge on git.apache.org migration to eris. (Step 1 is merge git ->
  git-wip on tyr) (opinions?)

* Investigate / negotiate external code-signing capability, currently in talks
  under NDA. INFRA-3991 is tracking the status, and a Webex call has taken
  place.

* Complete nagios-to-circonus migration for monitoring.

* Continue to experiment with weekly team meetings via google hangout.

* Explore the possibility of revamping the infra documents to have a more 
  intuitive feel about them, improve readability.

* Confluence Upgrade. Upgrade from 5.0.3 to latest. Hopefully will be less
  painful this time around.  (Support case closed, nothing useful came from it
  other than check the logs.)

* Port tlp creation scripts over to new json-based design on whimsy.

* Ensure all contractors are participating in on-call situations, minimally by
  requiring cell-phone notification (via SMS, twitter, etc) for all circonus
  alarms.

* Explore better integration with GitHub that allows us to retain the same
  information on the mailing list, so that vital discussions are recorded as
  having taken place in the right places (if it didn't happen on the ML...).

Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Choose a suitable technology for continued buildout of our virtual
  hosting infra.  Right now we are on VMWare but it no longer is gratis
  software for the ASF.

* Continue gradually replacing gear we no longer have any hardware warranty
  support for.

* Formulate an effective process and surrounding policy documentation for
  fulfilling the DMCA safe harbor provisions as they relate to Apache services.

* Institute egress filtering on all mission-critical service hosts.


General Activity:
=================

* Migrated dist.apache.org from backups of thor to eris.  Unfortunately a
  dozen commits were naturally lost in the process.  Thanks to TRACI.NET for
  providing additional bandwidth for this purpose.

* Jira: Jira is now runnning on Apache Tomcat 8.0.0 (rather than 7.0.x). While
  running on 8.0.x is unsupported by Atlassian, this is providing valuable
  feedback to the Tomcat community. To mitigate the risk of running an
  unsupported configuration, Jira is being monitored more closely than usual for
  any problems and there is a plan in place to rollback to 7.0.x if necessary.

* At the behest of committers, we have started working on a stronger
  implementation of GitHub services, including 'vanity plates' for all Apache
  committers on GitHub.  A method of interacting with GitHub Pull Requests and
  comments has been completed, that both interacts with the GitHub interface
  and retains all messages on the local mailing lists and JIRA instances for
  record keeping. At the time of writing, we have 367 committers on the Apache
  team on GitHub. We have made a blog entry about this at
  http://s.apache.org/asfgithub which seems to have reached many projects
  already.  Furthermore, the Incubator has been involved in the development of
  this, and are thus also aware of its existence and use cases.

* The new SSL wildcard was obtained from Thawte earlier this month, and will
  be rolled out to services very soon. Thanks to jimjag this got the business
  end of the deal done so we could actually get the cert in before the incumbent
  expires.

* All remaining SVN repos have now been upgraded to 1.8.

* Resurrected thor (mail-search) after soliciting help from SMS for on-site
  repairs.

* Amended release policy to provide rationale and spent time explaining the new
  section to members@.  See http://www.apache.org/dev/release#why

* Work with Cordova on processing their historical releases to comport with
  policy.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

We had 26 applications submitted this time. Of those, based on the judges
recommendations, the committee chose to accept 15 of these. Considering the
tight timescales we've been compressed into, those numbers are actually
pretty good.

All 15 successful applicants have accepted, and we now have an almost
complete set of flight / hotel / conference / dates / etc requirements from
everyone. We're working with the travel agent to find the cheapest sensible
flights for everyone, probably about half have been finalised now, rest
expected soon. As with past conferences, we're booking non-refundable and
non-changeable tickets, and we're self-insuring for the event of someone not
getting a visa or similar. We're ensuring everyone has their own travel
insurance to cover medical costs especially, but also ideally cancellations
in case they're ill or similar.

We've 5 applicants who need to apply for visas, so these are our top
priority.

We have however hit a snag with getting the wire transfer to the Travel
Agent, so she can ticket the flights we're happy with. We think we'll
probably be fine to wait until early next week to ticket most flights, but
for next time it'd be good if more people were able to approve transfers
with the bank. If the delay looks set to increase, we'll just put more (or
perhaps even all) on credit cards.

On a related money note, only Gav and Melissa have access to
/repos/private/financials/Bills/ to submit or track invoices. It would be
good if all of the Travel Assistance Committee could be given access too,
since we do generate a fair number each year.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

Relatively slow but steady month. No progress yet on Creative Commons
(CC-BY 4.0) issue. Geir has offered to help regarding conversations
with Oracle related to TCK access (renewals as well as new ones).
We are operating under the understanding that we still can test against
expired TCKs in the meantime.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds
arriving at security@ in Jan. These continue to be dealt with by
the security team.

Some effort was made this month to start to chase some old issues
which we forwarded to projects but were there was no visible progress.
One of these was escalated to the board after the reporter had no
response for 6 months (the discussion was ongoing at the time of this
report, but in general the difficulty is where a PMC does not have
complete technical coverage of the project, in these cases we should
make sure the PMC build a separate security team of the folks who can
handle issues.  This is in no way an ASF-only issue, we see exactly
the same problems with other upstreams including Linux kernel etc.)

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Jonathan Ellis]

Cassandra is a distributed database providing massive scalability,
high performance, and high availability.

Releases:

2.0.3  25 Nov 13
1.2.12 25 Nov 13
1.2.13 20 Dec 13
2.0.4  30 Dec 13
1.2.14  3 Feb 14

Development:

Work on 2.1 continues.  User-defined types [1] and collection indexing [2]
are complete, and internal optimization is ongoing: we have added a persistent,
atomic b-tree that saves 60% heap space compared to SnapTreeMap [3].

Community:

The January 2014 Cassandra Summit Japan [4] [5] saw about 100 attendees, a small
increase over December 2012.  About 2/3 of the audience were running Cassandra
in production.  There was widespread agreement that the English language
is the largest barrier to Cassandra use in Japan, and growth will not take off
until Japanese documentation is available.

Mikhail Stepura was added as committer 16 Jan 2014.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Click Project  [Malcolm Edgar]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it
is based around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is
very similar to Cocoon 2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and
designed to be easily used with Java code (= no frameworks required!).
On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal of becoming the best available
platform for RESTful webservices and web applications.

Community

Traffic on users and devs list continues be light. Some users asked about
different issues in the different versions of cocoon. Various devs attended
the questions and provided solutions. David Crossley pointed out that I was
not subscribed to the board mailing which I fixed. Further I updated
irs-disclosures.txt to my best knowledge however Simone had not been in this
doc so I used a approx. date.

Releases

2.1 has been released on 2013/03/20.


Development
None


Security issues reported:
 None.

Progress of the project:

 We need to release a new version of cocoon 3 and cocoon 2.2 but still no
committer has stepped up yet to do so.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Robert Burrell Donkin]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]



Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
(Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
which are missing in the CDI core spec.

DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers 
like Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server, 
JBoss Wildfly, Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also
on simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

Project Status:
Bugfixing goes on in the current code base.
Community is stable and active.
Gerhard Petracek will present DeltaSpike on the JavaLand conference.

Releases:
last release: deltaspike-0.5 on 2013-09-11.

As the JSF-integration module is now pretty much production 
ready we will probably ship 1.0 pretty soon.

Community:
Last Committer: Thomas Andraschko (tandraschko) on 2013-12-14
Mailing list activity was high and we had many different committers
contributing to our jsf module improvements.

Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  No activity on the user mail list.

  The only activity on the dev mail list was me doing a few issue tracker
  comments to show people some easy things that they could do to help the
  project to move forward.

  We received a request from a maintainer endeavouring to enable the Homebrew
  package manager to handle Forrest, beyond their current workaround. I did
  explain to our project what needs to happen. There has been no response.

  The project was asked to review our situation regarding the recently
  revised branding guidelines. No-one commented that they have done so.

  At this quarter, eight PMC members responded to my draft report. This
  confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

  The draft report did re-start a small discussion on private@ list about the
  state of the project. People were reminded about the outcome of the last
  time that this arose, i.e. it is okay for the project to be quiet, as long
  as it is still able to make decisions. People were asked to make effort on
  the dev mail list, and to assist with project tasks, and reminded about the
  need for a release.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  Enabled per-project configuration of Cocoon error handling.

  Updated our JSch supporting product.

persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key
value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The last release of Gora (0.3) was on 8th May 2013.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Project activity has been good. We've received a number of 
contributions from non-pmc/committers which is really positive.
Work is ongoing on GORA_94 a branch of the trunk code which 
focuses on a long-overdue upgrade of our legacy Avro 
dependencies from 1.3.3 to 1.7.X. As this is a major
undertaking therefore once this is addressed we will 
be pushing a release candidate for 0.4.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Apostolos Giannakidis as PMC member and committer
on 2014-01-17 (yyy-mm-dd). 

How has the community developed since the last report?

Shadowing overall project activity the community mailing
lists and Jira have seen contributions from new faces
and new names.
This is very positive for the project showing that 
people are not only using Gora but are keen to engage in
development.
Mailing list numbers are as follows
user@:    from 49 --> 57
dev@:     from 60 --> 64
commits@  from NA --> 26

Changes to PMC & Committers

Apostolos Giannakidis joined as PMC member and committer
on 2014-01-17 (yyy-mm-dd). Apostolos is the second GSoC
student who has been VOTE'd by the Gora PMC to join our 
ranks. Sebb kept us on our toes during the board@ 
72hr NOTICE period so thank you to him for that.

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of Apache projects
including, Nutch, Tika, OODT, Camel, Solr, Accumulo, Whirr, Hadoop,
Any23 & HBase (this is not an exhaustive list).

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 36 podlings currently under incubation.

  At time of writing, graduation votes were underway for the following:

    Knox
    Spark

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

    Jan 21 Apache Metamodel 4.0.0-incubating

  It took 9 days for the third IPMC vote to arrive.

    Release                             RC VOTE start  Third IMPC +1   Days
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Apache Metamodel 4.0.0-incubating   Dec 12         Dec 21      9

* IP Clearance

  * Salesforce donated the code for Phoenix, an open source SQL query engine
    for Apache HBase, a NoSQL data store. It is accessed as a JDBC driver
    and enables querying and managing HBase tables using SQL. 

* Miscellaneous

  * The issue of how best to integrate with GitHub is a recurring topic of
    discussion.  Infra added a new feature -- forwarding of comments on pull
    requests to dev lists -- which was well received.  However, as GitHub's
    interface is an external commercial service rather than something we run
    on our own hardware, it is difficult to ensure that communications
    will be archived, requiring additional vigilance from PMCs.

  * A proposal for Hoya, an application to deploy and manage existing
    distributed applications in a YARN cluster, was discussed at length but
    has not yet been voted on.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John Ament (johndament):

    Droids is a long standing podling, with a robust code base but without
    much need for frequent releases.  I think graduating into an existing
    TLP (not their own TLP) would be a good resolution, it helps avoid some
    of the over head of many binding votes to carry on while still
    maintaining an area to work in.  The people working on droids were fast
    to respond and give feedback on what's happening, but like is mentioned
    the list is not very active (in the past 6 months, the main
    conversations going on were around status of the project).

--------------------
Hadoop Development Tools

Eclipse based tools for developing applications on the Hadoop platform

Hadoop Development Tools has been incubating since 2012-11-09.

  1. we have to finish the release of version 0.0.1, the main issue being
     resolving source and binary license and notice files.
  2. we have to define and implement an effective approach to manage the
     "client connections" to multiple clusters.
  3. Build Community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

--------------------
Knox

Knox Gateway is a system that provides a single point of secure access for
Apache Hadoop clusters.

Knox has been incubating since 2013-02-22.

  3. Begin the process!

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  1. None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Two new committers added.
  2. More user questions on user list trickling in.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Internally agreed to being graduation processes.

--------------------
log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We probably need to decide what's an acceptable platform/compiler
     list, sort out any remaining hiccups, and then move towards a
     release.
  2. We need to publish the project site with updated content to
     reflect the new status and fix documentation bugs.
  3. We need to make a broader use of the ASF infrastructure
     (notably the CI, as well as improved management of the Jira
     site - notably with triaging), and establish a roadmap for
     the next releases.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are stuck on INFRA-7209 and how to properly publish the project
  site.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The committers are still getting acquainted with each other and the
  foundation. There have been some discussions about how to develop
  within the team of committers already, like using a CI, how
  to deal with issues regarding a changelog, which fixes should be
  covered by our first incubation release etc.
  Moderation of the list seems to work, there were some support
  requests which were answered and problems introduced by commits on
  trunk discussed.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Some known bugs were fixed already and available patches applied,
  which is work in progress for the new release. It has been suggested
  to schedule most of the remaining available patches for an upcoming
  release of 0.11.0 to include as much content which has been provided
  over the years as possible.

Date of last release:

  2008-04-03 was the official, pre-incubation 0.10.0

  Many post-0.10.0 commits exist on trunk which we intend to get out
  as 0.11.x.

Phoenix

Phoenix is an open source SQL query engine for Apache HBase, a NoSQL data
store.  It is accessed as a JDBC driver and enables querying and managing
HBase tables using SQL.

Phoenix has been incubating since 12/11/2013.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1) Perform initial release out of apache incubator followed up quickly
     by two new releases
  2) Make our customers successful and prove value of Phoenix+HBase over
     other alternatives
  3) Attract new committers to the project

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

The below is informational for the IPMC (no need to forward the board):

  We've been waiting for our Github issues to be imported into our Apache
  JIRA but it is taking a while. We're considering doing the import
  ourselves, as we're starting to see duplicate JIRAs and continue to have
  to point users back to our old Github issues.
  [[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-7179|INFRA-7179]]

How has the community developed since the last report?

We've cut over from our former Github-based open source project to
our new Apache home and dev and user lists are busy.

No new committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 * Apache Brand Management has ok'd our name of Apache Phoenix [1]
 * IP Clearance is nearly complete: software grant has been
   submitted and acknowledged. Vote is underway and will close
   on 2/8.  IP-CLEARANCE note has been posted on general.
 * Reviewing proposed release on dev list and if all looks good,
   will start a vote for our first release next week.
 * Working in parallel toward a new 3.0.0 release as well.

Date of last release:

 No release yet.

re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other
projects.

Tez has been incubating since 2013-02-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Growing the community
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No new PPMC members or committers added since the last report. We have had
  interest from both new users and contributors via mailing lists and JIRA.
  The Hive project recently merged its native support for Tez into their
  trunk branch. The Pig community is also working on integrating  Tez and we
  have seen various JIRAs filed as well as some patches from Pig developers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the first week of November, 2013 (last report), we have had around
  180+ jiras filed and 130+ jiras resolved. We made the first release of Tez
  ( version 0.2.0 ) in the first week of December, 2013. There is currently
  ongoing work to make Tez work on a secure Hadoop cluster, after which we
  plan to do a 0.3.0 release.

Date of last release:

  2013-12-03

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  At project incubation. No new PPMC members or committers added since the

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Logging Project  [Christian Grobmeier]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to the logging of application behavior.

Currently there are no issues, which require the board’s attention.


- Community

Log4j 2 remains a very active project. The overall
community is healthy and friendly. We expect to add new committers in the 
coming weeks.

Log4j2 talks were submitted to the ApacheCon US CFP.

Log4cxx returned to the incubator and was active for a few weeks.

A Chainsaw release is currently blocked because we don't have
access to a code signing certificate. We consider this very
important for Chainsaw. Our Infra request showed that
other projects need access to that certificate as well, like:
OpenOffice, jUDDI, Tomcat.

The ticket is unresolved since 05/Oct/2011:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-3991 

In general, the project is healthy and growing.

- Project Branding Requirements

All components meet the branding requirements, except Chainsaw. 
We are still planning for a new Chainsaw release.

- Last three community changes

 * Remko Popma joined the PMC on Sep 28 2013.
 * Dominik Psenner joined the PMC on Jun 03 2013.
 * Nick Williams joined as a Committer on May 11 2013.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security
policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been five major releases, including a 1.4 release on October 28,
2013, and a point release 1.4.1 on November 16, 2014.  A new major release
(1.5) is being voted on at this time.

Committers and PMC membership
========================

The last committer and PMC member we signed up was Minoru Osuka (minoru), on
January 10, 2013.  We voted in a new committer and PMC member in May, but he
declined to accept the committership due to his company's policies.  Other
contributors have been approached, but have also declined to accept
consideration for possible committership. The most recent of these
encounters took place in September.

We are still not entirely sure why people who are obviously interested and to
some degree committed to the project seem unwilling to become full committers.
I suspect that corporate restrictions make this a challenge in some cases.
Also, we seem to be interacting more with contractors than with employees
recently, and it may well be that contractors have less interest in a
long-standing relationship with our project.  Nevertheless, we have rumors of
significant contributions being prepared by at least three individuals; if any
of these contributions are made, then we will likely offer the individuals
involved committerships.

Mailing list activity
==============

Mailing list has been active, with a wide range of topics.  Most of our
connectors now have significant use cases and constituencies.  Dev list
comments centered around voting, extensions to the SharePoint connector,
people looking for integration advice, etc.  ManifoldCF also participated in
Google Summer of Code, and MCF committers mentored one student developer
through end of September 2013.

External contributions and even committer contributions have been significant
this quarter, despite heavy workload among most of the committer community.

I am unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

None.

Branding
========

We have reviewed the site branding guidelines and believe we are now
compliant with these, with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos
from other Apache products that don't have any such marks.  We have
not yet scheduled time to address this issue.

Work to fully support httpd-2.4 is moving along.

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

Apache-Test 1.38 was released on August 6th, 2012

No new Apache-Test releases since the last report.

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since the last report.

--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Qpid Project  [Gordon Sim]

Apache Qpid™ is a project focused on creating software based on the
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), currently providing a
protocol engine library, message brokers written in C++ and Java, and
client libraries for C++, Java (including JMS), .Net, Python, Perl and
Ruby.

* Releases:

Qpid Proton 0.6 was released on 16th January.

Qpid Dispatch Router 0.1 was released on 17th January.

The Qpid 0.26 release vote has concluded (we have changed the
publishing process we use and publication is currently waiting on
infra-7201, but should be complete soon). The previous Qpid release
(0.24) was in 7th Sep, 2013.

* Community:

The main developer and user lists continue to be active. JIRAs are
being raised and addressed.

No new committers were added since last report (November 2013). The
last committer added was Pavel Moravec on 30th Aug, 2013. The last PMC
members to be added were Andrew Stitcher, Chuck Rolke, Justin Ross and
Keith Wall, who were originally voted in during September 2011. It was
brought to our attention however that there was no record of
notification to - or acknowledgement from, as at that time required -
the board at that time. This was rectified by a vote in Dec 2013 and
an acknowledgement was received from Jim Jagielski.

* Development Highlights:

AMQP 1.0 continues to be an area of activity as issues are reported
(often in conjunction with other AMQP 1.0 implementations) and fixed.

Development is underway on a new AMQP 1.0 based JMS client, in line
with the JMS Mapping being developed at OASIS.

The existing JMS over 1.0 client and the java broker now support
WebSockets, tracking the specification for that being developed at
OASIS.

Though not part of Qpid per se, an AMQP based NMS implementation
(using qpid::messaging under the covers) has been developed in
conjunction with the ActiveMQ project, increasing options for
interoperability between the two projects.

Dispatch Router added support for both competing and non-competing
patterns, based on patterns specified in the configuration file. (Will
be part of 0.2 release). The Dispatch Router is tracking the
specification development for AMQP management.

Proton Messenger added support for dynamic nodes. (Included in 0.6
release). Some ideas have also been discussed to simplify using the
Proton engine API, namely adding an event-oriented interface and some
generic container support.

* Issues:

There are no items requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

Development:
* Investigated datum aliasing for various producers [1]
* Investigated using XSLT for processing different versions of
XML-based formats like GML [2]
* Basic CoordinateReferenceSystem implementations have been committed [3]
* Migration from Well Known Text version 1 (WKT 1) formatting to WKT
2, a.k.a. ISO 19162.

Community:
* First post to the Users@ mailing list [6]

Branding:
* The talk proposal for ApacheCon 2014 has been submitted. Martin used
David Neufeld's text [7], with minor changes. currently waiting to see
if ApacheCon accepts this proposal.

* The OGC sent Martin a private email suggesting to submit a blog post
on the OGC portal [8] about this talk. If accepted, Martin will come
back on the mailing list for proposing a blog post for OGC portal.

* There is an OGC meeting in March. Of particular interest for SIS
there is a CRS WKT SWG (currently scheduled March 26th at 11:00
AM[9]). We hope to have a fully functional WKT 2 implementation before
this meeting, so we can share our experience with the group. SIS would
be among the first WKT 2 implementations - the only other we are aware
of was made by ESRI.

Issues:
Need to add Martin as a wiki editor [4]. Thread here.[5]

Releases:

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our 
subprojects use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the 
XSLT libraries.

ISSUES

The volunteers appear short staffed to shepherd the staging of new 
patch releases and perform quality assurance activities on the 
code base.

RELEASES

- Xalan Java (2.7.1) 27-Nov-2007
- Xalan C/C++ (1.11) 29-Oct-2012

COMMUNITY ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature project with little development activity.
There are still persons able to address the issues of
developers.

The development email has little volume.  The Xalan library
still has a major presence in commercial software products.

PMC MEMBERSHIP

No membership changes.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

A new XML parser configuration was developed with enhancements for
the JAXP secure processing feature. This will allow applications to
set global limits (using system properties) on the number and size
of entities that should be processed by the parser. Similar
capability was already available programmatically through the XML
APIs.

Some minor refactoring was done in the XML Schema 1.1
implementation.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 50 posts on the j-dev
and j-users lists since the beginning of November 2013.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

New project files were added to support Visual Studio 2013. A few
other minor changes were made to update copyright years.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 70 posts on the c-dev
and c-users lists since the beginning of November 2013.

No news about when the 3.2 version will be packaged. The latest
release is Xerces-C 3.1.1 (April 27th, 2010).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

Some minor improvements were made to the XML Commons Resolver's
classloading code to better align it with the ObjectFactory classes
in Xerces-J and Xalan-J. No postings to the mailing list this
quarter.

Committer / PMC Changes

No new committers in the last quarter. A potential new Xerces-J
committer is currently being discussed by the PMC. The most recent
committers were elected in July 2008 (Xerces-C) and May 2009
(Xerces-J).

No new PMC members in the last quarter. The last two additions to
the PMC were in May 2010.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

There's still some work left to do on the TLP website, including
