       Over the last month there has been some discussion about the authority
       of project VPs to enter into binding agreements with third parties on
       behalf of the ASF. While the need for this is extremely rare, we
       reiterated that this can occur as long as it is contained to the scope
       of their project, the agreement has been reviewed by the Legal Affairs
       Committee and any other relevant officers, and that prior approval has
       been given for any associated expenses. A suggestion has been made
       that this be formalised through policy.

       I've started a discussion about streamlining the monthly report
       process in a way that may reduce the amount of traffic going through
       the board's mailing list. I plan to tie that up and make any changes
       to the reporting guidelines by the end of the month, before reports
       start appearing for the August meeting.

    B. President [Ross]

       Ross is absent due to family matters, and Rich is reporting in
       his absence. 

       Upayavira, Melissa, and others have been preparing for meetings
       at OSCON next week, with existing and potential sponsors. Details
       of this are on the Fundraising@ mailing list. Officers who will
       be at the conference are encouraged to make themselves available
       for those meetings if they haven't already done so. VP Fundraising
       has prepared a 'pitch deck' for potential sponsors at ApacheCon,
       which you may wish to review if you want to participate in that
       process.

       The conversation with the CloudStack PMC continues, and the PMC
       has now made a formal, detailed request to Infrastructure for
       additional hardware. As this just happened yesterday, there hasn't
       been time for a decision on this proposal yet.

       The Travel Assistance Committee has received some requests for
       assistance for ApacheCon Europe, but that process is still open
       for a few more days. The process between TAC and LF is improved
       over ApacheCon North America, and so should go more smoothly. Two
       new members of the committee have joined to assist in these
       activities.

       The Executive Assistant has been primarily focused on
       preparations around OSCON, both Fundraising related and
       logistical arrangements regarding our booth presence. Other work
       is detailed in her report.

       VP Brand Management reports a busy month with a heavy load of
       project requests and conversations.

       VP Infrastructure reports progress on a signed binaries solution,
       and a build server. The Infrastructure team is holding a F2F
       meeting this week for team building and working through issues
       that are made difficult by remote communication. The
       Infrastructure report discusses the activities of the team in
       great detail, as requested in last month's meeting.

       In Ross's absence, the proposed budget has not been completed,
       and we request the Board's indulgence to let this slip another
       month, while Ross takes care of personal matters.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
       Transition of bill paying and other functions to Virtual continues
       as planned. We have a Citizens Bank account up and running that is
       being used to make payments and the remainder of the funds in WFS
       are in process for being transitioned over to Citizen's and/or
       potentially to other assets with higher yield, e.g., CDs. The
       Treasurer's Office is awaiting further input from Virtual on a
       recommendation for where the remaining assets should be housed.
        
       Chris has received his token for Citizen's Bank. Michelle Ball from
       Virtual notes that unlike WFS, Citizen's only requires 1 person to
       release funds instead of 2.
        
       Virtual has begun to generate expenses versus actuals reports
       starting with data from May. The Treasurer's Office encourages those
       that are interested in the gory details to inquire - otherwise they
       will be summarized monthly as part of future Treasurer's reports.
        
       Weekly calls with Virtual have continued in both an ad-hoc manner,
       and moving to bi-weekly. A digest of the items discussed in the
       call include:
        
           1. Continued work on the budget with Ross.  
           2. Concern from Virtual regarding meeting IRS rules for 
              contractors.  
           3. Virtual will not be the ones to prepare our tax returns - this is
              contrary to the Treasurer's Office understanding that Virtual
              would.  Chris to have an action item to follow up with
              Virtual/Tom on this.
           4. Continued work on documentation for Treasurer processes.  
           5. Tracking down various bank statements and contracts information,
              e.g., for the EA.
           6. Interest in collecting information on donations, including
              targeted donations - Virtual states little concern in "single digit"
              number of these donations, but states that under the current
              contract, they would not be able to manage e.g., one targeted
              donation per ASF project.
           7. Virtual has made progress mapping expenditures to budget
              items.  
           8. Virtual will provide ftp access credentials for
              read-only access to
              their Sharepoint server and separately to their QuickBooks
              server; Sam will place this information into the ASF svn
              repository.
           9. Virtual will provide a phone number for our vendors to call
              when they have Billing issues
          10. Virtual would like to know if they can help with organizing
              smaller conferences/meetups? This is a service that they provide (for
              a fee).  Sam and Shane will gather more information.
        
       The invoice from the CPA for the Audit has been received and
       remittance is currently awaiting approval from the President or the
       EVP.
        
       Sam set up an archived accounting@apache.org list that forwards to
       Tom Pappas, Michelle Ball, Chris Mattmann, Sam, and Upayavira. Those
       wishing to contact both the Treasurer's officers *and* Virtual
       should use this list.
        
       Sam Ruby created a web interface to upload Bills to the received
       and approved workflow queue -
       https://whimsy.apache.org/treasurer/bill-upload. Sally and others
       have begun to successfully use this interface.
        
       Chris provided all the payment information from his Treasurer's
       notes to Michelle Ball and Virtual.
        
       The Treasurer's Office is waiting on input from the President's
       Office on who should have credit cards. Melissa has volunteered to
       also provide help and move the conversation forward.
        
       Treasurer's Office is working with VP, Infrastructure to financially
       onboard a new contractor, Dan Norris.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary is running well with no issues. In June, 73 iclas, 
       6 cclas, 25 member applications, and three grants were received 
       and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        My time has been consumed by ApacheCon for the last month.

        ApacheCon EU will be held in Budapest, November 17-21 of this
        year, and will be produced by The Linux Foundation event team.

        The CFP for ApacheCon EU closed on June 25, and speaker
        notifications were scheduled to be sent out on July 15th. We did
        not meet this deadline, but expect to have the schedule settled,
        and notifications sent out, this weekend at the latest. The
        talks have mostly been selected, with enormous help from
        various people, most notably Jan Iversen, and a few details
        remain to be confirmed with potential speakers. What remains is
        to finalize the schedule - talk order, which days things appear
        on, and so on - and identify an adequate number of fallback
        talks.

        At this point, we expect that the schedule will consist of 8
        tracks of talks for three days, followed by one day of tutorials
        (Thursday). ApacheCon will be immediately followed by the
        CloudStack Collaboration Conference Europe.

        We are scheduled to announce the schedule on July 28th, but I
        hope to have this completed earlier than this, as I will be in
        vacation for the week of July 28th through August 1st.

        We are in the process of selecting a venue for ApacheCon North
        America 2015, and several locations are being pursued. We hope
        to have a final venue selection in August so that we can start
        the CFP process before ApacheCon EU.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Several directors and members brainstormed on trademarks@ about ways to
improve response times and our ability to help our many Apache projects manage
their brands, including ways to better educate and empower PMCs to a much
greater degree.  In particular Chip and the CloudStack PMC have made
proposals/patches to start implementing this for their project, which should
be an excellent test case to ensure our documentation is sufficiently clear
for PMCs.

Our EA has jumped in on tm-registrations@ to help organize data collection for
trademark registration details from a number of projects who have requested to
register their product marks. 

As the breadth and complex types of questions both on trademarks@ and other
email addresses (including non-list emails) grows, it has reached the point
where it is becoming not practical to provide the level of support and
expertise we would like to provide to all Apache projects with all volunteers.
While our EA will be very helpful to pickup organizing registrations (in
conjunction with counsel), many of these questions need some practical
expertise to give the best answers.  

I will be manning the ASF booth at OSCON next week, and hope to be able to
help out with sponsor and other contacts.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

An active month so far, with preparations for OSCON, for which we emailed 
every sponsor to see if they wished to meet with us. Melissa has been 
collating the responses and arranging a diary.

Google asked for help with presentations at OSCON regarding GSoC, which
has been arranged.

We have a 'pitch deck' prepared by Chip that we can use for potential
sponsors at ApacheCon.

I shall be collating some financial details to make our fundraising
story at OSCON clearer.

I had a call with a Fundraising website vendor that Sally introduced me
to. Their app is very interesting, and seems very cheap. It could allow
us to build up workflows for receiving individual donations across our 
projects, tracking the donations against source projects, and thanking
donors, and potentially making requests to them for additional funds
for future projects. Given the price, I think this could be worth 
considering for some point in the medium term future.

I had a good conversation with a new contact at a Gold sponsor who has
agreed to renew.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we received an invoice from Meltwater News for our clipping reports
through December 2015 that was promptly processed with thanks to Sam Ruby and
Virtual.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally Khudairi has transitioned
out of top-tier Sponsor communications as of the new fiscal year. Following
discussions with VP Brand Management Shane Curcuru, Sally streamlined the
template "Powered by Apache" mark for Apache project logos, and has been
working with HotWax Media on creating a final version (HotWax Media are
donating this service). The aim remains to launch during OSCON. Sally is in
the third month of working Apache CloudStack on project-specific
marketing/promotional strategy and support.

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the newswire
service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this timeframe.
An entry was posted to blogs.apache.org on behalf of the Apache Travel
Assistance Committee (TAC).

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were tweeted on @TheASF, and 1 on
@ApacheCon to promote the CFPs closing for ApacheCon Europe and CloudStack
Communication Conference.

V. Future Announcements: Sally is working with a podling on a press release in
anticipation of their graduating from the Incubator this week. PMCs wishing to
announce major project news, as well as podlings ready to graduate from the
Incubator, are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more
information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution. 

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 5 media requests, and pitched several
"Apache friendly" journalists under embargo on developments in Apache
CloudStack. Sally is also pitching registered journalists for interviews
during OSCON. The ASF received 335 press clips over this time period, vs. last
month's clip count of 586. Our monitoring media hits for CloudStack (searching
coverage as "CloudStack", not "Apache CloudStack") has yielded a total of
1,089 mentions this month vs. 917 last month. 

VII. Analyst Relations: responding to a request from Chip Childers for the new
Fundraising presentation deck, we sought testimonials on the ASF from various
analysts, and received excellent quotes from 451 Research, Gartner, and
RedMonk. Sally is also pitching possible analyst briefings at OSCON. Apache
was mentioned in 3 write-ups by Gartner, 3 reports by Forrester, 6 write-ups
by GigaOM, 2 reports by Yankee Group, 2 reports by IDC, and 6 write-ups by 451
Research. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: we have promoted reminders for the CFP for ApacheCon
Europe under the usual channels. 

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally created new
conference signage, for which Melissa Warnkin has coordinated production
(along with new promotional materials/giveaways) for the ASF booth at OSCON.
Sally will not be attending OSCON. Discussions with RedMonk regarding a
possible group of Apache-branded DevOps and DataOps events in the UK continue.
Sally and is also finalizing a tearsheet for distribution at events in Europe
as requested by Jan Iverson. 

X. Newswire accounts: we have 14 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of the calendar year, and continue to receive
gratis news release distribution by Pressat (UK) with no pre-established
termination timeframe.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========

Dan Norris (dnorris)


Finances:
==========
* 64GB RAM for Arcas:       $777.16


Operations Action Items:
========================


Short Term Priorities:
======================

* Signed binaries
  Mark Thomas has made significant progress in his efforts with Symantec around
  using their Binary Signing as a Service product. I have high hopes that we are
  near a proposed solution. 

* builds.a.o 
  Much work has been done around builds.a.o; and it's largely stabilized. The
  past month has yielded 99.92% uptime. That's a far cry from the routine
  outages that were happening on average once a day. 

Long Range Priorities:
======================

* Monitoring
  ** Uptime monitoring and reporting:
     As an extension to defining core services and service uptime targets,
     Daniel has begun compiling weekly reports of uptime for most of the
     publicly facing services. These reports will in turn be compressed into
     monthly reports for the board as well as a yearly report detailing the
     overall uptime reality vs our set targets. Eventually, these reports will
     also feature inward facing services.

   ** Unified logging:
      Discussion and exploration has begun on unifying logging on all VMs and
      machines. The logging will be tied to puppet and allow for easy access to
      each hosts logs from a centralized logging database, as well as allow for
      cross-referencing data. Initial exploration into using LogStash with
      ElasticSearch and Kibana have begun, and are expected to produce findings
      for use in the next board report.

* Automation
  Tony has expended effort and time in deploying a more updated, platform 
  agnostic base for puppet. Giridharan Kesavan and Gavin have been 
  experimenting with using Ansible for build slave automation. Dan Norris
  has begun work on automating VM/cloud provisioning  

* Technical debt
  Gavin began addressing cruft in many of our automated jobs; this will be a
  long term effort, but that work is underway and already yielding benefits

  In some ways, we are just beginning to collect information to let us know
  where we stand, and exactly how much debt we have accrued. The uptime reports,
  and comparing that with our first pass at service level expectations has
  started occurring. 

* Resiliency 
  Our efforts around resiliency are still nascent. We have begun to address a
  few issues caused by resource constraints, though this is a very minor attempt
  to provide true resilience. As other efforts in our long term priorities take
  shape, I expect that we'll begin to see this accelerate. 

General Activity:
=================

* Dealt with yet another batch of OpenSSL CVEs affecting all hosts.
* Upgraded Arcas (JIRA host) with 64GB RAM to deal with slow response times.
  This has greatly reduced the response time from Jira. See screenshot detailing
  that change: http://people.apache.org/~ke4qqq/ss.png
* Welcomed a new contractor, Dan Norris, to the fold.
* Face-to-face meeting in Cambridge between infrastructure people
* Created 23 new committer accounts, 4 new mailing lists


Uptime Statistics:
================== 
These figures currently span weeks 27 and 28 of this year, and only cover public
facing services.

Type:                   Target:   Reality:   Target Met:
--------------------------------------------------------- 
Critical services:       99.00%    99.98%        Yes 
Core services:           98.00%    99.84%        Yes
Standard services:       95.00%    92.71%        No[1]
--------------------------------------------------------- 
Overall:                 97.43%    97.80%        Yes
---------------------------------------------------------

For details on each service as well as average response times, see
http://s.apache.org/uptime

[1] The target for standard services was not met due to our Sonar instance
    being unstable at the moment and only having around 50% uptime. We are
    investigating the issue.


Contractor detail:

ORDER BY updated DESC'

My Open Jira Tickets [34] See: jql query 'project = INFRA AND status != Closed
AND assignee was ipv6guru ORDER BY updated DESC'

Commits made Infra repo: 22

June 16th saw planned downtime at OSUOSL. The downtime window was 2 hours
between 11am UTC and 1PM UTC. Both myself and Daniel Gruno covered this outage
window and also at least 2 hours before and after the planned window. Actual
downtime we saw was 2 minutes at 11:55am.

Ongoing answering of queries on the infra@ and build@ mailing lists, including
quick resolutions to issues raised. The same goes for IRC - Channels open at
time of writing are:
  #sling #asfboard #jclouds #asfmembers #asftac @#abdera #avro #osuosl
  #+#buildbot #asftest @#asfinfra

Worked on various buildslaves of both Buildbot and Jenkins, updating,
upgrading, patching for SSL etc. Worked on upgrading SSL for several other
VMs, at the same time taking the time and opportunity to
update/upgrade/dist-upgrade and reboot.

Ongoing Medium Term Jobs:
=======================

  Dell Warranty Renewals.
 ------------------------------------

   Involves Liaising with various Dell Reps via email. Service Tags have been
   99% been brought upto date and documented in the service-tags.txt file. Make
   decisions on warranty renewals based on age and whether it is in our plan to
   renew the machine within the next 9 months. Get quotes for and give the go
   ahead to Dell for those we intend to renew. The current email noise from Dell
   regarding these is quite high so this is a task I intend to complete over the
   next few weeks - to either renew, or decline and stop renewals emails.

  Root Cron Job Emails.
 --------------------------------

  Involves sifting through root@ Cron emails from various machines and vms.
  Determine the current important ones that can be assessed and fixed to
  completion. Previously, this was just 'done' and perhaps followed up with an
  email reply to a cron job in question. For better visibiilty and reporting, I
  have now started creating Jira Tickets for these tasks; and also given these
  tickets the 'Cron' label. I expect to make steady progress and have the cron
  mails halved at least over the next 3 months.

  See JQL Query: 'project = Infrastructure and labels = Cron'

Confluence Wiki.
-----------------------

Confluence needs an upgrade. Test instance is in progress. I hope to have this
done in the next couple of weeks.

Ongoing Longer Term Jobs:
======================

  Jenkins/Buildbot
  ----------------------

Some time has been spent improving the stability of Jenkins Server and its
Slaves. With thanks Mainly to Andrew Bayer recently the Server has improved
dramatically. The slaves have seen improvement in stability and uptime too,
including the 2 windows machines. I have spent a fair bit of time recently on
these. I need to create new FreeBSD and Solaris slaves for Jenkins. The former
I think we can achieve in the Cloud whilst the latter I don't think is
supported at RackSpace, investigating. Might need to create our own VM image
for it. At the time of Writing, 34 Builds are in the Jenkins Queue, mostly
attributed to these missing two slave OS flavours and also Hadoop jobs.

Buildbot stabilty is just about back to normal after I rebuilt the Master from
scratch on a new OS Freebsd 10 (prepped by Tony). The forced upgrade of the
Buildbot Master version itself also caused some instability for a while due to
configuration upgrades required. This affected just about all projects using
Buildbot and the CMS. I note that the Subversion project has indicated that a
Mail should have been sent to the Subversion PMC about the downtime suffered
by the Subversion project as a result of the code changes required by the
forced upgrade. Following this advice, I'd have had to email another 30+ PMCS
also telling them the same thing. I find that my generic email to the infra
list should have been enough information for all parties concerned.

  Cloud for Builds.
  ----------------------

  Rackspace - A test machine has been created. Jenkins has yet to make use of
  this however and I'm in progress of working out the best way to integrate with
  our systems - do we use LDAP, Puppet etc with it or create a custom image we
  can replicate. I'll also be starting work soon on a Buildbot test instance for
  on demand.

  Microsoft Azure - A test machine with windows server 2012 is up and running
  and I have access. I am in progress of making changes to this image to make a
  baseline so that the Azure team can replicate several more once I have it
  right. Once done for Jenkins I'll do the same for Buildbot; and make sure to
  leave 2 or 3 instances available for general project use, which I'll advertise
  as available once ready.

  Puppet - Have completed online pre-training puppet course as advised by David,
  using a Vagrant instance via VirtualBox. I continue to invest a couple of
  hours a week in looking through the Puppet Labs online and Documentation. I
  continue to investigate the best methods of integrating the Jenkins and
  Buildbot Slaves with Puppet, though I'm really in a waiting pattern for our
  puppet master to be upgraded to v3.


* Tony Stevenson

Took two weeks of vacation

Having spent a considerable amount of time trying to make a new Puppet3 master
on a FreeBSD box this however did not pan out - there were far too many little
changes from a standard deployment needed and we were still having ssl issues
with puppetdb.

A new Ubuntu VM has been built as the new puppet master and is now about done.
One more test to run tomorrow.

Spent a little bit of time on-boarding jake into root@ activities (a/c
creation etc).

Issues with Erebus VMware host. Needed a reinstall of the vsphere agent and
reconnecting to the management console.

New infra-puppet GitHub repo

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

W3C is discussing the idea of extending the participation roles to include
"Webizen". A "Webizen" would be an individual (or group); they would not
have the full rights of W3C membership.  Discussions are at a very early
stage.

For ASF, nothing proposed so far would affect ASF current membership of
W3C.

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds
arriving at security@ in April. These continue to be dealt with by
the security team.  Apologies for lack of update last month due to
a missed reminder.  You'll notice a trend for reports against the 
Apache website which are so far all false positives caused by
people who run third party scanning tools and don't bother to 
interpret the results (for example reporting that you can access
a directory listing).  These also included reports that www.apache.org
had a public server status page, which although deliberate for many
years, we asked infrastructure to remove (and is now done).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Tom White]

Apache Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

== Issues ==

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

== Community ==

Committer activity continues to be low, as reported in May, with just
a few commits per month. The community has discussed soliciting more
reviews for the various Avro language implementations from those who
are more proficient in those languages. This has resulted in more
reviews, but it remains to be seen if it boosts committer activity
significantly.

Since the last board report in May, 26 Jira issues were filed and
16 resolved.

Mailing list activity is steady, with a few hundred messages total
per month.

No new committers have been added since 1/2014.

No new PMC members have been added since 9/2012.

== Releases ==

No releases have been made in the last quarter. The last release was
Avro 1.7.6 which was released on January 22, 2014.

A 1.7.7 release is under discussion; we are also discussing improvements
to make it easier to roll releases. (http://s.apache.org/ux)

 * Development for JDK 7 upgrade, we have isolated incompatibility
   between JDK 7 and Jetty 6.1.26 in NIO implementation and some
   file descriptor leaks in Jetty which causes ports to be blocked,
   and causes 100% CPU usage in jetty.  Support for JDK 7 will be
   deferred until Hadoop community move up to Jetty 9.

 * Moved older releases to archive.apache.org.

 * There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Releases:

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Gabriel Reid]

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running
MapReduce and Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

Project Status
--------------

The project has been moving along at a steady pace in the past quarter, at a
similar velocity to the previous two quarters. Since the last board report
there have been 53 new issues logged in Jira, with 44 of them being closed 
in that time. The majority of recent work has been focused on minor 
improvements and bug fixes, and there have also been quite a few tickets 
related to improvements in Scrunch (the Scala API for Crunch).

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Community
---------

Community activity has continued to be in line with recent quarters, with an
average of several mails on the developer list per day and an average of a 
message every day or two on the user list, and first-time contributions from
new contributors every few weeks.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and 
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, 
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports 
such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.

Releases: 
2.6.14 
2.7.11 
3.0.0
XJC-Utils 3.0.0 and 3.0.1

Committer/PMC: 
One committer added this period (Xilai Dai) 
No PMC changes this period.  Last PMC addition Jan 2014.

Community update: 
We released 3.0.0 this period which as a huge milestone for
us.   So far, the uptake has been quite positive with a lot of new users
logging issues.  We’re working on getting a 3.0.1 bug fix out shortly to fix
some of the issues that have been found.

The 2.7.11/2.6.14 releases fixed a couple of security issues that were made 
public on our web site: http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.html

Some discussions were started about requested changes for 3.1, but that’s 
being slightly delayed until we get 3.0.1/2.7.12/2.6.15 out (very shortly) 
when we plan to stop supporting 2.6.x.   This was to avoid having too many
fixes branches to deal with.

Much work has been done by various community members to get CXF 
working with Java 8.   The remaining issues require a release of BCEL from 
Apache Commons which we’ve been inquiring about for over a month and a 
half now.  Hopefully the commons folks can get that out soon.

-- Overall activity in the past quarter --

There has been relatively little activity this quarter. The mailing list
has been somewhat active but it would appear the bulk of the PMC no
longer has the resources to dedicate the required attention (e.g. there
are still contributions pending approval).

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

YARN development of a generic TimelineServer, resource tracking for disk and
network resources, caching of common dependencies, support for container
preemption, and other features continues.

The HDFS extended attributes feature branch merged to trunk (2014-06-11).
Thorough specification of FileSystem semantics (HADOOP-9361) also
successfully merged. Native checksumming, hedged reads, features built over
HA interfaces, NFS, and ACLs are also actively developed in trunk and
release branches.

Across all projects, work adding encryption and security features continues
in a development branch.

The project changed its bylaws to allow 5 days for release votes, instead of
the 7 allocated for other decisions.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Roman Shaposhnik]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are currently 34 podlings under incubation, with three votes to 
graduate as the report is being closed. All three VOTEs have passed, 
and VXQuery is still underway. S4 has voted to retire, but the retirement 
tasks have not yet been finished. Fleece has joined the incubator, as of 9 
June 2014.

Brooklyn

Brooklyn is a framework for modeling, monitoring, and managing applications
through autonomic blueprints.

Brooklyn has been incubating since 2014-05-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Performing our first release under Apache
  2. Completing migration into the Incubator - largest task is
populating Jira with existing issues
  3. Growing a diverse community and PPMC

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A small number of new users have appeared, contributing posts to the
  mailing lists, Jira issues for bug reports and suggested improvements,
  and a code contribution.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The "boostrapping" process is well underway, with active mailing
  lists, website, and a burst of commit activity.

Date of last release:

  No releases under Apache yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Andrea Turli and Sam Corbett have become committers and joined the
  PPMC on 2014-04-01 and -02 respectively. Their committer accounts
  are currently being processed.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

(cc) As the report notes, Brooklyn is slowly (but surely) converting over
to the ASF infrastructure and processes. They are making good progress at
this time.


--------------------
DataFu

DataFu provides a collection of Hadoop MapReduce jobs and functions in 
higher level languages based on it to perform data analysis. It provides 
functions for common statistics tasks (e.g. quantiles, sampling), PageRank, 
stream sessionization, and set and bag operations. DataFu also provides 
Hadoop jobs for incremental data processing in MapReduce.

DataFu has been incubating since 2014-01-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building an ASF-based community.
  2. Release.
  3. Decide on the future home of the project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Will Vaughan gave a talk on DataFu at ApacheCon in April, and
  Casey Stella gave a talk on Pig and DataFu at the Hadoop Summit in
  June.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Lots of JIRAs on bug fixes and new features, especially in April and May.
 Work slowed significantly in June, which probably means it's time for a
 release to mark our progress thus far.

Date of last release:

  None. Six month of incubation.

--------------------
DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images
and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.
smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that data, APIs 
will also be created to use and manage it.

DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.

The report was not delivered on time from the project itself, as a mentor
I (bdelacretaz) have sent the following challenges to the project's dev list
to try and get the current somewhat active PPMC members to take over:

  1. Challenge #1: provide regular reports
  2. Challenge #2: make a release
  3. Challenge #3: form a PMC with 4-5 members to graduate

Those should really not be challenges but at this point that felt like an 
appropriate way of indicating the importance of those actions. There's 
already promising responses, we'll see if those translate into concrete 
actions.

Apart from that there's been some good discussions in the last weeks, but no 
concrete results yet.

Best is probably to evaluate the progress on the above challenges next month
to make a decision about the future of the project.

Date of last release:

  No releases yet

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

(rvs) The report is missing. This on-n-off seems to continue with the 
project. I know that some of the mentors are recommending giving it more 
time, but it seems like we need to establish some metrics to at least get 
the community in shape to do the basics (like reporting and releasing). 
Without any kind of forcing function I am not sure what the future for this 
project really is.

(bdelacretaz) Agreed - I have now provided a mentor report above.


--------------------
Fleece

Implementation of JSon Processing Java specification.

Fleece has been incubating since 2014-06-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finish bootstrapping project, update clutch.xml and update
incubator status page.
  2. Expanding the community, increase user list activity and adding
new committers.
  3. Develop a set of testcases which prove correct parsing behaviour.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * none

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * First communication/discussions via mailing lists took place,
first issues reported and fixed.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Incubator status page, the mailing lists and the initial website

--------------------
Flink

Flink is an open source system for expressive, declarative, fast, and
efficient data analysis. Flink combines the scalability and programming
flexibility of distributed MapReduce-like platforms with the efficiency, 
out-of-core execution, and query optimization capabilities found in parallel
databases. Flink was originally known as Stratosphere when it entered the
Incubator.

Flink has been incubating since 2014-04-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. The new name ("Flink") has still not been confirmed by the trademark 
     team.
  2. Setup of release infrastructure and first release
  3. Continue with community growth

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Two presentations (Meetup in Nice by a committer, one in Budapest by a 
  contributor), new users are showing up on the mailing list and on JIRA.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Most of the infrastructure setup has been done. Users start using the new
  mailing lists.
  In the last month, 21 authors have pushed 120 commits to master. On 
  master, 910 files have changed and there have been 74,313 additions and 
  37,094 deletions.

Date of last release:

  2014-05-31 (no incubator release yet)

--------------------
Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Community Developement:
Apache Kalumet 0.6-incubating version has been released.
However, due to some misunderstanding, the release vote has not been
completed by 3 IPMC.  Especially, some legal files issues have been raised.
We are preparing a 0.6.1-incubating release to fix the legal files and
submit to IPMC vote.  We are in the way of promoting the documentation
on the website.

Project Development:
We are preparing the 0.6.1-incubating (plan for July, 14) to fix the
legal files issues raised on 0.6-incubating release and have a complete
IPMC vote.
We are preparing the 0.7-incubating release with the development changes.

Local branches have been created containing:
- new model and REST API
- new webconsole (remove of Echo framework)
These local branches will be merged on the 0.7-incubating branch (master).

Before Graduation:
   - The documentation has been updated and aligned with the 0.6-incubating
   release. The documentation will be promoted on the website and "linked"
   in announcement e-mails as soon as the 0.6.1-incubating release has
   been voted.
   - The 0.7-incubating release will fix the graduation issue, especially
   in term of license (removal of Echo2 framework for the UI).

Post Graduation:
  - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept
  globally to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
  deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of:

None so far.

MetaModel

MetaModel is a data access framework, providing a common interface for
exploration and querying of different types of datastores.

MetaModel has been incubating since 2013-06-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. More contributors to increase diversity of the community
  2. Finalize 4.1 release to demonstrate new functionality and evolution
within Apache
  3. Connect with other projects from Apache's ecosystem such as HBase,
Phoenix, Cassandra, Optiq

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A few new people have started to work actively on the mailing list.
  It is still a small community, and growth is needed.
  On the positive side we do see certain new individuals starting to
  contribute continuously to the project.

  We have been working on blogging, tweeting etc. to create more out-going
  communication about MetaModel.
  We feel that more of such activity is needed.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Apache MetaModel 4.1.0-incubating was released on Jan 21.
  This time with a new release engineer, which meant that the release
  instructions were re-iterated and updated.

  Communication on mailing list is improving and we see more diversity
  of requests.
  For instance, connectivity to Hadoop and HBase was previously not very
  active but now it's is taking a good share of the focus.

Date of last release:

  May 12th

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  June 2013 (but a new committer is being invited just now)

NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven.

NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.

Since the last report in April, a few obstacles have been removed:
 - the status page was updated with the current podling state and correct
 mentors
 - svnpubsub was enabled so the website can be updated again
 - a number of JIRA issues have been cleaned up to prepare for the release

Not blocking, but outstanding things to do:
 - resolve issues with Jenkins builds with infrastructure
 - finish closing out JIRA issues that have been partially finished
 for release
 - apply suitable patches that have been overlooked in the past and try
 to reconnect with contributors

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Ship the changes on trunk as a release and make it easier for new
  users to get up to speed when interested in the project
  2. Get a critical mass of committers/PPMC members that can respond to
  contributors, apply patches, nominate committers, and vote on releases
  3. Provide guidance on how to get involved in contributing

The incubator is already aware of the low level of activity, that many of
the PPMC are now disengaged and lack of mentors for the project. Konstantin
Boudnik has put his hand up to help out and that discussion is in progress.

There continues to be interest in a new release from users, and new
interest from some in making contributions that continue to be followed up.

Date of last release:

  2011-05-16

The last committer was added on 2011-04-19. There have not been any PPMC
additions since inception.

Optiq

Optiq is a highly customizable engine for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and
advanced query optimization, for data not residing in a
traditional database.

Optiq has been incubating since 2014-05-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Migrate fully to Apache infrastructure (next: web site and
     nightly builds).

  2. Re-organize code into org.apache.optiq namespace.

  3. Regular releases.

  4. Build an ASF community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need
to be aware of?

 With the mentors' permission, we released an unofficial
 release, optiq-0.8. Optiq has been making regular releases,
 approximately monthly, and this has built momentum in the
 community. Continuing this practice helps hold the community
 together. We intend to that the next release (0.9, end of July)
 is an official Apache Incubator release.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 This is our first report. The community remains very similar to
 the point where we joined the Incubator.

 We are doing outreach.

 * Julian Hyde gave two talks related to Optiq at Hadoop Summit.

 * Julian Hyde attended the ACM SIGMOD conference and discussed
   Optiq with several researchers.  Optiq was mentioned in
   several talks there.

 * An online meeting (via Google hangouts) for the community is
   scheduled for July 1st.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 This is our first report.

 Adopting Apache infrastructure:

  * We have completed necessary SGAs, and transferred code from
    github to Apache git, and begun committing to Apache
    git. (Original github site still online, but marked
    "retired" with redirection page.)

  * We have transferred github issues to Apache JIRA, and are
    using Apache JIRA for issue management.

  * Some members have complained that the traffic on dev@ is too
    great - requesting an issues@ mailing list for jira update
    traffic.

 We made an unofficial release (optiq-0.8) on 2014-06-27.

Date of last release:

 No releases yet under the Incubator. (But see unofficial
 release 0.8, above.)

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

 No new committers since we joined the Incubator.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building a user community
  2. Getting those users to contribute their work back
  3. Improving the application to make it easier to use

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No


How has the community developed since the last report?

 * We've made our first ASF-based release and are starting to get people
 discussing it on our dev list -our sole mailing list to date. This
 shows some take up, but it also identifies the challenge in diagnosing
 problems. We need to provide more application-side diagnostics to help
 both users and ourselves.

How has the project developed since the last report?


 * As stated, we've made our first ASF release. We plan to do this
 monthly for the next few months, to get our release process refined,
 as we as evolve the application from users' experiences.
 * We've fully migrated to the ASF JIRA server, and have been cross-filing
 issues with sibling Apache projects -notably YARN- so helping gain
 awareness of us and our needs. So far the other projects have been
 very helpful.
 * We're trying to contribute some of our changes back into the Hadoop
 and Bigtop projects -our workflow YARN services and service launcher
 to Hadoop; improvements to the test runner shell for Bigtop. These will
 spread the benefits of these features, and tighten our relationship with
 those projects on which we depend.

Usergrid

Usergrid is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) composed of an integrated database
(Cassandra), application layer and client tier with SDKs for developers.

Usergrid has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Obtain Usergrid release 1.0
  2. Resolve relationship with Apache in general
  3. Continue to grow community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

Recently, Usergrid has been through the wars with regards to its
development ethos, entire development process and most importantly
code commit process. The latter has been an issue which resulted in one
particular Apache Member having his account temporarily disabled, and
a new contributor workflow that the project believes does satisfy board
and infrastructure requirements:

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/usergrid/Usergrid+Contribution+Workflow

It has not been an easy month for Usergrid however the community spirit is
higher than it ever has been and the community is in a strong position
to meet Incubator criteria. An extremely positive note here is that
the Usergrid community has been actively expanding throughout the above
process. This is something we can all learn from.

How has the community developed since the last report?

The Usergrid community has been growing steadily and very encouragingly
based on community VOTE's. We welcome contributions to Usergrid. Most
importantly, many members of the existing Usergrid PPMC have been
(extremely) actively involved in Usergrid's dissemination and expansion.

 * 74 subscribed to dev@

How has the project developed since the last report?

Many, many commits. Usergrid is very healthy with regards to its
development. What needs to be addressed however is the following:

 * Resolve commit process... MAJOR
 * Reflect commit messages to commit@

Date of last release:

  Usergrid (incubating) has not made an official release as of date. The
  community areactively working towards a release for 1.0.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

Apache Isis is a framework to enable the creation of software using
domain-driven design principles, being an implementation of the naked
objects architectural pattern


== Activity ==

Mailing list activity has been steady; user mailing list subscriptions 
continue to increase linearly month-on-month.   There is a notable increase
in subscribers who are clearly using Isis to develop their own systems to take 
through to production.

A number of the committers, and one non-committer, met up in Milan for 
"Isis Con" 2014 [1] to discuss future evolution of Isis framework.  We not 
only got to compare how we are all using the framework for our own particular
projects, we also sketched out a roadmap for the future.  The outputs of those
discussions were summarized to the mailing list [2], also in our wiki [3].

We are also participating in this year's Google Summer of Code 2014 [4].
We had two submissions, and accepted one of them.  This student is tackling
his project very diligently and producing some good work; it wasn't a 
difficult decision to pass him on his mid-term eval.

A number of submissions have been made to present at various conferences
later this year: ApacheCon EU, Devoxx (Belgium), Agile Cambridge (UK) and
Agile Testing/BDD Conference (UK).


== Development and Releases ==

Isis continues to be developed steadily, albeit mostly by a single committer
(myself).  

This quarter we made one new release, v1.5.0 on 7 Jun 2014 [5].


== Committers and PMC ==

There have been no changes to the committers or PMC this quarter
* last committer added: Oscar Bou, 19 Aug 2013
* last PMC change: Oscar Bou, 19 Aug 2013


== Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

We made the following stable release from Jackrabbit trunk:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.8 on May 12th 

We made the following unstable release from Jackrabbit trunk:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.7.5 on March 17th 
    
We made the following releases from the Jackrabbit Oak sub project:
  
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 0.19 on March 24th
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 0.20 on April 8th
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.0 on May 20th
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.0.1 on June 26th

We made the following release from the Jackrabbit FileVault sub project:

  * Apache Jackrabbit FileVault 3.1 on March 31st
  * Apache Jackrabbit FileVault 3.1.2 on April 5th
  * Apache Jackrabbit FileVault 3.1.6 on April 22nd
          
o Community / Development
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak has finally hit the stage with its first major
    release in May. Apache Jackrabbit Oak is a new JCR implementation with a
    completely new architecture. Based on concepts like eventual consistency
    and multi-version concurrency control, and borrowing ideas from
    distributed version control systems and cloud-scale databases, the Oak
    architecture is a major leap ahead for Apache Jackrabbit.

  * Davide Gianella joined the Jackrabbit team as committer and PMC member
    in June. 

  * Various sessions about Jackrabbit and Oak have been submitted / accepted 
    to international conferences like ApacheCon, ApacheConEU,
    .adaptTo(Berlin).

Attachment X: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Bayer]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

Project Status
--------------

jclouds has carried out two successful releases (1.7.2 and 1.7.3) in the last
quarter and plans to release 1.7.4. The jclouds website and documentation
continues to be expanded.

The developer and user community is active, with sustained activity by the
core team. The PMC is still looking to grow the committer base and encourage
contributions across the spectrum of supported APIs and providers.

Community
---------

A slightly more detailed look at the project community. It should still be
brief, issues to think about include:

''When was the last committer voted in?''

2014-04-02 (Jeremy Daggett)

''When was the last PMC member added?''

2013-04-29 (initial composition of the PMC when jclouds entered the incubator)

There is regular activity on both the user and dev lists. Responses to
questions are generally fast, with multiple community members contributing.

Community Objectives
--------------------

What are the projects main plans and expectations for the community in the
next period?

 * Simplifying the current multi-repo release procedure to allow for more
   frequent releases
 * Determine an approximate release cadence and publish a draft roadmap
 * Encourage involvement and contributions by vendors of supported providers
 * Help students complete their two Google Summer of Code projects

Releases
--------

Have there been any releases from the project in the last quarter?

 * 1.7.2 (2014-04-16)
 * 1.7.3 (2014-05-30)

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Tim Williams]

Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF committers.

[STATUS]

We finished up the ByLaws cleanup from last quarter, saw one addition, and saw
some house-cleaning activity.

[DETAILS]

== Community ==

As mentioned in the last board report, our ByLaws were a bit flawed in their
voting requirements.  Last quarter saw the cleanup of the PMC roster and this
quarter the vote to correct the ByLaws passed, clearing the way for
streamlined lab additions.

Loads of cleanup occurred over the quarter including JIRA, a new VM, and the
website.

A new lab "Flexicon" was created with Gabriela Gibson as the PI.  Flexicon is
tool for individuals, business and crowds to organize and maintain a personal
or community-owned compendium of compound commands and scripts, which can be
standardized, shared, tracked and searched due to having a general compatible
format and inbuilt tests. It is not tied to any particular operating system or
software, it is a general tool to keep our working methods organized and to
enable us to share and preserve them. 

The Penihip lab went idle.

== Labs Statistics ==
- new: 1
- status changes (last 3 months): 1
- total number: 41
- active: 17

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Grant Ingersoll]

Apache Mahout has implementations of a wide range of machine learning and
data mining algorithms: clustering, classification, collaborative filtering
and frequent pattern mining

Project Status
--------------

The project continues to have a large and active user base.  While
the developer base has continued to grow, there is a very active
and healthy debate going on about where Mahout goes next.  We have
worked through many of these issues, but are not out of the proverbial
woods just yet.



Community
---------

* Andrew Palumbo and Pat Ferrel are new committers
* Dmitriy Lyubimov has resigned from the PMC

* The main issue concerning the community right now is the addition
of new contributions from 0xData and the integration of Mahout with Scala/Spark.



Community Objectives
--------------------

Our goal is to build scalable machine learning libraries. See the Issues
section below for the debate in the community about our objectives.


Releases
--------

In addition to an ongoing debate on Mahout's future, the community is actively
 working on integrating Mahout with Scala/Spark,  and bringing in new code and
 committers to update the core project.


Issues
------
For the most part, the community has gotten back to work by adding a couple of
new committers and pursuing the path of Scala support.  While there is still
not a huge developer base, people are contributing and working through the
issues.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache MRUnit Project  [Brock Noland]

DESCRIPTION
MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 1.1.0, released on
June 8, 2014. This was MRUnit's second release since graduation in May 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report: 
  http://s.apache.org/ia
* 12 JIRA's was resolved since the last report.
* Mail traffic is largely on the DEV list. Messages since Apr 1st: dev 142,
  user 5

COMMUNITY
* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
  the last report.
* Currently there are:
  Total of 41 subscribers to the developer list.
  Total of 80 subscribers to the user list.
  Total of 13 committers
  Total of 13 PMC members

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Julien Nioche]

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler 
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene™, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop 
datastructures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

There has been a lot of activity since the previous report and we are 
discussing releasing Nutch 1.9 within the next month or so. We fixed 
several important bugs and committed various improvements to the trunk.

There has been no releases of the Nutch 2.x branch since the previous 
report and there is limited activity on that branch. We are still 
planning to release 2.3 during the summer and are waiting for a few 
JIRA issues to be resolved first.

Apache Nutch has, for the first time, engaged in GSoC.
Lewis John McGibbney is working with student Fjodor Vershinin on the project 
"Create a Wicket-based Web Application for Nutch" [0] which essentailly
 will alow ANYONE to access, run, configure, provision, queue and execute
Nutch crawl jobs within the browser.

Progress is as follows
 * 1st report progress is here http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/FirstReport
 * Documentation on REST API => http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/NutchRESTAPI
 * Mentors comments are positive. The project is going to succeed. 

It will be a large step forward for the Nutch project in general.
 
 We also ported the Nutch website to Apache CMS, setup an IRC channel and 
 a Twitter account for the project (https://twitter.com/ApacheNutch).

COMMUNITY

There has been no change in the composition of the PMC and committers 
list since Talat Uyarer joined the PMC and committers on 31/03/2014.

The traffic on the mailing lists is at a steady level.

We submitted 2 talks and 1 workshop for ApacheCon EU. One of the talks
will present the results of a user survey [1] conducted by DigitalPebble Ltd.
 The workshop would be done by 3 Nutch committers.

A Nutch-related talk has been submitted for LuceneRevolution by a 
member of the community.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache OpenMeetings Project  [Sebastian Wagner]

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

### Issues for Board Awareness

The mail outage experienced by Apache last May is unacceptable
both for a reputable foundation like the ASF and for a
well-established project like OpenOffice.  We appreciate that the
Foundation is now aware that a well-working infrastructure is a
priority and that steps are being taken to guarantee a higher
quality of service.

### Community Development/Outreach Progress

The project added 1 new committer (May: tal) since our last report
in April. The new committer is involved in localization and website
improvements. No new PMC members since November 2013 (fanyuzhen).

The OpenOffice custom infrastructure (wiki, forum) is still in a
"minimal maintenance" mode. We are now starting to address the queue
of improvements requested by the community, but faster reaction
times are needed. The infrastructure team internal to the OpenOffice
project is insufficient and lacks coordination. We are
progressively standardizing on the Infra processes to minimize the
amount of "non-standard" sysadmin work needed.

Several volunteers engaged in translating the website to their
language by simply editing the HTML files; this proved to work
better in our case than sending people to the Apache CMS and asking
them to send patches.

We have new volunteers and new developments in the main website
too, with a completely reworked download section and more visibility
for localized websites thanks to a new language drop-down.

A new documentation effort for an end-users manual under the ALv2
licence is progressing more slowly than expected on the OpenOffice
Wiki, even though new volunteers show up regularly.

The localization community is growing: OpenOffice 4.1, released
29 April 2014, is fully released in 38 languages, 6 of which
(Bulgarian, Danish, Hebrew, Hindi, Norwegian Bokmal and Thai)
were new with respect to version 4.0.

OpenOffice had a dedicated track during ApacheCon Denver and
is set to have one during ApacheCon Budapest too, judging by the
number of submitted talk proposals.

The mailing lists for user support, localization, QA are quite
active, the marketing and documentation lists are moderately active.
Activity in social media is progressing well. The developer (dev)
list remains very active.

Community support forums remain popular with users, with an average
of over 100 posts per day. The online users counter reached two peaks
in May (359) and July (404). As for graphics, the forum header is
now consistent with the Extensions and Templates sites.

### Product/Project Development Progress

Apache OpenOffice 4.1.0, a release with some major improvements
including IA2 accessibility, OOXML compatibility, Mac OS X specific
features (64-bit application), replacement of outdated Mozilla code
with the NSS libraries, was published on 29 April 2014.

A bugfix release, Apache OpenOffice 4.1.1, is expected in August.
It will contain bugfixes and a few new translations.

Activities that are still ongoing include: actions for an easier
installation and availability on mainstream Linux distributions; a
new localization process, now progressing in the l10n40 branch; a
redesign of the build approach, dropping the historical dmake;
a rewritten OOXML filter, allowing import and (later) export.

The download trend remains very strong: Apache OpenOffice celebrated
100 million downloads on 17 April 2014.

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Apache-Bootstrap 0.07 was released on Jul 13, 2009

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since 2014-02.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Apache-Reload 0.12 was released on March 31st, 2012

No new Apache-Reload releases since 2014-02.


-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

Apache-DBI 1.12 was released on June 12nd, 2013

No new Apache-DBI releases since 2014-02.

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

Work on the http-2.4 branch is ongoing and we are getting closer to
being able to merge it to trunk and make an official release supporting httpd
2.4

Support for windows used to be difficult, having lost our main Windows developer.
However, recently, there as been more external contributions to our Windows support,
so it's looking better.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing steady activity, with a growing interest
in seeing the httpd-2.4 work complete.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened since the last report.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

The Apache Struts project community provides an action-based Java web
application framework.

The Struts team made two releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.16.2 - security fix release (2014-04-24)
* Struts 2.3.16.3 - security fix release (2014-05-03)

The last quarter was dominated by dealing with a major security issue.
The root cause for this issue is a widely overseen feature in Java Core
API that, in combination with using an expression language or bean
manipulation library, might lead to class loader access which in turn
allows for RCE attacks in certain server environments. Various web
frameworks were and might still be affected. Both Struts 1 and Struts 2
turned out to be affected.

For Struts 2 we received a vulnerability report leading to a very timely
security fix release followed by another security fix release to close
an additional attack vector for the same vulnerability. In favor for
these releases the vote on our next scheduled feature release 2.3.17 was
dropped.

Soon after disclosing the Struts 2 vulnerabilities, we got notified that
Struts 1 is affected as well. Despite Struts 1 had its EOL announcement
more than one year ago, the Struts PMC felt responsible to help the wide
user base still relying on Struts 1. The HP Fortify team was very
helpful in analyzing the issue and providing a mitigation path. The
issue caused enormous mail traffic, and we did our best to deal both
with communications and providing counter measures in an ASAP fashion.

While analyzing the issue deeper we found that we should contact both
the Tomcat PMC and the Commons PMC to have them review the issue impact
and evaluate if Apache Tomcat and commons-beanutils might want to
address this as well. Not unexpectedly, the Tomcat PMC decided that the
issue should not be addressed at container level but solely on the level
of deployed applications. The Commons PMC however decided that the issue
at its root cause should be addressed in commons-beanutils. In an
admirable cross project effort folks from Commons and Struts PMC,
including emeritus members, worked hard to get a solution out the door.

We are preparing a security fix release for Struts 1 including the new
commons-beautils library fixing the said issue.

In the aftermath of the buzz created by this issue and taking into
account the industry relevance of the Struts web framework family,
Google announced to add Apache Struts to their patch reward program.

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter. We
invited Bruce Phillips to join the PMC, but he rejected. Last PMC member
addition was on 2013-05-11, last committer addition on 2014-01-06.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.7) has been released 2013-04-29.
  We have made available the a series of beta builds of the upcoming 5.4 release, 
  (most recently, 5.4-beta-6, on 2014-05-29), following successful votes.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is high. Questions are answered with
  participation of not only the core contributors but also by the community
  at large. Discussion focuses especially around new features of the upcoming
  5.4 release. There are also frequent announcements concerning third-party
  libraries developed entirely outside the Tapestry team.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4 which
  will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other new features.
  At this point we are primarily looking at fixing bugs (from our large backlog)
  and documenting the significant new features.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 2014-04-25.
  The last PMC addition has been Massimo Lusetti on 2012-08-27.

PMC and committer diversity

  PMC and committer diversity is good. To our knowledge no two committers share
  the same employer. Levels of contribution vary over time with Howard Lewis
  Ship being the driving force behind Tapestry's development and various other
  committers working on areas of their interest.

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org" - completed
 * "Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc." - completed
 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing
 * "Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in footers,
   etc." - completed
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo
 * "Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date" - completed

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Massimo Manghi]

Apache Tcl is an umbrella for Tcl-Apache integration efforts. Current
projects are

 * Rivet
 * Websh 

Board issues: 

Apache Tcl is one of those active, but not intensely evolving projects.
We are maintaining our software, we have an adequate number of active
PMC members when it comes to testing and voting new releases but we
failed to attract new people to our project.
In recent years we did not have spontaneous contributions from the
community that could hint at possible candidates to be invited to join
the team of committers.  On the ASF lists the concept of understanding
and adhering to the ASF philosophy and bylaws was stressed
in several discussions, therefore simply going out to the mailing
lists calling for new volunteers seemed to us at least unfit to
these principles and in the long run potentially dangerous. The project
is still alive, I'm doing regular maintenance and some development
but the project needs freshmen to receive new impulse. Any guidance
from the board would be appreciated

Community:

No new committers were added. Last committer and PMC member joined
Apache/Tcl in Sept. 2012. Current number of subscribers to our 
active mailing lists are

 rivet-dev@: 44 subscribers
 websh-dev@: 20 subscribers 

 + no bug reports filed in this quarter for both Rivet and Websh

Releases

 + Rivet: we released version 2.2.0 on June 16th with a few bug fix and a
couple of command functionality extension. Initially planned to be a bug-fix 
release for Rivet 2.1 we voted to consolidate it as 2.2.0 because
it implements a strict policy on certain commands

 + Websh is maintained but no new artifacts were released after
3.6.0b5 (2009-09-24)

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the board's attention.


Community
=========

Two new committers were added since last report, leaving us with a total of 38
committers (note, there was a typo in the last report, which claimed we had 35
committers, when in reality it was 36). Our last committer was added on
05/28/2014. Activity on mailing list is normal, and we are seeing normal,
steady growth in mailing list subscribers:

    users@ - 432 subscribers (up 4% since last report)
    dev@ - 281 subscribers (up 2.5% since last report)


In Jira, 218 new tickets were opened and 136 were resolved or closed since
the last board report, which had 222 and 241 respectively. 830 changes were
committed to our git repository from 38 contributors. The number of unique
contributors is identical to the last report, but the number of commits were
almost twice as high.

Events
======

At ApacheCon 2014, we were represented with a full day track dedicated to
Traffic Server. Our spring Summit was held over two days at the same venue in
Denver, and was well received. We're planning for a fall Summit, the initial
idea was to do it in Budapest, but there seems to be little interest from the
community so far. We'll make a decision on where to host the next Summit soon,
but right now it looks like we'll do it in California instead.

Two Traffic Server community members will go to Velocity China in August and
talk about our project.

Releases
========

Two new releases were made since last report:

    Apache Traffic Server v4.2.1 (released 4/29/2014)
    Apache Traffic Server v5.0.0 (released 6/17/2014)

The v4.2.x family of releases is also a LTS branch, and this release marks
the EOL of all v4.1.x releases. The v4.2.x version will be supported until
v6.0.0 is released, roughly May 2015, and we expect a number of releases to be
made in the next year.

Upcoming releases include:

   * Soon: v4.2.2, fixing a few critical cache related issues etc.
   * Possibly: v5.0.1 in July
   * August: v5.1.0

Our v5.0.0 release also marked the End-Of-Life of the old v3.2.x release. No
further releases will be made for this version.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Wookie Project  [Scott Wilson]

Apache Wookie develops software related to implementation of the W3C
Widgets family of specifications.

ISSUES
We haven't really grown our community over the past year, and overall
activity is slowing to a trickle. Partly this is because of problems with
the W3C specification getting wider adoption as the major browser
vendors have all continued to produce competing formats.

Looking forward we may want to consider options including moving 
Wookie to the Attic or moving the project to become a sub-project of Rave
if the level of activity continues to decline. 

RELEASES
Wookie 1.0 was released on 24th February 2014.

ACTIVITY
Since April we've been working on Wookie 2.0, which is aimed at making
Wookie more modular and easier to integrate into Apache Rave and
other platforms.

COMMUNITY
Our last committer added was Steve Lee on 21st February 2013.
