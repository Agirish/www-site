 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month's reports show a huge amount of activity, some of the usual
       challenges and some solid progress addressing community challenges. 
       The following reports were acknowledged to include good examples /
       strategies that other communities could learn from: Beam, Mynewt,
       Incubator and Storm. Constructive feedback included the following
       items:
       * Reminder to always use links to lists.apache.org for mail archive
         references
       * Reminder to enclose sensitive items in <private> markers (since
         board reports become public when minutes are published)
       * Reminder to always include the date of the last release and last
         committer and PMC additions

       My personal focus last month was on getting started on the 5-year plan
       refresh and continuing research into nonprofit finance best practices.
       Watch members@ for updates.

    B. President [Sam]

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s Financial performance for the
       first four months of FY19;

       Operating Cash on Aug 31st, 2018 was $2,055.3K, which is up  $12.8K
       from last month’s ending balance (Jul 18) of $2,042.5K. Total Cash
       as of Aug 31st, 2018 is $3,448.1K ( includes the Pineapple and
       restricted Donation). The Aug 2018 ending Operating cash balance of
       $2,055.3K represents an Operating cash reserve of 13 months based on
       the FY19 conservative Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $158K/month.  The ASF actual reserve of 13 months at the end of Aug
       2018 is ahead of the budgeted 10.2 month reserve for YTD through Aug
       2018.  The ASF Operating reserve continues to be very healthy for an
       organization of the ASF’ s size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, the ASF, with regard to Income,  was
       ahead vs the FY19 budget but behind where we were at this time in
       FY18.  With regard to the Income vs Budget, YTD,  we are up $157.6K
       in total. Compared to FY18 the variance continues to be the timing of
       when Platinum Sponsor payments arrived in FY18 vs FY19.   We are
       however now ahead in donation income, due to the Handshake
       contribution, which has offset the timing variance of some
       sponsorship payments, as compared to the FY19 budget YTD.

       YTD expenses, through Aug 31st, 2018 are under budget by $295.6K,
       with all depts being under budget.  Infra as noted in the Board
       summary is $87K under budget due to Timing of hiring of staff and
       timing of Lease web invoices.  The other major timing issue is
       Conferences is under by $118.8K, which as we draw near the ACNA 2018
       it will resolve itself .  We have moved most of the dept
       underspending forward in the Cash forecast and will be reviewing the
       underspending with the departments as we move forward in FY19 Q2.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY 19 the ASF finished with a -
       <$.783> NI (or Breakeven YTD FY19) vs a budgeted negative <$453.9K>
       NI or $453.1K  ahead of Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the
       Fiscal year.  This was attributable to timing of Sponsor payments
       offset by more Donations than were budgeted as well as underspending
       in all depts YTD, vs the FY19 Budget.  At this point in the FY we are
       doing well, ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses.  We
       will continue to monitor this as we move further into FY19.

       Infrastructure
       =============

       Infrastructure team have posted their open position, please help
       amplify: https://s.apache.org/hiring2018

       There was an extended downtown of around 60 hours due to a hardware
       failure in our Jenkins master.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       A number of F2F sponsor meetings at ApacheCon are being coordinated by
       Sally, along with the on-boarding of two new Sponsor Ambassadors
       (Craig Russell and Ted Liu).

       Media and Analyst training will be available, for the 12th consecutive
       year, at ApacheCon. All are encouraged to participate in this
       excellent course.

       Otherwise, business as usual.

       Conferences
       ===========

       The 20th anniversary edition of ApacheCon is almost upon us. This is a
       "small one" by design (to keep the cadence going, and fill the gap
        between two producers). Current registrations stand at 300 and
        finances are healthy.

       Special thanks to:
        * Rich Bowen for coordinating
        * Ruth Suehle, for "everything" (Ruth is bridging the gap between
          producers)
        * Kevin McGrail, for fundraising
        * Sally Khudairi, for marketing assistance
        * Sharan Foga, for organizing the ASF booth presence
        * Trevor Grant, for being our on-site person for the booth
        * Daniel Gruno, for printing, design, and other logistics
        * Daniel Ruggeri, for booth assistance and other planning help
        * Chris Dutz, who is hosting and maintaining our event schedule
          system

       DC Road Show, 2018 is confirmed for Dec 4, 2018. See
       http://www.apachecon.com/usroadshow18/ CFP is open.

       Proposed events (status in full report):
        * JBCNConf, Barcelona, Spain
        * ApacheCOn EU, 2019, Berlin, Germany
        * Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019
        * ApacheCon North America 2019

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ===========================

       We have 10 (ten) TAC folks coming to ApacheCon - we ended up with 3
       Visa rejections and so had to cancel 3 flights. Coordination with
       planners around supporting roles for these people is underway.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       A common issue with communication comes up when contributors escalate
       concerns or issues across communities or mailing lists; all too often
       we spend additional volunteer cycles on tangents or how things are
       written, instead of focusing on the root issue and what works best for
       the ASF and our projects.

       I've drafted "How To Escalate Issues At The ASF" under
       board/escalation for discussion, as a specific guide for helping our
       communities better discuss hard issues across different groups at the
       ASF.  Feedback welcome before wider publication & linking.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising is going well and our monthly committee meetings continue.

Event sponsorship for 2018 has topped $192K and ApacheCon and the DC Roadshow
are both expected to be in the black.

As of this month’s financials, we are within $1K of being break even and
$453K ahead of budget.

As promised, the Targeted Sponsorship Policy is completed
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhZEcty2fSx7ZxiBs41j3qOUrqsA7TvKmQ13ZZ61lJY/edit

We have a Sponsor Lunch planned during ApacheCon in Montreal

Daniel Ruggeri is working with Infra to automate access to G Suite.

Minor note: Open Graph Protocol has been implemented for ApacheCon.com.  You
can see this if you post something on LinkedIn mentioning apachecon.com vs
apachecon.com/usroadshow18 vs http://apachecon.com/acna18/. Potentially
useful to look at the meta tags for this for other needs in the future.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Our job opening is now posted at https://s.apache.org/hiring2018

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Establish a new DNS hidden master, deprecating that function from
  our old minotaur.a.o server. This will also puppetize and trim the
  domains that our instructure supports. The bulk of our owned domains
  are handled by our domain provider.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Moving to Puppet 5, and to Ubuntu 18.04

General Activity
================
- Restored dSNMP monitoring, after our prior provider ended the
  service. The tool is a F/OSS script pulled from GitHub.
- Rebuilt our logging storage/query service on new machines more
  finely-tuned to the ElasticSearch installation. This expanded our
  storage capacity from a single month to over a half-dozen.
- Various Jenkins node work (Windows, disk space, etc)
- Streamline git integration/config with ASF mailing lists, jira

Uptime Statistics
=================
We had an extended downtime (about 60 hours) after the backplane for
our Jenkins Master machine blew up. We were able to bring up a new
machine, get the build data moved over, and turned the service back
on. We picked up more storage space on the master, in the process.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

## ApacheCon North America 2018, Montreal

Date: September 24-27, 2018
Location: Montreal, Canada
URL: https://apachecon.com/acna18

We are, at meeting time, five days away from ApacheCon North
America 2018, the 20th anniversay edition of ApacheCon. This is
going to be a small one, so it is well to remember that this was
by design, not by accident. We intended to do a small event to
keep the cadence going, and fill the gap between two producers.
Ruth Suehle has stepped up and helped us bridge that divide, and
we expect an great, if small, event.

As of now (when I'm writing the report) we have just crossed the
300 mark in registrations. The hotel is *completely* full. We
are still substantially in the black, even with some unexpected
last minute costs. Many thanks to everyone involved, especially:

 * Ruth Suehle, for everything
 * Kevin McGrail, for fundraising
 * Sally Khudairi, for marketing assistance
 * Sharan Foga, for organizing the ASF booth presence
 * Trevor Grant, for being our on-site person for the booth
 * Daniel Gruno, for printing, design, and other logistics
 * Daniel Ruggeri, for booth assistance and other planning help
 * Chris Dutz, who is hosting and maintaining our event schedule
   system
 * All of our sponsors and speakers

Yes, I'm certain I'm forgetting lots of people.

Details about the event are at https://apachecon.com/acna18

## DC Road Show, 2018  

Date: December 4, 2018
Location: Washington, DC, USA
URL: http://www.apachecon.com/usroadshow18/
Event lead: Kevin McGrail

The CFP for the DC Road has been opened, and notifications have been
sent out to our user and developer communities. Since it's a small
event, we anticipate a lot more submissions than spaces for that
content.

Planning discussions are ongoing, on the planners@apachecon.com
mailing list.

We are looking for speakers, and for a content committee. Please
subscribe to planners@apachecon.com if you are interested in
participate in the planning of this event.

## JBCNConf, 2019

Date: TBD
Location: Barcelona, Spain
URL: https://www.jbcnconf.com/
Event lead: Ignasi Barrera

JBCNConf is a Java event that is always heavy on Apache content. They
have proposed that we, the ASF, manage the content for a track or two,
and produce a co-branded event. Details are still sparse, but they're
looking at budget considerations and trying to find a date and venue.

This conversation will be brought back to the planners list soon,
since there are broader considerations that various people - notably
Sally and Kevin - have expressed concerns about.

## ApacheCon EU, 2019

Date: TBD
Location: Berlin, Germany
URL: https://apachecon.com/
Event lead: Rich/TBD

We have tentatively agreed to have NewThinking produce ApacheCon EU
2019 in Berlin. There are, however, no details yet. (NT are the folks
that produced the Berlin roadshow this year, in conjunction with
FOSSBackstage.)

If there's someone who lives in Berlin (or, at least, in Germany) who
wishes to step up to be event lead, I will gladly delegate this event.
Failing that, I (Rich) will be the event leadon this.

I hope that meetings with NT begin soon, but I have been completely
focused on ACNA18, and haven't really given it much thought yet.

## Apache Roadshow Chicago, 2019

Date: TBD
Location: Chicago, USA
URL: https://apachecon.com
Event lead: Trevor Grant

Trevor has sent a proposal for a roadshow in Chicago in 2019. He's
received a little pushback because what is proposed was a multi-track,
3 day event that looks much more like ApacheCon, and we are very
reluctant to have an event that directly competes with ApacheCon,
particularly in our 20th anniversary year. Details are still being
discussed, but it's very much taking a backseat to other more urgent
events.

## ApacheCon North America 2019

Date: TBD (September 2019?)
Location: TBD
URL: https://apachecon.com
Event lead: Rich Bowen

We are still looking for a venue for ACNA19, having determined that
the proposed venues were too small. We hope that our 20th anniversary
event is something that we can promote all year long and get a larger
than usual attendance turnout. Thus, we are looking at several cities
that are *not* in California. 

We hope to announce ACNA19 at ACNA18, and are actively working towards
that goal, but it's looking iffy.

## Other Events

We still have silence regarding a Seoul event, but we haven't
attempted to rekindle that conversation since last month's meeting. If
there's someone interested in stepping up to drive this, please
contact Rich, or the planners list.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

This report comes the week leading up to ApacheCon NA Montréal. Needless to
say, it is getting busy behind the scenes. All flight tickets are confirmed,
Hotel rooms sorted, Conference passes done.

We have 10 (ten) TAC folks coming - we ended up with 3 Visa rejections and so
had to cancel 3 flights (some sort or refund may be due in a few weeks.)

Note that confirmed flight reservation numbers are required as part of Visa
applications. We do not usually get this many Visa rejections, the norm is
either 0 or maybe 1. A routine inquiry with the travel agent proves once again
that is it still not worth us getting cancellation insurance for each ticket
as that far outweighs any loss incurred.

We are in communication with the planners folks to liaise what roles during
the week that TAC folks can assist with.

We look forward to another successful event!

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

Aug 2018 Report for VP Finance.  As was the case in July there was not
much activity, though the Document from the AAFCPA's Wealth Management
firm arrived and I will be sharing it with the Board on the Board list
before the Board meeting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

We're moving ahead with the plan proposed last month:
  1. Create an Assistant VP, Legal position and nominate Henri
  Yandell
   to this position.

  2. Appoint Roman Shaposhnik to a position of Vice President, Legal
  Affairs

Both resolutions have been submitted as separate items for the board
consideration. Huge kudos go to Chris for ensuring smooth transition
and making himself available until the end of 2018.

We see usual amount (roughly a couple per week) of Q&A happening
on the legal mailing list and LEGAL jira. All of these are being
handled with great support from Hen Yandell and others on the Legal
discuss list.

Chris is still working with VP, Infra and the office of Data Privacy
to draft a data privacy plan and set of updates to the ASF mailing
list archival removal policy owned by the infra team.

The only big in-bound item requiring us to formulate an externally
visible response this month is a request from a European Commission
in a Case M.8994 "MICROSOFT / GITHUB" This is being handled in a
timely manner but may require involvement of our legal counsel.

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

Current clean-up focus is on issues that are more than 90 days old
where no CVE name is yet assigned (therefore still in "investigation"
state).  There are currently 10 of these across 8 projects.

Stats for August 2018:

      13	[license confusion]
      24        [support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 37 (last months: 32, 39, 55)

      3	       [couchdb], [httpd], [spamassassin]
      2	       [commons], [nifi], [struts], [tomcat], [trafficserver]

      1	       [accumulo], [activemq], [allura], [fineract], [hive],
               [karaf], [netbeans], [ofbiz], [openoffice], [qpid],
               [ranger], [shiro], [spark], [storm], [subversion], 
               [thrift], [zookeeper], [site]

     In total, as of 1st September, we're tracking 89 (last month: 95)
     open issues across 42 projects, median age 113 (last month: 112)
     days.  56 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     8 (last month: 9) of these issues, across 7 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  We continue to work with these projects to get
     these closed out.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis2 Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

- Axis2 Java 1.7.8 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Axis2 Java 1.8 (development)

- Axis2 C 1.7 (development)

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained. We continue to receive patches from new users.

The vast majority of recent mailing list traffic comes in two forms: security
issues found by researchers and users static analysis tools such as Veracode,
and migration issues from old releases that are long unsupported.

Going forward the web service trends in the industry are REST, JSON and
annotation driven development via JSR 181 POJO Web Services - all things Axis2
has excellent support for however the docs are lacking to tie it all together.
Our day jobs have already moved in this direction, and recently we have seen
users figuring out that since they are already using Axis2 for SOAP they can
also use it for REST and JSON. We see an opportunity to grow our community via
better docs in this area. A Spring Boot starter kit is planned for the next
quarter, the idea being one maven dep instead of literally 25 separate Jars
and also code based auto configuration of the most common use cases.

Axis2 C added a new committer this past December 2017, and so far that is
helping the project pick up speed. There was more progress via commits and
Jira issues this past quarter.  Indications are that an Axis 2 C 1.7 release
could happen by the end of the year.

There are indications via various user list threads and Jira issues that an
Axis2 Java 1.7.9 release is likely to happen this upcoming quarter.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.
## Releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.8 was released on May 19, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Davor Bonaci]

## Description:

Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:

The Board is presented with a Special Order 7B to appoint Kenneth Knowles
(kenn) to the office of Vice President, Apache Beam. Kenneth has served on the
 PMC since its inception, and is very active and effective in growing the
 community. His exemplary posts have been cited in other projects.

## Activity:

Apache Beam is now approaching its second anniversary as a top-level project.
Major technical efforts going on include:
  - Finishing the portable Flink runner, which adds support for Python and Go
    SDKs.
  - Adding Schema support.
  - Beam SQL.
  - Infrastructure and automation.

Recent community decisions include:
  - Providing designated "Long Term Support" releases.
  - Better management of outdated dependencies.
  - Using JIRA to track and highlight non-code contributions.

Several blog posts have been published this quarter, primarily promoting the
releases. Google is organizing a Beam Summit in London next month, expecting
modest attendance. Additionally, Beam was featured at several conferences,
including Flink Forward 2018 in Berlin.

Going forward, the main focus should be on the community growth, particularly
on the user side using non-proprietary engines. This goes hand-in hand with
the next major technical milestone of delivering on the portability framework,
making Beam available to Python and Go communities.

## Health report:

The user community grew modestly, as evidenced by the increased mailing list
activity, which is encouraging.

Activity on the development mailing list decreased, but there were quite a few
new contributors joining, improving the diversity. Lifetime unique code
contributors grew to 322, with 53 new first-time contributors.

## PMC changes:

Currently 19 PMC members. No new PMC members have been added since the last
report. The last PMC addition was Thomas Weise on Fri Jun 08 2018.

Frances Perry requested to resign from the PMC, though that resignation has
been put on hold pending discussions around establishing an emeritus policy
instead, taking into account recent Board discussions and recommendations to
other projects.

## Committer base changes:

Currently 42 committers. Five new committers have been added since the last
report. New committers:
  - Scott Wegner was added as a committer on Thu Jun 21 2018.
  - Łukasz Gajowy was added as a committer on Wed Jun 27 2018.
  - Anton Kedin was added as a committer on Wed Aug 01 2018.
  - Andrew Pilloud was added as a committer on Wed Aug 01 2018.
  - Tim Robertson was added as a committer on Thu Aug 23 2018.

The PMC recognizes two areas for improvement: (1) diversity of affiliations
among active committers, and (2) an imbalance of contributors to active
committers. The main cause of these recent imbalances is turnover over the
last year, perhaps among some others. The plan of inviting quite a few new
committers over a period of time has materialized. We continue to be cautious
not to grow too quickly to jeopardize the community, or negatively affect
where the project business is handled.

## Releases:

Since the last report, Apache Beam has published two releases, with one more
currently in progress:
  - 2.5.0 was released on Thu Jun 21 2018.
  - 2.6.0 was released on Tue Aug 07 2018.
  - 2.7.0 is currently under preparation.

Going forward, we expect to publish a release every 6 weeks, a target that we
have become better at achieving.

## Mailing list activity:

Mailing list subscriptions and activity continues to increase modestly. The
activity on the development mailing list is down compared to the previous
quarter, likely due to seasonal effects of summer vacations. The activity on
the user mailing list has increased to a new high, which is very encouraging.

- dev@beam.apache.org
  - 547 subscribers (up 27 in the last 3 months).
  - 1757 emails sent to list (2000 in previous quarter).

- user@beam.apache.org
  - 574 subscribers (up 25 in the last 3 months).
  - 525 emails sent to list (353 in previous quarter).

## JIRA activity:

For the third quarter in a row, the JIRA activity is increasing, turning over
the earlier trend.

- 811 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (705 in the previous quarter).
- 501 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months (368 in the previous
  quarter).

Attachment K: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matthew Jason Benson]

## Apache BVal Report September 2018 ##

 - The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
   specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
   the foundation on February 15, 2012.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Apache BVal community members working in Apache Commons have recently
   succeeded in pushing the 2.0 release of the Apache Commons Weaver component
   upon which we depend.
 - Our immediate plans are to push the release of the Apache licensed bean
   validation 2.0 specification artifact through the Apache Geronimo project and
   then to release Apache BVal 2.0.
 - The security issue mentioned last quarter is incurred at the specification
   level and has been deemed low priority by the bean validation community as a
   whole, any vulnerability requiring deliberate and naive custom code on the
   part of the application developer. The Apache BVal community continue to
   ponder what actions we might take to reduce the likelihood of such naive
   exposures.

## Health report:

 - We retain a small core of developers with the desire to keep this project
   afloat.

## PMC changes: 

 - Currently 13 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Romain Manni-Bucau on Mon Nov 18 2013 

## Committer base changes:

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description:
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
   JavaScript.

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
We had four platform releases this quarter. The releases were mainly bug fixes
and also fixes related to `npm audit` issues. `npm audit` checks the
dependency tree for your code and provides a security vulnerability report.

We had tool releases for cordova-common, cordova-js, and cordova-coho. The
releases relate to bug fixes and fixes related to `npm audit` issues. We also
upgraded support to `node-6` and greater, with our dropping of `node-4`
support.

We had our first committers meeting (over video call) of 2018 with all the new
committers to discuss project direction. Our last meeting face to face was in
Oct 2016 in Redmond, WA.

We shut down creation of new issues in Apache JIRA, and enabled `Github
Issues` in all 71 repositories that we have in Apache's Github org. We decided
not to migrate any existing open issues in JIRA to Github -- we will
investigate and triage those issues in JIRA and migrate issues on a case by
case basis. We established an org-level Github Project Board for us to have a
bird's eye view of all Cordova issues in all our numerous repos, for planning
purposes.

## Health report:
Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green -
failures are usually due to external service issues that do device testing.
Our nightly builds have been stable with occasional packaging failures.

We are actively trying to resolve all existing issues in JIRA while also
maintaining all the new issues in Github.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The Flink community has released the 1.6 release, with enhancements
    to Streaming SQL, connectors, container-based deployment, and more.

  - The investment in more automated release testing seems to pay off. The
    community is releasing bugfix releases faster and more frequently.

  - The Flink Forward Berlin conference took place earlier in September April
    bringing together many community members. Talks were a mix of use cases,
    tech deep dive, ecosystem, and (for the first time) stream processing
    research topics.

  - Two more Flink Forward conferences have been announced: In Beijing on
    December 20-21, 2018, and in San Francisco on April 1-2, 2019.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

No changes compared to the last quarter.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The Tomcat and Forrest communities are still using Gump actively.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Incubator PMC report for September 2018

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 52 podlings incubating. During the month of August,
podlings executed 8 distinct releases and there are several ongoing votes 
on releases for September. Some long standing release votes were resolved.  
We added three new IPMC members.

Several podlings are heading towards graduation. We had one project, 
Gossip, retire to the attic. BatchEE seems stuck in performing the last 
graduation steps and needs some nudging over the line.

There were no IP clearances.

A number of podlings (3) that didn't report has decreased and Pony Mail has 
finally reported. Senssoft has some issues that stoped it from reporting 
but they are currently being addressed. Milagro has missed several reports
in a row and has failed to respond to queries to why this has occurred.
Gearpump have indicated they are discussing retiring.

Discussion continues about with to do about missing mentors and some 
actions should be taken in the next month including contacting mentors and 
asking if  they still want to continue in the role. This may result in a 
number of mentors needing to be replaced, and currently it is not known what 
mentor capacity the IPMC has. We've had a number of members join the IPMC 
to mentor projects this month which is encouraging. Given the low levels of 
activity on some projects (as indicated by sign off rates and a sampling 
of email list activity) this is a serious issue for the IPMC.

There's also been discussion on some podlings spending too long in 
incubation and hopefully that will lead to a few more graduations and 
retirements in the near future.

Changes have been suggested to the podling report and incubator proposal 
template that should help in small ways with the above situations.

A podling, Superset, has been making releases not in line with the Apache 
release policy. I've asked the podling to correct this and it's mentors are 
helping out with this and other issues. The podling has been almost 2 years 
in incubation and has made a large number of "unofficial" releases (50+).

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.Once we make a release with the licensing fix we will move forward
  with graduation.
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of? None

How has the community developed since the last report?
  1. Since our last podling report 1 month ago (i.e. between August 5 & 
  September 4, inclusive), we grew our contributors from 512 to 548 (36 new 
  contributors)
  2. Since our last podling report 1 month ago (i.e. between August 5 & 
  September 4, inclusive), we resolved 129 pull requests (currently at 2963 
  closed PRs)
  3. Since being accepted into the incubator, the number of companies 
  officially
  using Apache Airflow has risen from 30 to 193, 10 new from the last 
  podling report 1 month ago.

How has the project developed since the last report?
  See above : 129 PRs resolved, 36 new contributors, & 10 new companies  
  officially using it. We also released 1.10.0, our 4th Apache Release while 
  in the incubator as seen on https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/  #history

     Comments: The project is healthy and making good progress. As noted, 
     community building is the main challenge now. The technology is
     in good shape, so I believe people will start adopting.
     I am very pleased that they have created a twitter account; it should
     allow them to build community daily.

     Comments: The first release will be an important milestone. (During
       incubation the project has made non-ASF releases, with permission.)
       All other aspects of the project are functioning well; the project
       has built a vibrant community and lets the community drive its
       decision-making. I think it is not far from graduating.

               I do remain concerned at the volume of github notifications
               and the difficulty in following them. I plan to chat with the
               infrastructure folks at ApacheCon NA to see if there are any

               in this area.

Myriad

Description:

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos
together on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations
across both Hadoop and other applications running on the same physical
data center infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  * Grow the community and enroll new committers. 
  * Have (more) frequent Release cycles to be compliant with the Apache Way.
  * Creating roadmaps for releases with goals (new features).

Any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?:

  This Poddlig is one of the listed at IPMC list thread
  “Poddlings length of time in the incubator”. This Poddling was stalled
  for about two years, however the current new PPMCs have the hope of
  increasing the community unlocking the main issue we are facing. We
  have had low dev-mailing list activity the pass months, nevertheless
  we are working for unlocking our main issue.

How has the community developed since the last report:

  General low activity since June.

How has the project developed since the last report:

  No visible activity.

How does the podling rate their own maturity:

  [ ] Initial setup
  [X] Working towards next release
  [X] Community building
  [ ] Nearing graduation
  [x] Other: Working for outcoming our main blocker issue.

Date of last release:

  The 0.2.0 release was issued on Jun 29, 2016.

  ted: Myriad is in the process of deciding whether to reboot as Apache or
  to go independent. This is on the knife edge and I personally don't know
  the right answer.

PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to help make the 
web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce latency and bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create a first release
  2. The project needs more active developers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The last report being missed was my bad (oschaaf), I was on vacation
  and forgot to ask someone else to do it.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Again, there have been very limited external contributions, two 
  contributions to the core code-base.
  We do see certain users committing to helping out others on the google 
  group and github, some of them consistently for months now. 
  In terms of user engagement activity continues to be healthy.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Problems with Travis timeouts have been mostly fixed
  - Flaking dependencies hosted on sourcefourge have been fixed
  - Work is still in progress for a particularly nasty bug, which 
    would be great to have fixed in a first release.
  - An external contributor has been maintaining a docker image 
    for ngx_pagespeed, which should be proposed for inclusion into 
    the ASF repo soon

     based on Alan's feedback. Once a new committer is added to the project
     (which will happen soon), then we can update to "Nearing graduation".

OpenWhisk  

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able to 
execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) from 
external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional logic 
(Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST API-based 
Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support packaging and 
catalog services.  Additionally, it now provides options to host the platform 
components as Docker containers on various Container Frameworks such as Mesos, 
Kubernetes, and Compose.
 
OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.
   Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:    
   1. Finish the remaining component source code release under Incubator
      a. Release process/automation/documtantion are here 
      https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-release). 
   2. Increase additional company and individual Contributors to maintain all 
   project repos. and address Issue / PR backlog.
   3. Close legal transferred of Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and 
   logo to ASF

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of? 
   

    * Issue backlog building on incubator-openwhisk is still a major issue 
  (partly due to #2 above). As of this report, the "open" issue backlog is 384 
  (up from 365 as of last report), but open PR is at 35 (down from 55 as of last 
  report). Please note this is just on the "main" platform repo. and likely is 
  paralleled in other release component repos.
        * Need to prioritize and work to reduce while advancing major proposals 
  around restructuring around abstractions to accommodate running on Knative 
  while enhancing support for better logging/scheduling and performance testing 
  enhancements.
        * Trying to add more active Committers to augment those who have 
  dropped off in their activity; however, we have reached an impasse where 
  potential new Contributor pull requests are not getting timely reviews/merges 
  to provide a resume' for adding to the Committer roles.
    * It seems that Apache Infra. will not provide us servers to host a staging 
  environment that would help us perform needed staging testing on Pull Requests. 
  This means that independent testing needs to be done by members (companies). 
  We have explored a corporate donation as suggested (ala Spark and SystemML), 
  but this does not seem possible at this time. 
        * No change in status since last quarterly report.
    * Formal hand-off of OpenWhisk trademark/logo from IBM needs to be 
  executed; need to identify process for this. See #3 above.
        * Discussion started w/ Apache legal via "legal-discuss" mailing list 
  with subject "Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and logo".
        * IBM intends to hand-off ownership of trademarks at time of graduation.

How has the community developed since the last report?    

    * dev mailing list activity increased since Q2 driven by release-related 
  activity and an increase in technical discussion on the mailing list.
    * incubator-openwhisk Github stars: 3472 (+254 since last report)
    * incubator-openwhisk GitHub forks: 652 (+36 since last report). Note lots 
  of more competing projects entering the Serverless space.
    * Slack community:
        * 969 members (+151 from last report).  Very active in most channels 
  from both end users or the project and contributors
        * To-date: 112,326 messages sent across all channels
        * Analytics: https://openwhisk-team.slack.com/admin/stats
    * The  bi-weekly Zoom "Technical Interchange" continues to be well received

            How has the project developed since the last report?
     Emphasis on these areas have been featured since last report:
        * Google Knative announce
            * The announcement of Knative has elicited LOTS of discussion on 
            dev list and during interchange calls, as well as proposals on the Wiki, as to 
            how OpenWhisk can better align/position itself relative to this Kubernetes 
            (family) technology.  See some of the proposal discussions:
                * Knative, Kubernetes, and Apache OpenWhisk
                * Prototyping for a future architecture
                * Proposal on a future architecture of OpenWhisk
                * Kafka and Proposal on a future architecture of OpenWhisk
                * Simplifying configuring OpenWhisk Components (#3984)
        * Naver has asked to be listed as both a project Supporter and an 
        acknowledged OpenWhisk provider

Pony Mail

Pony Mail is a mail-archiving, archive viewing, and interaction service, 
that
can be integrated with many email platforms.

Pony Mail has been incubating since 2016-05-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Growing community and interest around the project
  2. Step up pace of branch development
  3. Fine-tune release process

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Pony Mail is in a bit of a slumber at the moment, with the principal
  people being busy elsewhere. This is not to say that oversight isn't
  happening, but that the development pace has slowed significantly.
  We hope this picks up in the foreseeable future.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Sharan Foga has joined as a new mentor. We are assessing whether there
  is need for more people to help out.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Not much to report here, a few bug fixes and issues filed.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

Pulsar

Pulsar is a highly scalable, low latency messaging platform running on
commodity hardware. It provides simple pub-sub semantics over topics,
guaranteed at-least-once delivery of messages, automatic cursor management
for subscribers, and cross-datacenter replication.

Pulsar has been incubating since 2017-06-01.

Most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  None

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Earlier in June there have been few discussions on the private list
  regarding communications regarding Pulsar that were not coming from
  PPMC or that were not respecting the ASF policies.  Clarifications
  followed between PPMC members, mentors and interested parties to
  ensure the mistakes were made in good faith and, in particular, to
  make sure everyone was fully has full understanding of ASF
  policies. There was no other branding related issue after the first
  occurrence.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community added 8 new contributors that submitted pull-requests
  which were merged into master.

  The number of users approaching the team on the Slack channel has
  kept steadily increasing since the last report. Many users have
  actively deployed. Pulsar for evaluation and production use cases.

  Different meetups were organized by project members and hosted by
  Yahoo in Sunnyvale and Yahoo Japan in Tokyo. We have presented
  Pulsar's introductions, updates on the state of the projects,
  deep-dives and hands-on tutorial, including recorded podcasts.

  One talk on Pulsar was presented at one at OSCon in July and there
  are several scheduled talks: 2 at ApacheCon in September, and 2
  others at Strata New York in September.

  Since the last report the number of weekly-active-users on the Slack
  channel has increased from 53 to 88.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  28 authors have pushed 494 commits to master in the last 3 months.

  The project has made the its seventh release since joining the
  Apache Incubator (2.1.0-incubating on Aug 2nd).

  This release introduced these new features:

   * Pulsar IO: A connector framework for moving data in and out of
     Apache Pulsar leveraging Pulsar Functions runtime.
   * A number of builtin connectors: (Aerospike, Cassandra, Kafka,
     Kinesis, RabbitMQ, Twitter)
   * Tiered Storage: An extension in Pulsar segment store to offload
     older segments into long term storage (e.g. HDFS, S3). S3 support
     is supported in 2.1 release.
   * Stateful function: Pulsar Functions is able to use State API for
     storing state within Pulsar.
   * Pulsar Go Client
   * Avro and Protobuf Schema support

  Community is actively working on a bug-fix release
  (2.1.1-incubating) and on the next milestone, 2.2 release for which
  the biggest feature will be support for SQL within Pulsar.

  Since June, 5 new PIPs (Pulsar Improvement Proposals) for
  major feature/changes, have been submitted to the wiki and
  discussed in the mailing list.

    PIP 23: Message Tracing By Interceptors
    PIP 22: Pulsar Dead Letter Topic
    PIP 21: Pulsar Edge Component
    PIP 20: Mechanism to revoke TLS authentication
    PIP 19: Pulsar SQL

SensSoft

SensSoft is a software tool usability testing platform

SensSoft has been incubating since 2016-07-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Extending release process to other parts of the SensSoft software stack.
  2. Grow the Apache SensSoft (Incubating) Committer/Community Base.
  3. Complete the issues highlighted at the SensSoft Roadmap 
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SENSSOFT/Roadmaps 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Yes. In the last Quarter, a number of core Apache SensSoft committers 
  changed organization. While the Apache SensSoft team will use this as an 
  opportunity to organically grow the committer/community based, these 
  departures have caused branding concerns for the organization that 
  initiated the Apache SensSoft software gift to Apache—The Charles Stark 
  Draper Laboratory, Inc. (Draper). Specifically, in referencing an 
  affiliation with the ‘Apache SensSoft’ project at different organizations, 
  an Apache SensSoft committer received the following request from Draper:   
  “We flagged your signature for review by Draper legal since SENSOFTtm and 
  Software as a Sensor (R) are Draper-owned trademarks. As you know, the main 
  purpose of trademarks is to avoid customer confusion. We believe that the 
  use of SENSOFT or SOFTWARE AS A SENSOR in [another company’s] employee 
  signature block may lead to confusion as to the source and owner of the 
  SENSOFT product. While we appreciate your acknowledgement that Draper owns 
  SOFTWARE AS A SENSOR and SENSOFT technology, and the good will behind your 
  intentions to promote technology you worked on while at Draper, in order to 
  preserve the Draper trademarks we respectfully request that you either:  
  -Remove any reference of SENSOFT or SOFTWARE AS A SENSOR from your BAE 
  signature block;  OR  -Indicate in the signature directly following SENSOFT 
  the following: “SENSOFTtm and SOFTWARE AS A SENSOR are trademarks owned by 
  the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.”  NOTE: SENSOFT refers to 
  SENSSOFT (SENSOFT is a misspelling)  The committer in question has 
  corresponded Draper and raised the issue that ‘Apache SensSoft’ refers to a 
  public open source project, where ‘Software as a Sensor’ and ‘SENSSOFT’ 
  refer to Draper proprietary technology, as well as citing the terms of the 
  Software Gift. Draper is steadfast in asserting rights now that committers 
  formerly at Draper are now at other employers.  While this affects the 
  Apache SensSoft community’s ability to grow through outreach and publicity, 
  we do not believe we require Legal assistance from the ASF. Rather, in 
  discussion with both Draper and Apache SensSoft PPMC/Champions, the path of 
  least resistance appears to be to change the Apache SensSoft project name. 
  The PPMC will initiate a vote on @dev for changing the name. If it passes, 
  a subsequent vote will determine the projects new name. In the meantime, 
  committers will begin removing references to Software as a Sensor(tm) from 
  project documentation. 

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Several community members have started new employment opening opportunities 
  for community growth in the last quarter. No new community members have 
  come onboard.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Development continues at a sustainable level. Several major improvements 
  have been made to make the Apache SensSoft stack deployable at various 
  levels of scale, including major improvements to documentation and 
  examples, and testing procedures. Project maturity roadmaps (Wiki) and 
  version release plans (JIRA) continue to be maintained.

  frequency of commits).
  2. Make it easier for Devs to create plug-ins for ingest of data.
  3. Developing a workflow in Spot that allows intuitive analytics without 
  the need of licensed software.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware

  N/A

Have your mentors been helpful and responsive or are things falling through 
the cracks?

  Due to the community’s irregular activity level over the past months we 
  have had trouble aligning with our mentors. 
  The project is in the process of establishing a cadence to our activities 
  and we welcome help and advice from mentors.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Project wide meetings are continuing every 2 weeks. We are starting to see 
  more Pull Requests come in. Hoping that the end of summer (end of 
  vacations) will bring further participation from the community. We are 
  working on updating the Spot website and confluence pages to reflect 
  changes in the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A roadmap draft has been constructed. Our next focus is creating a new 
  release. Therefore, work is underway on closing some long running Pull 
  Requests and important bug fixes.

Superset

Superset is an enterprise-ready web application for data exploration, data
visualization and dashboarding.

Superset has been incubating since 2017-05-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. Plan and execute our first Apache release
  2. Align on a long-term product roadmap with the broader Apache Superset 
  community
  3. Grow the community and enroll new committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware 
of?
  * At this point in time, we’re having issues on how to come up with the 
  LICENSE file needed for our first Apache release given the number of 
  dependencies we have on the Javascript side.  Since we package the JS 
  bundle along with our Python application, it seems like we'll have to
  come up with either a programmatic way to extract the LICENSE info, or ship 
  the application without the JS deps, and provide instruction has to how to 
  fetch and build the package deps, which isn't very convenient. We also have 
  some minor deps on GPL lib, one of which we need to get clarity as to how   
  to to handle them. It's related to the "chardet" sub dependency of the Pypi 
  requests library. 

  Currently, we believe there are 2 approaches to dealing with the LICENSE 
  and NOTICE files for Superset.  Either:
  A) Dynamically building these files by querying npm/pypi (the javascript 
  and python package repositories) for all the metadata and assembling these 
  files. See the list of JS packages organized by licenses here:
  Https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/5801
  B) The other approach is to distributed a stripped down version of Superset 
  that has a script that fetches external deps and builds it.

  The committers are activating around these issues and thinking creatively 
  about resolving them. A thread on dev@superset.incubator.apache.org was 
  started and a discussion is taking place.

How has the community developed since the last report?
  * Organic growth of our Github contributors (246->274), forks (3318->3627), 
  watchers
  (1020->1077) and stars (19,399->20,519)
  * Group of active committers meeting bi-weekly from Airbnb, Lyft and 
  Twitter.  Added Michelle Thomas as a new committer.

How has the project developed since the last report?
  * A completely redesigned dashboarding experience launched
  * Big Number charts have a new look and visualization
  * In the Table Config & SQL Lab -> Explore View, clicking a data source now 
  opens a modal with table editing for settings, columns, calculated columns, 
  & metrics
  * Addition of integration and functional tests
  * A healthy, constant flow of bug fixes, quality improvements and new
  features, take a look at the project’s Pulse on Github for more details

Taverna has been incubating since 2014-10-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Re-engage PPMC members
  2. Graduate?
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  INFRA-16698 is pending comments from Daniel Gruno / IPMC on how
  to manage incubator repositories on git-wip-us.apache.org that have
  been retired (in our case transferred to another GitHub organizations).
  The suggestion is to do a "git rm" and leave a README on the head commit
  pointing to the new location.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  2 Google Summer of Code students have been active over the summer with
  strong guidance from mentors and getting pull requests merged.

  However the rest of the community has been very quiet and not
  commented much on the GSOC progress or pull requests.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Good progress from GSOC students, which code bases are now
  due a new release to include their changes.

  Two legacy git repositories were retired to not go through
  graduation (INFRA-16698).

  There is not much outstanding towards graduation, except
  re-engaging the PMC members.

  We will have to admit we are a slow project, which is
  OK (many Apache projects are), yet still there seems
  to be some kind of incubator fatigue - for
  instance no-one else picked up the job of doing this
  report although prompted to do so by a mentor.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

     The PPMC needs to work on a graduation plan. Graduation should
     not be a major task for Taverna but it does need doing.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Dave Fisher: This podling thinks they are near graduation, but has never 
  added any new committers/PPMC members. Not so sure. I sent a message to the 
  podling about this.
  Alan Gates:  This is my fault.  See email thread

  41fdc5e96857b13f5@%3Cdev.tephra.apache.org%3E where I started pushing them 
  towards determining their future direction.  I assumed they had added 
  additional PPMC members without checking.  I can take this feedback back to 
  them and help them work through this.
  James Taylor: I've updated the community assessment to "Community building"
  based on the above feedback.

Warble

Warble has been incubating since 2018-06-11

Warble is a distributed endpoint monitoring solution where the agent is 
hosted
on your own hardware.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation.
  1. Engage initial committers.
  2. Set core design and feature set, avoid creep of new features before 
  the core is complete.
  3. Expand committers and community 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware 
of:
  none

How has the community developed since the last report?
  This is the first report since entering the Incubator. Community 
  involvement has slowly increased.

How has the project developed since the last report?
  This is the first report since entering the Incubator. Code has been 
  donated and work has been done on initial designs and documentation.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
  We're working through initial design as most of the donated code will need
  to be re-written/adapted to what we want to do with Warble. Community 
  input has been good working towards documentation and initial code updates.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

Report from the Apache Jackrabbit committee [Michael Dürig]

## Description:
 The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
 implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
 (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content repository is
  stable, largely feature complete and actively being maintained. Jackrabbit
  Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
  repository as a modern successor to the Apache Jackrabbit content
  repository. It is targeted for use as the foundation of modern world-class
  web sites and other demanding content applications. In contrast to its
  predecessor, Oak does not implement all optional features from the JSR
  specifications and it is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All maintenance
 branches and the unstable development branch are continuously seeing moderate
 to high activity.

 Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of the work
 going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly driven by
 dependencies from Oak.

 The direct binary access feature finally landed in trunk this quarter. This
 is a major new feature that required effort and coordination from many
 different domain experts in our comitter base.

 There is an ongoing effort to understand and be prepared for the impact of
 the changes in the release model of Java. This includes evaluating whether we
 can support newer Java versions on some of our branches.

 We expect to further improve modularisation of our code base to enable
 independent releases for non core moduls. Discussions and prototyping is
 expected to happen in the next couple of months.

## Health report:
 The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all mailing
 lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. There is a wide
 range of topics being discussed on the various Jira issues.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Adrien Grand]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Activity:
The upcoming Lucene 7.5 will include:
 - Support for indexing and searching geo-shapes as 6D points which represent
   tessellated triangles rather than terms in an inverted index. We expect
   this new approach to perform better. [1]
 - Better reclamation of deletes through merges. We previously allowed indices
   to contain about 50% deleted documents, and potentially much more on
   indices that have been force-merged. Forced merges do not create huge
   segments anymore[2] and deletes are now more aggressively reclaimed[3],
   allowing up to about 33% deleted documents per index.

 The upcoming Solr 7.5 will include:
 - Support for co-locating replicas of multiple collections on the same
   nodes.[4]
 - Inclusion of the new "Nori" korean analyzer in the default distribution.
   [5]
 - More stream evaluators, in particular around outlier detection. [6]

 - There is an ongoing discussion to release Lucene/Solr 8.0 later this year.
   [7]
 - Both user and dev mailing-lists are very active.
 - Discussions are generally flowing in a good shape.
 - We produced 2 releases since the last report.
 - We are updating our release process to conform with Apache requirements.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    In this period of reporting, No much of tickets has been created and
    resolved, basically, we add test cases for the feature of reference
    breaking and bugfix, also we are trying to upgrade the dependent
    artifacts to support latest JDK version. From JDK9, there are many gaps
    need to be identified and filled up, we are trying to make all dependent
    artifacts to be compatible with JDK9 and then resolving the compatibility
    issues for Mnemonic itself.
    With the support of our community contributors, we have added new
    operators to Chunkbuffer for the convenience of adoption and integration
    with other projects.
    Recently, a new The Mnemonic version has been released, we are starting
    to work on v0.13 that might be released before next report.

Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - no new PMC member added since Jun. 2018.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 13 committers.
 - No new committer added since Jun. 2018.

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.12.0 on Sep. 04 2018
 - Still active development on next major version (0.13)

JIRA Activity:
 - 3 JIRA tickets created since the last report (Jun. 2018)
 - Also 5 JIRA tickets closed/resolved this period

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

## Description:
Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- Vulnerability reports: the security team has received a few reports and it
  is communicating with the reporters to confirm and properly address them
- The stabilization of the new release branch, 17.12, is proceeding well but
  we still don't have scheduled a date for the first release; we will publish
  soon a new bug fix release for the 16.11 branch
- The documentation initiative: We are trying to re-start the documentation
  effort and although progress has been slow during the annual holiday period
  we hope to see a lot more focus on this in the coming months
- Various bug fixes and enhancements have been contributed and committed to
  the trunk: a summary  of the main changes is available as usual in the
  project's blog [1]
- More details about the community activities are published in the official
  blog [1], on Twitter [2] and other social media [3]; our public HipChat room
  [4] has seen low activity as in the previous quarter
- Trademarks: there are a few domains in our backlog for which we have to take
  some corrective actions [5]; they do not represent very concerning
  violations but the PMC needs to take some action soon since they are in the
  backlog since a long time; one month ago the Trademark team asked for an
  update about one of them and we still have to provide a response; we will
  follow up with them as soon as we have an update
- We did some housekeeping (renaming of hash files and removal of deprecated
  hashes) in the project's release archive to make it fully compliant with the
  latest ASF release policies [6]

## Health report:
We have invited three new committers; as usual the PMC is monitoring and
discussing new candidates for the PMC and the committers' groups; the
community is actively involved in improving the trunk, stabilizing the release
branches and in various discussions and support requests posted mostly in the
mailing list and in Jira.

    Avro RPC for communications. This will be released within the coming
    month.
 -  We are also working on supporting OODT to be built under JDK 10.

## Health report:
 - Project activity has been quiet except for the 3 1.2.x releases.
 - Due to Apache DRAT GSoC project, OODT could identify bottlenecks of using
   XML RPC and could expedite the Avro RPC migration. As a result, Avro RPC
   support has been made stable along with better logging support.
 - Despite the number of mails in the lists are lower compared to the last
   term, contributor involvement has increased within the period where more
   contributors worked actively within the period.
 - OODT 1.9 is ready to be released and will be released in the coming month.
 - After 1.9, we will be moving to the 2.0 development cycle which will be a
   major step forward.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

We've seen activity pick back up since the unusually slow end to last quarter.
We voted on and released version 1.3.0 which included a number of key fixes,
improvements, and new features for the toolkit and we've continued to work on
improvements, bug fixes, and polishing as we work towards 1.4.0.

We're working with a new contributor to get them involved in GSoC since they
have been working on contributing and expressed interest in having a mentor so
they can expand their understanding of the toolkit. Hopefully schedules will
work out and we'll be on our way to a new committer/PMC member after a
successful GSoC! We're continuing to monitor activity given the occasional
drop that we see and the overall stagnation of PMC/Committer additions.

Issues for the board: None

When was the last committer or PMC member elected:
 - Ibrahim Jarif - 26 April 2016
 - Omkar Reddy - 20 January 2016

When was the last release:
 - 1.3.0 - 23 April 2018
 - 1.2.0 - 24 April 2017

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description: 
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specifications which are defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0), JSR-346
 (CDI-1.1 and CDI-1.2 MR) and JSR-365 (CDI-2.0).

 The OWB community also maintains  a small server as
 Apache Meecrowave subproject. Meecrowave bundles latest releases of
 the ASF projects Tocmat9 + OpenWebBeans + CXF + Johnzon + log4j2.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 We fixed a lot of tickets we got as feedback from real production.
 We also continue pushing performance despite the fact that we are still
 a few times faster than other CDI containers.
 The new Oracle Java release cadence (half year updates to bytecode) 
 causes quite some additional work. 
   
## Health report: 
 Community is doing fine. Small but active. 
 Meecrowave sees some adoption and TomEE did some releases lately
 which both help with the adoption.

   usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of
   the Java platform.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at this time.

Activity:
   Development activity continues toward the 2.1.0 release, which still should
   be *soon*, although a bit slower due to summer vacations. Builds were done
   using Java 10, and numerous issues fixed, so we are well-positioned for
   going forward.  Community is very silent as usual these last few years.

   Basically unchanged for several years:  development is ongoing, but users
   are quiet.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]


## Description:
 - The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
   software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
   to underlying platform-specific implementations.  There are three
   sub-projects: APR, APR-UTIL and APR-ICONV, of which the first two
   are the main focus of developer interest.
   
## Issues: 
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.             
   
## Activity: 
 - This quarter has seen increased activity in trunk.  The big
   event is that an APR-JSON module, originally developed by
   a third-party, has been adopted by the project (the original
   author has moved on and was happy to donate but not to join
   the team).  Another activity has been crypto updates
   reflecting OpenSSL updates and deprecations.

   There have been some platform changes, with Windows updates
   reserved for future versions, and a bugfix affecting Solaris.
   The latter calls for a new bugfix release, which is anticipated
   very shortly.

## Health report: 
 - The project remains basically healthy.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 41 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Evgeny Kotkov on Tue Sep 12 2017 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 67 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Evgeny Kotkov at Wed Sep 13 2017 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - None in the period.  Last release was a joint release of
   APR-1.6.3, APR-UTIL-1.6.1 and APR-ICONV-1.2.2 in October 2017.
   A new bugfix release (of APR only) is anticipated in September.
   
## Mailing list activity: 

 - The subscriber base remains stable.  Reasons for renewed activity
   are described above.
   
 - dev@apr.apache.org:  
    - 329 subscribers (down -4 in the last 3 months): 
    - 214 emails sent to list (79 in previous quarter) 
   
 - bugs@apr.apache.org:  
    - 20 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months): 
    - 38 emails sent to list (50 in previous quarter) 
   
   COMMENT: these figures are from reporter.apache.org, but are not
   consistent, in that the "previous quarter" numbers disagree with
   those then reported.  The differences are not significant.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Harbs]

## DESCRIPTION
Apache Royale is a new implementation of the principles of Apache Flex but
designed for JavaScript runtimes instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes.  Apache
Royale is designed to improve developer productivity in creating applications
for wherever Javascript runs, including browsers as well as Apache Cordova
applications, Node, etc.

## ISSUES
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## RELEASES
- Apache Royale 0.9.2 was released on March 16 2018.
- Apache Royale 0.9.4 in progress.

## ACTIVITY
- No releases this quarter.  Releases have been stalled by a combination of
  factors. One is that someone volunteered to be the RM and had not released
  Royale before and ran into configuration issues. Another is that so many new
  files were added that the Maven SCM plugin would not work correctly. Another
  is that there is a disagreement about the organization of files in the
  release. There has been a lot of work done to resolve this disagreement and
  it looks like we are close to resolving it. It looks like the Maven plugin
  has been fixed so hopefully we will release soon.
- Lots of progress on a new default look (component set) for Royale apps.
- Lots of progress on migrating a large Flex app to Royale. A new "Flex
  Emulation" component set is being worked on to ease migrations.
- New names are showing up on the mailing list asking about Royale.
- The owner of an ActionScript code base that doesn't use Flex is attempting
  to use the Royale Compiler to cross compile his code to JavaScript.
- There have been a number of blog posts on using Royale. They seem to be well
  received.
- We are using Disqus for blog comments. It seems to help engagement. We were
  not able to figure out how to get comments sent to the @dev list.
- We had huge activity on Social Networks, trying to inform about what is
  happening in Apache Royale as we progress in the project. We think is
  important to do this so people outside the project, not following in a daily
  basis could get a notion of how we are doing. The numbers here are the
  following:
    - Twitter got 375 followers since we open the account, and we are getting
      around 30 likes when we post something, and between 10 to 20 retweets,
      showing interest in what we're doing.
    - Facebook gets 97 likes to the page and we are getting around 10-15
      interactions (likes) and some comments, showing interest in Apache
      Royale. We took advantage of a promo in Facebook that allowed us to
      promote Apache Royale during 1 month (5 Jun - 5 July). We spend 1€ per
      day during 30 days, during that time we reached 34.879 People and had
      6.943 Interactions.
    - Google Plus, we post here as well but seem this social networks gets few
      interactions and seems not widely used by our target users.
    - We started a LinkedIn Group where 113 people joined in no time since
      opened. Groups in LinkedIn used to be watched by many people but remains
      silent most of the time, although it seems the way most of LinkedIn
      groups work.

## COMMUNITY
- Alina Kazi was added as committer on April 26 2018.
- No new PMC Members yet
- Two new contributors being watched to be committers.

## Mailing list activity:
 User lists subscribers continue to grow.  Fewer emails to read, but still a

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Description
===========

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Issues
======

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Activity
========

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

- We have released 3 sets of OSGi bundles.
- Our users are asking for the new ServiceMix release, so we should focus on
  preparing the new ServiceMix 7 (or maybe 8) based on the newest versions of
  Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.
- We are going to focus more on improvement of the documentation and
  improvement of the examples to give people easier start into integration
  with ServiceMix.
- We should focus during the next periods on cloud and devops themes to make
  the ServiceMix distribution more attractive for users.


Health report
=============

- Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA is on the same level like in the
  last period. We had some contributions.
- Our 2 PMC members have stepped down from PMC, because they have been
  inactive for a longer time and they didn't expect any further contribution
  from their side.  We actually don't see any new candidates to be invited to
  join the PMC.

PMC changes
===========

 - Currently 22 PMC members.
 - Andrea Cosentino was added to the PMC on Wed Mar 15 2017

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- Last release was 1.4.0 on 05-May-2017

Community & Project:

- Mailing list traffic has dipped slightly in the last quarter

- Feature development is planned to continue against master.

- OSGI support is a popular feature, we get an occasional one-liner
patch. However, we do NOT have a committer with sufficient experience,
which makes supporting it difficult.

- The 1.4.0 Release has been a step toward modernizing Shiro as well
as retain backwards compatibility

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Sling Project  [Robert Munteanu]

## Description:

Apache Sling™ is a framework for RESTful web-applications based on an
extensible content tree.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Business continues as usual with individual module releases. We are
considering releasing Sling 11 in the near future with Java 11 and preliminary
Java 12 support.

The "Apache Sling and friends" conference - adaptTo - is taking place in
Potsdam, Germany on 10-12 september, and we welcome the opportunity of meeting
in person and having a Sling hackathon.


## Health report:

Good activity level overall, contributions from different people continue. We
_think_ we see an increase in casual contributions after the move to Github
but could not quantify this yet due to missing tooling for aggregating stats
across a large number of repositories.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for Sep 2018

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Request to the Board for variance from new release policy:

We are requesting a variance from the Board regarding the new release policy
that disallows new artifacts from using SHA-1.

Apache SpamAssassin publishes rules updates that are cryptographically signed
using GPG, and have SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 hashes that are intended to
protect against data corruption in transit. The updates we publish can be used
by people who are still running the previous version of SpamAssassin, 3.3.2,
as well as the current version 3.4.1, which only recognize the GPG signature
and SHA-1 hash checksum. The recently released 3.4.2 drops the use of SHA-1
completely. We would like a variance to continue to publish SHA-1 hashes with
the rule updates until some date that we will specify as end of life for
SpamAssassin 3.3.2. We would then stop including SHA-1 hashes with the rule
updates, requiring everyone to upgrade to at least SpamAssassin 3.4.2 or stop
updating their rules. The exact date will depend in part on the response from
the Board regarding this request. Please note that the security of the
downloads come from the use of GPG signatures, not the hashes.

It can be argued that the use of SHA-1 in our rule updates does not fall under
the release policy, as we are not using it as part of the distribution of new
package releases. We do owe it to our users to be reasonable about how we
expect them to transition to the new SpamAssassin version 3.4.2. We would like
confirmation from the Board that we can proceed with the orderly transition to
dropping use of SHA-1 in our rule update system by setting a reasonable end of
life date.

We have a discussion of our request in
https://bz.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=7618

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running of our rule update infrastructure
and our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

Major news is that we have produced our first release in over three years.

We have added a new committer.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.2 on 16 September 2018.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Version 3.4.2 includes several security fixes, including four for which CVEs
have been issued. We expect to produce a version 3.4.3 in the near future to
address some issues that were deferred, in part so we could quickly release
the security fixes. Our main development branch is for a version 4.0.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description:
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - It was pointed out on the board@ list that Storm was one of a number of ASF
   projects with bylaws that include a provision for the voluntary and
   involuntary designation of inactive PMC members as "emeritus". The PMC
   discussed the issue and agreed that such provisions, though never used,
   should be removed.

   Ultimately, the PMC voted to retire our project-specific bylaws entirely,
   in favor of documenting project-specific policies (e.g. commmit policy) in
   a "Developer Guidelines" document. Once the patch is approved, the bylaws
   document will be removed from the Storm website.

 - The developer community is currently in the final discussion phase for the
   2.0 release and we expect to release that version this month. We also
   expect to make a 1.2.3 maintenance release shortly.

## Health report:
 - Project activity is steady, neither increasing nor decreasing.
- New contributors continue to engage and that engagement tends to keep up
  activity levels, even as some contributors move on. We continue to expand
  the PMC by regularly inviting new members.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 37 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Ethan Li on Tue Apr 10 2018

## Committer base changes:

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Michael Semb Wever]

## Description:
 Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for Java
applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify
the development of user interfaces.

## Activity & Health report:
 User and dev ML traffic was lower this quarter. 
Commits and Issues ML traffic show a small increase.

 The last release was Tiles-3.0.8, on November 18th 2017.

 There are currently two responsive PMC, other PMC help out with votes
when needed.  In total there are 8 PMC members, and 10 committers.

 The last PMC/committer was added on Mon Apr 23 2012,
being Nicolas LE BAS.

 The initial agreement from the two responsive PMC to 
move the project to the Attic still stands. 
 Initiating the process has been on hold as some contributions have
come in, albeit small bugs fixes.
 There is low-hanging-fruit tasks of moving the codebase onto JDK11 
for any new contributors to get into.
 If no new activity eventuates then the process of moving to the Attic, 
starting off with an announcement to  users ML and then a vote, will 
commence in the next quarter.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Josh Thompson]

## Description:
- VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
  brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
  bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
  web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
  TLP on June 20, 2012.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- Our previous board report specified there are two people that could be
  potential committers. Nothing has been received from them in since the last
  board report. We will continue to look for opportunities to engage with them
  in an attempt to get them more involved, hopefully leading to becoming
  committers. The comments on the last two reports suggested to add people
  sooner rather than later. I think this is a great model, but I also think
  that needs to be balanced with having a higher commitment to the project
  than just contributing something once. Do you have any suggestions on what
  would be the minimal someone should do to be considered for a committer?
- As explained in the Health report point below, work has slowed with the
  start of university semesters. We are hopeful these two people will have
  more opportunity to engage as things pick up toward our next release.

## Health report:
- Committee Health score: -2.65 (Action required!) - The report generator tool
  lists VCL as having a low health score. The VCL project has had very slow
  progress in the last few months, but that does not mean no progress. Most of
  the committers involved in the project work for universities and have had
  other responsibilities take priority at the beginning of the fall semester.
  Progress toward our next release (which only needs a little more work)
  should pick back up again in the next few weeks as start of semester
  activities die down.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project.

The libraries need some work to make sure the code base is operational
in the newer software development studios and platforms.  The 'C++' project
needs significant work to become C++17 standards compliant.  The Java library
has the most activity.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

We could use assistance with the details of inviting contributors to the PMC.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Most activity has been through JIRA issue tracking. The email lists
have seen little activity.  There are several contributors we are considering
as members to the PMC.

Contributors have recently increased their activity in both the Xalan-C and 
Xalan-J projects.

There are two contributors to Xerces that have expressed an interest in
contributing to the Xalan projects. They have also contributed to the Xalan
JIRA system.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

There are two contributors that we are hoping to become active members of
the Xalan project.  They currently support the Xerces project upon which
the Xalan project is based.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

The libraries need some work to make sure the code base is operational
in the newer software development suites. We need to ensure that the
Xalan libraries are compatible with the Xerces projects.

There is also a concern that there is insufficient support to maintain
the Xalan projects.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

With help from the community Xerces-J 2.12.0 was published to Maven Central in
June. There have been a few minor fixes and improvements made since the last
release. Most of the project activity has been mailing list discussion in the
last quarter.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; roughly 190+ posts on the j-dev and
j-users lists since the beginning of May 2018.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-J
2.12.0 (April 30th, 2018).

Xerces-C

A number of fixes and improvements have been made since Xerces-C 3.2.1. The
developers have been working on making a 3.2.2 release and started voting on a
release candidate last week.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 70+ posts on the c-dev and c-users
lists since the beginning of May 2018.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-C
3.2.1 (February 28th, 2018).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity over the
reporting period.

XML Commons

No activity over the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in April 2017 (Xerces-C) and May 2017
(Xerces-J).

No new PMC members since the last report. The most recent addition to the PMC
was in June 2016.

Three committers have committed changes to SVN since May 2018.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The Xerces logo was updated in June to include a "TM" symbol. We have no
further actions for branding and so will be dropping this section from future
reports.

    not centered around some sort of "bad actor" or a change to the ASF
    infrastructure.  Let's hope this continues!

## Health report:

    Our typical pattern appears to continue: activity goes significantly up
    due to the work required to get a new release out.  Unless a new release
    is eminent, next quarter will likely be another quiet one.

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]
## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop does not typically report during this period, but given some 
discussion on the private mailing list and the board attention that this 
discussion has had, the PMC thought it best to submit a summary of the 
current situation in this month's report to see what feedback the board may
have at this point. This issue is explained in detail below in the "Issues"
section.

As a side note, TinkerPop has recently added a new committer in Harsh 
Thakkar.

## Issues:
For many months, the TinkerPop PMC has been discussing the idea of an 
"emeritus system", similar in nature, but not quite the same, to what had 
been published in Hadoop (and other TLP) by-laws. The fact that we had been
in discussion on this topic had been reported as private remarks on both the
July 2018[1] and the April 2018[2] reports. The board did provide some 
general feedback on the April report[3] in relation to those remarks.

It was somewhat unfortunate that we'd classified this discussion as one 
related to "emeritus", which has specific meaning in Apache parlance, as 
ultimately the concern was more related to how the TinkerPop website 
organized the listing of contributors to the project. Perhaps it took 
discussion to get to that point of understanding, but none of this talk has
anything to do with revoking committer rights or removing PMC members.

With that much in mind, a summary of where the discussion has led can be 
found here[4]. That post also contains some proposed work items based on 
those points. Pending board feedback, there are likely still some open 
issues:

1. RELEASE NOTES format changes should be discussed on the dev list for 
wider feedback
2. The summary refers to a "bio update email" - the wording of that email 
is perhaps a simple one or two sentences, but would require consideration.

## Releases:
- 3.2.9 (May 8, 2018)
- 3.3.3 (May 8, 2018)

## PMC/Committer:
- Last PMC addition was Robert Dale - April 2017
- Last committer addition was Harsh Thakkar - August 2018
