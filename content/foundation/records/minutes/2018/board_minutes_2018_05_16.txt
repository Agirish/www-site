 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we had several very good reports.  Brooklyn, Geode, HTTP
       Server and Phoenix all submitted exemplary reports.  Several PMCs were
       thanked for responding to feedback and dealing with issues that they
       or the board called out in prior reports and / or improving the
       quality of their reports. Thanks to all who contributed to developing
       project reports this month.

       Other than general thanks and praise for good reporting, comments this
       month were all in one of the following categories:
       * Requests to ensure that projects with low activity have effective
         PMC oversight
       * Reminders to keep everything that can be public, public
       * Request to include in board reports description of how projects
         managed problems
       * Reminder to include basic information on committer / PMC roster
         changes

       After getting general agreement on the concept and initial list of
       policies to work on, I started work this month on the policy roadmap.
       Working with Bertrand, my goal is to get started on discussing the
       first one (release) this month and also agree on how the review and
       approval process will work and where approved policies will be hosted.

    B. President [Sam]

       No issues for the board.

       Good fiscal year overall.  Every expense line item was essentially at
       or below budget.  Fundraising was significantly over budget, and that
       is without counting the Pineapple Fund donation.

       Thanks to the board for approving the FY19 budget.  My personal vision
       is that we complete the next five year plan by the end of this
       calendar year, and that five year plan be where we focus on strategy
       and the one year budget be where we focus on tactics that implement
       that strategy.

       Every area is operating smoothly.

        - - -

       Selected Highlights:

       Brand Management:
       * There are currently 24 open issues across 14 PMCs

       Fundraising:
       * Executed PCCC PSA for paid VP Fundraising
       * Amended process for nominating VP Sponsor relations
       * Working to increase targeted sponsorship
       * Working to gel the Sponsor+ program
       * Ready to launch ASF endowment program

       Marketing and Publicity:
       * New "VP Sponsor Relations" title
       * Promoting ApacheCon and two Apache Roadshow events
       * Worked with vendor to correct their promotional practices
       * 9 blog entries, 30 tweets, 9 LinkedIn posts, 5 media queries

       Infrastructure:
       * Status moved to StatusPage.io / NodePing
       * mail-search has been replaced and will ultimately be retired
       * new TLP server under Azure
       * Jenkins server difficulties hope to be resolved with new server

       Conferences:
       * Current focus is on Apache RoadShow Europe in June
       * ApacheCon North America schedule has been posted
       * Proposals and venues are being evaluated for conferences in 2019

       Travel Assistance:
       * 28 completed applications were received and scored

        - - -

       After talking to Kevin, Tom, and Daniel, the costs for converting
       Fundraising from a contract to a PEO are likely to be in the $15K
       range annually.  Our joint recommendation at this point is to NOT
       proceed with this.  If the board sees this differently, give me action
       item and I will continue to pursue it.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report: 

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s performance for
       the 12 months of FY18.

       Operating Cash on April 30, 2018 was $2,072K, which is up $117K from
       last month’s ending balance (Mar 18) of $1,955K.    Total Cash as of
       Apr 30th, 2018 is $2,964.4K. The Apr 2018 ending Operating cash
       balance of $2,072K represents an Operating cash reserve of 20.1 months
       based on the FY18 conservative Cash forecast average monthly spending
       of $103.1K/month( using the FY19 budgeted expense budget of $1,896.3K,
       the FY19 monthly expense amount is $158K which using the ending Oper
       Cash balance of $2,072K, gives us 13.1 months of Oper based on FY19
       expenses as of 4.30.18).  The ASF reserve continues to be very healthy
       for an organization of ASF’ s size.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we had a very strong and favorable showing
       against our FY18 budget, however we need to keep an eye on any
       invoices that come in that may have pertained to FY18 as we move
       through May and June 2018, for comparative purposes.  For April 2018
       we were over the FY 18 budget for Revenue by $18.8K due to timing of
       Sponsor payments compared to the Apr 18 Budget.  The Foundation was
       also under the FY18 budget in Expenses as well for Apr 18 (all depts
       were under for April 2018 except Publicity due the timing of some
       invoice payments).   The Fundraising team did an excellent job in both
       areas, servicing both new and existing Sponsors for FY18.  With total
       actual FY18 Revenue, as of Apr 30th, 2018, of $1,785.9K (up $211.8K
       from Mar 18 and up $796.6K from Apr 17), we finished at 145.6% ahead
       of our FY18 budgeted Total Revenue of $1,226.5K.  Regarding Sponsor
       revenue, we finished FY18 at $1,616.9K, (up $210K from Mar 18 and up
       $838K from Apr 17) which has us at an increase of 149.2%  over our
       budgeted Sponsor revenue goal of $1,084K for FY18.  This is a great
       accomplishment as we exceeded our FY18 Sponsorship budget by more than
       a half million dollars if FY18 and are poised to keep that momentum up
       into FY19.  As for the remaining revenue categories, we have received
       $169K against a total budget of $142.5K or 118.6% ahead of our FY 18
       budget.  With regard to FY18 vs FY17 for the other revenue categories,
       we had $167K in FY18 and $139.9K in FY17 or 121% increase, due in
       large part to what we have received via the Hopsie platform, which
       again is fantastic as it is no real cost to the foundation but another
       option for Fundraising.

       KAM Comment: Including the Pineapple fund conversion to cash increases 
       the fundraising for FY18 by just about another $900k as well.

       YTD expenses, through Apr 30th, 2018 are under budget by $157.1K, with
       Infra as the only dept over budget ($2.6K or basically breakeven to
       their FY18 budget). This is due primarily to a number of FY18 budgeted
       expenses not being utilized (TAC legal fees in Brand, EA, etc).

       Regarding Net Income (NI), for FY18 the ASF finished with a positive
       $548.6K NI vs a budgeted negative <$167.9K> NI or $716.5K ahead of the
       FY 18 Budget for Net Income, which is more than 3 times better than
       the FY18 budget.  Again, I want to congratulate the entire Foundation
       on these very positive Operating results as FY 18.  It does truly
       take a team effort to achieve these types of results.  Now that we see
       what can be achieved by our efforts, we do need to continue to keep
       these efforts up as we move into FY19.  We need to continue to provide
       Fundraising all the support and resources to continue with the
       traction that has been created with in the last year, while keeping an
       eye on our expenses at the same time.   We should also recognize that
       the Foundation as compared to not only its FY18 budget but also to FY
       17 actuals, is in “an extremely good place” by all measures and we
       should all be very proud of that fact, as FY 18 has ended and we enter
       FY19, which in turn is very good for all of our ongoing projects and
       initiatives.

       Asst. Treasurer Report:

       - Treasurer is going well.

       - Purchased and implemented 10 more Google Vault Licenses for
         $100/year.  All users have Vault on Google. Might want to look at
         bouncing all our mail archives to an infra user to use for
         e-discovery noting last months evidenciary hold notice.

       - We are working on the annual report due May 18 to SK.

       - The public 990 is still not available for the update of the Apache
         page.  I am checking  https://www.guidestar.org/profile/47-0825376
         and clicking the show 990 button for downloads which shows it is not
         yet available.

       - KAM is stepping down from his Asst Treasurer role now that the
         Fundraising contract is signed:

       As my role has shifted to a paid role with Fundraising please accept
       this notice of resignation as Assistant Treasurer as an action item at
       the next board meeting.

        It has been my pleasure to help and Uli has agreed that I will
        continue to help monitor treasurer@/accounting@/etc. and retain the
        RSA token for Citizens in case he needs a backstop.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The secretary office continues to run smoothly with active help from the
       Assistant Secretary.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Congratulations on bringing the ASFs largest cost centre in on budget
       (actually a slight 0.3% overage on our $800K+)

       A key new, long term, focus is to upgrade all infrastructure
       management from Puppet v3 to Puppet v5. While the existing long term
       focus of decommissioning aging hardware continues.

       status.apache.org page has been moved to StatusPage.io - a number of
       benefits are identified in the Infrastructure report. A key one is a
       better mechanism for managing and notifying of scheduled maintenance.

       There have been some difficulties around the Jenkins masters. This is
       being managed in preparation for installation of a new dedicated piece
       of hardware.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       VP Marketing reports the completion of counselling "a Big Data vendor
       on correcting their promotional practices to align with established
       ASF publicity, outreach, and branding guidelines." Thank you to Sally
       and the impacted PMCs, as well as the company themselves for working
       in the best interests of the broader community.

       Otherwise business as usual, including assistance with fundraising
       relations.

       Conferences

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       No specific activity in the past month; life issues got in the way.

       Going forward, I hope to spend time working on improvements for how
       projects and officers engage with the board, and keeping discussions
       on changes focused and productive for all.  One effort will include
       the new Board JIRA queue to allow us to decide on some kinds of
       specific proposals for change.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Mark Thomas]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.


* OPERATIONS

A request was received for a logo to use to represent httpd. It has been
passed to the PMC who are discussing options.

Google Analytics has been removed from the Brand pages as it wasn't used and
removing it was simpler than figuring out what needed to be done to make it
GDPR compliant.

Discussed the possibility of allowing additional project content to be hosted
at sites other than *.apache.org. No change in policy at this time.

Merchandise request for GEODE. Passed to PMC for final approval.

Event requests for GEODE and ACCUMULO. Passed to PMC for final approval. The
GEODE event overlaps with ApacheCon. It is being hosted as a side-event at a
larger conference so such conflicts can be difficult to avoid.  The organisers
will be asked to co-ordinate on dates sooner for future events to try and
avoid this.

Usage requests (books) for MAVEN and OPENOFFICE. Both approved.

The GMail based tracking system for open issues continues to work well. There
are currently 24 open issues across 14 PMCs


* REGISTRATIONS

Started process of registering OPENOFFICE (rather than OPENOFFICE.ORG). This
follows on from previous discussions with the OpenOffice PMC regarding long
term strategy for registrations.

A notice of an office action was received for our BEAM registration. Our
response is being discussed with the PMC.


* INFRINGEMENTS

Discussed potential infringements with Spark, Maven, Cassandra and OpenOffice
with the relevant PMCs. Most were non-issues. Those that were are being
followed up with the relevant PMC.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues to go well.  As proposed, KAM has taken a paid role of
VP Fundraising.  Daniel Ruggeri serves as volunteer VP Fundraising.  KAM
reports to him and he will report to the President.  Additional work for HALO
to contact Platinum sponsors is also going.  Work for additional levels
delayed pending contract vehicle from Virtual expected soon.

DRuggeri Notes:
* Added Sally Khudairi and Tom Pappas as VP Sponsor Relations effective
  2018-04-28
* https://fundraising.apache.org is being built out and is mostly stabilized -
  eyes welcome
* Executed PCCC PSA for paid VP Fundraising (KAM) 2018-05-14
* Amended process for nominating VP Sponsor relations per [VOTE] 

KAM Notes:
* We are working on the annual report due May 18 to SK.
* KAM believes that the idea of automatically embedding and maintaining ASF
  space on *.apache.org resources is not tenable and is closing the ticket.
* Committee meetings continue to occur monthly.
* Work continues on our three 2018 Apache events including sponsor agreements
  and pitches
* KAM CFP selected for FOSS Backstage.  Planning to attend BBW & FOSS
  Backstage for ASF to speak on How to be an Effective Board Member:
  https://foss-backstage.de/session/how-be-effective-board-member
* KAM CFP selected for ApacheCon.  Planning to attend AC2018 to speak on
  Inclusion, Meritocracy and the Apache Way.
* We are working to increase targeted sponsorship and move Leaseweb to
  Platinum level with annual billing so we don’t have this criss cross like
  now.  Tom may have a more recent update as of the board meeting as this is
  ongoing as I write the report.
* KAM also repeated our ask for Apache for Amazon for Infra on 5/4.  No
  response received as of this report..
* Continue improving our fundraising procedures and working on our playbook
  website (https://fundraising.apache.org/).
* Attended CANON Cyber security event hosted by Rick Howard of Palo Alto where
  we discussed the concept of an ASF endowment.  
  Follow-up meeting planned for the 18th.
* Some notes: pitched Accenture, talked with Twitter, talked with Bloomberg,
  pitched pivotal, asked DLA piper about targeted sponsorship.
* Discussed a possible targeted sponsorship for mentorship with Andrew
  Friedman.
* Coordinated ASF representation for Huawei annual conference.
* Working to gel the Sponsor+ program for website and event recognition for
  sponsors for an entire year.  Pitched to three sponsors
  (IBM/Pivotal/Twitter)
* Twitter is 99% back on board as a bronze level but working on a higher level
  for 2019.
* Quenda has been increased in status as a targeted sponsor.
* Attending breakfast this week for GMU and will continue planning on DC
  roadshow
* ApacheCon in Turkey was vetted and declined.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we have kicked off the fiscal year with contract renewals with all
our vendors to ensure continuity in service. We anticipate a smooth start to
Q1 of FY2019.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi is preparing the ASF Annual
Report. We published the latest "Success at Apache" post: "Dip into the Apache
Way" https://s.apache.org/HpyO . Sally continues day-to-day Sponsor
ambassadorial outreach with Fundraising under her new "VP Sponsor Relations"
title, and is working with ASF Conferences on promoting ApacheCon and two
Apache Roadshow events. She has successfully counseled a Big Data vendor on

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
No issues for the President/EVP, nor for the Board.

Finances
========
Infrastructure ended up at a slight 0.3% overage on our $800K+
budget. We will call this a success. Leading into FY19, we will
continue our ongoing efforts to minimize costs and to provide as much
value as possible from the budget provided to our department.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Upgrade Confluence to the latest release
- Switch to the newly-provisioned Jenkins Master
- Finish tooling to enable easy/mass migration from git-wip to GitBox

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- We are currently running on Puppet v3. aka Old. Moving to v5 will
  take some considerable effort, and will be started this year. Quite
  a bit of research on the impact to our operation has already been
  done, and how we can run v3/v5 side-by-side as we perform the
  migration. This is lower priority than decommissioning old hardware
  and moving those systems into puppet.

General Activity
================
- Our status.apache.org page has been moved to StatusPage.io. This
  involved a move from system monitoring via PingMyBox to NodePing.
  This has simplified some of our status/monitoring flow, and brought
  some new features (particularly around scheduling maintenance, and
  paths for people to sign up for notifications). PMB was performing
  some traffic routing checks which is not available in our new
  system, but that is acceptable.
- The old mail-search.a.o server has been moved to mail-search-old,
  and our new replacement is mail-private.a.o. It has gone live, and
  has been working terrifically (long term, it will disappear in favor
  of lists.a.o)
- We have brought up a new "TLP Server" within Azure, and are running
  tests to ensure everything is working correctly. It is in DNS round
  robin, so is serving live traffic at this time. Concluding this
  effort will allow us to turn off some very old hardware.
- In the vein of turning off old hardware, we have also started some
  work on puppetizing our core email system ("hermes"). This will be a
  long and fearsome process to transition into the cloud, but we'll
  get there one day.
- We had an unscheduled upgrade of FishEye after receiving
  notification of vulnerabilities in our version.
- Our rsync server for mirrors has been set up on a single-purpose
  bare metal box (it used to be shared with TLP servers, and fought
  for I/O). We will shortly disable the older servers, in favor of
  this single machine, in order to reduce bandwidth costs and reduce
  the I/O contention with other ASF services.

Uptime Statistics
=================
We've been having difficulties with our Jenkins Master server, and
have needed to reboot it several times over the past week. The root
cause is still unknown. We have chosen not to dig in just yet, as
we've acquired a beefy new server tuned to become the new master. The
old one had I/O contention with fellow VMs on the box; this new one
will operate on bare metal with wicked-fast I/O. Post-move, we'll dig
in should similar problems arise.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Apache RoadShow Europe, Berlin, is just a few weeks away. June 11-14
2018. With assistance from Sally, the many speakers, and various
projects, we are promoting the event. We have also started a
discussion of how (and whether) we might cooperate with this event
next year. http://apachecon.com/euroadshow18/

ApacheCon North America now has a schedule posted, and we have stepped
up our promotion efforts, but are focusing mostly on the EU event
until early June. http://apachecon.com/acna18

The venue search for ACNA 2019 is progressing. We still intend to
announce ACNA19 at ACNA18.

A proposal was received for a 2019 event in Turkey, and declined.

Thus, we are still open to other opportunities in Europe for 2019.

We have received proposals for 2019 events in Japan and South Korea.
While there was general approval, VP Conference is not taking any
direct action on either of those proposals at the moment.




-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

For ACNA Montreal we have had 28 completed applications (and 4 that never got
finished in time). The judges have scored and at this time we are putting
together a judges meeting to go through and approve/reject the applications.
Once this is done, the applicants will be informed, ACNA planners will be
informed and then we'll start to go through the rest of the process, getting
Visa applications sorted etc.

No other events being supported yet, but we are on the lookout for other
smaller events now that our budget was approved.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

Overall a very quiet month.

The Legal Affairs committee responded to an inquiry from the Infrastructure
administrator regarding allowing the capability of PMCs to set the repo:status
information in GitHub through our GitBox tooling. Legal saw no issue with
this.

A discussion surrounding examples of components that have undergone
relicensing from GPL to ALv2 was run to ground with useful help from various
members of the legal committee to the inquirer.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment B: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Materne]

## Description: 
Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools.
It consists of 3 main projects:
 - Ant - core and libraries (AntLibs)
 - Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
 - IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
Additionally Ant provides several extensions to Ant (antlibs).

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
 - Set up a build matrix: Ant (1.10.x) can be build from Java 8 to Java 11.
 - Published a new Ivy release (RC version as the API is not fixed enough), so 
   we could get more familiar with the release process of Ivy and send a sign of 
   life. Ivy-2.5-RC1 is compatible with Eclipse Oxygen.3.
 - Lots of refactoring the Ant codebase regarding JUnit/Hamcrest matchers,
   Java8 and codestyle.

## Health report:

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Brooklyn Project  [Geoff Macartney]

## Description:

- Apache Brooklyn Project is a software framework for modelling, monitoring
  and managing cloud applications through autonomic blueprints.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Development continues with a regular turnover of pull requests submitted
  and merged.
- We had previously proposed two candidate Google Summer of Code projects,
  one for a new UI and one for improved authentication mechanisms. However,
  while there were a number of expressions of interest and some proposed
  projects, we did not find that any of them met the criteria sufficiently
  for us to accept them.
- Richard Downer stepped down as PMC chair and I (Geoff Macartney, geomacy)
  have taken up the role.

## Health report:

- The project continues with a regular turnover of pull requests and commits.
  It has been a relatively quiet quarter compared to previous ones in terms
  of the number of commits, however development is continuing and users are
  feeding back their problems and feature suggestions.
- We continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
  members with the aim of regularly adding individuals. On this occasion,
  there have been no new appointments since our last report.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 15 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Thomas Bouron on Tue Oct 31 2017

## Releases:

 - Last release was 0.12.0 on Wed Sep 27 2017
 - There has been dev list discussion about releasing a 1.0.0 version of
   Brooklyn. While no firm date has been set, the consensus seems to be that
   we are close to being able to do that, and I expect discussions about a
   suitable date for the release will happen during the summer.

## JIRA activity:

 - 9 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 11 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

 
## Activity:
 The project is moving at a slow pace with a few commits in the last months.

We just successfully voted our last release, 1.5.6.
   
## Health report:
The project has been stable for a long while and the space of build tools 
for Java projects has been overall stagnant for a number of years.
   
## PMC changes:
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Peter Donald on Tue Oct 15 2013

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Camel Project  [Christian Mueller]

## Description:
- Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration library based on
  Enterprise Integration Patterns. Rules for Camel's routing engine can be
  defined in either a Java based DSL or XML.

## Issues:
- We apologize to have missed the previous board reports. PMC members stepped
  up and we are taking action to move forward.
- We also asking the board to change the Apache Camel PMC chair and proposing
  Andrea Cosentino as the new PMC chair.

## Activity:
- We are focusing the development of the next minor release Apache Camel
  2.22.0 expected for the end of June.
- Since the last report we released: Camel 2.21.0, 2.21.1, 2.20.2, 2.20.3 and
  2.19.5
- We are working on a new website while the documentation has been totally
  migrated to Github to be able to control the documentation at code level.
- We are continuing our work towards Apache Camel 3.0.0.

## Health report:

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
After several lengthy mail list discussions, a consensus reached on the
timeframe of early September for creating a 4.0 branch and what the rough
goals are going to be for a feature set. This consensus has been in the making
for some time, so we are glad to have it.

## Health report:
As seen from the mail list activity and committer and PMC additions, overall
the project is healthy.

## PMC changes:
There are currently 27 PMC members. Three New PMC members were added during
this reporting period:
- Blake Eggleston on Wed Mar 28 2018
- Sam Tunnicliffe on Tue Apr 03 2018
- Stefan Podkowinski on Wed Mar 07 2018

## Committer base changes:
There are currently 50 committers. One committer was added during this
reporting period:
- Jay Zhuang on Wed Feb 28 2018

## Releases:
We had a minor release on each of our four supported branches:
- 2.1.20 was released on Fri Feb 16 2018
- 2.2.12 was released on Fri Feb 16 2018
- 3.0.16 was released on Mon Feb 19 2018
- 3.11.2 was released on Mon Feb 19 2018

## Mailing list activity:
Mail list activity on the dev and user lists has been up substantially. We
attribute the rise in dev list activity to a series of robust discussions
regarding the timeline of branching and releasing a forthcoming 4.0.

dev@cassandra.apache.org:
- 1626 subscribers (down -4 in the last 3 months):
- 703 emails sent to list (180 in previous quarter)

user@cassandra.apache.org:

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Clerezza Project  [Hasan Hasan]

DESCRIPTION
Apache Clerezza models the RDF abstract syntax in Java and provides supports
for serializing, parsing, and managing triple collections, as well as a tool
to generate the source code of a Java class with constants for an ontology 
described in RDF. Apache Clerezza components are OSGi-based and have the 
purpose to ease building of Semantic Web applications and services.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

A question of the board to the previous report was: 
mt: Over 4 years since the last PMC/committer change and getting on for 2 
years since the last release. Is the project still viable? 
Are there at least 3 active PMC members?

Answer: 
Yes, there are 4 active PMC members in the project: reto@apache.org,
hasan@apache.org, rwesten@apache.org, and tommaso@apache.org. Therefore,
Apache Clerezza is still viable.

RELEASE
Latest release was partial-release-201604 created on May 13, 2016.

ACTIVITY
Reto and Hasan met in Zurich to discuss refactoring of the new
'reunited' branch of Apache Clerezza. Hasan is working on it.

COMMUNITY
Latest change was addition of a new committer and PMC member on 16.08.2013.

INFRASTRUCTURE
Latest update of the Apache Clerezza Website was in February 2018.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Cédric Damioli]

## Description:
  Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Issues:
  there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

  The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14 A few JIRA issues opened or
  resolved since last report. A little activity on both users and dev
  mailing-lists, in any case more than the previous quarter. The project is
  mainly in maintenance mode.

  Last board feedback was the occasion to have a small discussion between PMC
  members on the opportunity/interest to move to the Attic. It seems that the
  time has not yet come, but it's true that the activity keeps being low.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

# Description:

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache Projects

## Issues:

No issues require board attentions at the moment.

## Activity:

OpenExpo

As part of our involvement with the OpenExpo, there was a request for
volunteers to write short articles on open source trends for the conference
e-book. Several volunteers came forward and the ebook was published in both
English and Spanish versions. [1][2]. Thanks very much to Sally for
co-ordinating this effort.

Ignasi Barrera has taken over the event co-ordination from Sharan for the
OpenExpo as she is now fully focussed on managing the EU Roadshow. A wiki page
[3] has been setup to track the details.

Apache EU Roadshow

The CFP for the Roadshow ended with 72 talks being submitted. A request for
reviewers was made on the mailing list. The Tomcat and Httpd PMCs selected
their own tracks and while the others were based on reviewer scores. 28 talks
were finally selected and the schedule has been announced.[4]

We will now be focussing on promoting the event to attract as many attendees
as possible.

ApacheCon NA

The CFP for ApacheCon NA ended with 249 submissions. To help promote the event
across as many projects as possible an apachecon
"ad" has been created that projects can add to their websites. [6]

Other Events

GOTO Chicago : Thanks to Trevor Grant talking to the organisers, we also had a
booth presence at GOTO Chicago.Feedback was very positive and a proposal has
been made to run an Apache Roadshow in Chicago for 2019 [5]

OW2Con Paris: We were given a track but unfortunately had only one submission
so have cancelled our involvement.

OSCON: We have been allocated a free booth and there are quite a few Apache
project related talks (Spark, OpenWhisk, Kafka, PredictionIO, Ignite, MXNet,
Mesos and Fineract) on the schedule.

GSoC

The ASF was accepted as a GSoC mentor organisation again this year and our
mentors mailing list is being used to co-ordinate the work. Both Uli and Maxim
have been very active in finalising the list of accepted students.

Ongoing Discussions:

Producing new member orientation material How to improve the Help Wanted
experience and/or site

## Health report:

We are recieving an increasing number of requests to participate at
conferences either with a booth presence or with track presentations. We
perhaps need to think about introducing better co-ordination, visibility and
planning if we want to be able to participate more effectively in future
events.

We have also had a lot of interest from people using the Help Wanted site and
are currently discussing ways to improve the experience.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 26 PMC members.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
- Seamless multi-master sync, that scales from Big Data to Mobile,
  with an Intuitive HTTP/JSON API and designed for Reliability.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 

## Activity:
 - We worked through a gnarly set of issues in 2.1.1 that will culminate
   in the soon-ish 2.2.0 and 2.1.2 set of releases. This was a multi-month
   cross-team effort that resulted in many happy end-users.
 - Updated CI infrastructure and convenience build dependencies due to
   major repos dropping one of our dependencies (SpiderMonkey 1.8.5).
 - We will have presence at ApacheCon in Montreal thanks to Joan @woahli
   Touzet.
 - A number of PMC members attended long-time contributor Robert Newson’s
   wedding in Windsor: https://twitter.com/rnewson/status/988141902313779200

## Health report:
 - Slowed down activity after busy Q4/17 & Q1/18, some of it due to
   industry-wide generally busyness because of SPECTRE, MELTDOWN & GDPR.
 - The project is doing fine overall, and is looking forward to after
   May 25th.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 15 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Nick Vatamaniuc on Tue Nov 07 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 63 committers.
 - Peng Hui Jiang was added as a committer on Sat Mar 03 2018

## Releases: 
 - Last release was 2.1.1 on Mon Jan 29 2018

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

# Status
Since the last report, a new TLP for DRAT was proposed, which raised some
questions about how it relates to Creadur / RAT. There were no specific
concerns raised within the Creadur PMC. An offer was extended to the Creadur
PMC members to join the DRAT PMC, and Brian Fox accepted and is now also
partof DRAT. Otherwise, no changes to the code.

Since this is a low activity project, a vote was called on the content of this
report as a test of our ability to self-govern. As of the time of posting, we
achieved 4 +1s in less than 24 hours.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

# Community
In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC / Commit.


# Releases
- Apache Rat 0.12 was released in June, 2016
- Apache Rat 0.11 was released in August, 2014
- Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Report from the Apache DRAT Project  [Chris Mattmann]

- Apache DRAT is a distributed, parallelized (Map Reduce) wrapper around
  Apache RAT™ and other code auditing tools to allow it to complete on large
  code repositories of multiple file types.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - we are currently voting on the addition of a few new PMC members and
   committers and will have something to report next quarter here.
 - Google Summer of Code has started and we have a project to improve the DRAT
   UI with Ahmed Ifhaam to evolve the DRAT UI. Chris Mattmann is mentoring and
   we expect some activity around the project.
 - Wayne Burke and Phil Otilinger made some minor updates to the website to
   conform to the branding policy by fixing the year mentioned and to clean
   the website of old artifiacts.
 - Lewis McGibbney upgraded DRAT to the latest released version of OODT
   (1.2.2) and to the latest Tomcat (9.x)


## Health report:
  - we are a small but growing project. There are some big opportunities to
    make DRAT the defacto code analysis tool used by all of our projects. We
    need to get our Drat-Viz full ASF website published and we also need to
    think about a Maven plugin. But beyond that we are healthy, adding new
    committers and PMC, participating in GSOC and slowly but steadily growing.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - Philipp Ottlinger was added to the PMC on Mon Feb 26 2018

## Committer base changes:

   independent, intuitive and maintenance friendly API providing a maximum of 
   compile-time-safety.
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Again, we have worked on fixes and received various improvements which we 
   plan to publish with a new release later this year.
 - Work on the redesign of our website has not yet started due to lack of time 
   of the chair (and possibly others).

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Flume Project  [Mike Percy]

## Description:

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently
collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data to scalable data
storage systems such as Apache Hadoop's HDFS.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Added support for encrypted passwords
 - Various bug fixes and stability improvements

## Health report:

This has been a slow quarter due to people being busy, going on vacation, and
only having a few active PMC members and committers. On the plus side, there
have been some new contributors to the project.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 23 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
 - Last PMC addition was Denes Arvay on Sun Nov 05 2017.

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 31 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months.
 - Last committer addition was Attila Simon on Sat Nov 04 2017.

## Releases:

 - Last release was 1.8.0 on Tue Oct 03 2017.
 - There are no releases being planned at this time.

## Mailing list activity:

Partway through the previous quarter we switched JIRA traffic from dev@ to
issues@. This resulted in a significant drop in traffic to dev@ that was
smeared across the previous quarter and this quarter. We'll monitor the
activity next quarter to see how things are progressing, but overall it appears
that change has been good for increasing the signal:noise ratio on the dev list.

One thing we didn't do yet was update the web site to reflect the addition of
the issues@ list, so the number of subscribers to that list is very low. We'll
get that fixed soon.

 - dev@flume.apache.org:
    - 284 subscribers (down -7 in the last 3 months):
    - 47 emails sent to list (189 in previous quarter)

 - issues@flume.apache.org:
    - 9 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 125 emails sent to list (59 in previous quarter)

 - user@flume.apache.org:
    - 673 subscribers (down -7 in the last 3 months):
    - 21 emails sent to list (20 in previous quarter)

Attachment U: Report from the Apache FreeMarker Project  [Dániel Dékány]

## Description:

Apache FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text
output based on templates. Apache FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class
library for programmers.

FreeMarker 2 (the current stable line) produces releases since 2002. The
FreeMarker project has joined the ASF in 2015, and graduated from the
Incubator in early 2018.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

There was some development activity, in the 3.0 branch mostly. All the post
graduation tasks have been completed.

## Health report:

Activity is relatively low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User
question and new Jira issues are being answered promptly.

The long term goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0 branch, so
that the project can innovate and the code base can become much cleaner (and
more attractive for new committers), instead of being blocked by 15 years of
historical baggage. (Meanwhile, the backward compatible 2.x branch must be
maintained, and produce releases.)

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 7 committers.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Giraph Project  [Avery Ching]

## Description: 

- Giraph is a Bulk Synchronous Parallel framework for writing programs
  that analyze large graphs on a Hadoop cluster. Giraph is similar to
  Google's Pregel system.
   
## Summary:

- Avery Ching has stepped down as VP of Giraph and the PMC voted to
  nominate Dionysios Logothetis. The resolution has been added to the
  board's agenda.

- We are actively trying to reinvigorate the community and the flow of
  patches being committed has resumed.

- Since last report, we have added a few features around collecting
  performance statistics and making it possible to act on it
  (e.g. when excess Garbage Collection happens). These have proven
  necessary tools in a large-scale production environment.

- In terms of increasing community engagement, we are in contact with
  a team from the industry that is considering investing in Apache
  Giraph and contributing to the project (details below).

## Issues: 

- The PMC has requested a brand new member of the project, Dionysios
  Logothetis, as the new VP.  As a result, the Apache members on the
  PMC (Avery Ching, Hyunsik Choi, Owen O'Malley, and Sebastian
  Schelter) will need to be actively mentoring.
   
## Activity: 

- Code contributions

  - It is now possible to collect statistics on performance stragglers
    and act on it through the Observer mechanism.
  - New GC observers provide ability to define actions on GC events through
    simple interface.
  - Instantiation of custom OutEdges implementation is now more
    configurable and more efficient.
  - Improved serialization mechanism by reducing intermediate data copies.
  - Bug fixes.

- We started cleaning-up JIRAs that have been completed, and closing
  obsolete ones.
   
## Health report: 

- We are in discussion with a team from the industry that want to
  start building a graph analytics platform on top of Apache Giraph in
  the next few years and plan to start contributing to the
  project. They are already active by creating JIRAs and have
  expressed interest in contributing specific tasks, such as cleaning
  up obsolete hadoop profiles, and improving the Giraph testing
  environment. They also want to become committers at some point.

- As a consequence, this will increase the diversity in the group of
  committers, not just the numbers.

- We plan to clean-up the code in two ways (i) remove obsolete Hadoop
  profiles. This will allow us to remove the need for the Munge
  plugin, which will make it easier to develop and test code locally
  (ii) remove unmaintained modules. These two items will remove some
  unnecessary complexity from our build and make it easier to maintain
  a healthy build. This is important for the overal health of the
  project as it will make it easier for new contributors to start
  working with Giraph.

- We plan to make a release after this clean-up.
  
## PMC changes:

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description:

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, first class functional programming support and
runtime and compile-time meta-programming.

## Issues:

There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time. Outstanding
issues:

 - The final steps to completing the website migration are still outstanding.
   A new issue has been raised wrt bad formatting on the https version of the
   site due to the current status, so there will be increased pressure on us
   to complete this task.
 - The community is still keen on some kind of Groovy Champions scheme. We
   have passed on the information around Apache requirements for such a scheme
   was it to move forward. No further discussions have taken place.

## Activity:

 - This quarter, 349 commits were contributed from 18 contributors including
   11 non-committer contributors (10 new).

 - Over the previous quarter, Apache Groovy has been downloaded 19 million
   times. Twice as much in Q1'18 as the same period the previous year.

## Health report:

 - Our release train velocity has been maintained, and there seems to be a
   healthy level of discussion about project direction on the mailing lists.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP
standards.

## Issues:
 There are currently no issues requiring board attention.

## Activity:
 - Two releases (2.4.32, 2.4.33) were made in this quarter.
 - The project is working towards leveraging github for bugs/feature requests
 - Discussions on revamping/restructuring the QA/test framework are ongoing
 - The latest releases and gotchas found there have led to an ongoing
   discussion around release procedures and versioning.
 - We are looking into expanding community outreach and adoption of httpd
   through various vendor-neutral marketing pushes. Among them are plans to
   start a monthly newsletter to both inform about new features of httpd and
   combat elements of fear, uncertainty, and doubts about the project, its
   capabilities and its community as a whole.

## Health report:
 - The project is generally speaking very healthy. Commits in this reporting
   period were up almost 40%, and the number of active developers (22) were up
   around 10%. On emails and issues, we've had virtually no change in the
   number of active people, with roughly the same number of people joining and
   leaving. We've seen one new committer, Jim Riggs, and 10 new issue
   contributors.
 - On the email front, this quarter has been extremely busy compared to the
   previous one, as explained in detail in the last paragraph in this report.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 52 PMC members.
 - New PMC members:
    - Jim Riggs was added to the PMC on Thu Apr 12 2018
    - Frank Gingras was added to the PMC on Thu Feb 01 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 120 committers.
 - Jim Riggs was added as a committer on Fri Apr 06 2018

## Releases:

 - 2.4.32 was released on Wed Mar 14 2018
 - 2.4.33 was released on Sat Mar 24 2018


## Mailing list stats:
I wish to include the stats in this report, as they show a very positive
uptick in activity over the past quarter. This is primarily due to the 
discussions outlined in the activity paragraph, as well as increased
efforts on the development front:

- users@httpd.apache.org:
   - 2527 subscribers (down -15 in the last 3 months):
   - 452 emails sent to list (368 in previous quarter)

- dev@httpd.apache.org:
   - 832 subscribers (down -11 in the last 3 months):
   - 1099 emails sent to list (434 in previous quarter)

- bugs@httpd.apache.org:
   - 324 subscribers (down -4 in the last 3 months):
   - 738 emails sent to list (382 in previous quarter)

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Impala Project  [Jim Apple]

# Description:

Impala is a high-performance distributed SQL engine.

## Issues:

The PMC requested that Google, the owners of "IMPALA: Scalable Distributed
DeepRL in DMLab-30"[0], add a disclaimer acknowledging that the ASF owns the
Impala trademark. Google declined to do so.

We engaged with Mark Thomas, ASF's VP, Brand. He suggested we not pursue this
further. See [1] for details.

0: https://deepmind.com/blog/impala-scalable-distributed-deeprl-dmlab-30/

1: https://s.apache.org/impala-deeprl-rm

## Activity:

The previous three months had 248 patches to the master branch, while this
three-month period had 364. This pattern in the past was usually a result of a
slowdown during the US winter holiday months, and I expect that's true of this
uptick, as well.

Prominent work in the last three months includes:

 - Decimal support in Kudu tables
 - End-to-end compression of metadata
 - Support for LLVM 5
 - Support for Hadoop 3
 - Support for the ORC format

## Health report:

The project remains very active. Statistics pertaining to this are covered
above and below: more than 100 commits per month, more than 100 JIRAs resolved
per month, four new people added as PMC members or committers. We have
continued a release cadence of about once per quarter.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 26 PMC members.
 - New PMC members:
    - Philip Zeyliger was added to the PMC on Sun Apr 22 2018
    - Thomas Marshall was added to the PMC on Sun Feb 04 2018

## Committer base changes:

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [John D. Ament]

Incubator PMC report for May 2018

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 52 podlings undergoing incubation.  This was an extremely quiet month within the incubator, no changes in the PMC structure, no new podlings, one podling planning to graduate and only one release executed.  We do have two additional podlings planning graduation, but likely they will go next month (June).  There is work ongoing to replace the present chair.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - None

  People who left the IPMC:

  - None

* New Podlings

  - None

* Podlings that failed to report, expected next month

  - Gossip - report received extremely late, but had no mentor sign off.  Prior comments from mentor (P. Taylor Goetz) are retained:
        Reminders sent for both April and May reports. When I brought up 
        the possibility of retirement, several community members expressed interest
        in continuing incubation.
  - S2Graph - report received, but no mentor sign off

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - Traffic Control

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  April:

  - 2018-04-02 Apache ServiceComb Java_Chassis 1.0.0-m1

* IP Clearance



* Legal / Trademarks



* Infrastructure



* Miscellaneous

  - A discussion began recently about how to deal with absent mentors.  No concrete work, but it seems one call out is to check on a mentor's pulse to see if they are still supporting their podlings.

Druid

Druid is a high-performance, column-oriented, distributed data store.

Druid has been incubating since 2018-02-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Complete SGA for current sources and ICLAs for current committers.
 2. Move the source code and website to Apache infrastructure.
 3. Plan and execute our first Apache release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

- None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

- We have disabled posting on our pre-Apache development list.
- We have updated our pre-Apache community page (http://druid.io/community/) to
  include information about incubation.
- We have set up a placeholder site on https://druid.apache.org/.
- A healthy, constant flow of bug fixes, quality improvements and new features
  are still ongoing on https://github.com/druid-io/druid.

How has the project developed since the last report?

- Since the last report there have been 69 commits from 23 individuals.
- We have conducted a vote to put out a release candidate 0.12.1-rc1. This
  release candidate is being done outside the Incubator. We also anticipate the
  0.12.1 release to be done outside the Incubator.

     Comments: The "Initial setup" status is accurate because the SGA has
       not been completed yet. This is frustrating to all. Code is in github
       rather than ASF git, and Apache releases are not possible.
       Druid is functioning according to the Apache Way as much as they
       can, given these limitations.
       Druid has made its 2nd non-ASF patch release, with permission.
  [X](druid) P. Taylor Goetz
     Comments: SGA finally received. Hopefully druid will be able to do an Apache
       release soon.

     Comments: Activity levels remain very high. I am struggling to follow day

               challenges for me are:
               - no threading of github issue / pr mail makes it hard to follow
                 individual issues
               - users having different ASF and GitHub user names makes to hard to
                 follow who is a committer and who is not

Edgent

Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime
that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
    around the Edgent project.
 2. Attracting at least another independent committer/ppmc member.
 3. Finding further real world users of Edgent

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 Community participation, implying interest in Edgent, continues
 to be an issue.  One of the two active committer/PPMC members has
 retired at the end of February and the level of their continuing
 participation is has been significantly reduced since then. The second
 active committer was also very consumed with finishing his house-
 building, which is now finished. So we are hoping to see increased
 activity again.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 * An article on Apache Edgent has been published as cover-story in the
   German JavaSPEKTRUM magazine in March
   (https://bc-v3.pressmatrix.com/de/profiles/4967c6d5eae1/editions/138b1a28747149541fb0)
 * At the Techcamp.Hamburg in April we had one well attended talk about
    Apache Edgent
 * Total, we have 76 subscribers to our mailing list, an increase
   of 4 since the last report.
 * We have seen a new name on the list, which seems to be interested in
   contributing. Especially in the Kafka area. We are hoping to see more
   activity in the near future.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 * We have updated the Kafka module to the latest Kafka version
 * According to JIRA, 2 new issues were added and none were resolved
   in the last 90 days
 * 12 commits were made in the last 90 days.

Extracting all binaries out of code base is still in progress.  There is only one binary left. 
Internal developers from Twitter are working on this process.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The number of contributors to the project has increased from 82 to 87 since the last report.
  * A meetup was hosted at Twitter HQ in Sunnyvale, CA with approximately 80 in attendance


How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Development has been very active. 
  * Work is in progress to get all licensing headers in compliance with Apache 
  * Twitter has submitted a signed SGA, granting ownership of Heron to Apache
  * The repository has been moved from Twitter's github account to Apache git
  * The appropriate work has been completed for package renaming.  com.twitter has now been changed to org.apache
  * All of the binaries have been removed from the code base with the exception of Scribe.  Twitter developers are to finish this task.

     Comments: Heron has been somewhat slow in adopting Apache-style communication and practices. Hopefully
       a first Apache release will provide an opportunity to change that.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
Dave Fisher: I've been following the podling for many months. The podling is beginning to communicate better on the dev@ list. It took a long time to get the SGA from Twitter, but now that it is done. They are working towards the right way. They do need to have better asynchronous discussion and I've prompted for such on dev@.

PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to help make the web
faster by rewriting web pages to reduce latency and bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Work on ASF compliance with regard to the code base and website
     needs review.
  2. Create a first release
  3. Engage more active developers, expanding the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  One new pmc member/committer joined. There have been external contributions to 
  the code, but those have been mostly one-offs and not to the core product.
  We do see certain users committing to helping out others on the google group
  and github, some of them consistently for months now. 
  In terms of user engagement activity continues to be healthy.
  (lots of questions, some of which have been added to the FAQ).


How has the project developed since the last report?

  Changes with regard to ASF/incubator compliance for the code-base, 
  dependencies, and existing website have been made for mod_pagespeed.

  There have been non-trivial dependency upgrades to address platform
  compatibility issues.

  A bug fix for a relatively frequently reported issue is under review.

Date of last release:

  N/A

  A discussion on dev@ will be initiated to gauge consensus for spinning up 
  the release process based on the current code-base. The advantage is that
  doing so would make transitioning from Google- to ASF- signed releases
  low friction.

SDAP

SDAP is an integrated data analytic center for Big Science problems.

SDAP has been incubating since 2017-10-22.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Grow community
 2. Make formal SDAP (Incubating) releases
 3. Evangelize SDAP as an integrated data analytic center for Big Science problems

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

SDAP has been heavily advertised at/in tons of Earth Science 
technology forums. The SDAP community has plans to continue
in this thread with loads of activity booked over the summer 
including for example, a workshop at the forthcoming ESIP
Summer 2018 meeting in Tucson, AZ 
http://esipfed.org/meetings/upcoming-meetings/esip-summer-meeting-2018 

How has the project developed since the last report?

Development is being sustained with initial discussion of an initial 
Incubating release some time soon. The dev@ community has produced
documentation regarding release artifacts. The aim would be to have 
a release candidate ready within the next month or so.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

N/A

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

A discussion thread has begun on the retirement of the Slider podling.
There has not been much activity on the thread so far. Concern was
expressed that users who are unable to upgrade to Hadoop 3 will be
stuck without Slider support. A question was posed about whether an
additional release before retirement would help. Given the lack of
involvement on the thread, it is likely that a retirement vote will be 
held soon.

How has the community developed since the last report?

No new community development.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Two commits have been made since the last report. One improved Slider's
behavior in multi-homed environments and the other fixed a bug in how the
Slider agent kills processes.

Toree

Toree provides applications with a mechanism to interactively and remotely
access Apache Spark.

Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.More discussion and engagement on the mailing list as opposed to "gitter"
  3.Continue to make releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

* We have discussed couple times about inactive mentors, and we will
most likely start a process to replace those with new more available
ones so that we can get our release and graduate process more smoothly. 

How has the community developed since the last report?

* The community has been working on the 0.2.0 release,
and a new RC5 is undergoing vote.

How has the project developed since the last report?

* Regular cadence of community activity, more on the low to medium
size on the mailing lists. Having said that, lots of questions and
interactions are still happening in a very active fashion on the
"gitter chat community". I am particularly trying to make folks 
reach out via the mailing lists or JIRA, but without much success.

specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server
Technical Committee.

It provides a high-performance user profile and event tracking server.

Unomi has been incubating since 2015-10-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Keep a good pace of releases
  2. Improve communication around the project and improve project web site
  3. Expand the communities (both developers and end-users)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

None

How has the community developed since the last report?

We are seeing external contributors more active in both mailing list and
the issue tracker. We are also working on making sure to on-board by
swiftly answering questions and taking their needs into account while
encouraging them to contribute.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Version 1.3.0-incubating should be released soon, we are working on it
right now. It notable include upgrading a lot of frameworks (Apache Karaf
4, Apache CXF 3.1, and lots more). After that version we plan to work on
integrating the new CXS GraphQL API as well as work on some more
performance and scalability improvements.

On the communication side we plan to update the website to talk about the
support for GDPR features and better privacy integration, and one of our
PPMC members will talk about the project at ApacheCon NA.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

## Description:
 - jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
   Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification
   for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an
   implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR).

## Issues:
 - There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

## Activity:
 -  jUDDI - last release was 22 NOV 2017. Little development has taken place
    since then.

## Health report:
 - Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in
   all likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.
 - There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to
   potential security issues. There were no issues raised since the last
   report.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Alex O'Ree on Sun Mar 17 2013

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 7 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

## Releases:

 - Last release was 3.3.5 on Wed Nov 22 2017

## /dist/ errors: 14
 - These errors are for older versions of jUDDI in which a former PMC's gpg
   key expired. The key has been refreshed however the previous releases will
   probably not be resigned.

## Mailing list activity:


 - dev@juddi.apache.org:
    - 71 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 39 emails sent to list (50 in previous quarter)

 - user@juddi.apache.org:
    - 112 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):

   functionality improvements.
 - We are currently working on version 7.2.0 which will introduce support for
   auto-generated Swagger UI.  Release date should be in the next few weeks.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for efficiently storing and
processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========
We released 1.0.1, which fixes 49 critical issues. We also released 1.1.0, which
includes major features such as JBOD, delegation tokens, controller improvements, 
dynamic broker configs, improved consumption performance with a large number of 
partitions, and Kafka Streams API improvements. We are actively fixing critical
issues that have been reported since the release.

Community
===========
Lots of activities in the mailing list. We have 2665 subscribers in the user
mailing list, up 36 in the last 3 months. We have 1044 emails in the user
mailing list in the last 3 months, a bit less than the 1152 in the previous
cycle. We have 1143 subscribers in the dev mailing list, up 39 in the last 3
months. We have 2521 emails in the dev mailing list in the last 3 months, a bit 
less than the 2869 in the previous cycle.

We elected one new committer, Dong Lin on Mar. 28, 2018. We didn't elect any new
PMC member in this cycle. We last elected a new PMC member on Jan. 17, 2018.

Kafka Summit in London completed with more than 500 attendees.

Releases
===========
1.0.1 was released on Mar. 6, 2018.
1.1.0 was released on Mar. 29, 2018.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

Apache Kibble is a suite of tools for collecting, aggregating and visualizing
activity in software projects. http://kibble.apache.org/

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity and health

This quarter has, again, been very quiet. We had some interesting discussions
(at FOSDEM, in February) with organizations and open source projects that
expressed an interest both in using, and participating in, Kibble, however
there has been no followup from them. We intend to proactively reach back out
to them in the coming month to see what their plans are.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Rafael Weingärtner on Fri Dec 08 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 12 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Rafael Weingärtner at Sat Dec 09 2017

## Releases:

We have not yet made a release.

## Mailing list activity:

All of our lists have been silent in the last month, and moderately quiet for
the duration of the quarter. We suspect that this is because many of our
community members have had other thing pressing on their attention the last
few months, and that we will see a resurgence when those things abate.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Lucene.NET's development has come to a complete stand-still since
about six months by now. Not a single commit to the ASF repository has
happened. While there are a few PMC members around who send an
occasional emails, nobody seems to find the time to carry on
development.

When we asked on the dev list whether people were willing to
contribute only a few people indicated interest but said they wouldn't
find the time to contribute anyway.

Financial support has been offered to the project and directed to the
appropriate ASF channels
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENENET-601.

There are different opinions between PMC members whether Lucene.NET is
on its way into the Attic. The Attic has already been mentioned by one
PMC member on the dev list but we haven't openly discussed dissolving
the PMC and going to the Attic.

We'll be kicking of a public discussion about the future of the
project in the coming week. If we decide to go to the Attic then this
will have already been the first step according to

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Andrew Palumbo]

## Description:
Apache Mahout is an environment for quickly creating scalable performant machine learning applications.
  
## Issues: 
 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

Activity this quarter has been low. The team hit a larger blocker with a very ambitious multi-artifact release; while upgrading scala and spark versions shifting IP restrictions and life for an all volunteer team has made it difficult to get over this hump.  As well the the team, spread very thin in the past quarters, took on several other large tasks, leaving all overworked.  

The team has been considering plan for a release to become Spark 2.x/scala 2_11.x compliant:

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.10.0 release on
April 19, 2018.  The next major release is scheduled for August 30, 2018.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017.
We did not sign up any new committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the
lookout for new PMC members and committers.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been moderate to active this quarter.  Development has
included a number of long-running projects being finally reintegrated with trunk,
e.g. the initiative to provide explicit repository migration support.
Issues reported have been centered on the development of new connectors,
development currently being coordinated through the Google Summer of Code program.
I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.
In answer to the board's question whether we were aware that people could
use the lists.apache.org UI to communicate on our lists without having to sign up:
no, this was not something I was aware of, and I will be happy to advise people
who have singleton questions to use that feature.


Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache MetaModel Project  [Kasper Sørensen]

## Description: 
   Providing a common interface for discovery, exploration of metadata and 
   querying of different types of data sources. 
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - We've added a few new committers to the project.
 - The project is in a low activity period in terms of code/issues.
   
   
## Health report: 
 - We've been trying to promote people from casual committers to
   actual formal committer members. But it hasn't yet caused for any
         kind of increased activity it seems.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Metron Project  [Casey Stella]

## Description: 
Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order
to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis.  Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.
  
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 

We continued with healthy activity across the mailing lists including
a number of active discuss threads.

There were multiple talks given about Metron in Dataworks Summit Europe
in Berlin.  A number of our users seem to be in Europe, so it was quite
well attended.  It featured introductory talks and more advanced
streaming analytics features by vendors.  There was also a use-case talk
by a customer.  Additionally, prior to the conference there was a meetup
held and was very well attended.

We also have multiple talks by committers scheduled at the Dataworks
Summit San Jose in June.  These talks will be more technical and
architectural deep dives on our streaming analytics capabilities.
   
## Health report: 

Mailing list activity, conference submissions and ticket participation
indicates that we're continuing to grow and attract real users.  
Specifically, we performed substantial performance refactoring in
reaction to Metron being used in production in some larger companies.
This forced us to rearchitect some components to be simpler, which 
is a good sign.

Given this maturation and the active work to add support for new indices
(i.e. Apache Solr), we are at a cusp of a next release, I feel.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]
Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

Activity has slowed slightly since last quarter but remained mostly on par with what
we expect aside from an unusually quiet April. We voted on and released version
1.3.0 which included a number of key fixes, improvements, and new features for
the toolkit.

The vote for a new member mentioned in the previous quarter's report resulted
in us inviting a new person to become a committer and PMC member. Unfortunately,
he declined to join. That being said, he continues to contribute and we welcome his
contributions and hope that he will decide to join us in the future.

We continue to see occasional bursts of activity from new contributors
but they tend to leave as quickly as they arrived. Adding new blood to the
project is a constant goal for us. GSoC and internships offered by PMC
members provide the most consistent avenue for new contributors. We're continuing
to monitor activity given the occasional drop that we see and the overall
stagnation of PMC/Committer additions.

Issues for the board:
 None

When was the last committer or PMC member elected:
 - Ibrahim Jarif - 26 April 2016
 - Omkar Reddy - 20 January 2016

When was the last release:
 - 1.3.0 - 23 April 2018
 - 1.2.0 - 24 April 2017

   event will be held concurrently with HBaseCon (same day, same space). A
   subset of PMC members are presently finalizing talks which will be given at
   the event. https://phoenix.apache.org/phoenixcon-2018/

## Health report:
 - Overall the project is maintaining its healthy state. We have our strong
   core developers, a regular collection of users getting involved, new
   developers submitting fixes, and releases happening. PMC needs to evaluate
   contributors and committers for new committers and PMC members,
   respectively.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 25 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Sergey Soldatov on Mon Oct 02 2017

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Committer-activity is good, there is progress towards a 4.0.0 release,
   albeit the large piece of fixing a few severe issues in a "un-attic-ed"
   release of XMLBeans is still not finished yet. Despite this we are working
   on fully supporting Java 10+ due to some changes breaking our
   Zip-Bomb-protection. A number of bug-fixes and smaller enhancements were
   merged, quite a number of these were provided by non-committers via GitHub
   PullRequests.

## Health report:
 - There is constant discussion of bug reports/features via bugzilla and a
   number of requests which indicates that the popularity of Apache POI is
   still very good. Questions via email or on Stackoverflow usually get
   answers quickly.

   Bug influx decreased slightly and we could work off a few compared to last
   time, probably in part because it is now some time since a new release was
   published.

- Proton-C and its language bindings had their 0.21.0 and 0.22.0 releases,
  incorporating various bug fixes and improvements, and removing some
  deprecated bindings. The source tree has been reorganised to better
  accommodate its remaining contents, after these and earlier changes when
  proton-j was moved to its own independent repo. Work continues on fixing
  additional issues ahead of a 0.23.0 release.

- Proton-J saw releases 0.26.0 to 0.27.1 to incorporate various improvements
  and fixes useful to dependent client/broker/other components, and work
  continues on more.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:

- Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup search of network services.  Services may be implemented in a number of languages, while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at least), to allow proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:

No significant issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Interest in making Jini specifications programming language agnostic.

Release roadmap:

River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&  binary release)
River 3.2 - Input validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling&  safe ServiceRegistrar  lookup service.
River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

- Minimal activity at present on dev.
- Some recent commit activity, around modular build.

- Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and
     Gadget attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports
     IPv4 multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so
     authentication can occur prior to downloading service proxy's,
     this addresses a long standing security issue with service lookup
     while significantly improving performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal
     of support for insecure cyphers.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses
     classdepandjar, a bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
   * Updating the Jini specifications.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description: 
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Work continued on a few issues for the XML Security for Java project. A
   performance issue spotted by a user was fixed. An issue with including
   newline characters in BASE-64 encoded output was also fixed, which was
   causing interop problems with other stacks. 

   The single biggest chunk of work was in modifying the StAX-based XML
   Security implementation to work with MTOM-enabled web services. Finally,
   some work was done to get the current trunk code working with Java 10. A
   new 2.1.2 release with these fixes is expected in the next quarter.

   The XML Security for C++ library was also under active development over
   the last quarter.
   
## Health report: 
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC. Right now there are no obvious potential new committers for the
   project.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The
base of the SIS library is modelled according international standards
published jointly by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).


## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

The work submitted by a contributor last year (upgrade XML metadata from
legacy ISO 19139:2007 format to the new ISO 19115-3:2016 format) has
been integrated. This work impacts about 500 classes.

A Google Summer of Code student got her project accepted for this summer
[1]. She already did a project in 2016 (which has been integrated for
most parts), and her 2018 project builds on top of her 2016 work.

A talk has been accepted for ApacheCon in Montréal: "Which geospatial
API for the cloud?" [2]


## Health report:

The project is reported healthy according the Apache Committee Report
Helper.

  applications that wish to prioritize latency, faster UDFs in Python using
  data batching through Apache Arrow, images as a data type in the machine
  learning library, and various other new features.

- Work is under way to expand several of these new features in upcoming minor
  and major releases.

Trademarks:

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community is healthy and active. New features are being designed
  and developed, and bug reports are being handled. Our user support
  forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers regularly.

  Our last committer additions happened in October 2017:
    Pavel Lyalyakin who has been contributing to the project's website.
    Troy Curtis Jr who has been contributing to SVN's Python 3 bindings.

  We thank Johan Corveleyn and Mark Thomas for their behind-the-scenes
  assistance in dealing with code of conduct violations.

* Releases

  We have released Subversion 1.10.0 on April 13 2018.
  This release was accompanied by an ASF blog post:
  https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-announces31

  The current supported releases are 1.10.0 and 1.9.7.

  Several bug fixes for our stable release series have been proposed,
  New stable releases can be expected in the near future.

* Wiki Migrated

  Our Wiki was migrated from the ASF's old MoinMoin instance to the
  Confluence wiki on cwiki.apache.org. The migration took considerable
  effort to get right, preserving full history and as much of the 
  original layout as possible. The various conversion tweaks will be
  documented for ASF Infra so they can be reused for other interested
  projects. The old wiki pages will be edited to become redirects to the
  new pages, after which they can be made read-only.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiriccò]

## Description:

Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in
enterprise environments.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

CVE-2018-1322 and CVE-2018-1311 were successfully managed by the PMC, and led
to the 2.0.8 and 1.2.11 releases.

Andrea Patricelli (PMC member) was officially nominated mentor for the GSoC
2018 project based on SYNCOPE-1220.

Maintenance work (with feature addition) keeps going onto the 2_0_X branch and
will likely lead to 2.0.8 release. The code on master branch has reached a
point where it could effectively be released as 2.1.0: discussion around this
point need to start on the dev@.

## Health report:

Discussions about new features and improvements keep appearing and being
followed up in dev@.

Newcomers approach user@ and are getting supported by various members of the
community.

The numbers (ML subscribers and traffic) seem to support these trends.

## Description:
  Tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information lookup
  activities

## Issues:

  None

## Health report:

  A relatively quiet quarter, development wise.

  We continue to have more than adequate oversight, with two to three active
  committers, and two to four occasional committers.

## Development:

 - New tool created to gather board meeting statistics

 - A number of improvements were made to the board agenda tool, mostly
   reconciling secretary/chairman tasks, but also adapting to the new chair's
   meeting flow, provide templates for adding items to the agenda, and to
   treat separate discussion items as separate agenda items.

 - Safari and Microsoft Edge now support service workers by default, meaning
   that at this point all but IE users will be using Service Workers and
   ES2017, most notably improving page reload times.
