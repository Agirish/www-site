 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we prepared and are in process of running the Annual
       Mambers Meeting.  We are also preparing the 2019 budget.  The timing
       of the decisions that we have to make, coincident with the election of
       a new board and new members has created some stress among the
       officers, directors and membership.  That stress manifested in
       behaviours on members@ and board@ that were not what we expect of
       ourselves. I expect that we will do better moving forward.

       The usual themes were repeated in some of the report comments this
       month - remember to always include dates of most recent commmitter /
       PMC additions and releases, keep discussions that can be on the public
       dev list public, focus on helping new contributors earn merit so that
       they can be voted in as committers and committers to PMC members. This
       month, several projects were commmended and / or advised on handling
       of security issues.  A great resource for this is
       https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html.

       The Storm project submitted a very good report this month.  In the
       Activity and Health sections, there is good discussion of community
       health, practical problems that the community is dealing with, and
       actions taken.  The Axis report was also very good this month, showing
       continued progress restoring that community to a healthy and active
       state.

    B. President [Sam]

       Issues for the board:

         None this month.  Next month there will be a FY19 budget to be
         approved, and I will highlight the need to come to a decision on
         how to proceed with Fundraising.

       Overall

         Yet another month where income exceeds targets, and expenses are
         under budget.  And that is not including the Pineapple BTC donation.

         No major issues to report across operations.  Sally and Mark are
         actively working on issues related to companies not working with
         our trademark policy.  I'm confident that they both have matters
         under control and/or will ask for help if/when they need to do so.

       Fundraising

         The key line in the fundraising report is: "the ability for me to
         volunteer as VP Fundraising comes to an end".  Next month, I intend
         to recommend that the board fund this position for up to two years.
         I encourage any returning or new directors who may be inclined to
         reach a different conclusion to reach out directly to Tom, Sally,
         and Kevin for their perspective; either 1-on-1 or collectively as
         each of you see best.

         Sponsorship thanks page now includes targeted sponsors:
            https://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html

         Kevin attended events at GMU NSF / Smartcities, OSLS & Google UC
         Berkeley Tech Talk, and ISSA-NoVA.  Expenses and results are detailed
         in the Fundraising report.

       Brand Management

         The transition from Shane to Mark has gone smoothly, as expected.
         Mark has established a new issue tracking process and reviewed
         emails dating back to June 2017.  Currently there are 25 issues,
         and all are awaiting action from (P)PMC, external parties etc. to
         progress them.

         Mark is requesting input on the content and level of detail provided
         in his report.  I'm very happy with the report.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first Ten
       months of FY18.

       Operating Cash as of Feb 28th, 2018 was $1,804.6K, which is up $11.2K
       from last month’s ending balance (Jan 18) of $1,793.4K.  As a
       majority of the Pineapple Donation was collected in Feb 18 ($695.6K)
       this has been segregated as non-operating funds at this point until
       the Board makes decision as to how to permanently record it.  Total
       Cash as of Feb 28th, 2018 is $2,500.2K. The Feb 2018 Operating cash
       balance is up $382.2K from the Feb 17 month end balance of $1,476.4K
       (and $1,023.8K in total cash compared to Feb 17, due to the $695.6K
       Pineapple Donation amount collected).  The Feb 2018 ending Operating
       cash balance of $1,804.6K represents an Operating cash reserve of 16
       months based on the FY18 conservative Cash forecast average monthly
       spending of $112.6K/month. The ASF reserve continues to be very
       healthy for an organization of ASF’ s size, with a conservative FY18
       YE estimate of 15.9 months of Operating cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong and
       favorable showing as compared to our FY18 budget through ten months
       of FY18, however as I will continue to mention, because we are on a
       cash basis, the timing of Sponsor payments received (including
       multi-year sponsors) and Payables released plays a big part in how
       well we perform financially month to month and year over year.  This
       month we were over the FY 18 budget for Revenue (Timing of estimated
       sponsor payments were under but offset by a large annual donation
       that was budgeted to be received in Mar 2018 offset the sponsorship
       timing issue).  The Foundation was also under the FY18 budget in
       Expenses as well for February.  As I have mentioned in previous
       months we want to continue to focus on our new Sponsors, but we also
       cannot take away any focus from our existing sponsors as that was how
       the FY18 budget was constructed.  If anything, the Fundraising effort
       will become one of the most critical functions within the Foundation
       especially with the upward trend in expenses noted in the 5-year plan
       as the Foundation continues to grow each year.  Any significant
       disruption in the momentum that the Fundraising efforts have gained
       in the last year, puts achieving the results noted in the 5-year plan
       (that was voted in last month) in serious jeopardy, which will result
       in the Foundation not continuing to grow as planned. The Fundraising
       team continues to do an excellent job in both areas, servicing both
       new and existing Sponsors.  With total actual Revenue, as of Feb
       28th, 2018, of $1,308.6K (up $97K from Jan 18 and up $615.9K from Feb
       2017), we are 106.7% of the way to our Total Revenue budget of
       $1,226.5K for FY18, with two months of FY18 remaining.  Regarding
       Sponsor revenue, we have received in the first ten months of FY18,
       $1,143.6K, (up $18K from Jan 18 and up $579.1K from Feb 17) which has
       us at 105.5% for YTD, exceeding the budgeted Sponsor revenue goal of
       $1,084K for FY18.  This is a great accomplishment as we still have 2
       months left of FY 18 and we have exceeded our Sponsorship goal by
       $59.6K (and we are estimating another $310K+ to come in between Mar
       and Apr 18).  As for the remaining revenue categories, we have
       received $164.9K against a total budget of $142.5K or 1.16% of our FY
       budget with 2 months left of FY18 (due to the timing of a large,
       annual, one-time donation, which was budgeted to be received in Mar
       18).

       YTD expenses, through Feb 28th, 2018 are under budget by $110.6K. 
       All depts., for the first time in FY18, are under budget. We will
       continue to monitor the actual vs budget as we move through the
       remaining 2 months of FY18.  As we finish up Mar 2018, I will be in
       contact with the dept. heads, to make sure, as we are on a cash
       basis, that any FY18 expenses are accounted for in FY18 and do not
       carry over to FY19.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $286.9K NI vs a budgeted negative <$394.2K> NI or $681.1K
       ahead of the FY 18 Budget for Net Income ten months into the FY. 
       With the current conservative forecasted revenue, and expenses for
       the remainder of FY 18, we are now estimating, at the Fiscal year
       end, a positive $276.6K NI vs a budgeted NI loss of -$167.8K or about
       a $444.4K better NI than the FY18 budget.  This is attributable to a
       combination of additional revenue and lower than budgeted expenses
       for FY18 ($400.8K more in revenue and $43.6K in lower expenses based
       on our conservative forecast).  I would also like to point out that
       YTD 18 NI vs YTD 17 NI we are $615.9K ahead in Revenue while Expenses
       were $35.9K higher year over year, for a $580K increase in NI year
       over year ($281.3K positive NI in FY18 vs <-$298.7K> NI in FY 17). 
       Again, I want to congratulate the entire Foundation on these very
       positive Operating results now that we are ten months into FY 18 and
       coming down the home stretch for the remainder of FY18.  It does
       truly take a team effort to achieve these types of results.  Now that
       we see what can be achieved by all our efforts, we do need to
       continue to keep these efforts up as we move through the remainder of
       FY 18, and into FY19.  We need to continue to provide Fundraising all
       the support and resources we can, to continue with the traction that
       has been created with in the last year, while keeping an eye on our
       expenses at the same time.   We should also recognize that the
       Foundation as compared to not only its FY18 budget but also to FY 17
       actuals, is in “an extremely good place” by all measures and we
       should all be very proud of that fact, as we finish out FY 18 and
       enter FY19.

       The Cash Basis Audit has been completed, and the ASF came through it
       with flying colors, as we knew it would, receiving the highest rating
       possible, that being an Unqualified opinion from the Auditors.  
       Everyone should be very proud of this result for the Foundation’s
       first ever Independent Audit.  Also, the 990 for FY17 was signed by
       the Treasurer, submitted and accepted by the IRS well in advance of
       the 3.15.18 due date.  So, the Foundation is not only on very solid
       financial footing but has been audited, for the first time,  and has
       filed all of its required compliance returns, both State and Federal
       for FY17.  One last item is the transfer of $1,500K of the
       Foundations funds has been successfully transferred to CDARS, as the
       assistant Treasurer had noted during the last Board meeting.  This is
       a CD “laddering” option that is administered by banks accredited by
       the Treasury and is now fully insured by the FDIC which was not the
       case when the deposits were in Citizens as the FDIC only insures up
       to $205K per tax id number.  Moving the Pineapple donation into the
       CDAR system will begin in the next month or so.

       Asst Treasurer's Report:

       - [IMPORTANT] Identified an operational concern caused by unclear
          budgets for items crossing over fiscal years coupled with a lack
          of signatory limits that presents a risk for the foundation.  To
          be clear, the issue at hand is that the status quo allows officers
          to sign contracts in excess of their budgets because of a
          precedent to use estimated net amounts for budget authority.

       The solution I recommend is that the board is three fold:

       1) be more specific on budget limits that look at the maximum,
       worst-case scenario risk not the net.  As a specific example, this
       means that the VP of Conferences has a spending budget of 100K Net
       with a Maximum Risk Authority of 250K covering the events in CALENDAR
       year 2018 (not Fiscal Year).

       2) expressly discuss during budget discussions that some expenditures
       will be across FY and that VP is authorized to act in this manner.
       Specific Example, we are looking to execute agreements for ApacheCon
       2019.

       3) require the treasurer’s agreement before committing the foundation
       for any amounts over $5,000 (or that person’s credit card authority
       whichever is greater).  This adds a similar oversight to what exists
       right now when sending actual money but applies to contracts,
       purchase orders, etc..

       Additionally, more clarity is needed for future years especially for
       roles involving large sums of money and future events which is
       primarily going to be our Events.

       See this email for my initial report on the matter:
       https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/af95e4303d2b7801a1d2da3f4841133b33b4583b8494da98859cac1b@%3Cboard.apache.org%3E

       Money Market - Interest income has been estimated conservatively.
       This is an estimate based on market conditions that we cannot
       influence. See below for the exact method used for the estimation.
       Total Income      $14,400 USD

       Expenses Finance, Accounting and HQ services $40,200 The ASF is using
       Virtual for our services at a cost of $3350/mth. Paid Expense
       Solution $1,500 The ASF is using some paid solutions to streamline
       processes and protect data confidentiality.  This includes services
       such as bill.com, dropbox (currently in use), Expensify, etc. CPA
       Financial review / Audit $0 The Audit Is anticipated to be done every
       3 years.  Last done for FY17.  Skipping FY18 and FY19 for an audit in
       FY20. CPA 990 Preparation $4,500 The ASF files a United States IRS
       tax return for non-profits called a 990.  This is the anticipated
       budget to prepare and file this form.  We will work to reduce this to
       $2500 with another vendor. Total Expense $46,200 USD

       Total (Expenses - Income) $31,800 USD

       - I've converted the BTC to $892,881.67 USD after bank fees and value
         loss due to the volatility of the BTC.  As of today, March 17,BTC
         is at 8271.  Upon donation, it was ~11,300.

       - Filed 3rd quarter report for Treasurer and working on the annual
         members meeting report

       - 990 filing for the FY ending Apr 2017 is completed and e-filed.

       - First audit completed with unqualified status for records through
         FY ending Apr 2017 (that’s good).  Next audit scheduled for FY2020.

       - I have handled the PackT royalties and expect it to be annoying
         ongoing.  They now have my personal account having refused to send
         the money any longer to a “business account”.

       - Previously Reported Items Still Tracking w/Nothing to Report

       Have not tested transferwise.com, pending a contractor’s help
       testing.

       Contribution Language for Car Donations - No update.  Not a high
       priority.

       Need still to get contracts for Virtual, Hopsie & HALO confirmed and
       in ASF SVN or drive.

       Quickbooks Backups - Need to ping Virtual and check on progress for
       this.

       Documenting payment privacy changes is still in KAM’s court.

       There is consensus that the budget should include both the
       expected expense as well as offsetting expected revenue. This
       will be reflected in the budget that will be discussed next
       month.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Matt Sicker has volunteered to help secretary, and has already been
       responsible for filing two dozen incoming documents. Please see
       Discussion item 8B to discuss appointing Matt to Assistant Secretary.

       In February 73  ICLAS, three CCLAs, and two grants were received and
       filed.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       No issues to report. For the most part it's business as usually, two
       items of particular interest are:

       Progress being made on a self service infrastructure (Apache
       Infrastructure Management, AIM). This will free infra team members to
       focus on non-standard requests and issues.

       Some analysis of our usage of Travis is providing valuable data to
       help with capacity planning in the future.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       VP M&P is actively engaging with a company engaged with one of our
       high profile projects that is having some difficulties working within
       our trademark policy. The main focus of her work is to educate the
       company on what is and is not acceptable use of our marks.

       Otherwise business as usual.

       Conferences
       ===========

       Apache EU Roadshow program is published -
       https://apachecon.com/euroadshow18/

       Apache North America CFP is open and going well. Two keynotes have
       been announced. Details at http://apachecon.com/acna18/

       TAC
       ===

       Applications for ApacheCon NA applications are open (closing May 1st).
       Judges have started reviewing. It's great to see TAC being on track
       again. Well done team.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Review /board/policies page for use

       We have a simple yet comprehensive single page list of all services
       available to PMCs, and policies required of PMCs by the board. The
       board should agree to remove the DRAFT markers and use this page to
       help improve board<->PMC shared expectations.
       https://www.apache.org/board/policies

       @Shane: discuss this proposal on board@ for the next board to take up.

    B. Appoint Matt Sicker to the position of Assistant Secretary

       Matt has volunteered to help Secretary, and since early March, has been
       filing incoming documents. Craig would like the board to formally
       recognize his contributions by appointing him Assistant Secretary,
       replacing Sam Ruby. Thanks to Sam for his dedicated service in this role.

       The board appoints Matt Sicker to Assistant Secretary, relieving Sam
       Ruby.

    * Ted: Discuss state of development with PMC; encourage on-list development
          [ Tajo 2017-06-21 ]
          Status: I have had off-list discussions with Hunsik. There is a
                  considerable amount of chaebol politics that has inhibited a
                  number of committers from contributing back. He is working to
                  smooth that out. I have high uncertainty about whether he can
                  do that.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Mark Thomas]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.


* OPERATIONS

The transition of the role of VP Brand from Shane Curcuru to Mark Thomas
is complete.

The new GSuite based issue tracking process (modelled after the process
used by the Security Team) is up and running and working well so far.
All mail to trademarks@ dating back to 1 June 2017 has been loaded into
GSuite and has been reviewed for outstanding issues. Out of ~270 threads
since then there are ~25 current issues. All of these are up to date and
are waiting on action from (P)PMC, external parties etc. to progress them.

An overdue invoice (we had no record of the original) was identified and
paid. Contact details were clarified and subsequent invoices have been
received correctly.

David Fisher (wave) has joined the Brand Management committee.

Jukka Zitting (jukka) and Upayavira (upayavira) resigned from the Brand
Management committee.

I've noticed a more than expected level of off-list communication from
both inside and outside the foundation. Nearly all of it belongs on list
and I am re-directing it to the relevant list as it arrives.

As this is my first report as VP Brand, I'd welcome feedback on the
content and level of detail provided.


* REGISTRATIONS

A letter of understanding has been signed with the Eclipse Foundation
allowing Eclipse to use the name Jakarta EE as the new name for Java EE.

The OpenOffice PMC have reviewed their existing trademark registrations
and proposed a plan for future registrations and renewals. This is a
very welcome action and the plan is now under discussion.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

- Overall fundraising continues well with sponsorship exceeding targets for
  the entire year without considering the additional $892K from Pineapple.

- The Sponsor Thanks Page with targeted sponsors is now launched
  https://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html

- Switched the BTC Donation wallet to a Coinbase wallet on apache.org.  No
  longer using the old wallet.

- As the ability for me to volunteer as VP Fundraising comes to an end, I
  have submitted a proposal to the board to continue in a paid role while at
  the same time working to make sure the G Suite team drive is highly
  organized and things are well documented.  Additionally, moderation for the
  fundraising & fundraising-private are now moderated by a group (thanks to
  Mark Thomas).

- Apache Roadshow DC is shaping up nicely:
  https://docs.google.com/spr  eadsheets/d/1tzHt55CUEMs-r-PDdCEk0-N7mqyTe9Ty5W2jy_YnLfs/edit#gid=979328350
  Fundraising for our events is off to a nice start with an event contract
  created based on our sponsorship agreement and 4 sponsors with contracts in
  their inbox representing $52K if inked with many many more in the pipeline.

- targeted sponsorship for one sponsor is now $5k annual renewable + $60 per year for 3
  years, renewable after 24 months.

- On behalf of ASF, I attended a GMU NSF / Smartcities event to identify
  potential sponsors and review the space for the DC Rodshow.  Total costs: 55.97.  

- Also attended OSLS & Google UC Berkeley Tech Talk to talk with the Linux
  Foundation, identify potential sponsors, and talk to current sponsors. 
  Costs $2,343.73
The next event was a Tech Talk at Google.  Overall a good event.  I spoke to
quite a number of people about sponsoring the AC

At Berkeley and OSLS, was able to support the International Women's Day.  No more
bracelets left and I think they were a big hit.

- I am now out of all of the red do IT like a girl bracelets with the last 50
  shipped to support the United Women in Cyber which I will attend on the
  29th as well on behalf of the ASF

- Attended ISSA-NoVA Monthly meeting to ask them to advertise our events,
  identify possible sponsors and discuss the CFP.  Will be pitching two
  recruiters to sponsor and ISSA-NOVA will share our event with their
  members. Costs: 49.13.

- Filed 3rd quarter report for Fundraising and working on the annual members
  meeting report

- Minimum donation implemented (I think it’s $5 or $10) with Hopsie to slow
  down the abuse and small charges with exorbitant fees.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - March 2018

I. Budget: we have submitted our budget for the upcoming the fiscal year.
Standing, and/or mult-year contracts with press release distribution, media
clipping, and projects analytics services have been renewed to avoid
interruption in service, and will be invoiced in FY2019. We are projected to
remain on budget and on schedule through the remainder of the fiscal year. The
quarterly report for Q3 FY2018 is underway and will be published shortly.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: work with ASF Fundraising continues. We published
"Success at Apache" twice to accommodate a lag in production at the beginning
 of the year; they are: "A Newbie's Narrative" https://s.apache.org/A72H and
"Contributing to Open Source even with a high-pressure job"
 https://s.apache.org/lM9O. Sally Khudairi has been helping ApacheCon on
 promoting the event. She is also once again counseling a specific vendor
 involved with a highly-visible Apache project in the Big Data space regarding
 their repeat offenses regarding established ASF publicity, outreach, and
 branding guidelines. Sally initially brought the issue to the project's PMC
 and worked with the vendor's marketing and PR teams with specific instruction
 in May 2016.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

  - 12 February 2018 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
    CloudStack® v4.11

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 191 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 28 items, and have 46.7K followers on
Twitter. We posted 7 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 40.4K organic
impressions in total.

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to
announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are
requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice
for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 5 media queries. The ASF 3,200 received
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,682. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 7,185 press hits vs. last month's 3,846. ApacheCon received
23 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received three analyst queries. Apache was
mentioned in 27 reports by Gartner (including 6 Magic Quadrant reports:
Identity Governance and Administration {Apache Syncope}, Data Management
Solutions for Analytics {Apache HBase, Impala, and Kudu}, Data Science and
Machine-Learning Platforms {Apache Spark}, Managed Security Services,
Worldwide, Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms, and Data and
Analytics Service Providers, Worldwide, ): no reports by Forrester, 11 reports
by 451 Research, and 5 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: no projects are in production.

IX. Events liaison: Sally continues work with ASF Conferences and ComDev
regarding upcoming Apache Community events and ApacheCon.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 7 pre-paid press releases remaining with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through 2018.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Finances
========
We have entered "budget season". Infrastructure has submitted its
first draft to the President for inclusion into a draft budget. That
draft will be presented to Members during our Annual Members Meeting
(starting March 20th), and later to the Board that will be elected
during that Meeting.

For Fiscal Year 18 (May 2017 to April 2018), the Infrastructure team
has managed its outlays and should end the year on-budget. We've
adjusted our FY19 request based on past-year actuals, and expected
growth in outlays corresponding to the Foundation's growth.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
* We have picked up some responsibilities for running Apache STeVe as
  the voter tool, used by the Foundation, for its Annual Meeting
* The feature for "searching of private ASF archives" is being
  removed, in favor of a longer-term solution focused around
  lists.apache.org. However, mail-search.apache.org still resides on
  old hardware and needs to be migrated before our expected timeframe
  for validating "full production" of lists.a.o. The browsing of
  private archives is in-process, and should be deployed shortly to
  mail-private.apache.org.

General Activity
================
* As part of our migration plan, mail-archives.apache.org has been
  moved to a brand new VM (rather than ASF-owned metal). The site has
  been reviewed, verified, and switched over to the new VM. This is
  just one part of our overall migration process, and upgrading the
  many systems involved in our mail handling, but a very necessary
  part that is now behind us.
* We have been continuing work on ASF users being able to "self serve"
  their needs. Over the past month, we've improved the ability for
  Incubator Members be able to request new respositories, mailing
  lists, and other resource for their podlings. Another facility was
  added to assist with recovering from problems in website updates.
* Using some of the Travis CI APIs, and working with their support
  team, we have been able to analyze our usage of running builds,
  their concurrency, and queueing of builds. This will help us to
  review our capacity planning, and determine growth needs around our
  projects' use of Travis.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Over the last month, much progress has been made on all currently-active
events. That is, ApacheCon North America 2018, the Apache EU Roadshow, and the
proposed DC Roadshow.

The schedule for the EU Roadshow has been published, and this event is paid
for and ready to go. Sharan has handled everything about that event. I (Rich)
anticipate that I will be on-site for that event, but I am still sorting out
details. Details of this event are at https://apachecon.com/euroadshow18/

The CFP for the North America event is going well. Sponsorship and other
planning items are progressing smoothly. Two keynotes have been announced, and
two others are in discussion. Details of this event are at
http://apachecon.com/acna18/

Please join the planners@apachecon.com mailing list if you wish to help,
volunteer, or be better informed. Archives of that list are, of course,
available on lists.apache.org


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

After the initial ramp up and getting applications open, we are now in a quiet
period. Applications are coming in steadily and at least two judges are
starting to score them as they come in. In a week or so we'll send out another
reminder to committers and PMCs.

Applications close on May 1st - at which time the judges will get together and
compare scores etc.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

Despite my original intention to step down, I had a change of heart
and desire to continue as VP, Legal for the near future. I will be
looking over the next 6-12 months for an appropriate candidate if
one emerges to train in the role so there is a smooth transition
when the time is right. Thanks to those who sent words of encouragement
to continue on.

Not a busy month but there were a handful of issues to report on.
In LEGAL-363 [1] we are disussing the use of CC-BY-4.0 HTML and CSS
in Example code. Discussions are ongoing, but based on precedent
this will likely be disallowed.

A question surrounding ASF, copyleft and container images, includes
ongoing discussion about the ability for projects to publish
"official" Apache container releases. Guidance from Legal at this
point is that the ASF only releases source code, and our policy
officially covers that. However, the ASF does allow for binary or
"convenience" artifacts, as unofficial artifacts released by the
PMC. It would seem that Docker containers fall into this area, and
so Legal is unlikely to provide any specific approvals, etc., and
we do not see this as outside of the existing approach to dealing
with binary / convenience artifacts. Guidance was provided to check
with infra regarding the ability to publish to DockerHub.

The committee answered a question regarding an external project
already licensed under the ALv2 and whether it made sense to a)
fork the project; and b) if so, bring the project into the ASF via
the Incubator. Legal committee recommended that the upstream project
determine the situation surrounding the copyright for the existing
code first before continuing the discussion surrounding Apache
incubation. The resolution was provided in LEGAL-367 [2].

Discussion is ongoing in reference to the inclusion of documentation
produced by the Open Grid Forum (OGF) within an Apache project. The
documentation is licensed using the OGF license. The discussion in
LEGAL-369 [3] led to the creation of LEGAL-372 [4] in which their
is a request to categorize the OGF license. That classification is
critical to determine how to proceed in LEGAL-369.

One of our podlings requested a definitive ruling regarding the
necssity of including a list of 3rd party dependencies accompanying
software grants from upstream IP holders. Legal does not believe
these are required, though in the recent past, a company did provide
such a list along with a grant, and Legal saw no problem with its
inclusion. However, the ASF secretary and the podling mentors for
the project in question do not believe that the list is a requirement
- and Legal agrees. The discussion is close to resolution in LEGAL-374
[5].

Finally, a question was quickly answered regarding the use of Jetty
in Apache projects in LEGAL-375 [6].

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues and helping projects clean
up the backlog of old issues and outstanding CVE names.  Meanwhile we
continue being responsive to new security@ emails, with all issues
recently handled by next working day (and most within hours).

* 2018-03-01 there were 117 open issues across 58 projects with median
  ages 84 days (2018-02-01 there were 142 open issues across 59
  projects with median age 89 days).  (Around a dozen are github
  dependancies that mostly will have no security consequence)

* 2018-03-01 there are only 3 CVE not yet in Mitre CVE database from
  before Apache became a CNA in 2017.  This is down from 133 when we
  started the cleanup on 2017-05-09.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis2 Board Report, March 2018

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary
components (both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

- Axis2 Java 1.7.7 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Axis2 Java 1.8 (development)

- Axis2 C 1.7 (development)

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still actively maintained. We continue to receive patches from various new users/contributors.

Axis2 Java put out several releases in 2017. Lately the focus has been responding to mailing list questions and Jira issues concerning end users automated 
penetration testing by various 3rd party tools.

Several email threads occurred with security@apache.org this past 30 days concerning Axis2 Java and also Axis Java 1.x (last release was 2006). Jira issues have been created (AXIS2-5910 , AXIS2-5911) , emails have been sent to the original sender, and internal discussions are in progress. 

Axis 1.x is likely to have a new release after all. RHEL 6 and 7 distribute it so its widely a problem at our day jobs. There are numerous security issues - several already fixed by community submitted patches and in SVN. An additional challenge for a release will be the migration off of the unsupported httpclient 3.x libs, to httpclient4.

Axis2 C added a new committer this past December 2017, and so far that is helping the project pick up speed. Possibly the Java team that knows C (myself for example) , could help get a release in motion. The Java team needs to get past the security issues first, then revisit how we can help the C team.  

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 30 days, last committer added was Bill Blough on December 7th 2017.
## Releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.7 was released on November 22, 2017.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## JIRA Activity

- 4 JIRA tickets created in the last month.
- 0 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last month.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Davor Bonaci]

## Description:

Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:

There are no issues that require the Board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

Apache Beam is now in its second year as a top-level project, and the
community continues to grow modestly.

In this quarter, the main technical focus continues to be on the portability
framework, and its adoption across all components of the project, which would,
among other benefits, extend the Python and Go SDKs to all Beam runners. A
sizeable portion of the community is working on this effort.

As usual, the project kept interconnecting additional execution engines and
data storage/messaging systems, and serves as a glue in the ecosystem. On the
execution side, runners for JStorm, Apache Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Samza and
Apache Tez are being prototyped in feature branches, but without too much
recent activity. On the IO connector side, the healthy growth continues, with
new connectors being contributed or improved month-over-month.

Seznam.cz decided to donate the Euphoria API to Apache Beam. Also, an SGA for
Google’s previous donation of the Go SDK is still pending. Both IP clearances
should complete by the next report.

Recent major community decisions include:
- Dropping Java 7 support, and requiring users to upgrade to Java 8.
- Dropping Apache Spark 1.6 support, and requiring users to upgrade to a Spark
  2.x cluster.
- Completely switching the build system to Gradle.

In this quarter, the community published two blog posts, one as a look-back at
2017 and one about the most recent release. Beam was featured at Strata Data
Conference San Jose 2017. Additionally, Google hosted a day-long Beam Summit
with solid participation.

Going forward, the main focus should be on the community growth, particularly
on the user side using non-proprietary engines. On the technical side, the
next major milestone is the completion of the portability framework across all
components of the project.

## Health report:

The community continues to grow steadily, as follows:
- Lifetime unique contributors grew to 245, with 30 new first-time
  contributors.
- Increased mailing list subscriber/activity.
- Increased JIRA activity.
- Contribution of new components into the project by external entities.
- Continued release cadence.

The overall health is solid, improving from a recent low, and is benefited by
addition of new community members with foundation membership and/or experience
in other projects.

## PMC changes:

Currently 18 PMC members. No new members have been added since the last
report. Last PMC addition was on Wed Nov 08 2017. We are watching several
potential candidates.

## Committer base changes:

Currently 31 committers. No new members have been added since the last report.
Last committer addition was on Wed Nov 08 2017.

There are clear candidates, probably five or so. I’m confident the PMC will
address this very quickly.

## Releases:

Since the last report, Apache Beam has published one release:
- 2.3.0 was released on Thu Feb 15 2018.

Version 2.0.0 was the first release that comes with API stability guarantees.
Going forward, we expect to publish a release every 2 months.

## Mailing list activity:

Mailing list subscriptions and activity continues to increase modestly. It is
worth noting that we saw an increase in frequency and depth of mailing list
discussions, as well as better participation and diversity of opinion compared
to last year.

- dev@beam.apache.org
  - 501 subscribers (up 28 in the last 3 months).
  - 1595 emails sent to list (1452 in previous quarter).

- user@beam.apache.org
  - 530 subscribers (up 36 in the last 3 months).
  - 503 emails sent to list (456 in previous quarter).

## JIRA activity:

Whereas JIRA activity was going down for a few quarters, it is great to report
that we’ve turned the trend back upwards.

- 507 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (449 in the previous quarter).
- 324 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months (171 in the previous
  quarter).

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Evans Ye]

## Description:

Apache Bigtop is a software related to a system for integration, packaging,
deployment and validation of a big data management software distribution based
on Apache Hadoop.

## Issues:

In reply to Board's comment on last report: We had to remove Kafka artifacts
because they violate ASF's policy to ban Facebook BSD+Patents license. The 
PMC had a discussion in [1]. There's also a Legal Jira[2] linked with it.

## Activity:

* The BoF at FOSDOM 2018 hosted by Olaf brought back a discussion to the 
community that Bigtop dev is slowing down. The community is reaching
out to ODPi[3] for comments.
* The community is mainly fixing issues after bumping up versions of supported 
Linux distros [4].

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

The project remains in a low activity mode although there have been
continuing discussions. Good progress has been made on infrastructure
related issues. There have also been recent discussions on a new core
component as a means to migrate away from using Trac as a backend.

See further information below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

The main progress since the last report has been an effort by John
Chambers to restore issue tracking to the project. Now this work has been
completed to a reasonable point. The linking to source control for repo
browsing has been changed to use the git repo instead of the main
subversion repository. This has the benefit that we do not need to rely
on continuing maintenance of some kind of local mirroring of an svn repo
which did not prove to be a robust solution before. One downside is that
old links to patchsets via their revision number are not expected to
work and we do not envisage using up any effort to fix this automatically.

There is a continuing need to raise activity in other areas. Discussions
up to the previous report gave some confidence that there was a community
with an interest in moving the project on and that they were willing to
consider the migration away from Trac to be viable. Since then, a further
proposal has been made to create a core project based on Django to
experiment with the basic data model for issue tracking. This resulted in
a moderate response but this has been seen by the project chair as excuse
enough to go ahead with the experiment.

Along the lines of suggestions in the last report, we will take the
opportunity to look into the use of git for source control. The ability of
our issue tracker to browse to such a git repo with relative ease makes
splitting new work out to a new repository straight forward. Opinions of
the community are currently being sought on this matter. This choice does
not block progress.

As expressed in the previous month, with some progress still in evidence
the PMC wish to repeat deferral of the proposal to move Apache Bloodhound
to the Attic for another three months. The PMC is aware that it will need
to continue to engage with the community for determining direction and
attempting to recognise contributors as potential PMC members at the
earliest opportunity.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description:

 A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
 JavaScript.

## Issues:

 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We had four platform releases - two patch release for Browser (5.0.2, 5.0.3),
one minor release for Android (7.1.0) and one major release for Windows
(6.0.0) The Android and Browser releases were just small bug fixes. The
Windows release now suppoorts the latest version of visual studio and does
Windows 10 builds by default.

We had many plugins gets released. Many of the releases needed second releases
due to issues with installing from npm due to us forgetting to update some
fields.

Cordova-cli@8.0.0 was also released. This was accompanied by releases in other
tools that the CLI is composed of. We took the release of this major version
to drop deprecated code.

## Health report:

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green.

We still have a huge backlog of GitHub Pull Request activity, again, same as
last quarter. Will keep chipping away.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Curator Project  [Jordan Zimmerman]

## Description:
- Apache Curator is a Java/JVM client library for Apache ZooKeeper, a
  distributed coordination service. It includes a highlevel API framework and
  utilities to make using Apache ZooKeeper much easier and more reliable. It
  also includes recipes for common use cases and extensions such as service
  discovery and a Java 8 asynchronous DSL.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - No important activity to report. We are responding to bug reports,
   questions as normal and we have fairly regular releases.

## Health report:
 - As we continue to mention, the project appears to be slowing down just as
   ZooKeeper seems to be slowing down. This is probably healthy for a project
   of Curator's age.
 - Apache Curator would benefit from one or more additional active committers
   but it's difficult to find these people.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache DRAT Project  [Chris Mattmann]

## Description:
- Apache DRAT is a distributed, parallelized (Map Reduce) wrapper around
  Apache RAT™ and other code auditing tools to allow it to complete on large
  code repositories of multiple file types.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- Philipp Ottlinger was elected to the DRAT PMC and as a committer
- The new DRAT website is up and going! http://drat.apache.org thanks to
  Nipurn, Shivika, Wayne, and Philipp for all the hard work
- there is increasing activity surrounding people trying to use DRAT with a
  lot of comments and potential bugs and issues to fix in various
  environments.
- Chris Mattmann registered for GSoC 2018 as a mentor and posted several
  issues in the DRAT Github and tagged them with gsoc and gsoc2018 labels
- one of the issues https://github.com/apache/drat/issues/113 already has
  interest


## Health report:
- Still want to turn our attention to getting a full ASF scan of DRAT over the
  Github/Gitbox repositories for ASF projects as a start.
- GSOC 2018 will help with attracting more contributors (already doing so in
  #113)

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- Philipp Ottlinger was added to the DRAT PMC and as a committer on    
  2018-02-27

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 11 committers.
- Philipp Ottlinger was added to the DRAT PMC and as a committer on    
  2018-02-27

## Releases:

- Working towards a 1.0 release still. Hopefully in the next quarter.

## Mailing list activity:

- Mailing list subscriptions remain stable. There hasn't been as much mail
  sent (about half as much). I think folks just were focused on getting the
  website going, and I think the next step of running DRAT over all the ASF
  repos weekly will generate a lot of traffic. Also I think making a first
  release will also do that. Finally GSOC 2018 will likely generate more
  mailing list traffic as well.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Eagle Project  [Edward Zhang]

## Description:
 - Apache Eagle is an open source analytics solution for identifying security
   and performance issues instantly on big data platforms.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - In recent months, seems more users started to try Apache Eagle 0.5.0
   release version. And users also reported some issues with starting Eagle
   with command line and other usability issues. Community has solved those
   issues.

## Health report:
 - We see some new users trying out Eagle and some of users can submit PR for
   some fix, but seems we still need volunteers to do some small fixes quickly
   to help community.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The Flink community is in the final phase of the 1.5 release, with the
    release branch being forked and final tests and bug fixes happening.

  - The 1.5 release marks a major rework of Flink, to make its design more
    natural for idiomatic use with containers (specifically Kubernetes) and more
    dynamic resource environments, but at the same time retain the current
    integration with Yarn, Mesos, and standalone setups.
    Aside from that, the release improves latency, checkpoints, recovery time,
    and extends streaming SQL and the DataStream API, among other things.

  - The Flink Forward San Francisco conference will happen in three weeks.
    Flink committers were offered a free pass.
    The program can be found under https://sf-2018.flink-forward.org/conference/

  - Concerning the note in the previous board report, the Huawei
    CloudStream website now uses Apache Flink, rather than only
    Flink (accessed March 15th)
    https://www.huaweicloud.com/en-us/product/cs.html

COMMUNITY

No new PMC members were added since the last report.
The newest PMC member is Chesnay Schepler, joined on July 26th, 2017

Committers added since the last board report:
  - Eron Wright was added as a committer on January 17th, 2018

Flink currently has 35 committers and 19 PMC members.

  - 1.4.1 was released on February 15th, 2018
  - 1.4.2 was released on March 8th, 2018
  - 1.3.3 was released on March 15th, 2018
  - shaded-3.0 was released on February 28th, 2018

ACTIVITY ON JIRA / MAILING LISTS

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Guacamole Project  [Mike Jumper]

## Description:
 - Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway which supports
   standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH. We call it "clientless" because

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Several edge-case fixes related to keyboard behavior on specific platforms.
 - Recent attention and development on allowing redirected device names to be
   configurable.
 - Contributions of enhancements to guacenc's featureset from the community
   look promising.

## Health report:

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Two of the projects who still get notified by Gump build failures
indicated they still get useful results out of Gump, two others
indicated they no longer want to receive notifications.

No other changes compared to the last quarter.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The Apache POI project opted out of Gump.

We asked the five remaining projects who still would receive
notifications of build failures whether Gump was still useful for
them. The Apache Tomcat and Apache Forrest projects indicated they
really take value from it, while the XML Graphics Commons project told
us they'd no longer need Gump (and we've disabled notifications for
them).

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

AriaTosca

ARIA TOSCA project offers an easily consumable Software Development Kit(SDK)
and a Command Line Interface(CLI) to implement TOSCA(Topology and
Orchestration Specification of Cloud Applications) based solutions.

AriaTosca has been incubating since 2016-08-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community and enroll new committers.
  2. Have (more) frequent Release cycles to be compliant with the Apache Way.
  3. Grow the project’s contributions from existing community of contributors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

1. The project issued its third release (0.2.0) as far as the code is
   concerned.  Some considerable functionality has been added since the last
   release in addition to a growth in diversity of contributions.

How has the community developed since the last report?

* All project communication now takes place on either the mailing list or
  ASF's Slack, and is open for everybody.  We have worked hard to make this
  the normal operating mode of the community. There have been some hiccups,
  but in general the majority of discourse has taken place on the list.

 * Increased chatter on the mailing list including new subscribers who ask
   questions, make suggestions and are likely to become contributors
   themselves in the near future.

* Weekly grooming meetings are now attended by the majority of the community.
  This is not only a forum to review the weekly work items list, but also as a
  place for open discussion about issues, questions as well as for the
  community to get to better know each other.


How has the community developed since the last report?

Over the last 3 months we have seen a significant increase in contributions as
well as a few new contributors, particularly from the Ericsson contingent.


How has the project developed since the last report?

ARIA now has two new patches considerably extend the parser's
plugin/extensions

Website and documentation improvements for usability and to enhance new user
Usability in terms of “getting started” instructions

9 JIRA issues have been resolved since the last report.  Note that the
repository was locked for several weeks during this period due to release
process issues and learning curve.

We will be doing another release during this quarter.

The community has begun to undertake updating AriaTosca to support the Tosca
1.1 Simple YAML profile.


How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

Daffodil

Apache Daffodil is an implementation of the Data Format Description Language
(DFDL) used to convert between fixed format data and XML/JSON.

Daffodil has been incubating since 2017-08-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete first Apache release as an Incubator
  2. Broaden base of contributors and build the community (e.g. work with
  other Apache projects where Daffodil could provide extra functionality)
  3. Improve documentation on setting up a development environment to ease the
  addition of new developers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

- Outstanding legal issue regarding Open Grid Forum document inclusion in
  Daffodil (LEGAL-369)

How has the community developed since the last report?

- No new committers. However, we have had activity from a couple outside users
  on the mailing lists asking about Daffodil capabilities/usage

How has the project developed since the last report?

- All SGA/CLAs have been submitted (from Tresys, IBM, and NCSA), all code
  relicensed to ASF, and package namespace switched to org.apache.daffodil
- Development pace has continued without any notable issues
- The first release candidate was created in February 2018. However, bugs were
  found that required an rc2 release. Those issues were resolved, but issues
  related to the LICENSE and NOTICE files were raised in the rc2 release vote.
  This is expected to require an rc3 release, planned to start voting in early
  March.

Druid

Druid is a high-performance, column-oriented, distributed data store.

Druid has been incubating since 2018-02-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
 1. Migrate existing contributors and users to apache mailing lists.
 2. Move the source code and website to apache infrastructure.
 3. Plan and execute our first Apache release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?
* The team is working on the items on the Incubation Checklist.
* We’re working on moving the existing mailing lists, source code, github
  issues and website to Apache Infrastructure.
* In order to keep the project momentum up until the migration is complete we
  are continuing the development on existing druid repository.
* We are considering doing the 0.12.0 release before migrating source code to
  apache, since the IPMC has already voted for it and migrating infra to
  apache might take a while, and we don't want to block 0.12.0 on this
  migration.

How has the community developed since the last report?
* This is our first board report.

Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together on
the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both Hadoop
and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
In this project state the most important action to move towards
graduation is to create traction on the project again. So from my
point of view the list of actions is the following:

[X] Promote the project in social networks, blog entries and so forth
for getting interest again.
[X] Get a few active new users.
[X] Refresh the state of unattended issues reported for interested
users in the pass.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
Only to be informed about new users are willing to boosting up the
project again.

How has the community developed since the last report
The most relevant thing is the activation of mailing list again and a
few new users willing to participate.

How has the project developed since the last report.
The project has not evolved since the last report.

How does the podling rate their own maturity.

OpenWhisk  

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able to
execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) from
external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional logic
(Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST API-based
Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support packaging and
catalog services.  Additionally, it now provides options to host the platform
components as Docker containers on various Container Frameworks such as Mesos,
Kubernetes, and Compose.

 
OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  Establish process for source release (automation work ongoing here
  https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-release) Increase contributions
  to maintain all project repos. Kubernetes and Mesos deployments work and 
  integrations need improvement; comm, aware of lots of work being done in 
  (private and public) forks.

  Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
  of?

  - Issue backlog building on incubator-openwhisk has grown significantly;
    need to prioritize and work to reduce while advancing
    performance/security/deployment issues.
     - Trying to add more active Committers to augment those who have
      dropped off in their activity. A consistent hosted, staging
      environment would help repro. issues, as well as stage PRs to test
      fixes. It had been our intent to have Apache host our staging (and
      move it out of disparate private builds within various companies).
      However, INFRA indicates they only typically allocate 1 VM per
      project for use with demos and minor things.  They indicate that
      perhaps a corporate donation is in order (ala. Spark).
     - Goal: standup testing resources at Apache and utilize for public CI
      and performance testing of OpenWhisk on Kubernetes
     - See discussion here: OpenWhisk / Kubernetes proposed epics/action
      items/questions
     - No change in status since last quarterly report
  - Formal hand-off of OpenWhisk trademark/logo from IBM needs to be
    executed; need to identify process for this.
     - Discussion started w/ Apache legal via "legal-discuss" mailing list
      with subject "Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and logo".
     - No change in status since last quarterly report

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Mentor changes:
     - Felix Meschberger and Sergio Fernández have stepped down from being
      mentors with regrets.
     - Bertrand Delacretaz volunteered to become mentor to fill Felix' spot.
     - Jim Jagielski volunteered to become mentor to fill Sergio's spot.
  - dev mailing list usage has been relatively active
  - incubator-openwhisk Github stars: 2877 (+696 since last report)
  - incubator-openwhisk GitHub forks: 544 (+75 since last report)

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Emphasis on 3 areas have been featured since last report:
  - Release process
     - See incubator-openwhisk-release (code, tools, documentation), see
      demo (as of 2/28): YouTube
        - Lots of discussion and work on developing both a manual and
         automated (source code) release process for 12 openwhisk project
         repos. that constitute the project's platform and related tooling
         (i.e., version tied).
        - All steps in release process are described in repo's markdown
         that the comm. is working to complete
        - Checklists/Runbooks created for release managers to follow
        - Automation tested with signing/hashing as per Apache requirements
        - still working on assuring all Apache license/legal/notice/change
         files are present (perhaps automated as well) issues with RAT and
         TENTACLES tools documented, working to document our exception
         lists and policies and alternative tools to verify licenses when
         not supported by RAT
  - Security enhancements
     - Now encrypting "data-in-motion" by enabling SSL between Controllers,
      Kafka and Invokers.
  - Scalability / Performance
     - Controller now uses fully scalable impl. instead of active with "hot
      standby"; lots of testing/changes to validate as optional before
      moving to promote as default on dev. list.
     - Introduced new LoadBalancer plug-in that uses Horizontal sharding;
      evaluating making it the default as perf. tests indicate notable
      improvement in controller-invoker throughput under load.
     - Improved handling of Artifact Attachments as a separate artifact (for
      storage/update/deletion) and provide alternative implementations
      (other than CouchDB), primarily Object Storage services as targets.
     - Made ActivationId implementation leaner by adopting UUID (single
      string) versus an object that wraps a UUID.
  - Other Notable discussions/changes/issues/features:
     - Added support of Time-series DBs using Kamon Tag (e.g., OpenTSDB,
      Datadog)
     - Discussions on large (size) argument support in runtimes/impacts on
      performance/configurability.
     - Updated all tools/ubuntu-setup to support xenial and later Ubuntu
      releases.
     - Implementation of runtime for Go (GoLang) actions.  New contributor
      authored new Invoker runtime and tested with 3 possible impls. for
      performance before submitting for review.
     - Action Compositions now supported in Controller and demonstrated on
      Interchange call; more changes may be coming for Controller to enable
      parallel processing.
     - Added A Pull Request (PR) template (checklist) for all code
      submissions (incubator-openwhisk) to assure they are ready for review
      and get assigned correctly.
        - https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/pull/3386
     - Action time limits are now configurable.

PLC4X

PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable
logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.

PLC4X has been incubating since 2017-12-18.
Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building the community: The PPMC and committer group has a large
     percentage of codecentric employees, we have been recruiting people
     from other companies, but will have to continue these efforts for
     establishing a healthy Apache community.
  2. Onboarding of new committers: With PLC4X several people on the team
     are not very familiar with the Apache Way. We have started and will
     continue our efforts on this onboarding.
  3. Make our first release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

In order to get access to some of the specifications the ASF will eventually
have to become Members of some external foundations: OPC, EtherCat, Modbus …
these memberships usually have a free level, that allows us to use the
specifications but doesn’t result in any regular costs. We will have to discuss
these details with the ASF and the other foundations.
One of the external foundations (Profinet) doesn’t have a free membership. In
general, the CEO of the European branch of the Profinet Foundation has signaled
that it should be possible for the ASF to become a member and have an outside
company pay the membership fees, but we have to discuss the details (With them
as well as the ASF).

How has the community developed since the last report?

Christofer has invested most of his time in February spreading the word about
PLC4X.
A first POC has been created for the company “Kampf Schneid- und Wickeltechnik
GmbH & Co. KG”
Two articles for IoT Special editions of German tech magazines have been
submitted. The “JavaSPEKTURM – IoT Sonderheft” is scheduled for sale end or
March, the “iX – IoT Sonderheft” is scheduled later.
The university of Stuttgart has shown great interest in joining our effort, as
they had just started a project with a similar goal. Chris will continue
on-boarding efforts in March.
At this year’s AALE Conference in Cologne, Chris has talked to a lot of people
from different German universities. We’re hoping to get at least a hand full of
them on board too.
We have continuing our onboarding of new Apache committers (extended emails
with a lot of explanations on why we are doing things the way we are)
In the next few months we are expecting to spread the word and hopefully grow
the community due to the tech magazine articles as well as several talks on
different conferences.

How has the project developed since the last report?

The work on the RawSocket Netty transport which is a requirement to implement
protocols that are IP based, but are not TCP or UDP has continued and we are
currently waiting for infra to setup a dedicated Jenkins VM for our project so
we can enable the RawSocket releated tests.
We have finished a first version of the Beckhoff ADS driver, and are looking
forward to first tests with this.
The functionality of the S7 driver has improved due to experience collected
with the Kampf POC.
Next we are aiming to implement Modbus and OPC-UA protocols.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

We have a mix of new participants and experienced Apache people involved.
So far, the new participants have shown great willingness and success in
adopting the Apache Way.
However, we still need to continue:
the on-boarding
increasing the diversity of the team
Also, will we need to decide and establish all the processes involved in
releasing software at Apache

Pulsar

Pulsar is a highly scalable, low latency messaging platform running on
commodity hardware. It provides simple pub-sub semantics over topics,
guaranteed at-least-once delivery of messages, automatic cursor management for
subscribers, and cross-datacenter replication.

Pulsar has been incubating since 2017-06-01.

Two most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community with new Committers/PPMC members.
  2. Complete the Podling name search tasks

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community added 6 new contributors that submitted pull-requests which
  were merged into master.

  There has been a sharp increase in users approaching the team on the Slack
  channel with many questions on getting started, clarifications,
  troubleshooting. While developers use Slack for informal chatting, the
  predominant usage of Slack has be users support. We have created a tool to
  create daily email digests of the conversation and post it on dev@ and user@
  lists, to comply with ASF policy of. We are also extracting the most
  recurrent questions/answer from Slack and plan to add an FAQ section on the
  website, together with improving documentation in the areas that seemed more
  difficult to users.

  Project members from several companies have organized or participated in
  several meetups, presenting Pulsar's introductions, deep-dives and hands-on
  tutorial, including recorded podcasts. We have several scheduled talks on
  Pulsar at various conferences (such as Strata San Jose on March 8th).


How has the project developed since the last report?

  22 authors have pushed 536 commits to master in the last 3 months.

  The project has made the its third and fourth releases since joining the
  Apache Incubator (1.21.0-incubating on Dec 17th and 1.22.0-incubating on Mar
  6th). Project members are actively working on next milestone, 2.0 release
  that will include several new features including:
   * Topic compaction
   * Redesigned type-safe API with schema support
   * Lightweight compute support

  Overall, since December, 7 new PIPs (Pulsar Improvement Proposals) for major
  feature/changes, have been submitted to the wiki and discussed in the
  mailing list.

  Since the last report the number of weekly-active-users on the Slack channel
  has increased from 27 to 53.

clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop new
algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs).
It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on several DSPEs
such as Apache Storm, Apache Flink, and Apache Samza.

SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Enlarge the contributing community
  2. Have new companies and organizations using the Apache Samoa technology

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None

  3. First ASF release. (SkyWalking 5.0)
  3. Further ASF culture and processes.
  4. 5.x releases are stable for product, and have an open end user case, at least.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 Looking for input on how to develop/release our plugins that rely on GPL libraries, 
is making those plugins optional good enough?

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  Since new development on one of Slider's primary maven modules has
  moved to the hadoop-yarn-services-core module in Apache Hadoop,
  development of other Slider modules has also tailed off. The Slider
  community needs to decide whether we should retire the remaining
  Slider code or propose graduation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No additional issues.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Mailing list and commit activity have continued at a low rate. We invited
  a new committer / PPMC member, Kyungwan Nam.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  An improvement to allow Slider to work in multi-homed environments is
  in progress and we have fixed a couple of bugs related to certificate
  management and functional test failures when running on newer versions
  of Hadoop.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
The podling is relatively mature, but activity is low.

  While there has been an uptick in development activity recently, and the
  contributor is a new PPMC member, the podling PPMC as a group is not moving
  towards graduation.

  Reiterating my comments from December: I am worried that pushing through

  I have been quite impressed by the uptick since New Year, which shows how just
  a bit of PMC engagement can give lots of follow-on activitity. I would hope
  Taverna can continue this move out of the "risk of retire" zone, but that
  requires more PMC members to chip in now and then.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

Report from the Apache Jackrabbit committee [Michael Dürig]

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained. 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding  
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 

## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
 maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are 
 continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

 Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
 the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
 driven by dependencies from Oak. 

 This quarter saw the 5th major release of Jackrabbit Oak (1.8). With 
 Oak 1.8 out the team is currently discussing future topics including 
 supporting other persistence back ends, adapting to upcoming Java 
 versions and how to support older Java versions while maintaining 
 backward compatibility without losing the ability to invent.

 A potential security vulnerability was reported to us by the Apache
 Security Team on Dec. 25th. See https://s.apache.org/7l6s. After careful
 evaluation and consideration with the reporter no exploitable issue was 
 identified. See https://s.apache.org/R3Ke. Nevertheless the affected code 
 was improved to avoid a potential future vulnerability through reuse of 
 that code in another context. See OAK-7119.
   
## Health report: 
   The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
   mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

   There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
   lists as well as on the various Jira issues. 

   Turn around on Jira issues is on the lower end this quarter. It is 
   expected to rise again once feature work on the next release picks up.
   
## PMC changes: 
 - Currently 50 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Robert Munteanu on Mon May 22 2017

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description

Apache Labs exists to incubate small and emerging projects from ASF
committers.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Labs has had a quiet period. Largely because PMC Chair has had a new job to
  settle into and the ASF Members meeting is coming up.

- We still haven't managed to get any volunteers to spin up a lab, but I have
  had some ideas for other ways in which labs could be of use and I will
  develop those in the next period.

## Health report:

- Labs is quiet, but while there are still avenues to explore for how it might
  benefit the community and generate some interaction I will persist in
  following them up

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Jan Iversen on Tue Feb 04 2014

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Adrien Grand]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
- There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The 7.x branch is very active and receives many bug fixes and incremental
   improvements like soft deletes (Lucene), more stream evaluators and
   improvements to the existing learning-to-rank support (Solr) or OpenNLP
   integration (both).
 - The master branch (future 8.0) mostly diverges from 7.x by improvements to
   scoring and to the execution of top-k queries sorted by score.
 - Both user and dev mailing-lists are very active.
 - Discussions are generally flowing in a good shape.
 - We produced 3 releases since the last report.
 - We had a discussion around test failures which were getting ignored[1],
   which resulted in a deeper analysis of test failures in order to try to
   finally fix those failures[2].
 - We receive vulnerability reports on a regular basis, but for one of them
   we requested a CVE more than 1 year ago and haven't been able to fix it
   yet[3][4]. We made it a priority and will try to more quickly act on
   vulnerability reports in the future.
 - We agreed to ask for reviews more systematically in order to improve code
   quality[5], but without requiring reviews for code to be committed, trusting
   everybody's judgment to figure out when a change absolutely requires review.
 - In order to keep Java 8 as a minimum version requirement while taking
   advantage of Java 9's new APIs like Arrays.mismatch, we now package a
   multi-release JAR.[6]

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    In this period of reporting, A new major improvement has been added to 
    Mnemonic codebase that helps the developer to remove the boilerplates
    that are required to use durable classes with generic types.
    Usually a custom factory proxy must be defined for each of durable
    type if that is a generic type, right now, just need to instantiate a
    helper class with 1 line code instead of 27 lines code;
    this improvement makes code less error-prone and more concise.
    With the support of some members of PMC, we may have a chance to run
    Mnemonic on cutting edge server platform equipping with very large
    volumn of non-volatile memory device. I think this may help us to
    study the system and identify the gaps for durable models if any.
    We also have fixed a major bug that may impact the user experience
    on Fedora 27.
    With the support of our community contributors, there are 2 conference
    that has accepted our Mnemonic related topics, one is NVMW2018 as poster
    and another is OSTS as presentation.
    The Mnemonic code has become stable again and is ready for next release,
    so the v0.11 might be released before next report.
    
Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public and no new users are appearing, but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 1 months.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 13 committers.
 - No new committer added since the last committer on Jan. 8, 2018.

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.10.0 on Mon Nov. 2017
 - Still active development on next major version (0.11.0)


JIRA Activity:
 - 13 JIRA tickets created since the last report (Feb. 2018)
 - Also 13 JIRA tickets closed/resolved this period

Sincerely,
Gang(Gary) Wang on behalf of the Apache Mnemonic PMC

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

## Description:
Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project

## Issues:
there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- the new release branch, named 17.12, was created in December 2017: once
  stabilized by back-porting bug fixes it will be the basis of the new
  releases
- vulnerability reports: a new report was received on 27/02/2018 but it was
  based on the output of a static code analysis tool and we suspect it may
  contain only false positives; we replied to the reporter to ask for
  additional details but so far we haven't received any response; apparently
  several other projects received similar reports from the same author and
  they have been advised by the Security Team to discard them; we will do the
  same if we do not get any further information from the reporter; apart from
  this, there are no other open tickets concerning security vulnerability
  reports
- the community started a documentation initiative; the goal is to move
  technical and user documentation into the repository where it will be
  maintained along with the codebase; after several discussions an initial
  proof of concept was done; it is based on the Asciidoctor Gradle plugin and
  generates PDF and html output formats; in parallel we asked for volunteers
  from the community [5] to become part of an OFBiz documentation team that
  would help review existing documentation and create content for the new
  documentation framework; the 20 people currently in the documentation team
  are made up of a mix of experienced and new contributors; a Skype call was
  organised to kickstart the effort and notes from the call were posted to the
  mailing list [6]
- we continue to monitor for any brand or trademark violations
- various bug fixes and enhancements have been contributed and committed to
  the trunk
- as usual, more details about the community activities are published in the
  official blog [1], on Twitter [2] and other social media [3]; our public
  HipChat room [4] has seen low activity

## Health report:
while the committer and PMC base didn't change in the last quarter, the PMC is
in the process of inviting a new PMC member that will be announced in the next
report; as usual, the PMC is monitoring and discussing new candidates for the
PMC and the committers' groups; the community is active: a new release has
been published and the stabilization of the new release branch is in progress;
the documentation effort has generated a lot of activity and also helped
identify and engage new contributors.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description: 
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.
   
## Olingo Status
Olingo has no issues that would require board attention.
There has not been much activity since the January board report.
The Oasis specification is still not released and there have been no
requests for a new release in the old code lines. So no releases have been
built within the last 3 months.

Mails on the dev or user mailing list focus mostly on usage questions.

## Activity: 
 Activity is fine. OWB core gets a few maintenance improvements.
 We also probably gonna ship another CDI-1.2 (OWB-1.7.x) maintenance release.
 Meecrowave is also doing fine. Got a lot of attraction lately.
 Mark Struberg presented Meecrowave and TomEE at the JavaLand Conference.
 We are currently evaluating the use of the OWASP maven plugin to check
 for CVE vulnerabilities. If it works out then the next step would be
 to check whether this could be provided via the apache-parent pom 
 for other projects as well.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Lee Whitcomb]

Description:
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
   features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
   Java platform.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    The long-awaited 2.1 release is closer than ever -- at least two big
    refactoring projects for this release are done, and a host of other,
    smaller changes have been made.  Expectations are now that we will be
    able to release this next quarter.  A new user has recently gotten
    Pivot to work with NetReXX, which is a very interesting development.
    The project builds and runs with JDK 9, although no "modularization"
    has taken place yet.  There has been a lot of "commit" traffic from
    the new development, and a larger number both of new JIRA tickets,
    but also JIRA tickets fixed this quarter.

Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    and a new user appeared.  Development on the next version is very
    active.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 4 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
 - Last PMC re-addition was Niclas Hedhman on Wed Jan 13 2016.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 9 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago

Releases:
 - Last release was 2.0.5 on Mon Jul 3 2017
 - Still active development on next major version (2.1)

Mailing List Activity:
 - All mailing list activity (except private@) is up this quarter, although
   subscribers are down a bit. Note: these stats for last quarter are the
   same as the previous report, but differ from the "reporter" app --
   probably because of timing differences for the "quarter".

 - dev@pivot.apache.org
    - 61 subscribers (unchanged from last report)
    - 270 emails sent to list (143 in previous quarter)

 - user@pivot.apache.org
    - 170 subscribers (down two from last report)
    - 15 emails sent to list (1 in previous quarter)

 - commits@pivot.apache.org
    - 19 subscribers (down -1 from last time)
    - 151 emails this quarter (vs. 91 in last quarter)

 - private@pivot.apache.org
    - 12 subscribers (unchanged from last quarter)
    - Just a few emails this quarter also

JIRA Activity:
 - 16 JIRA tickets created this quarter
 - Also 15 JIRA tickets closed/resolved this period

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Polygene Project  [Paul Merlin]

Description:
Apache Polygene is a community based effort exploring Composite
Oriented Programming for domain centric application development.

Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at the moment.

Activity: 
Activity is slow. A lot is due to individual contributors busy with
their own businesses. We have a remarkable high degree of entrepreneurs in our
mix, and we seem to be busy putting Polygene 3.0 to work. The planned 3.1
release has been postponed and probably not coming in the next quarter either,
for above mentioned reasons. In January we made one Polygene presentation at
Alibaba in Hangzhou.

Health report: 
Community health continues to struggle, but as long as there is
interest and enough active PMC members, we will continue.

PMC changes:
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Stanislav Muhametsin on Mon Jun 12 2017

Committer base changes:
 - Currently 18 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago

Releases:
 - Last release was 3.0.0 on Wed Jul 26 2017

Mailing list activity: 
Mailing list activity is a little bit down, but that is
expected from the lesser dev activity in general.

 - dev@polygene.apache.org:
    - 38 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 58 emails sent to list (104 in previous quarter)

JIRA activity:
 - 7 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 0 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
 - The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
   software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
   to underlying platform-specific implementations.  There are three
   sub-projects: APR, APR-UTIL and APR-ICONV, of which the first two
   are the main focus of developer interest.
   
## Issues: 
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.             
   
## Activity: 
 - This has been a quiet period in a stable project with a slow but
   comfortable life cycle.  Activity has been low.
   
## Health report: 
 - Following a new release and a followup release for errata in 2017,
   it is to be expected that activity should fall back.  The underlying
   condition of the project remains quiet but healthy.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 41 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Evgeny Kotkov on Tue Sep 12 2017

 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Evgeny Kotkov at Wed Sep 13 2017 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - None in the period.  Last release was a joint release of
   APR-1.6.3, APR-UTIL-1.6.1 and APR-ICONV-1.2.2 in October 2017.
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - The subscriber base remains stable.  Activity is sharply down
   as described above.
   
 - dev@apr.apache.org:  
    - 335 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 59 emails sent to list (164 in previous quarter)

- Our ASDoc (ActionScript Doc just like JavaDoc) also went live.  It is a
  (almost) production Royale app.
- The ASDoc is indexed by Google, something that Flex apps had a hard time
  doing, so another reason for Flex users to migrate to Royale.
- One PMC member is working hard on the default look-and-feel for Royale apps.
- The compiler was extended to be able to report on API usage in order to
  understand what Flex dependencies Flex apps might have when migrating.
- Several people are investigating Royale as a way to break their Flex app's
  dependencies on Flash.  One user claims to be about 4 bugs short of
  finishing his migration.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

2018 March - Board report for Apache Shiro

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- Last release was 1.4.0 on 05-May-2017

Community & Project:

- Mailing list traffic has returned to normal (after a lull around the
holidays last quarter). StackOverflow remains a popular alternative
for the user list.

- Feature development is planned to continue against master.

- OSGI support is a popular feature, we get an occasional one-liner
patch. However, we do NOT have a committer with sufficient experience,
which makes supporting it difficult.

- The 1.4.0 Release has been a step toward modernizing Shiro as well
as retain backwards compatibility

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for March 2018

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

This has been another good quarter for the project.

We added one new committer and had one committer join the PMC.

Our mass-check system is running smoothly.

The users, dev, and sysadmins mailing lists have been active and healthy.

We had one member of the PMC volunteer to be a mentor and have a project
proposal for GSoC 2018. We have posted a call for applicants.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.1 on 30 April 2015.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

In last quarterly report we said that we were resuming work on a version 3.4.2
after having put it aside to complete an update of the mass-check system
infrastructure. Our expectation that we would complete the release in January
proved to be overly optimistic. We have been making steady progress on closing
the issues that are targeted for 3.4.2, with some increase in participation by
committers. Our current hope is to have a release by mid-June.

We have previously said that this should be the last release of the 3.4 branch
before moving on with work towards 4.0, but a future 3.4.3 release is now
looking more likely in the balance of priorities to get 3.4.2 released.

Committer/PMC changes:

One new committer this quarter:

Giovanni Bechis (gbechis) 15 February 2018

One new PMC member this quarter:

Bill Cole (billcole) 5 March 2018

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description:
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:
 - The Storm PMC has an ongoing discussion and effort to expand and diversify
   the PMC and committership. There are currently 4 candidates under
   consideration and/or vote.
 - The community has decided to reduce the number of active/supported version
   lines to 3 (currently 1.2.x, 1.1.x, and 1.0.x) and has updated the downoad
   page and cleaned up dist.a.o accordingly.
 - The community hopes to release a beta version 2.0 soon now that the 1.2.x
   release line has been introduced.
 - For our 1.2.0 release, an LGPL binary dependency was inadvertently
   included. The issue was quickly noticed and fixed (by making the dependency
   optional), and 1.2.1 was released shortly thereafter. The 1.2.0 artifacts
   have been removed from distribution. I have reminded PMC members (including
   myself, as the source of the mistake ;) ) the importance dependency/license
   checking during release votes.

## Health report:
- Project activity continues to be fairly consistent, with periodic lulls and
  bursts in activity.
- New contributors continue to engage and that engagement tends to keep up
  activity levels, even as some contributors move on.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 35 PMC members.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Isuru Udana]

## Description:
Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight Enterprise Service
Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

## Issues:
 None identified.

## Activity:
After the Synapse 3.0.1 release, activity on the project has gone down in last
quarter. That is mainly because of all the active committers got busy on their
regular day to day work at the start of the year. Community is actively
responding to the security issues reported by the external people. But other
than that there wasn't much activity. We expect to get more contribution from
the community in Q2 as several people have expressed their interest in
contributing to the project. Plan is to get the next release done in Q2.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]

## Description:
 - A Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java WebSocket and Java
   Unified Expression language specifications implementation.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
-  Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
   responsiveness on both dev and user lists.
-  Given the timing of the EU roadshow, we decided not to run a Tomcat
   specific event in Frankfurt this Spring. Instead, we are running a
   training course in Manchester UK. The event is currently predicted to
   make a small (<$100) loss but there are still two weeks to go and one
   more ticket sale will mean the event generates a surplus. In any
   event, the current losses are more than offset by the surplus
   generated from the previous event.
-  In support of the training course we have started to produce ALv2
   licensed training material. The long term aim is to create a large
   number of modules that may then be combined into courses as required.
-  We have put together a day long Tomcat track for the ApacheCon EU
   Roadshow. We anticipate at least as much content, if not more, for
   ApacheCon NA.
 - Tomcat 9.0.4, the first stable release of the 9.0.x branch
   implementing Servlet 4.0 was released this period.
-  We continue to explore migrating from svn to git. The open issue /
   question list is reducing as we explore each issue and reach
   consensus on the way forward. Discussions continue on dev@.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 26 PMC members.
 - The last addition was Huxing Zhang on 2017-05-18.

   extended, the contributor went silent.

## Releases:
 - We continue on our roughly monthly release cadence for 9.0.x and
   8.5.x with the older versions releases once every 1-2 months.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]
The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release of the Xalan C/C++
library.

The libraries need little work to make sure the code base is operational
in the newer software development studios and platforms.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Most activity has been through JIRA issue tracking. The email lists
have seen little activity.

There has been some work to put patches into JIRA but we still need to get
the patches integrated into the XALAN-C for an update release.  The contributors
are active with other source projects and currently have little time to
devote on the Xalan C/C++ library.  There still is some activity devoted
to the Xalan Java library.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

The libraries need little work to make sure the code base is operational
in the newer software development studios and platforms.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

Since November, there were some minor improvements made for XML Schema 1.1 and
the documentation for that feature.

There was one individual who expressed an interest in helping with the
Xerces-J 2.12.0 release. It seemed like they were going to work with their
employer to get a CLA on file, but we have not heard back from them yet.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; roughly 100+ posts on the j-dev and
j-users lists since the beginning of November 2017.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-J
2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

Xerces-C 3.2.1 was released at the end of February which addresses a security
issue (CVE-2017-12627) and fixes some other bugs.

Mailing list traffic has been high; roughly 360+ posts on the c-dev and
c-users lists since the beginning of November 2017.

The latest release is Xerces-C 3.2.1 (February 28th, 2018).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity over the
reporting period.

XML Commons

No activity over the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in April 2017 (Xerces-C) and May 2017
(Xerces-J).

No new PMC members since the last report. The most recent addition to the PMC
was in June 2016.

Three committers have committed changes to SVN since November 2017.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Allen Wittenauer]



## Description:

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and release
processes for software projects.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

No new PMC members added in the last three months; our Last PMC addition was
Ajay Yadav on Thu Dec 01 2016.  There are currently 8 PMC members.

Akira Ajisaka was added as a committer on Tue Feb 06 2018.   There are
currently 12 committers.

Since the last report, version 0.7.0 was released with the resource related
changes. This release, however, was problematic in a few ways.  The ASF JIRA
upgrade broke patch precommit testing for a large number of projects.  After
getting changes in place, this required the project to "rush" a release to get
these other projects back to functional.  Unfortunately, this revealed that
the PMC's ability to get the necessary votes for a release promptly doesn't
appear to be realistic.  There has been some discussion in the past quarter to
rethink how we do releases to make this possible.

## Health report:

Activity is significantly down, despite reliance on the project being up. The
software itself is relatively stable, so that may be the reason why.

## Releases:

- 0.7.0 was released on Fri Jan 26 2018

## Mailing list activity:

- dev@yetus.apache.org:
  - 44 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):
  - 23 emails sent to list (67 in previous quarter)

- notifications@yetus.apache.org:
  - 16 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
  - 87 emails sent to list (445 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:

- 25 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 13 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Paiva Junqueira]

## Description: 

Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It enables
the implementation of a variety of primitives and mechanisms that are
critical for safety and liveness in distributed settings, e.g., 
distributed locks, master election, group membership, and configuration.
   
## Issues: 
 No issue requiring board attention
   
## Activity: 
 - Community is working towards releasing 3.5.4. There are currently 10
   listed blocker issues.
 - Release 3.4.11 had a regression and 3.4.12 is on the way, we are ready
   to cut a release candidate.
 - There has been questions and work in the security list around
   vulnerabilities, but there has been no disclosure in this period.  
   
## Health report: 
 The project activity is currently at a low. It has been fairly stable
 during the past year, but we are still suffering from the
 fact that a good chunk of the project committers are busy with other
 activities. Our goal has been to work with contributors to offer them
 committership to guarantee that we have a continuous flow of 
 contributions being merged.  
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 13 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Michael Han on Wed Jun 21 2017 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 22 committers. 
 - Abraham Fine was added as a committer on Tue Jan 30 2018 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 3.4.11 on Wed Nov 08 2017 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 There has been a 15% and 35% drop in the dev and user lists,
 respectively. This is significant and we attribute it to the
 fact that we haven’t had enough committer activity in the
 project during this period.  
   
 - dev@zookeeper.apache.org:  
    - 512 subscribers (down -9 in the last 3 months): 
    - 2052 emails sent to list (2426 in previous quarter) 
   
 - user@zookeeper.apache.org:  
    - 1236 subscribers (up 8 in the last 3 months): 
    - 77 emails sent to list (118 in previous quarter) 
   
   
## JIRA activity: 
   
 - 46 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
