 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       Feedback on project reports this month was generally very positive.
       All of the following reports were complimented for their completeness
       and/or concision:  Calcite, Carbon Data, Hbase, Mina, Nifi and Nutch.
       Constructive feedback from Directors followed some familiar themes,
       along with promoting some ideas developed in the Beam community.
       * Helping people progress along the path from contributor to committer
         to PMC member eases the pressure on committers and PMC members to
         review PRs and manage releases.
       * Beam suggestions on community development: https://s.apache.org/4rVt
       * Making sure that private discussions are moved to public lists
         unless they really have to be private.

       My personal focus this month was to continue studying non-profit
       finance, to begin planning for the update of the 5-year plan and
       continued work on organizing ASF policy documents.  I did not make the
       progess on the last two items that I had hoped.  Over the next month,
       I will put some materials in the Wiki for review and collaboration.

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall, expenditures are under budget, and income is too.  The latter
       is attributable to timing issues, which by now we are good at
       identifying with precision.  Still makes me nervous :-), but all signs
       are that we are still good.

       Brand Management remains under control with no board issues.

       Fundraising remains busy, again no board issues.

       Finance is off to a slow and deliberate start, with a meeting planned on
       Monday.  Given the miscommunication last month, I asked that no
       endowment discussions with potential sponsors be held until this board
       meeting.  Just so it is crystal clear: after today, I will be giving the
       green light to Daniel and Tom to have or approve discussions with
       potential sponsors with the explicit understanding that such discussions
       are limited in scope to refining and validating the content of a
       potential future proposal for the board review, currently targeted for
       September.  This approval specifically EXCLUDES solicitation of funds.

       Other things to be aware of: the team is working with legal affairs to
       determine how GDPR will be implemented by the ASF.  More details on this
       can be found in the Legal Affairs report.  Separately, a discussion is
       underway on operations@ on a proposed set of ASF wide expense
       guidelines.  A concrete proposal has been made, and there are a number
       of "red lines" on the document.  This work will continue, with no
       concrete target date yet for completion.  All ASF members and officers
       are welcome to participate.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.

       Virtual Report: 

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s Financial
       performance for the first two months of FY19;

       Operating Cash on June 30th, 2018 was $1,983.8K, which is down $15.2K
       from last month’s ending balance (May 18) of $1,999K.    Total Cash
       as of June 30th, 2018 is $3,376.7K (includes the Pineapple and
       restricted Donation). The June 2018 ending Operating cash balance of
       $1,983.8K represents an Operating cash reserve of 12.6 months based
       on the FY19 conservative Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $158K/month (which is roughly $55K/month higher than the FY18 avg
       monthly expense amount).  The ASF reserve continues to be very
       healthy for an organization of the ASF’ s size.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, the ASF, with regard to Income, was down
       both vs budget and vs FY18.  With regard to the Income vs Budget,
       YTD,  we are off $102.2K ($135.6K due mostly to timing of sponsor
       payments). This is the same issue when compared to FY18 where a
       couple of Platinum sponsor payments arrived in May vs April.   We are
       however ahead in Conference income, again based on timing which
       offsets some of the sponsorship variance. YTD expenses, through June
       30th, 2018 are under budget by $136.1K, with all depts being under
       budget.  Infra as noted in the Board summary is $53.8K under budget
       due to Timing of hiring of staff, timing of Travis CL bill and timing
       of Lease web invoices.  We have moved these expenses, as we have done
       with all the depts, as we are only two months into the new Fiscal
       year, forward in the Cash forecast and will review them next month at
       the end of the first fiscal quarter.  Expenses, as compared to YTD
       FY18 were $5.5K higher which is a very good measure at this point of
       the Fiscal year.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY 19 the ASF finished with a -
       <$54.2K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$88.1K> NI or $33.9K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the year.  This was
       attributable to timing of Sponsor payments offset by more
       underspending, vs the FY19 Budget,  as this is the only the second
       month of the Fiscal year, this type of result is not A-typical and we
       will continue to monitor it as we move into the last month of Q1
       FY19.

       In June, 60 ICLAs, two CCLAs, and two grants were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Mostly business as usual - some significant upgrades recently (Jenkins
       and Buildbot) and the migration of 1.1 million docs pages (Maven) off
       the deprecated CMS.

       GitHub integration has started to hit API rate limits. This will
       require some new mechanisms to reduce our calls.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Annual report published. Thank you all who contributed but special
       thanks to Sally for "herding the cats".

       Publication of promotional best practices to align with established
       ASF publicity, outreach, and branding guidelines is coming soon.

       Otherwise business as usual.

       Conferences
       ===========

       Currently 8 events in various stages of planning. This is testament to
       the hard work of VP Conferences and a small team of volunteers.
       However, such a volume only increases the need for volunteers to
       sustain it.

       The team have sought to define the names "Apache Road Show" and 
       "ApacheCon" in an attempt to clarify why we're doing different things
       around events, and to help planners, attendees, and sponsors to
       understand what we're doing. See https://s.apache.org/6OAU

       Details in the full report, but the events currently in the pipeline
       are:

       Apache Roadshow Europe 2018, Berlin - wrapping up ApacheCon North
       America 2018 - early bird pricing closes July 20th Apache Road Show,
       DC, 2018 - CFP due immenintetly Apache Road Show, Chicago, 2019 - Date
       and Venue to be confirmed ApacheCon EU 2019, Berlin - New Thinking
       proposal being finalized ApacheCon NA 2019 - site search is ongoing
       Seoul Event - discussions have dried up, may be shelved. BCN 2019
       Colocation/Road Show - proposal

       TAC
       ===

       Ramping up for ApacheCon NA. Currently processing paperwork for the 13
       recipients.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       Nothing to report but summer vacation!  Starting work on "How to
       better communicate with the board", whether via email, wiki, or
       wherever ideas this month.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - July 2018

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule. We have a small handful of vendor

processing shortly.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi completed the ASF Annual Report
and accompanying press release https://s.apache.org/VVyr . She continues
Sponsor ambassadorial outreach with Fundraising, and has successfully brought
Tencent onboard as a new Platinum-level Sponsor. She has been working with ASF
Conferences and Community Development on promoting official ASF events, as
well as the ASF’s participation in community events such as OSCON. She will

    2018 Fiscal Year

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 209 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 10 items, and have 48.9K followers on
Twitter. We posted 10 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 22.5K
organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: one announcement is in development. Projects planning

major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating normally, and there are no issues for the
President or the Board.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Jira will be upgraded to its latest release. We schedule these
  upgrades for about every six months, rather than attempt to track
  every upstream release.
- Our GitHub integration has been running into API rate limits. This
  will require some new mechanisms to reduce our calls.
- The team is going to investigate the new mod_md module for automated
  integratino of LetsEncrypt certificates. This will simplify
  certificate management on project VMs and will enable us to use LE
  on the main TLP servers.

General Activity
================
- Jenkins was upgraded to the latest LTS release, along with upgrades
  to the large number of plugins used by our projects. To assist with
  tracking before/after versions of the plugins, we've automated much
  of the reporting through the Jenkins API.
- Apache Maven moved off of the deprecated CMS system to a simple
  svnpubsub arrangment, with generation occurring through their own
  workflow. Maven was one of the largest users of the CMS (it has
  around 1.1 million pages), so this is a big step in the long path
  towards decommissioning the CMS.
- Buildbot was upgraded, including underlying upgrades to the
  operating system and our puppet scripts. Follow-on improvements to
  buildbot script management have improved this service for our projects.
- The team has begun making plans for ApacheCon in Montreal, to meet
  with the community and for our yearly team meetup.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

# Events/Conferences

There is a huge amount of activity right now around events, and an
increased need for volunteers to sustain all of it. We have people
stepping up for various events, which is very heartening.

As you can see from the list of headings in this report, we have 8 or
more events that are at some point in flight right now. One event is
over, but is still being wrapped up. One is less than 3 months away. The
rest are in various stages of planning.

We have updated the ApacheCon attendance spreadsheet - 
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/ApacheCon/attendance.ods
with the latest numbers that we have for all events, historically, as
this is something that producers frequently ask for. We do not have
financial information for most of our past events, due to varying
degrees of producer transparency.

Rich, VP Conferences, will be on vacation July 11th through 20th, and
will have limited/zero internet during that time, but will attempt to
attend the board meeting.

## Road Show vs ApacheCon definitions

The terms "Road Show" and "ApacheCon" have been being used for about a
year now, to refer to the different types of events that we are doing.
Rich attempted to give some clarity to how these terms should be used
correctly, to avoid confusion as to which is which. That definition is
stated on the ComDev mailing list: https://s.apache.org/6OAU

While the definitions allow for some ambiguity, it is hoped that this
will clarify why we're doing different things around events, and will
help planners, attendees, and sponsors to understand what we're doing.

## Apache Roadshow Europe 2018, Berlin, wrapup

The Apache Roadshow in Berlin is now a month behind us, and Sharan Foga
is still wrapping up some of the financials. We had approved a EU15k
budget for her, and we are coming in almost exactly that - EU14,800.

Full accounting for this event may be found in the event spreadsheet 
at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xqk-Y-Fys1gfRRmaomhDU6n0Ua-GtANBzK4vsf5VK7g/edit#gid=433313287

## ApacheCon North America 2018

The next milestone in the ACNA18 calendar is the end of earlybird
pricing, which happens on July 20th. At that time, general admission
rates go up by $250. Reminder messages have been sent to our committers
list, and to all dev@ and users@ mailing lists for all projects. This
typically results in a surge in ticket sales.

We have some early speaker dropouts, and will be digging in the fallback
list as soon as our sponsored sessions are all filled out.

## Apache Road Show, DC, 2018

We hope to have the web presence and CFP up for the Apache DC Road Show
up by the time of this meeting.

## Apache Road Show, Chicago, 2019

Trevor Grant will be leading the effort to put together an Apache Road
Show in Chicago, in 2019. Date and venue selection are the first order
of business.

## ApacheCon EU 2019, Berlin

We have an initial proposal from New Thinking to produce ApacheCon EU
2019 in Berlin, at the Kulturbrauerei - the same venue as the 2018 road
show. While many details still remain to be worked out, we are very
excited to be working with NT again.

## ApacheCon NA 2019, Site search

The site search for ApacheCon NA proceeds well. We received an initial
list of suggestions in San Francisco, which I rejected because the
"cheap" hotel rate was over $300, and this has been very poorly received
by our membership in the past. We redirected the search to San Diego.

I have received an initial response about San Diego, and have not yet
had a chance to review it. A phone call has been requested with Virtual
to discuss options, and I have not yet scheduled that, due to my
upcoming vacation time.

## Seoul Event

The conversations around a potential Seoul event in spring of 2019 have
gone silent. We request someone with interest in making that happen to
step up and engage with Edward Yoon.

## JBCN 2019 Colocation/Road Show

A road show, colacated with JBCNConf 2019 Barcelona -
see http://www.jbcnconf.com/2018/ for more information - has been
proposed. There are no details yet, but Ignasi Barrera has stepped up to
be lead on this event. A meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, July 10th, to
discuss general details. I will update this report after that meeting if
there's anything to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Things are busy now with the ramp up to ACNA - our 13 applicants are filling
out paperwork as needed and filing for Visas to Canada. As part of that, Visa
support letters have been sent to all applicants that need them. The Visa
letters are as per Canada guidelines and include flight and hotel booking
information. 
Therefore - yes, Hotel rooms are booked, flights are booked for all except one 
at time of writing. All applicants should have their Conference
passes also. One or two have queries with the Visa process but seems to be
going well otherwise. Myself and Chris Dutz have been on hand to answer any
queries. 
Treasurer sent 15K to our usual travel agent for the bulk cost of the
flights, one remaining flight will need to be topped up by credit card. So our
original estimate was quite close. 
Summary, things are busy, but on target, on time and running smoothly (touch wood).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

Hello everyone,  sorry for the delay in my report this month as it is
my first month as VP.  That said along with Kevin McGrail, will be
attending a call on Monday July 23rd, with the JCF to get more
familiar with their Endowment services.  I also had a call with the
AAF Wealth management group as I had noted on the previous board call
and they are preparing a proposal as the JCF has for review.  I have
also provided as noted on the lists a template of an Expense policy,
which people have made suggestions to. Other than that nothing else to
report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Adam Soroka (ajs6f@) has joined the "Art & Culture (Museums) On The Web"
Community Group.

The Foundation was already participating in this CG so no further commitment
to the W3C CG process was needed.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

The traditional legal questions are continuing to be answered on legal-discuss
primarily by members of the community and Legal Committee. These include
questions surrounding what licenses projects can use; how documentation can be
licensed, and so forth.

A big theme over the past month e.g., see LEGAL-383 [1] for an example, is to
have legal input on constructing a data privacy policy for GDPR. VP, Infra has
been involved and we are working with DLA piper and over the last week I
received a long set of privileged guidance that I need to share with VP, Infra
regarding the next steps to take in creating Apache's privacy policy.

What became clear is that the creation of such a policy both a) should not be
limited to GDPR, and likely applies to DCMA and other related privacy
concerns; b) the process is in its own right a separate body of work from
strictly legal concerns; and c) it makes sense to create an officer position
responsible for managing this in tracking with industry, academia, and other
non-profits where data privacy is a big deal. The result is a resolution for
Board consideration to create a separate VP, Data Privacy officer position
reporting to the Board to manage our strategy. Initially Chris, our current
VP, Legal is proposed to staff it, but a replacement will be recruited and
presented for consideration before the end of the CY.

In the meanwhile, Legal, Infra, and data privacy will work hand in hand to
deliver the ASF's policy in this area.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Michael Wall]

## Description:

 - The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
   scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
   access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
   Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper,
   and Thrift.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - There were 2 new releases, Accumulo 1.9.0 and Accumulo 1.9.1 since the last
   report.  The 1.9.0 release [1] had a critical bug in the Write Ahead Log
   (WAL) process that is fixed in 1.9.1 [2].

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It
specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat
and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern
hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy streaming
messaging and interprocess communication. Languages currently supported include
C, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Rust.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- We have not released since March as we work to improve our release and build
  automation. We plan to include binary artifacts in our next release vote,
  where we have only had source artifacts in past releases.
- We received a code donation of a Ruby interface via the usual IP Clearance
  process
- There is a new Arrow + LLVM analytics project (Gandiva) happening outside of
  the Arrow community. We discussed incorporating this work into Apache Arrow
  but have not made any decisions yet.

## Health report:

The project's user and contributor base is growing rapidly. We are struggling a
bit with maintainer bandwidth. As an example, 2 committers have merged 84% of
patches (where there have been nearly 2000) since the project's inception. We
are discussing ways to grow the maintainer base on the mailing list.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Henk P. Penning]

## Description:
PMC Attic is responsible for the oversight of projects
which otherwise would not have oversight.

## Issues:
No public issues

## Activity:
In may 2018, PMC Poi showed an interest in reviving the code
of (atticked) project XMLBeans. This triggered a long, confused,
complicated discussion involving PMC's Attic and Poi, and
(finally) Board. The whole thing started with the (premature,
unauthorised) unfreezing of the (canonical) XMLBeans code
base by infra, on PMC Poi's request.

Sofar, no project has ever moved from the Attic to an existing,
established PMC, so there was no cookbook.
For guidance, Attic is inclined to take a formal approach :
to look at ASF bylaws and offical policies.
Note that atticking a project involves a lot of dumb handwork,
which Attic wants to avoid and automate ; hence the formal approach.

The Attic-internal discussion was confusing because in speech
and (formal) documents, terms like PMC, Project, sub-project
and TLP are almost used interchangably.

In discussions with Poi, Board and infra, Attic's formal approach
was generally met with a "get out of the way", "JFDI" attitude.
Quick and dirty, ad-hoc solutions are ok ;
introducing exceptions isn't a "problem".

In the end, 4 items were identified where "re-use Xmlbeans" or
"create in Poi" [go POI] was possible:
https://mail-search.apache.org/members/private-arch/attic-private/201806.mbox/%3C1901870.K1nLqlVQl1%40giga%3E
-- source code: unfreeze of fork
-- dist area : /dist/xmlbeans/ or /dist/poi/xmlbeans/
-- groupId : org.apache.xmlbeans or org.apache.poi
-- web site : xmlbeans.a.o or poi.a.o/xmlbeans/
Directors' responses varied from JFDI, to "let POI decide", to "go POI".
By then, there was frustration and irritation, so the discussion was
actively stopped ; Attic just unatticked XMLbeans.

At the moment :
-- Poi uses the original xmlbeans code base [re-use]
-- Poi publishes releases in /dist/poi/xmlbeans/ [go POI]
-- Poi uses the xmlbeans groupId [re-use]
-- Poi maintains xmlbeans.a.o [re-use]

For the future :
-- Attic will use this result as a new option for "Process of
   leaving the Attic again".
-- A PMC that wants to take over an atticked project
   must ask the board's approval first.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Michael Mior]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and its
Avatica sub-project.

Avatica Go 3.0.0 was released late April with support for Avatica HSQLDB. This
is the first release of Avatica Go by the Apache Calcite project since the
code was donated. Avatica 1.12.0 was released late June. The next release of
Calcite is well underway and is expected to be completed in July.

We have continued to have a steady string of new committers and PMC members
with solid contributions. Alan Gates, an early mentor of the Calcite project
has resigned from the Calcite PMC, and is now an Emeritus PMC member. A paper
providing an overview of the Calcite project was presented by project members
at the SIGMOD 2018 conference. The talk was very well received and we hope to
continue publishing in the future.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description: 
 - Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
 and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop. 
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
 
## Activity: 
 - The only real activity this quarter was a few small changes to improve S3
 compatibility/reliability and an interesting discussion/debugging exercise
 on the user mailing list about an incompatibility between Crunch's Apache
 Spark runtime and the code for reading/writing Avro serialized data.
   
## Health report: 
 - I believe the overall state of the project reflects the overall state of
   open-source data engineering in general, i.e., a steady move away from
   MapReduce-based pipelines to running pipelines on top of modern engines
   like Spark or the generalized APIs of a system like Apache Beam. There
   simply isn't much interest (or much need) to extend Crunch's functionality
   as opposed to providing a smooth migration off of it and on to Spark or Beam.
   The only real exception to this is certain extremely large workloads that
   cannot move to Spark or Beam for whatever reason, and for those workloads,
   we should be making it easy (as the rest of the Hadoop community has) to
   run those jobs in either an on-premise cluster or on the cloud by not assuming
   that data will be stored in HDFS permanently.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description: Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: Activity this quarter centered around a few efforts:
Relatively quiet quarter.  I good chunk of time was spent around getting 3.2.5
released.  That required new versions of Santuario and WSS4J which took some
extra time due to a bunch of discussions/reviews on some changes there (all good).
Thus, the release was a bit delayed from expected.  

We've moved master from targeting 3.2.x patches to targeting 3.3.0.   The main 
thing we're attempting there is getting better support for Java 10/11/whatever
in place.   However, other big updates/changes are also being discussed.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Stefan Seelmann]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
 - ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
             written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
             compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
             Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
 - LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
             replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
             and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
             with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
             servers.
 - Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
             used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
             designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
             application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
 - Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
             role-based access control, delegated administration and
             password policy services with an LDAP backend.
 - Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
             various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
             and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
             interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
             facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
             as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
             and mobile.
 - Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
             (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.
 - SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification. (new)

## Issues:

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

General:

 - We had to deal with a vulnerability in LDAP API 1.0.0 which took
   quite some effort and slowed down other work.
 - We have a new sub-project SCIMple. It was accepted long time ago
   but paperwork took some time. It replaces eSCIMo which will be
   moved to attic.
 - Discussion about how to deal with Java 9/10/11

Per sub-project:

 - ApacheDS: low activity: Mainly updates due to changes in LDAP API. 
 - LDAP API: good activity: Release of 1.0.2 (security fix).
             Improvements in error logging and reporting. Preparation
             for first 2.0 release canditate was re-started.
 - Studio:   low activity: Mainly updates due to changes in LDAP API.
 - Fortress: good activity: Added support for HA and RFC2307 BIS.
             General dependency updates. Vote for 2.0.1 started.
 - Kerby:    good activity: More work on new "Hadoop Authentication
             Service" and some bugfixes. 1.1.1 was released and 
             2.0.0 release is planned.
 - Mavibot:  no activity
 - SCIMple:  good activity: Initial code import, IP clearance ongoing.

## Health report:

  Overall development activity (commits, development related mails,
  resolved issues, releases) was similar to previous quarter.

  In general there is good activity and release planning across
  all sub-projects.
  
  The PMC feels the project is still healthy.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Myrle Krantz]

## Description

Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues

PR backlog continues to grow including contributions from 2017 GSOC interns
and delays in moving towards a monthly release cycle for the 1.2 release and
beyond. There was little availability of PMC members to take on this burden so
a dedicated and funded individual is being supplied from the community to take
on these responsibilities.

## Activity

GSOC interns

4 interns are currently heads-down on their projects:

Dilpreet Singh of India is working on version 2 of the Fineract CN Mobile
Field Operations app including converting over to Kotlin, refactoring, and
adding in new features. Ebenezer Graham of Mauritius is working on a SMS/Email
microservice for Fineract CN Ruphine Kenge of Cameroon is implementing the
back-components for group management on Fineract CN Pembe Miriam of Cameroon
is implementing the web user interface for group-based lending and
microfinance services on Fineract CN. Newly selected committer, Aleksander
Vidakovic is configuring the Apache VM infrastructure for a public demo server
for Fineract CN - a request for additional infrastructure is being made to
Apache board.

Marketing: Myrle co-presented with Justin McLean on Fineract and the Incubator
at FOSS Backstage..  Myrle promoted Fineract via feathercast with many thanks
to Rich Bowen.

At least 5 members of the community will be in attendance at ApacheCon and two
talks including a keynote will be given. Talks are being prepared now.

Fineract CN APIs have been documented using Spring REST Docs by Isaac Kamga
and are temporarily available on
http://smartfinance.tech/fineract-cn-api-docs/.

## Health report

PR's backlog continues to be an issue.

activity of the quarter before that.

- 27 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 9 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Hive Project  [Ashutosh Chauhan]

## Description:
 - The Apache Hive (TM) data warehouse software facilitates querying and
   managing large datasets residing in distributed storage.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Alan Gates (PMC member) found a violation of our trademark and got in touch
   with project owner. Matter was resolved quickly as project owner agreed to
   make requested changes to comply with Apache policies.
 - Last quarter we reported about multiple security issues found in Hive. We
   released 2.3.3 this quarter addressing those issues.
 - Cloudera hosted User group meetup on May 9th. Event was well attended. In
   addition to short presentations, this time we also had a panel discussion
   on Metastore.
 - After an elongated discussion on dev@ project decided to adopt "Green Build
   policy" wherein it was agreed upon that no commits are permitted without
   getting +1 from automated patch testing. That has led to more discussion
   and subsequently improvements in robustness of unit tests and test
   infrastructure in project.
 - Work is underway to make storage-api 2.7.0 and Hive-3.1 releases.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 42 PMC members.
 - Naveen Gangam was added to the PMC on Thu Feb 22 2018

## Committer base changes:
 - Currently 77 committers.
 - New commmitters:
    - Marta Kuczora was added as a committer on Wed Jun 06 2018
    - Ádám Szita was added as a committer on Tue Jun 05 2018

## Releases:
 - 3.0.0 was released on Mon May 21 2018

Incubator PMC report for July 2018

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 52 podlings incubating. During the month of June,
podlings executed 6 distinct releases and there are several ongoing votes 
and releases for July.  We added no new IPMC members. No podlings are 
graduating this month but there's dicussion about HAWQ graduating, and
many are heading towards graduation. We had one project, AriaTosca,
retire to the attic. There were no IP clearances.

A number of podlings didn't report and that may be due to less reminders
sent out this month. The three podlings that failed to report last month
also failed to report this month. Two responded (Druid and Spot) to why
last month, but lack of activity and response from Pony Mail is concerning. 

Of note in June on the list there was discussions on
  - retirement and what to do with gitHub/gitbox repos
  - Gossip exiting the incubator

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - None

  People who left the IPMC:

  - None

* New Podlings

  - Doris

* Podlings that failed to report, expected next month
  
  - Airflow
  - Annotator
  - BatchEE
  - Druid
  - Gossip
  - Milagro
  - Pony Mail
  - S2Graph
  - SensSoft
  - Spot

* Graduations

  - None

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  June:
   - 2018/07/02 Goblin 0.12.0
   - 2018/06/22 Servicecomb 1.0
   - 2018/06/17 Pulsar 1.22.1
   - 2018/06/15 Singa 1.2.0
   - 2018/06/07 Traffic Control 2.2.0
   - 2018/06/05 Dubbo 2.6.2
   
  The Traffic Control release seems odd as they are a TLP.
  Seems to just be a timing issue as the vote was open before
  they become a TLP.

* IP Clearance

  None

* Legal / Trademarks

  None

* Infrastructure

  None

* Miscellaneous

  None

Amaterasu

Apache Amaterasu is a framework providing configuration management and 
deployment for Big Data Pipelines.

It provides the following capabilities:

Continuous integration tools to package pipelines and run tests.
A repository to store those packaged applications: the applications 
repository.
A repository to store the pipelines, and engine configuration (for instance, 
the location of the Spark master, etc.): per environment - the configuration 
repository.
A dashboard to monitor the pipelines.
A DSL and integration hooks allowing third parties to easily integrate.

Amaterasu has been incubating since 2017-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Prepare the first release
  2. Grow up user and contributor communities
  3. Prepare documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Two conference talks have been delivered (PyCon il and SDP)
  * Initial documentation has been created, targeted for Amaterasu's next 
release

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * since the last report 4 release candidates have been have been built and 
voted upon, at the time of this report the last RC (4) has passed the vote 
on in the general@incubator mailing list 
  * Two additional contributors started contributing to the code base
  * One more organization we are aware of have started a POC with Amaterasu

     Comments: Activity has picked up recently, and the first release is 
coming. That said, I think the community is not developing fast enough to 
suggest a good fit for the Foundation. I have general concerns whether the 
project can graduate and how quickly.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
Gobblin

Gobblin is a distributed data integration framework that simplifies common
aspects of big data integration such as data ingestion, replication,
organization and lifecycle management for both streaming and batch data
ecosystems.

Gobblin has been incubating since 2017-02-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

    1. Make frequent releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

* Various major components and futuristic features are being driven by the 
community 
  (non-committers) thus building a very healthy pool of contributors that 
can be voted 
  in as committers. 
* Continued growth in engagement over Gitter IRC, and mailing lists.
* 79% of commits (a record in Gobblin community) were from non-committer 
contributors.
* Email stats since last report:
  user@gobblin.incubator.apache.org : 44 dev@gobblin.incubator.apache.org : 
200
* There have been 66 Commits since last report:
    git log --format='%ci' | grep -cE '(2018-0(4|5|6|7))'
* 52 ie. 79% of those commits were by non-committers:
   git log --format='%ae %ci' | grep -E '(2018-0(4|5|6|7))' | cut -d ' ' -f 1
   | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
* Recurring video conference based meetup has been happening every month 
with a 
  healthy attendance.
* Gobblin was presented and well received in various meetups / conferences 
  around the world (independently by Apache community members).

How has the project developed since the last report?

* Major progress in Gobblin's evolution as Platform-as-a-Service - being 
driven 
  by couple of non-committers. 
* Comprehensive work being driven by a non-committer for stability of 
Gobblin 
  cluster at extreme scale. 
* Enhancements to key integrations such as Salesforce, Couchbase, Kafka, 
etc. 
* Addition of features for compliance and security. Increased adoption in 
this 
  area by the community (for critical use-cases such as GDPR). 
* Release 0.12.0 done.

Gossip

Gossip is an implementation of the Gossip Protocol.

Gossip has been incubating since 2016-04-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

We opened up a discussion thread to move Gossip out of the incubator. It was 
initially -1 ed by a 
committer. There is a separate discussion on the main incubator list about 
our lack of timely
reporting. After a short discussion we agreed we not want to be an undue 
burden and wanted
to give the IPMC time back so they can follow up with the other podlings. 
We will take an official vote on Monday to close down the podling.

HAWQ

HAWQ is an advanced enterprise SQL on Hadoop analytic engine built around a
robust and high-performance massively-parallel processing (MPP) SQL engine
evolved from Greenplum Database.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

    Nothing at this time.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

     Nothing urgent at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

1. Conference Talks :

* HAWQ for data scientists,  Shanghai CIO forum (Speaker: Lei Chang,  June 
23, 2018)
 

2.  "Graduate Apache HAWQ (incubating) as a TLP" discussion was started: 
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/67a2d52ef29cbf9e93d8050ed0193cc110a91996
2dd92f8436b343b7@%3Cdev.hawq.apache.org%3E

The followings is the content of the thread:

With the 2.3.0.0-incubating release officially out, the Apache HAWQ
community and its mentors believe it is time to consider graduation to the
TLP:
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b4a0b5671ce377b3d51c9b7
ab00496a1eebfcbf1696ce8b67e078c64@%3Cdev.hawq.apache.org%3E

Apache HAWQ entered incubation in September of 2015, since then, the HAWQ
community learned a lot about how to do things in Apache ways. Now we have
a healthy and engaged community, ready to help with all questions from the
HAWQ community. We delivered four releases including two binary releases,
now we can do self-driving releases in good cadence. The PPMC has
demonstrated a good understanding of growing the community by electing 12
individuals as committers and PPMC members. The PPMC addressed the maturity
issues one by one followed by Apache Project Maturity Model, currently all
the License and IP issues are resolved. This demonstrated our understanding
of ASF's IP policies.

All in all, I believe this project is qualified as a true TLP and we should
recognize this fact by formally awarding it such a status. This thread
means to open up the very same discussion that we had among the mentors and
HAWQ community to the rest of the IPMC. It is a DISCUSS thread so feel free
to ask questions.

MXNet

Apache MXNet is a lean, flexible, and ultra-scalable deep learning framework 
that supports state of the art in deep learning models, including 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks 
(LSTMs). The framework has its roots in academia and came about through the 
collaboration and contributions of researchers at several top universities. 
It has been designed to excel at computer vision, speech, language 
processing and understanding, generative models, concurrent neural networks, 
and recurrent neural networks. MXNet allows you to define, train, and deploy 
networks across a wide array of use cases from massive cloud infrastructure 
to mobile and connected devices. It provides a very flexible environment 
with support for many common languages and the ability to utilize both 
imperative and symbolic programming constructs. MXNet also very lightweight. 
This allows it to scale across multiple GPUs and multiple machines very 
efficiently, which is beneficial when conducting training on large datasets 
in the cloud.
 
Apache MXNet has been incubating since 23-Jan, 2017.
 
Four most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
 
1. Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way 
-- ESTABLISHED.
2. Grow the community -- ONGOING.
3. Bring website up to Apache standard – COMPLETED.
4. Identify remaining ICLAs or SGAs that need signing – NEAR COMPLETION.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?
 
   None
 
How has the community developed since the last report?
 
a) Various Slack channels, dev@ mailing lists, and user discussion 
forums (http://discuss.mxnet.io) are being used actively. The contributors 
have been working on having all discussions on the public dev@ mailing list 
as much as possible. At least one of the discussions infringed on Apache 
code of conduct and mentors had to step in and provide guidance to the 
community. 

b) After lengthy discussion the community agreed to establish 
user@mxnet.incubator.apache.org with the goal to increase users as well as 
grow the contributor community.

c) Community events: 
- In April the community organized the first MXNet meetup in Seattle. We had 
over 100 attendees, 15% from outside Amazon. 
- In May the community organized a virtual hangout with two sessions to 
collect feedback and ideas from the community.
- Korean MXNet community is growing well and most of contributors are 
outside of Amazon:

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Brand and domain donation.
  2. 3rd donation, consisting of documentation, e.g., tutorials and related 
images.
  3. Handing over of netbeans.org to Apache and related rerouting.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 None.

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Improve code generation from ODF XML grammar to reduce complexity 
(sponsorship by German Government next Winter) 
  2. Attract more developers - (collaboration scheduled for the end of 
October)  
  3. Fulfil the 1.0 version  
  

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?
   Several bug reports yet no new committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?
    Svante Schubert won for a second time sponsorship by German government's 
prototypefund.org for next Winter. 
    His previous collaboration feature runs finally full-featured with green 
regression tests on his GitHub fork, and was not yet merged into the main 
branch.
 Merge needs to be done before October, so the new sponsorship can 
focus on source code generation from the ODF XML grammar loaded into Graph 
Database (Apache Tinkerpop).

     Comments:
       The podling continues good development under Svante's guidance, but 
is certainly lacking other committers. That said, there is an active 
community with people responding to questions and comments on the mailing 
list. I hope the move to Gitbox helps.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
ODF Toolkit has moved source code development to GitBox/GitHub. The website 
remains in SVN as it is tied together with Apache CMS.
Given that this pooling has been in Incubation for seven years it is worth 
considering retirement. Just yesterday there was a question about how ready 
it is for production given that it has "-incubating" in the package names.

PLC4X

PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable 
logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.

PLC4X has been incubating since 2017-12-18.

Most important issues to address while moving towards graduation:

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building the community: The PPMC and committer group has a large 
percentage of codecentric employees, we have been recruiting people from 
other companies, but will have to continue these efforts for establishing a 
healthy Apache community.
  2. Onboarding of new committers: With PLC4X several people on the team are 
not very familiar with the Apache Way. We have started and will continue our 
efforts on this onboarding.
  3. Make our first release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

Not at the moment.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Christofer has invested most of his time in May and June spreading the word 
about PLC4X.

There have been several conference talks on PLC4X:

  * Building IoT 2018 in Cologne: Christofer Dutz – Industrial IoT und Edge 
Computing mit Apache PLC4X und Apache Edgent
  * @Vanced Network Meetup in Solingen: Christofer Dutz – Open-Source in der 
Industrie mit Apache PLC4X
  * Apache Roadshow EU in Berlin: Christofer Dutz - Revolutionizing the 
Production Industry with Apache PLC4X

A blog post in a major corporate tech-blog has been published with the
content of the JavaSPEKTRUM article on Apache Edgent and Apache PLC4X:
https://blog.codecentric.de/2018/06/edge-computing-industrial-iot-apache-edge
nt-apache-plc4x/

As a direct result on a talk in Berlin about mentoring new committers,
we have started creating “low-hanging-fruit” tagged issues and have
started promoting them.  As a result we have 2 potential contributors
interested in tackling these. Hopefully this will result in continued
activity from their side.

We have reached out to a developer offering Modbus, EthernetIP and
OPC-UA drivers on his Github page to get him to join our efforts.

The dev-list subscriptions has gone up by 7 (now 29) from the last
report.

We now have a Twitter account: https://twitter.com/ApachePlc4x as
another channel of communicating interesting PLC4X facts.  After
tweeting a lot about our project, the number of followers to that has
drastically increased to 41

How has the project developed since the last report?

We have setup a VPN for the CI server and other committers to be able
to communicate with real PLCs, however this feature has not proven to
improve the involvement of other committers so far.

We have recently found a set of git repos with Apache licensed code
for accessing Modbus, Ethernet/IP and UPC-UA devices. We have reached
out to the original developer to maybe get him on board with our team.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

We have a mix of new participants and experienced Apache people
involved.  So far, the new participants have shown great willingness
and success in adopting the Apache Way.  However, we still need to
continue: the on-boarding increasing the diversity of the team Also,
will we need to decide and establish all the processes involved in
releasing software at Apache

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built 
on
top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and query
processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across multiple 
nodes.
Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through SPARQL, a conventional
query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase diversity of committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No

     Comments: Activity has picked up recently, and the first release is 
coming. That said, I think the community is not developing fast enough to 
suggest a good fit for the Foundation. I have general concerns whether the 
project can graduate and how quickly.

* Major progress in Gobblin's evolution as Platform-as-a-Service - being 
driven 
  by couple of non-committers. 
* Comprehensive work being driven by a non-committer for stability of 
Gobblin 
  cluster at extreme scale. 
* Enhancements to key integrations such as Salesforce, Couchbase, Kafka, 
etc. 
* Addition of features for compliance and security. Increased adoption in 
this 
  area by the community (for critical use-cases such as GDPR). 
* Release 0.12.0 done.

We opened up a discussion thread to move Gossip out of the incubator. It was 
initially -1 ed by a 
committer. There is a separate discussion on the main incubator list about 
our lack of timely
reporting. After a short discussion we agreed we not want to be an undue 
burden and wanted
to give the IPMC time back so they can follow up with the other podlings. 
We will take an official vote on Monday to close down the podling.

HAWQ

HAWQ is an advanced enterprise SQL on Hadoop analytic engine built around a
robust and high-performance massively-parallel processing (MPP) SQL engine
evolved from Greenplum Database.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

    Nothing at this time.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

     Nothing urgent at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

1. Conference Talks :

* HAWQ for data scientists,  Shanghai CIO forum (Speaker: Lei Chang,  June 
23, 2018)
 

2.  "Graduate Apache HAWQ (incubating) as a TLP" discussion was started: 
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/67a2d52ef29cbf9e93d8050ed0193cc110a91996
2dd92f8436b343b7@%3Cdev.hawq.apache.org%3E

The followings is the content of the thread:

With the 2.3.0.0-incubating release officially out, the Apache HAWQ
community and its mentors believe it is time to consider graduation to the
TLP:
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/b4a0b5671ce377b3d51c9b7
ab00496a1eebfcbf1696ce8b67e078c64@%3Cdev.hawq.apache.org%3E

Apache HAWQ entered incubation in September of 2015, since then, the HAWQ
community learned a lot about how to do things in Apache ways. Now we have
a healthy and engaged community, ready to help with all questions from the
HAWQ community. We delivered four releases including two binary releases,
now we can do self-driving releases in good cadence. The PPMC has
demonstrated a good understanding of growing the community by electing 12
individuals as committers and PPMC members. The PPMC addressed the maturity
issues one by one followed by Apache Project Maturity Model, currently all
the License and IP issues are resolved. This demonstrated our understanding
of ASF's IP policies.

All in all, I believe this project is qualified as a true TLP and we should
recognize this fact by formally awarding it such a status. This thread
means to open up the very same discussion that we had among the mentors and
HAWQ community to the rest of the IPMC. It is a DISCUSS thread so feel free
to ask questions.

Livy

Livy is web service that exposes a REST interface for managing long running
Apache Spark contexts in your cluster. With Livy, new applications can be
built on top of Apache Spark that require fine grained interaction with many
Spark contexts.

Livy has been incubating since 2017-06-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community to have more activities.
  2. Grow more contributors and committers.
  3. Regular release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None

How has the community developed since the last report?

Activity on the dev and user mailing lists as well as the rate of reported
JIRA issues has stayed steady.

MXNet

Apache MXNet is a lean, flexible, and ultra-scalable deep learning framework 
that supports state of the art in deep learning models, including 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks 
(LSTMs). The framework has its roots in academia and came about through the 
collaboration and contributions of researchers at several top universities. 
It has been designed to excel at computer vision, speech, language 
processing and understanding, generative models, concurrent neural networks, 
and recurrent neural networks. MXNet allows you to define, train, and deploy 
networks across a wide array of use cases from massive cloud infrastructure 
to mobile and connected devices. It provides a very flexible environment 
with support for many common languages and the ability to utilize both 
imperative and symbolic programming constructs. MXNet also very lightweight. 
This allows it to scale across multiple GPUs and multiple machines very 
efficiently, which is beneficial when conducting training on large datasets 
in the cloud.
 
Apache MXNet has been incubating since 23-Jan, 2017.
 
Four most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
 
1. Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way 
-- ESTABLISHED.
2. Grow the community -- ONGOING.
3. Bring website up to Apache standard – COMPLETED.
4. Identify remaining ICLAs or SGAs that need signing – NEAR COMPLETION.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?
 
   None
 
How has the community developed since the last report?
 
a) Various Slack channels, dev@ mailing lists, and user discussion 
forums (http://discuss.mxnet.io) are being used actively. The contributors 
have been working on having all discussions on the public dev@ mailing list 
as much as possible. At least one of the discussions infringed on Apache 
code of conduct and mentors had to step in and provide guidance to the 
community. 

b) After lengthy discussion the community agreed to establish 
user@mxnet.incubator.apache.org with the goal to increase users as well as 
grow the contributor community.

c) Community events: 
- In April the community organized the first MXNet meetup in Seattle. We had 
over 100 attendees, 15% from outside Amazon. 
- In May the community organized a virtual hangout with two sessions to 
collect feedback and ideas from the community.
- Korean MXNet community is growing well and most of contributors are 
outside of Amazon:

NetBeans

NetBeans is a development environment, tooling platform and application
framework.

NetBeans has been incubating since 2016-10-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Brand and domain donation.
  2. 3rd donation, consisting of documentation, e.g., tutorials and related 
images.
  3. Handing over of netbeans.org to Apache and related rerouting.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 - Currently 588 (557 in last report) on Apache NetBeans users mailing list 
and 422 (406 in last report) on Apache NetBeans dev mailing list.
 - New splash screen discussed and accepted.
 - NetBeans represented at FossBack 2018: 
https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/entry/apache-netbeans-at-foss-backstage
 - NetBeans represented at COFAN 2018: 
https://blogs.apache.org/netbeans/entry/netbeans-for-javaee-project-productiv
ity

How has the project developed since the last report?

 - May 2018: Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 RC1 released: 
https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html
 - Hats off to Emilian Bold, the first non-Sun/Oracle release manager, who 
put the RC1 mentioned above together.
 - 2nd Oracle donation consisting of 1.5M lines of code grant accepted and 
code handed over:

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Improve code generation from ODF XML grammar to reduce complexity 
(sponsorship by German Government next Winter) 
  2. Attract more developers - (collaboration scheduled for the end of 
October)  
  3. Fulfil the 1.0 version  
  

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?
   Several bug reports yet no new committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?
    Svante Schubert won for a second time sponsorship by German government's 
prototypefund.org for next Winter. 
    His previous collaboration feature runs finally full-featured with green 
regression tests on his GitHub fork, and was not yet merged into the main 
branch.
 Merge needs to be done before October, so the new sponsorship can 
focus on source code generation from the ODF XML grammar loaded into Graph 
Database (Apache Tinkerpop).

     Comments:
       The podling continues good development under Svante's guidance, but 
is certainly lacking other committers. That said, there is an active 
community with people responding to questions and comments on the mailing 
list. I hope the move to Gitbox helps.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
ODF Toolkit has moved source code development to GitBox/GitHub. The website 
remains in SVN as it is tied together with Apache CMS.
Given that this pooling has been in Incubation for seven years it is worth 
considering retirement. Just yesterday there was a question about how ready 
it is for production given that it has "-incubating" in the package names.

PLC4X

PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable 
logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.

PLC4X has been incubating since 2017-12-18.

Most important issues to address while moving towards graduation:

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building the community: The PPMC and committer group has a large 
percentage of codecentric employees, we have been recruiting people from 
other companies, but will have to continue these efforts for establishing a 
healthy Apache community.
  2. Onboarding of new committers: With PLC4X several people on the team are 
not very familiar with the Apache Way. We have started and will continue our 
efforts on this onboarding.
  3. Make our first release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

Not at the moment.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Christofer has invested most of his time in May and June spreading the word 
about PLC4X.

There have been several conference talks on PLC4X:

  * Building IoT 2018 in Cologne: Christofer Dutz – Industrial IoT und Edge 
Computing mit Apache PLC4X und Apache Edgent
  * @Vanced Network Meetup in Solingen: Christofer Dutz – Open-Source in der 
Industrie mit Apache PLC4X
  * Apache Roadshow EU in Berlin: Christofer Dutz - Revolutionizing the 
Production Industry with Apache PLC4X

A blog post in a major corporate tech-blog has been published with the
content of the JavaSPEKTRUM article on Apache Edgent and Apache PLC4X:
https://blog.codecentric.de/2018/06/edge-computing-industrial-iot-apache-edge
nt-apache-plc4x/

As a direct result on a talk in Berlin about mentoring new committers,
we have started creating “low-hanging-fruit” tagged issues and have
started promoting them.  As a result we have 2 potential contributors
interested in tackling these. Hopefully this will result in continued
activity from their side.

We have reached out to a developer offering Modbus, EthernetIP and
OPC-UA drivers on his Github page to get him to join our efforts.

The dev-list subscriptions has gone up by 7 (now 29) from the last
report.

We now have a Twitter account: https://twitter.com/ApachePlc4x as
another channel of communicating interesting PLC4X facts.  After
tweeting a lot about our project, the number of followers to that has
drastically increased to 41

How has the project developed since the last report?

We have setup a VPN for the CI server and other committers to be able
to communicate with real PLCs, however this feature has not proven to
improve the involvement of other committers so far.

We have recently found a set of git repos with Apache licensed code
for accessing Modbus, Ethernet/IP and UPC-UA devices. We have reached
out to the original developer to maybe get him on board with our team.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

We have a mix of new participants and experienced Apache people
involved.  So far, the new participants have shown great willingness
and success in adopting the Apache Way.  However, we still need to
continue: the on-boarding increasing the diversity of the team Also,
will we need to decide and establish all the processes involved in
releasing software at Apache

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built 
on
top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and query
processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across multiple 
nodes.
Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through SPARQL, a conventional
query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase diversity of committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

automatically at runtime.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

This has been a slower quarter that usual, but nothing of concern. 
There is reduction on dev mailing list activity reported below mostly

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache James Project  [Eric Charles]

## Description:
   - The Apache James Project delivers a rich set of open source modules and
     libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which build into an
     advanced enterprise mail server.

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Preparing James 3.1 release.
 - Lack of new committer has been discussed on the private and public mailing
   lists. Committers discussed about new features (distributed platforms...)
   but finally Users wants better documentation and easier onboarding rather
   than having additional new features. We are still searching ways to find
   contributors for "howtos" documentation and hopefully get more users and
   contributors on version 3 that could become committers.
- Discussion to migrate repositories from git-wip to gitbox.

## Health report:
 - We need to address the lack of new committers with better doc (simple
   howtos on current features to be written), more regular releases (sounds
   like we are on a good way for this) and being more engaging on mailing
   lists (action is needed on this).
 - Mailing lists subscribers stable.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 16 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrea Turli]

== Description ==

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
cloud providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We have upgraded to Java 8 to a newer Guava version. It will have a
significant impact on users but we believe it will simplify jclouds
adoption in modern environments. We have discussed it long enough to have a
clear upgrade path, and will keep the old branches JDK 7 compatible. Users
already know that the next major release will require Java 8, so although
the impact is significant, there should be no issues.

We are working with the Karaf community to complete the migration of our
jclouds-karaf integration to Java 8 too and then we'll be ready to release.

== Community ==

The project continues to receive contributions in the form of code and
issues from new developers, indicating that development is healthy and that
users are feeding back their problems and feature suggestions. We have
detected, though, that interactions in the mailing list have slowed down,
and we are starting to have some discussions on how to improve engagement.

We're kicking off the process of supporting Alibaba Cloud hoping to get
contributions from users of that cloud.

Currently there are 25 committers and 12 PMC members.

Last committer: 2018-01-26 (Jim Spring)

Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
members.
== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.1.0, took place on 2018-02-21.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards for RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

Activity remains mostly normal across mailing lists and GitHub.  There was a
large dip in traffic to the Users list this quarter (down 50%) which appears
to be due to new features having bedded in.

Previous quarters user traffic was spiked due to the introduction of the new
TDB2 component and extended discussions around a hard to reproduce concurrency
bug in a long standing component.  The project does also experience periodic
spikes in traffic caused by university professors mandating use of Jena for
courseworks and these users are often complete novices who generate temporary
high volumes of traffic.  We did experience a lot of that last quarter while
this quarter has been much quieter in this regard.

The project has made a couple of releases and incorporated several large
contributions from new contributors who have been made committers.  A
committer was also promoted to the PMC in recognition of their ongoing
contributions to the project.

## Health report:

Current activity levels are normal

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 13 PMC members.
 - Chris Tomlinson was added to the PMC on Sun Apr 29 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 17 committers.
 - Aaron Coburn was added as a committer on Mon Jun 18 2018

## Releases:

 - 3.7.0 was released on Mon Apr 09 2018
 - 3.8.0 was released on Mon July 02 2018

## Mailing list activity:

Dev traffic was normal, user traffic saw a significant drop as discussed in
Activity earlier in our report.

 - users@jena.apache.org:
    - 638 subscribers (up 9 in the last 3 months):
    - 363 emails sent to list (724 in previous quarter)

## JIRA activity:

 - 55 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 66 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

 Pure Java application for load and functional testing.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The project discussing to release the next version, which brings a lot of
   improvements and fixed bugs.
 - Currently a GSoC's student is working on the support of HTTP/2 inside
   JMeter. The work is slow and complex and the result isn't guaranteed.
 - We have a (false-positive) security report under study. We will answer to
   the reporter.

## Health report:

 - The project has a good activity during last quarter with a good number of
   fixes/enhancements and external patches / PRs.
 - A new PMC member has been added since last report

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 9 PMC members.
 - Vladimir Sitnikov was added to the PMC on Fri Jun 08 2018

## Committer base changes:

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Johnzon Project  [Hendrik Saly]

## Description:
Apache Johnzon is an implementation of JSR-353 (JSON-P 1.0), JSR-374
(JSON-P 1.1) and JSR-367 (JSON-B 1.0) and a set of useful extension for this
specification like JAX-RS providers and websocket (JSR-356) integration.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Status:
We recently finished and released the implementation of JSR-374 and JSR-367.
Current focus is now to optimize the performance and stabilize the new
features. A new module on top of the JSR for the JSON Schema validation is
developed to open the project to something outside than pure specs.

## Releases:
→ 1.0.1 was released on Tue May 08 2018
→ 1.1.8 was released on Sun Jul 01 2018

## Committers and PMC membership:
The last committer we signed up was Jonathan Gallimore on May 09, 2018. The
last PMC member was Reinhard Sandtner, added to the PMC on August 30, 2016.

## Project activity:
Since the last report there was mid activity. We some some more external
contributions than usually via github.

We had 12 new Jira tickets and closed 14 tickets. On the mailinglist there a
no unanswered questions left. On the dev list we have 36 (+4) subscribers
currently and 12 msg sent per week. Since last report we saw mailing list
activity from a few new people.

## Description: 
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity:

   Haddock, some important fixes regarding caches / ACLs and a few more 
   features and bugfixes.
 
 - 2.10.5 expected for August.
 
 - We received our first PR on Github. It didn't make it to master because of 
   that same fix being included as a part of a subsequent commit, but our 
   first interaction merits a mention.

 - New code has been mostly about fine-tuning Haddock template for mobile 
   devices; also a fix for the default template and smoothing the 
   build/release process.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description: 

Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues: 

No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Since the last report, we've made one maintenance release (1.7.1).
The 1.7.1 release included critical bug fixes discovered in 1.7.0.
Work continues on further new features including deeper integration
with Apache Hive, support for backup and recovery (using Apache Spark
as an execution building block), and more.

## Health report: 

- User mailing list didn't grow much in this quarter, and traffic was
  also down 10%. It's hard to discern an obvious pattern here - most
  questions are answered relatively quickly after they appear on the list.
  Perhaps we are doing a good job of improving documentation and, as
  common questions are captured in the mailing list archives, fewer people
  need to ask questions on the list?

- Website traffic growth is up a bit: Around +6% for both users and
  sessions vs the prior quarter. The previous report asked how these
  numbers are calculated. We are currently using Google Analytics
  on our site.

- Development activity (measured by code review and JIRA traffic) is down
  noticeably (reviews -14%, JIRA -40%, commits -36%). Code was authored by
  18 unique contributors (-4 since last quarter) of whom 3 were new
  to the project (-5 since last quarter). Again no obvious trend here
  since activity was way up last quarter -- just seems to be a noisy
  metric.

- It's been a while since we added a committer, but some promising
  votes are currently going on on the private list.

## PMC changes: 

 - Currently 19 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Hao Hao on Wed Dec 13 2017

## Committer base changes: 

 - Currently 19 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Hao Hao at Wed Dec 13 2017

## Releases: 

 - 1.7.1 was released on Wed Jun 06 2018

## JIRA activity: 

 - 91 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 64 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache MADlib Project  [Aaron Feng]

## Description:
- Apache MADlib is a scalable, big data, SQL-driven machine learning framework
  for data scientists.


## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:
- A MADlib community call on the topic of the last 1.14 release occurred on
  2018-May-10.  This included demos of new features and improvements to
  existing features.
- Community is currently working on the 1.15 release which will be 4th release
  as an Apache TLP project.  We expect voting on release artifacts in late
  July.
- Ideas are being generated for the 2.0 release which will come after 1.15.


## Health report:
The community is relatively small but very engaged with robust mailing list
traffic, interest in doing frequent releases and new functionality being
developed by contributors. The number of developers actively contributing to
the code/documentation is approximately 8 in the 2nd quarter of calendar year
2018, which is about the same as the last report. We will constantly be on a
lookout for new community members to be invited either as committers or PMC.


## PMC changes:
- No changes in PMC, currently 13 PMC members.


## Committer base changes:
- Currently 15 committers.
- Two new committers added in the last 3 months.
- Last committer additions were Jingyi Mei on 2018-06-14 and Nikhil Kak on
  2018-06-27.


## Releases:
- Next release: v1.15.0 planned for late July 2018
- v1.14.0 released on 2018-05-01
- v1.13.0 released on 2017-12-22
- v1.12.0 released on 2017-08-29


## Mailing list activity:
Average monthly mailing list activity was 83 posts to dev@ and 11 posts to
user@ for the last 3 months Apr-Jun.


## JIRA Statistics:
- 8 JIRA tickets created in the last month
- 8 JIRA tickets resolved in the last month

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Andrew Palumbo]

## Description:
Apache Mahout is an environment for quickly creating scalable performant
machine learning applications.

## Issues:

A change of chair resolution is before the board with Andrew Palumbo’s
resignation as PMC chair; with Andrew Musselman taking over as the PMC chair.

## Activity:

Working towards a 0.14.0 release this Summer. The Primary sticking point is
building in Maven for release to multiple versions of Scala, which requires

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Maven Board Report - July 2018
---------------------------

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a standardized
coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build lifecycle.

* Issues

  <<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

* Activity

  In May Snyk informed us (indirectly) about a security vulnerability called
  Zip Slip vulnerability (https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability). In
  short *if* there's a malicious jar and you unpack it, files *might* end up
  outside of the targeted directory. There are a lot of criteria required to
  be hit by this vulnerability. We've fixed this by doing an extra check while
  unpacking and updated those plugins that offer unpacking. Since Maven simply
  reads jars in memory, there's no real issue here. To complete the story:
  Sonatype has analyzed Central and couldn't find jars that abused the zip
  slip vulnerability. Details on
  https://maven.apache.org/security-plexus-archiver.html

  Another success is the release of Maven 3.5.4, containing better color
  support for a larger set on consoles. And of course some other small
  improvements and bugfixes.

  It is very likely that we'll work on 3.6.0, moving towards the next major
  release. However, the changes we want to implement will take a huge amount
  of time and resources. And this is still a huge issue.

- Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources
  away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and
  elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- We are in the process of moving to GitBox!
- Some members from the PMC and community have started planning a 2018
  MesosCon.

## Health report:

- The project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features, reviews
  and releases. The mailing lists, slack and IRC channels are also very much
  active with healthy discussions. Multiple active working groups
  (containerization, performance, API, community).

## PMC changes:

- Currently 45 PMC members.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Metron Project  [Casey Stella]

## Description
Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order
to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis.  Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
Dataworks Summit in San Jose was held in June and there were two Metron
technical talks as well as a cybersecurity meetup held prior to the
conference.  One of the talks at the meetup involved a system integrator
building utilities atop Metron, which was very interesting to see.

There was much interest in the release done directly prior to the
conference as well.
   
## Health report: 
Mailing list activity, conference submissions and ticket participation
indicates that we're continuing to grow and attract real users.  The
investment in modernizing some of the infrastructure dependencies has
met with renewed interest in users.

Also, we have made some strides in UI development recently with more
contributions.  This will aid in user growth as Metron can be complex
at times.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache MINA Project  [Guillaume Nodet]

## Description:
Apache MINA is a network application framework which helps users develop high
performance and high scalability network applications easily.

## Issues:
  None

## Activity:
 Mina SSHD 2.0.0 was released this quarter, the switch to a new major version
 was mainly driven by the split into several smaller modules, which required
 some refactoring and incompatibilities.

 MINA 2.0.18 was released but post-release feedback lead to discover some
 incompatibilities, so a 2.0.19 was quickly released to fix those. 
 PMC has started discussions about moving FtpServer and Vysper to the Attic.
 The SSHD 2.0.0 took quite some time to release and there were some discussion
 about delaying for further refactoring, but those were abandoned because of 
 the lack of consensus.
 
## Health
 Both Mina SSHD and Mina Core subprojects have only two active committers
 (different committers though).  The SSHD subproject has external contributions
 so we may have new committers in the future.
 The FtpServer and Vysper have very low activity: a single commit since a 
 year for FtpServer, no activity since 4 years for Vysper.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Sebastian Nagel]

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene®, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop®
data structures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.


ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


RELEASES

The last release on the 2.x branch (2.3.1) dates to Jan 20 2016.


CURRENT ACTIVITY

A release of the Nutch 1.x branch (1.15) is in preparation and
should be made during the next two weeks.  It will include an
upgrade to the new MapReduce API (NUTCH-2375, now considered
stable), improvements to index data using various indexing
backends (Solr, etc.), improvements and fixes of the existing
HTTP/HTTPS protocol plugin and a new HTTP protocol plugin
which supports http/2.


COMMUNITY

We got two new committers since the last report, both having
joined us in June 2018:
- Omkar Reddy who completed his Nutch GSoC project in 2017
- Roannel Fernandez who contributed multiple improvements
  of indexer plugins

The traffic on the user mailing list is at a steady level:

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Sathwik]

## Description:
   Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web services
   orchestration using flexible process definitions.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   It has been a silent period, not much of activity seen. The plan is to get
   a release out of the trunk which has a lot of new things. Lack of support
   from the community might see a very slow activity in the near future as
   well. New contributors who had shown some interest in the past have been
   silent so far.

## Health report:
 - ODE is very mature and stable, however the interest in BPEL has decreased
   significantly. Thus ODE's development is currently pretty much in
   maintenance mode.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Peter Kovacs]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, mac-OS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## STATUS

The activity within the project dropped in this quarter. Topics took longer to
process. However to our knowledge no committer left permanently, we expect that
activity will raise again when our volunteers have time again for OpenOffice.
We see the current situation as a natural development.

## ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

No Changes to report. We did not do any activity to recruit new committers.

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We are processing the migration towards new VMs and taking over the
maintenance from infra for these systems. We have targeted to finish the
migration of the Wiki media platform by end of June, in order to proceed with
testing. Forums have been planned to processed in a longer term. However the
progress in the migration relative to our expectations of the forum is better,
and the Wiki media is a bit behind. In total we are satisfied with the progress
in total, since for both topics we see no show stoppers.

Forum is currently in public testing, and receives incremental bug fixes.
Media Wiki is expected to go into public testing on the weekend from 13 to 15
July.

We want to thank Infra for their support in this topic. We are very happy
with their supported provided.

## MARKETING
The German community is producing new flyers for the Booth team in German and
English. We are looking for translators into other languages.
(French has been discussed.)

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache ORC Project  [Owen O'Malley]

## Description:

 - A high-performance columnar file format for big data workloads.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring the board's attention.

## Activity:

 - Released ORC 1.5.0 (and a few follow up bug fixes 1.5.1 and 1.5.2)
   + Added new C++ writer
   + Added support for variable length blocks in HDFS
   + Implemented a CSV to ORC converter
   + Improved performance for decimal types
   + Added support for compiling C++ code under MSVC.

 - Presentation about Avro, ORC, and Parquet benchmarks from Spark
   was given at Berlin Buzzwords
   https://berlinbuzzwords.de/18/session/fast-access-your-complex-data-avro-json-orc-and-parquet
   The code is in ORC-386 at https://github.com/apache/orc/pull/290

 - Presentation about how to split up projects, such as ORC out of Hive, at FOSS Backstage
   https://foss-backstage.de/session/untangling-spaghetti-when-and-how-split-projects

 - Did a FeatherCast about ORC in Berlin.

## Health report:

- After more discussions and a thread on Apache legal, we have reincorporated the benchmark
   code, which depends on the GPL'ed JMH framework back in to the project. Consensus was that
   because the benchmarks are not user facing they qualify as "optional components" from
   https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#optional . To strengthen this characterization, we
   ensured that the benchmarks are not built by default and are not distributed on Maven Central.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Polygene Project  [Paul Merlin]

Description: Apache Polygene is a community based effort exploring Composite
Oriented Programming for domain centric application development.

Issues: The PMC Chair is mostly AWOL, due to change in personal life
circumstances. Additionally, myself and the last major contributor have found
ourselves working together on something completely different, and been
completely unable to put effort into the project. This is also the reason why
no report was produced last month. So, I have indicated to the community
(dev@) that unless someone speaks up, that I will initiate the process to put
Polygene into the Attic.

Activity: There was quite an effort in Q1 to push forward to the 3.1 release,
particularly to include "enterprise" SQL support. But for reason mentioned
above, this came to an abrupt halt in April. As we have been unable to attract
and retain any new blood into the project, I think it is time to close the
doors at ASF.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
 Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation
 uses to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 There has been little to no activity in the past 3 months. Some ideas,
 relating to a plugin architecture around authorization and ballots
 have been discussed, but nothing specific has been decided on yet.

## Health report:
 As usual, I did a check to see if we have sufficient oversight, due to
 the low activity. At present, 4 PMC members have indicated that they
 are still actively monitoring the project. As stated in earlier
 reports, STeVe is in a holding pattern, waiting for people to
 accumulate enough free time to look into whatever
 improvements/stabilizations they can think of, though there are no
 concrete plans at this moment. As STeVe is largely stable and working
 as intended, I do not see this as a bad thing, but rather that we have
 achieved what is needed at present, and while things can always be
 improved, there is no known urgency here.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 5 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Rich Bowen on Mon Apr 20 2015

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 9 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Pierre Smits at Tue Dec 15 2015

## Releases:

 No releases yet. As stated before; we have been running members
 meetings on a trunk philosophy for the past few years and it's worked
 out well enough. If we get indications of a desire to use STeVe outside
 the foundation, we will of course consider pushing a release out.

## Mailing list activity:

 Very low activity, nothing worth going into details over.

## Bug/issue activity:

 - 1 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 0 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Streams Project  [Steve Blackmon]

## Description:

- Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online
  activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets
  accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
  streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:

- There are a lot of changes occurring in the APIs of our supported data
  sources.  Due primarily to the EU's GDPR legislation, a user's ability to
  collect profiles and posts from accounts other than the authenticated
  account is being limited.
- On the other hand comprehensive data about the authenticated account
  (sometimes via bulk export not via API) is becoming richer, presenting an
  opportunity for the project to assist users in awareness of the data
  collected about them by third-parties, and with data portability between
  systems using bulk export archives.

## Activity:

- We released Apache Streams 0.6.0, coordinated by a new release manager
  (number 5).
- We made progress toward including a binary artifact in an upcoming release.

## Health report:

Significant new features are expected this quarter.  Adding committers and
growing the PMC needs to be a focus this year.

## PMC changes:

- None. There are currently 8 PMC members.  The most recent PMC addition
  occurred on July 19, 2017.

## Committer base changes:

- None. There are currently 8 committers.  The most recent PMC addition
  occurred on July 19, 2017.

## Releases:

- Apache Streams 0.6.0 was released on June 17, 2018

## Mailing list activity: (3 month)

19 Emails sent during these 91 days, down 18 (-45%) compared to previous 91
days. 8 topics started during these 91 days, down 6 (-42%) compared to
previous 91 days. 6 Participants during these 91 days, down 2 (-25%) compared
to previous 91 days.

## JIRA Statistics: (3 month)

12 new, 15 resolved

## Website Traffic: (3 month)

1,187 sessions, up 5.89% compared to previous 3 months. 1,107 users, up 10.04%
compared to previous 3 months.

## Upcoming Project Initiatives:
- Complete preparations for a binary release.
- Add new providers that source streams from export archives of existing data
  sources (twitter, facebook, google).
- Integrate binary release with Apache Kibble.
- More tweets and blog posts of zeppelin notebooks demonstrating data
  pipelines and analyses based on Apache Streams.
- More official examples in source tree demonstrating integration of Apache
  Streams with complementary technologies.
- Drop remaining maven dependencies on java SDKs for accessing third-party
  APIs in favor of HTTP/REST interfaces powered by Apache Juneau Remoteable
  Annotations.
- Improve the interfaces by which components are created, configured,
  activated, and executed via SDK and CLI.
- Reduce disparities between normalized activities and objects of like type
  collected from various data sources.
- Reduce disparities between the configuration objects that initialize similar
  providers from various data sources.
- Add official support for Schema.org and Activity Streams 2.0 data types.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made no GA releases in the last quarter. The last
release was
* Struts 2.5.16 - full GA release including bug fixes and feature
enhancements (2018-03-16)

The last quarter was rather quiet regarding development of new features.
Community contributions and general development activities were a little
bit lower than in the previous quarters.

After various discussions and tries to get around glitches, it looks
like we are soon going to announce EOL for the 2.3 development line
along with JDK 6 support.

No committers were added in the last quarter.

Last committer addition:
* 2017-11-14 - Yasser Zamani (yasserzamani)

In the reporting quarter Yasser Zamani (yasserzamani) accepted our
invitation to join the Struts PMC (2018-06-12).

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop released versions 3.2.9 and 3.3.3 in early May which included
many bug fixes and some minor new features. Development has started on the
next major release, 3.4.0, which will contain major new features and some
breaking API changes, the first such release in about a year (3.3.0 in 
August of 2017 was the last time we had this type of release). Once 3.4.0
is released in coming months, the community will discuss what the future
plan is for the 3.2.x line and whether it requires continued support. We
will continue to develop the 3.3.x line for some time. When 3.4.0 releases
we will have companion 3.2.10 and 3.3.4 releases as well.

TinkerPop has seen continued growth in the development of third-party 
libraries, which we tend to take as a sign of good community health. Two
recently announced examples include:

* spring-data-gremlin[1]
* kotlin-gremlin-ogm[2]

Both of these libraries open TinkerPop and its graph query language, 
Gremlin, to entirely new development ecosystems in Spring Data and Kotlin
respectively.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.2.9 (May 8, 2018)
- 3.3.3 (May 8, 2018)

## PMC/Committer:
- Last PMC addition was Robert Dale - April 2017

Merging of the MicroProfile JWT code into TomEE did eventually occur and
lives in the TomEE 8 branch.  No releases of TomEE 8 have occurred yet,
though discussion of when to release that branch has started.  Discussion on
backporting MicroProfiles to a potential TomEE 7.1 based on Java 8 also has
been discussed.  There was some support for such a branch, though some
thought after the coming TomEE 7.0.5 would be ideal.

Efforts to release TomEE 7.0.5 are nearing completion, two votes already been
attempted, the second still in progress.  The release includes significantly
greater compatibility with Java 9 and upgrades of 6 of the major libraries
such as Tomcat, CXF, OpenWebBeans and OpenJPA.  Support for Java 10 and 11 is
still early stages.

How the project will handle the faster Java release cycle in a general sense
is unknown.  TomEE itself has tended to have 6-8 month release cycles, so
some adjustment in terms of speed is likely necessary in order to keep up.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Traffic Control Project  [David Neuman]

## Description:
 - Apache Traffic Control can be used to build, monitor, configure, and
   provision a large-scale content delivery network (CDN).

## Issues:
- How can we fix our committee health score? 
  [https://reporter.apache.org/chi.py#trafficcontrol]
- No other issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

- Announced the 2.2 release of Traffic Control
- Started working on finalizing scope and a Release Manager for 3.0
- There has been some discussion around PMC vs Committer and how to best allow
  our committers to perform releases without being PMC. As a new TLP this is
  something that we need to work out.

## Health report:
 - The project is healthy.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 13 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 18 committers.
 - No changes (the PMC was established in the last 3 months)

## Releases:

 - apache-trafficcontrol-2.2.0 was released on Mon Jun 25 2018

## Mailing list activity:

 - Overall mailing list activity seems to be pretty consistent over the last
   month.  We tend to use dev@ more heavily than other lists, maybe we should
   consider using users@ a little more.

 - users@trafficcontrol.apache.org:
    - 95 subscribers (up 7 in the last 3 months)
    - only 1 email sent over the last month (compared to 7 in the current
      month prior)
    - most of our communication happens on dev@, perhaps we can get better at
      using the users list.

 - dev@trafficcontrol.apache.org:
    - 93 subscribers (up 4 in the last 3 months)
    - 77 emails sent to the list (up about 5% from the last month)

 - issues@trafficcontrol.apache.org:
    - 29 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months)
    - > 1000 emails over the last month (actually a 1% decrease)
    - This list is primarily automated emails from github so statistics are
      not too interesting

 - summits@trafficcontrol.apache.org:
    - 6 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months)
    - this list is meant for users to submit CFPs for summits, therefore it is
      hardly used.


## GitHub activity:
 - 93 Pull requests submitted in the last 30 days
 - 85 Pull Requests merged in the last 30 days
 - 27 issues created in the last 30 days
 - 23 issues closed in the last 30 days
 - 205 stars on the Traffic Control repo

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Bryan Call]

## Description: 
Apache Traffic Server is a HTTP and HTTP/2 proxy server and cache.  What makes
ATS unique across the landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on
extensibility (plugins), HTTP and HTTP/2 protocol conformity, and performance.
ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs in the world, delivering a significant
portion of all Internet traffic.

## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - There was an ATS Spring Summit in Cork, Ireland in May in which 18 people
   attended.  It was a mixture of presentations and working groups to clean
   up the code.  Many proposals where made on the direction of the project
   and decisions were finalized on the mailing list.
   
## Health report: 
 - ATS 7.1.3 was released and had good adoption.  We are currently working
   on the ATS 7.1.4 release and the 8.0.0 release that will both happen this

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to
SOAP/XML based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations.
Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within
Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite
mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed,
and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure
the project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since
SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of the art,
we don't expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new
committers, etc...

Last quarter, we did a bunch of releases so we didn't expect much
this quarter.  We did do a new release of WSS4J mostly to grab
the newer version of Apache Santuario.  

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)

Releases this period:
WSS4J - implementation of WS-Security and related technologies
 - WSS4J-2.2.2 was released on Sun Jun 17 2018 

Last releases for other technologies:
*  XmlSchema 2.2.3 : Jan 2018 (XML schema object model)
*  Neethi 3.1.1 : Jan 2018 (WS-Policy Framework)
*  Axiom  1.2.20 : Oct 2016 (StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model)
*  Woden 1.0M10 : Sept 2015  (WSDL 2.0 implementation)
