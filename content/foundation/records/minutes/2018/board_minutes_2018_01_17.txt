 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       At last month's meeting, we continued discussion of the 5-year plan.
       This has frankly been difficult for us to complete.  Bertrand
       suggested that we might do better to focus first on the high-level
       vision and objectives before debating specific decision points.
       Bertrand drafted a vision statement that we were able to agree on and
       which I hope will be formally approved at today's meeting.  I proposed
       the following objectives for the 5-year plan.  We have not reached
       consensus yet on these, so they should be viewed as draft at this
       point:

       1. Ensure that the services that the ASF offers to project communities
       are clearly defined and can be reliably delivered in a manner that
       meets their expectations.

       2  Improve our success for identifying, attracting, welcoming and
       developing “like-minded communities” that will be successful at the
       ASF.

       3. Effectively scale our operations and governance processes in such a
       way that the ASF continues to be a light-process, light-governance,
       largely decentralized organization whose central operations serve
       projects in a manner consistent with the way PMCs are expected to
       serve their communities

       4. Ensure the financial soundness of the ASF over the term of the plan
       and establish the foundation for long-term stability

       We need to start planning the 2019 budget soon, so my hope is that we
       can complete the 5-year plan, including the financial projections, by
       next month's meeting.

       The quality of the project reports this month was overall very good.
       Many thanks to the PMC chairs and PMC members who contributed.  There
       were quite a few very good reports this month.  I will call out two as
       as exemplary: CarbonData and Fineract. In each case, challenges as
       well as progress are called out and a complete picture of the state of
       the project is presented.

       One thing that we often mention is that just presenting mailing list
       stats is not necessary and should be omitted unless they add something
       to the report.  This month's Hbase report provides an example of using
       ML stats to support the ideas in a report.

       Several projects discussed their challenges with imbalance between
       contributors and committers - i.e., large numbers of PRs and not
       enough committers to keep up with them.  In each case, the feedback
       from the board was to try to find ways to get contributors on a faster
       path to committership.

       In some cases, commenters asked for a more complete picture of project
       activity and community health. PMCs were reminded that project reports
       are public and are the public record of the state of the project, so
       its best to include more than just the basic facts about releases,
       committer / PMC changes, etc.

       As part of review of projects, we often look at project mailing lists.
       This month, some comments were made about topics from dev or private
       lists that would have been good to include in reports.  For example,
       one project dealt with a LGPL dependency issue. Including a summary of
       the issue and how it was dealt with in the report would have been
       good.

       One comment asked that a PMC be careful with how its private repo is
       used.  Like private mailing lists, private repos should be used only
       for things that really have to be private.

       Finally, we had to repeat the reminder that reports should always
       include the dates of the last committer addition, the last PMC member
       addition and the last release.

       Thanks again to all PMC chairs for taking the time to develop reports
       this month and to my fellow board members for doing such a complete
       and thoughtful review of the reports submitted.

    B. President [Sam]

       Items requiring board attention:

         * Budget (can be deferred to discussion items)

         * Three minor questions in Fundraising Report
           * First has been discussed on board@
           * I recommend the second be delegated to Legal Affairs
           * Third is not ready for this month

       ### Executive Assistant

       Despite the best efforts of myself, Ross and members of the board, the
       ASF has come to the conclusion that it no longer has a need for an
       Executive Assistant. This position has now been eliminated, and
       Melissa has been laid off.

       I've enjoyed working with Melissa, and will enthusiastically give her
       a reference.  If anybody knows of a good match for her ample talents,
       I encourage them to act quickly!

       I have no immediate plans to replace Melissa as VP, TAC. This will be
       revisited once we have a large scale conference again.

       ### Finances and Budget

       I agree with the Treasurer's report that income is exceeding targets
       and expenses are under control, with the possibility that this year we
       will show a modest surplus.  The only caution is that $171K of this is
       due to income that was not received last year, attributed at the time
       to timing issues.  If that is removed, we will see a deficit; but even
       so a much smaller one than budgeted.

       The impact of the laying off of the EA will be a modest increase in
       expenses in January (to be reported in the February meeting), a modest
       decrease in expenses for FY18, and a significant reduction ($100K,
       which not only covers salary, but benefits, employer taxes, PEO
       management overhead, etc.) in General & Administrative expenses in
       subsequent years.

       I encourage the board to complete their efforts on the 5 year plan by
       the February meeting as that input is needed in the preparation of the
       FY2019 budget.  Delaying the FY2019 budget past the beginning of the
       fiscal year will inevitably result in Tom and I having a shadow budget
       that is unapproved by the board.  Let's not do that.

       My observation remains that both Brand Management and Fundraising
       activities are beyond what can reasonably be expected to be sustained
       by volunteers; with Brand Management being the more urgent of the two.
       Ross has additional input on this matter.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first Eight
       months of FY18.

       Cash on Dec 31st, 2017 was $1,663K, which is up $31K from last month’s
       ending balance (Nov 17) of $1,632K. The Dec 2017 cash balance is up
       $65.1K from the Dec 2016 month end balance of $1,597.9K. The Dec 2017
       ending cash balance of $1,663K represents a cash reserve of 14.7
       months based on the FY18 conservative Cash forecast average monthly
       spending of $112.8K/month. The ASF reserve continues to be very
       healthy for an organization of ASF's size, with a conservative FY18
       YE estimate of 13.5 months of Operating cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong and
       favorable showing against our FY18 budget at this of point of the FY,
       however as I will continue to mention, because we are on a cash basis,
       the timing of Sponsor payments received and Payables released plays a
       big part in how well we perform financially month to month and year
       over year.  This month we were over the FY 18 budget for Revenue
       (Payments were received this month from Facebook Platinum Sponsor,
       Aetna Silver Sponsor and STS Web Hosting Bronze Sponsor) and the
       Foundation was under the FY18 budget in Expenses.  As I have mentioned
       in previous months we want to continue to focus on our new sponsors
       but we also cannot take away any focus from our existing sponsors as
       that was how the FY18 budget was constructed.  The Fundraising team
       continues to do an excellent job in both areas, servicing both new and
       existing Sponsors.  With total actual Revenue, as of Dec 31st, 2017,
       of $977.1K, we are 79.7% of the way to our Total Revenue budget of
       $1,226.5K for FY18, while only 67% of the way through FY18.  Regarding
       Sponsor revenue, we have received in the first eight months of FY18,
       $899.6K, which has us 82.9% of the way to our budgeted Sponsor revenue
       goal of $1,084K for FY18.  This is fantastic, only 67% of the way
       through the current Fiscal Year.  As for the remaining revenue
       categories, we have received $77.5K against a total budget of $139K or
       55.8% of our FY budget eight months into the FY.

       YTD expenses, through Dec 31st, 2017 are under budget by $79.7K.  Most
       depts. are either under budget or at budget, (Infra, due to being
       right on budget for Dec 2017 remains YTD where it was at the end of
       Nov 2017). We will continue to monitor the actual vs budget as we move
       through the remaining four months of FY18. As we finish up Jan 2018, I
       will be in contact with the dept. heads, to better forecast the final
       quarter of FY18.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $147.8K NI vs a budgeted negative <$263.9K> NI or $411.7K
       ahead of the FY 18 Budget for Net Income eight months into the FY. 
       With the current conservative forecasted revenue, and expenses for the
       remainder of FY 18, we are now estimating, at the Fiscal year end, a
       positive $12.8K NI vs a budgeted NI loss of -$167.8K or about a
       $180.6K better NI than the FY18 budget.  This is attributable to a
       combination of additional revenue and lower than budgeted expenses for
       FY18 ($139.7K more in revenue and $40.9K in lower expenses based on
       our conservative forecast).  I would also like to point out that YTD
       18 NI vs YTD 17 NI we are $372.8K ahead in Revenue while Expenses were
       only $40.1K ahead year over year, for a $332.7K increase in NI year
       over year ($147.8K positive NI in FY18 vs <-$184.9K> NI in FY 17). 
       Again, I want to congratulate the entire Foundation on these very
       positive Operating results now that we are eight months through FY 18,
       as it truly takes a team effort to achieve these types of results. 
       Now that we see what can be achieved by our efforts, we do need to
       continue to keep these efforts up as we move through the remainder of
       FY 18, and continue to give Fundraising all the support we can, while
       keeping an eye on our expenses at the same time. We should also
       recognize that the Foundation as compared to not only its FY18 budget
       but also to FY 17 actuals, is in "a very good place" and we should all
       be very proud of that fact.

       The Cash Basis Audit continues to move along.

       Asst Treasurer Report:

       - Things are running very smoothly.

       - Canceled CSC renewal - $441 just for registered agent, canceled -
         Requested refund and we MIGHT get $155 returned for the annual
         report filing.

       - Hired incorp for $104 annually for registered agent fee.  Virtual is
         filing annual report at no extra charge. Will file the first,
         correct Annual report in about a decade soon (as of 1/12)

       Question: Where to store the invoice/contract information for incorp,
       our new registered agent?

       - PackT royalties will not be sent to the ASF directly.  I will have
         to give them a personal bank account as the contract is “personal
         not business” and has my name on it.  Even though it’s royalties
         donated by Doug Cutting to the ASF.  I haven’t decided if I like
         giving them my personal account as a passthrough.

       - Network for Good database is updated and they sent a replacement
         check which was confirmed cashed.

       - A Donation Minimum will be implemented soon with Hopsie.  Likely in
         the ~$5 range as fees otherwise make it pointless and we get $1
         donations and $0.01 donations.

       - Any comments or questions to add and answer on the D&O Governance
         FAQ?

       Previously Reported Items Still Tracking w/Nothing to Report
       - Have not tested transferwise.com, pending a contractor’s help
         testing.
       - Contribution Language for Car Donations - No update.  Not a high
         priority.
       - Documenting payment privacy changes - No update but pinged so we can
         consider moving to Google instead of Dropbox since G Suite is
         donated.
       - CDARS - Paperwork is done and this should be implemented soon.
       - Will to get contracts for Virtual, Hopsie & HALO confirmed and in
         ASF SVN or drive.  Working to make sure as much as possible is
         documented.
       - Quickbooks Backups - Need to ping Virtual and check on progress for
         this.

       Work continues on the new whimsy application for inviting contributors
       to file an ICLA. For a demo please visit

       In December 170 ICLAs, four CCLAs, and three grants were received and
       filed.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Everything progressing well. Upgrades to both Jira and Jenkins being
       highlights. Good progress on GitBox tooling to perform "mass
       migration" of projects from git-wip over to gitbox, with the goal of
       deprecating the Foundation's operation and management of git
       repositories.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       A milestone was reaching - we raised more than $20K and communicated
       with 363 individual donors via Hopsie since launching on 28 March
       2017. While this number is small when compared to our overall
       fundraising activities it is notable that we have been exploring ways
       to empower individual donors for many years. This progress is very
       encouraging.

       At the request of the Presidents office, Halo have worked with VP
       Trademarks to draw up a proposal to provide support for our trademarks
       activities. This is designed to address the growing workload on our
       volunteers. I would note that this proposal is about ensuring prompt
       and appropriate attention to trademark issues where the foundation
       deems them important. It is independent of any discussion about where
       Trademark management should sit in the org structure.

       In order to set context I will remind the board of why investing in
       supporting our volunteers is important in this area, firstly I'll
       quote Phil's proposal [1]:

         1.  The ASF should provide support for some PMCs to register their
         trademarks.

         2.  The ASF should provide support for some PMCs to help ensure that
         their brands are used appropriately.

       Assuming that we have consensus on these two statements I'll go on to
       explain my own justification for providing support to our volunteers
       (shared and refined with others including VP Trademarks, VP Marketing
        and President):

         * Open source used to be mostly about sharing expertise around
           internally used software
         * Over time open source has increasingly become a part of products
           for sale
         * Open source brands have therefore become valuable as a result,
           e.g. Apache is about quality and independence, Kubernetes is about
           infrastructure standardization
         * As direct revenue is increasingly generated from software built on
           OSS, so has marketing pressure to use OSS brands to attract sales
         * The rise of “consortium led” OSS means that trademark use for this
           purpose is often seen as acceptable
         * Consequently the ASF is seeing increasing pressure to allow use of
           its marks in ways that would undermine our meritocratic model of
           independent governance
         * Therefore, the ASF needs to step up it’s protection of our marks
           so that we maintain independence within our communities

       It is my hope that the board will consider Halo's proposal and work
       through the Presidents office as we seek to build a model that is both
       cost efficient and gentle on our volunteer efforts.

 8. Discussion Items

    1. The Board's 2018 vision statement

    The following vision statement is proposed for approval by the
    Board, to be published on our Foundation blog and used as a basis
    for our 5-year plan:

    Our mission is to support communities that create and distribute
    Open Source software at no charge under the Apache License, per our
    Bylaws. To this end we provide (virtual) space and resources,
    including mentoring, for project communities to flourish, produce
    and release software under our legal umbrella.

    We are strongly committed to our projects' independence from any
    external influences, be they corporate, organizational or otherwise.
    This allows us to provide a neutral space for our communities.

    As a Foundation we intentionally do not define a technical strategy;
    that is determined by our projects. The Foundation's goals center on
    communities, as opposed to technologies.

    The Foundation is managed and directed by its Members, who are
    individual volunteers. Companies or organizations cannot be members
    of the Foundation, nor take a role in the governance of our
    projects.

    We help our communities understand and practice the Apache Way, a
    collection of practices for collaboration and project sustainability
    that we document and clarify on an ongoing basis.

    We expect our community members to act as individuals. Their rights
    and responsibilities are based solely on their merit, defined by
    what they individually do in project communities, not on any
    external affiliation, title, or degree they may have, nor on their
    contributions to external projects or other organizations.

    We provide very reliable and highly automated core infrastructure
    services to our projects. We allow projects to use external non-core
    services based on their specific needs, allowing our own services to
    remain simple and focused. For durability, all our critical data and
    services are managed or mirrored on systems that we fully control.

    Our marketing and outreach is focused on activities that directly
    support our mission, educate the public about Apache projects and
    the Apache Way, and help attract the types of communities for which
    our Foundation is a good home.

    Our fundraising-related activities help find and retain the sponsors
    and donations on which our operations depend. We seek donations from
    corporations and individuals who support our mission.

    We provide legal and brand management services to our projects based
    on demonstrated needs, and define branding policies and best
    practices to help our projects benefit from the strong Apache brand
    in an appropriate way.

    We welcome new projects via our Incubator, where experienced mentors
    help them learn to operate as Apache communities and projects.
    Incubation is where communities are defined, so we put a strong
    emphasis on guidance during the incubation phase to promote
    self-governance and preserve our core values as the Foundation
    grows.

    The board adopts this mission statement as proposed by general
    consent.

    @Sally: review the mission statement for publication

    2. Budget

    With the lay-off of the EA, the bottoms up five year projections now
    show a modest positive balance. This likely is understated for the
    following reasons:

      1. Even conservative projections show us doing better than projected
      for FY18. While much of that was due to FY17 timing issues, it still
      represents an increased amount in the bank.

      2. The model the projections use is a linear change (mostly growth)
      in expenses and revenue by category. While there may be some
      offsetting expenses we will need to incur without an EA, this amount
      is unlikely to equate to the amount projected.

      The budget worksheet has been updated to reflect the above.

    3. Call-in number changes

    The dial in number for future meetings may change. Do we still need
    a toll-free US number?

    @Sam: pursue an alternative board conference call strategy

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD (continuing issue)

The number of PMC and external requests coming in continues to exceed the
available volunteer expertise and time by a significant amount.

The current path is unsustainable, and is a disservice to the ASF, all of our
projects, and the many well-behaved outside parties wishing to use Apache
trademarks in their own work.


* OPERATIONS

The number of new requests from PMCs and external parties continues to far
outstrip the available volunteer time and expertise, resulting in a growing
backlog of questions to address.  As an example, since the past board meeting
there have been:

- 3 emails to vp-brand@ with actionable information
- 2 invoices
- 2 informational emails to tm-registrations@ (reports of registration actions
  that we've requested)
- 3 queries from counsel on tm-registrations@ requiring a response
- 58 total emails to trademarks@:
- 7 new queries/threads from PMCs, Members, or committers
- 4 new queries/threads from outside parties
- traffic on 3 threads dealing with policy questions
- Overall, at least 15 outstanding queries, mostly from outside parties,
  awaiting a final answer to their questions about Apache trademark use

Mark Thomas assisted in spotting and correcting a bug in one of our mailing
list configurations.

I co-presented "Trademarks In Open Source" at the PLI: Open Source Software
2017 - From Compliance to Cooperation law continuing education conference.

Website Analytics shows the expected end-of-year dip in overall traffic and
mostly the same kinds of trends as past months.


* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

To better document the entire registration process, including showing how much
management and coordination is done for each mark applied for, I wrote up the
9 step lifecycle for that process (one out of 24 different processes managed
in brand).

No new registration news otherwise this month.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Board Discussion Item #1: Can the board please discuss / vote adding the
phrase “at no charge” to our mission?

Board Discussion Item #2: Thoughts on licensing ASF commercially if people so
desire?  Daniel Shahaf pointed out https://sqlite.org/copyright.html.  If
people will pay for it and we give them nothing extra, any concerns?

Board Discussion Item #3: Resolution to establish VP, Sponsor Relations is on
a back burner due to the holidays and other priorities.  Expect to raise it
again soon, certainly before the end of the FY.

ASF eligibility for Benevity renewed for a year.

We closed out 2017 with $21,743.24 raised through 259 payments processed via
Hopsie. Fundraising committee meetings with Virtual continue and are
productive.  Will move to monthly now that Sponsor Audit is complete and
things are more routine.

KAM will attend FOSDEM on behalf of the ASF.  Will notify sponsors and
potential sponsors.

KAM planning to attend Buzzwords and FOSS backstage as well.

Completed the pitch deck update that was in progress.

No update about the Fundraising / MiniApacheCon Idea at GMU.  College re-opens
on the 16th of January and hope to have more movement after that.

Sent a Happy New Year's note out to Sponsors.

Had a multi-day outage on Hopsie caused by an IP block.  Looking at changing
how we proxy Hopsie as the fraud block ended up blocking our proxy.

New sponsors continue to be added and thanks version 2.0 with targeted
sponsors continues to be moved towards launch.  A few more logos to add.

Cloudera, Hortonworks also renewed. IBM is currently invoiced for 1 year and
working on the future years.  Working with Indeed as a platinum and cloudsoft
renewing.  Oath also still moving along and Bookmakers now a 3-year bronze
sponsor

Reiterating from Virtual report: “Regarding Sponsor revenue, we have received
in the first eight months of FY18, $899.6K, which has us 82.9% of the way to
our budgeted Sponsor revenue goal of $1,084K for FY18.”

No update on the Sponsor thank you / fundraising event

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are reviewing our expenses anticipated through the end
of the fiscal year. Thus far, our operations remain on budget and on
schedule, with no outstanding vendor payments due.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: work with ASF Fundraising continues.
Since formally returning to work with ASF Fundraising in March 2017,
Sally Khudairi was able to successfully secure more than $600K in
Sponsorship renewals. We raised more than $20K and communicated with
363 individual donors via Hopsie since launching on 28 March 2017. ASF
Platinum and Gold Sponsor promotions have begun and will debut early
2018; four ASF Sponsors have participated in new media opportunities
relating to Apache project and community initiatives. The “Success at
Apache” program closed out its inaugural year with the publication of
is 12th post, "Success at Apache: What a Long Strange (and Great) Trip
It's Been" https://s.apache.org/gVuN . We have also published Apache
in 2017 - By The Digits https://s.apache.org/h8do ; most of the data
points were made possible by Snoot.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:
  - 10 January 2018 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
    Trafodion™ as a Top-Level Project
  - 14 December 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces
    Apache® Hadoop® v3.0.0 General Availability
  - 13 December 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces
    Apache® Mnemonic™ as a Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: 9 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. We are preparing new ASF Sponsor promotions, which
 include "Success at Apache" and Sponsor Case Studies. 4 Apache News
 Round-ups were issued, with a total of 181 weekly summaries published
 to date. We tweeted 21 items, and have 45.4K followers on Twitter. We
 posted 10 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 109.2K organic
 impressions in total.

V. Future Announcements: one announcement is in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing
to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success
stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at
least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 9 media queries. The ASF received
2,038 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 2,119. Media coverage
of Apache projects yielded 3,214 press hits vs. last month's 5,039.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure continues to operate normally, with no issues to raise
to the President or the Board.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
* Move more content onto infra.a.o
* Move our DNS hidden master off of minotaur.a.o, as part of our
  long-term program to deprecate minotaur.
* Prepare for moving to Atlassian's "Stride" chat system, as HipChat
  is being deprecated. Initial testing has already begun, but we do
  not (yet) have a hard date on when they will cut us over.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
* Continue deprecating old hardware and operating systems, moving onto
  VMs and machines at third-party hosting services

General Activity
================
Jira underwent a major upgrade on January 14. We are now on the
almost-latest version of Jira (they released a new version last week).
This allows for some better integrations with our LDAP system and
other Atlassian software that we run.

We have continued to make improvements to the GitBox system, including
a more responsive list of respositories. We've been working on tooling
to perform "mass migration" of projects from git-wip over to gitbox,
with the goal of deprecating the Foundation's operation and management
of git repositories. We will retain a mirror/archive of projects'
repositories on GitHub (to meet Legal Affairs' requirements), but
these are much simpler to manage, being readonly and low traffic.

Our work on simplifying the LDAP system has progressed nicely. There
are some remaining items related to older operating systems, and some
external partners that we will be wrapping up. This has reduced the
number of LDAP-related incidents that we used to see, interfering with
operations of our infrastructure.

The holiday season also gave us a great opportunity to upgrade Jenkins
to its next LTS release, and to make numerous improvements to its
speed and reliability. As Apache Maven has reported, we've worked with
them to improve job management and web site generation.

Uptime Statistics
=================
We continue to maintain a high state of uptime, meeting our goals.

Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

We are still pursuing a small, collocated event alongside Berlin Buzzwords.
Sharan has taken the lead for this event. We are also still looking for venues
in North America for fall of 2018 for a full ApacheCon event.

Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

The monthly was pretty quiet, as expected since it included the Winter
holidays for many.

Discussion surrounding ECCNs for Cassandra and Kafka was initiated in
LEGAL-358 [1]. Apparently the page for a.o/licenses/exports/ did not include
entries for those projects. So far the Apache Cassandra PMC has responded with
the required updates to the page but we are still waiting for the Apache Kafka
PMC to reply. David Nalley suggested we may want to revisit our policies for
recording ECCNs. Legal advises the Board that the relevant committee
(Security? Infra?) may want to consider this.

A question regarding commercial use and attribution of ASF software was raised
and replied to by members of the Legal committee and list.

Two active threads regarding the proper location of attributions and notices
(LICENSE or NOTICE files) continues on the legal-discuss list.  No definitive
conclusions have been arrived at, but the discussions have proven quite
valuable to those participating.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

At the end of 2017 we switched to using a shared gmail account for
handling security@apache mail with use of labels to track issues.
This has already started to have a positive effect stopping the
handlers duplicating effort and allowing us to better track issues
that still need actions.

The metrics I usually include in the board report are a by-product of
a monthly walkthrough of the mailbox to spot any missed issues.  The
new handling system does not require this monthly walkthrough and so
there are no stats this month.  However we're working on scripts to
reinstate this, as well as provide more useful stats for board
oversight.

One of these reports we can now automatically create is an aging
report showing the number of outstanding security issues per project
and how long they have been open:

*       As of 2008-01-01 there were 185 open security issues across
        61 projects with median age 134 days

This metric is created automatically and each of the issues has not
been checked for accuracy.  We're working our way through these in the
coming weeks to determine the state and then our future board reports
can highlight projects where we have concerns (i.e. with large numbers
of open issues or generally unresponsive).

Attachment B: Report from the Apache ActiveMQ Project  [Bruce Snyder]

Description

Apache ActiveMQ is a popular and powerful open source message-oriented
middleware. Apache ActiveMQ is fast, supports many cross language clients and
protocols, comes with easy to use enterprise integration patterns and many
advanced features while fully supporting JMS 2.0, AMQP 1.0, MQTT, Stomp and
REST.

Activity

ActiveMQ
* Some folks are collaborating on the redesign/refactor of the ActiveMQ
  project website to give it a makeover and to better identify where activity
  is taking place
* A vote was held to make the Apollo project read-only and indicate on both
  the ActiveMQ website and in the Apollo readme that the project is no longer
  under active development

ActiveMQ Artemis
* An Artemis Roadmap wiki page was created to identify the outstanding issues
  that must be addressed by Artemis in order to achieve some level of feature
  parity with ActiveMQ 5.x. The overall objective for working toward feature
  parity between ActiveMQ 5.x and Artemis is for Artemis to eventually become
  ActiveMQ 6.x.
* The web console for Artemis has had good adoption with contributors beyond
  that of the originals contributing
* Clebert Suconic hosted a video call to walk through the Aretmis code base
  with some folks

Releases

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite, and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule, and since April 2017, it has its own independent repository.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and its
Avatica sub-project.

Calcite 1.15.0, was released in December with 50 issues are fixed by 22
contributors. Some features of note are a "server" module with DDL support;
dynamic parameters in the LIMIT and OFFSET and clauses; refactoring the JDBC
adapter to make it easier to plug in a new SQL dialect; and a data profiling
algorithm, that efficiently analyzes large data sets with many columns,
estimating the number of distinct values in columns and groups of columns.

Our community continued growing this quarter, as two new committers
(Christian Beikov and Vova Vysotskyi) were added to the project.

Finally, members of the Calcite PMC along with external collaborators
submitted a paper to the industrial track of SIGMOD 2018.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CarbonData Project  [Liang Chen]

## Description:

- The Apache CarbonData is an indexed columnar store file format for fast
  analytics on Big Data platforms (including Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark,
  among others) to help speed up queries an order of magnitude faster over
  petabytes of data, with the aim of using a unified file format to satisfy
  all kinds of data analysis cases.

## Board comment in the last month report:
  - rb: I'm fascinated by the statement that you helped 5 companies deploy
    CarbonData. Was this via the mailing lists, or was this more direct
    involvement?
  - Reply: All these discussions and help actions only be supported via
    mailing list

## Issues:

- There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

- Community is pretty active, contributors who are from 20+ different
  organizations , and now the number of contributors is more than 100+, we are
  receiving around 100-200 pull requests per month.
- A new release 1.3.0 is preparing rc1, plan to finish this release in
  January.
- In 1.3.0, there are many good features(supports spark 2.2.x integration,
  streaming ingestion, partition optimization, pre-aggregation etc.),
  especially "pre-agg feature" can improve performance 10+ times for some
  "group by scenarios".
- We organized 1 time meetup in the past 3 months(19th Nov), the meetup focus
  on helping users to use CarbonData(How to use index feature, dictionary
  feature, update and delete feature, etc.)
- Liang attended Chinese yearly open source conference in Nov, shared
  CarbonData story in Apache.

## Health Report:

- The project is healthy, community keep active in all the various
  categories(dev mailing list, JIRAs, and pull requests).

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Pepijn Noltes]

## Description:

 - Dynamic service framework for C and C++.

## Issues:

- It has been a while since the last Celix release. Primarily this was
because we wanted the PubSub implementation as part of the release and
there where still some issues in the PubSub implementation. These
issues should now be solved,  so we should be able to create a release
in the coming weeks.

## Activity:

- Some fixes where done for the PubSub implementation, this was
holding the back the next release.
- The specified config attributes (config.properties) for Celix
containers are now also added in the generated main file. This is a
step in decoupling Celix containers from specific work dir
dependencies.
- Support for adding additional services to a running dependency
manager component is added.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description:
 - Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
 and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The big push this quarter was to upgrade the Hive dependencies
   for Crunch in order to add a new HCatalog module for reading and
   writing data to the Hive metastore. This was one of the major
   upgrades to the project that we wanted to get done before the 1.0
   release, and we're working on getting the HBase version upgrades
   and fixes into the mainline of the codebase now.

## Health report:
 - Acting on the feedback we received after our last report, the PMC
   recently voted to add the primary developer of the Hive/HCatalog
   functionality as a new committer on the project, and are reaching
   out to him now to kick off the process with the ASF. We're optimistic
   about adding another new committer for the HBase work in the next
   quarter.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]


## Description: Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: Activity this quarter centered around a few efforts:
There were three primary development activities this quarter:
1) Patch releases - primarily to fix bugs found in 3.2.0 we tried to get
the first patch release out so folks don't need to depend on a .0 release.
These patches also fixed a now public CVE (CVE-2017-12624)
2) Fediz - Fediz was updated to use the latest CXF releases as well as
to fix a now public CVE (CVE-2017-12631)
3) New "microprofile" REST client - a discussion was started to
implement the MicroProfile type save rest client specification
(https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client)
within CXF.  A new module was created for it and a lot of
work has started toward achieving that goal.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

## Description:

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o Derby    : a relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
              testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
              persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Derby 10.14.1.0 was released on Oct 13, 2017.

During the fall, an audit revealed that some paperwork was missing from an
old Derby security vulnerability (CVE-2010-2232) in the MITRE CVE database.
The missing paperwork has now been supplied and the database is accurate.

Following a successful vote, the Derby community has decided to sunset
Java 8.  Derby 10.14 was the last release to support Java 8; the community
is actively working on an upcoming release which will require Java 9.

## Health report:

In general, the software in the DB project is mature and reliable,
and isn't undergoing much change. Activity continues to be low, but
stable. Periodic releases occur, primarily containing bug fixes,
and are successfully voted on.

## PMC changes:

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Stefan Seelmann]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
 - ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
             written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
             compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
             Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
 - LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
             replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
             and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
             with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
             servers.
 - Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
             used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
             designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
             application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
 - Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
             role-based access control, delegated administration and
             password policy services with an LDAP backend.
 - Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
             various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
             and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
             interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
             facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
             as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
             and mobile.
 - Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
             (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.

## Issues:

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time"

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Myrle Krantz]

## Description

Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues

## Activity

We've added committers.

We've voted on and accepted Fineract CN (formerly mifos i/o) and imported the
code into gitbox repositories.  We've made progress in deciding how to do
issue tracking, and release management on this code.

We announced the SQL-injection security vulnerability (CVE-2017-5663) which
was fixed in Apache Fineract 1.0.0.

The Mifos Initiative has involved us in Google Code In so we've had the
pleasure of making the acquaintance of many young, up-and-coming programmers
who are introducing themselves on our list. To date we've interacted with 245
students who are all working on a wide range of coding and non-coding
projects.

The Apache Fineract 1.1.0 release is soon to be ready for a vote. The
community has been doing extensive QA cycles. It will include a number of the
GSOC projects including the data import tool enhancements, two-factor
authentication, notifications framework, static analysis and more.

A vote to accept in a code donation from the Mifos Initiative of the Fineract
CN Mobile app developed by Apache Fineract 2017 GSOC intern, Rajan Maurya is
underway and should be complete before the January 17 board meeting.

Google Summer of Code 2018 applications are open now for mentoring
organizations. The Mifos Initiative plans to apply to mentor projects on both
Mifos X and Apache Fineract 1.0/CN which would be in addition to any
participation under Apache Software Foundation as an umbrella organization.

## Health report

We've made progress on our unmerged pull requests.  Documenting the process
for merging and closing pull requests in the Fineract confluence seems to have
helped.  At the time of our last board report, the oldest open pull request
was from March 2016. Currently, we've reduced the number of open pull requests
from 47 to 16.  Unfortunately many had to be closed without merging. Those
that remain are still quite old.

We also were able to resolve several outstanding issues with respect to
committers for whom ICLAs or Apache ids were missing, so that there are no
longer any voted in committers who are not on the roster.  Several of the
committers listed below in "committer base changes" were voted in and
announced significantly earlier.

## PMC changes

 - Currently 13 PMC members.
 - Avik Ganguly was added to the PMC on Sat Oct 14 2017

## Committer base changes

 - Currently 22 committers.

## Releases

- Released version 1.0.0
  https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/fineract/1.0.0/ on June 1, 2017.



## Mailing list activity:
- Subscriber counts to dev and user have been slightly but steadily
  increasing. The number of new subscribers who introduce themselves has seen
  a significant uptick, but is mostly Google Code In students.  Not all of
  them will remain with the project.
- Email counts are not completely comparable with previous quarters because in
  mid-September we rearranged what e-mails are sent to which lists. Those
  changes may have also driven changes in subscriber count to the issues and
  commits mailing lists. Hopefully, those changes will also make our dev list
  more attractive for newcomers.  This was also mentioned in our previous
  report

 - dev@fineract.apache.org:
    - 199 subscribers (up 39 in the last 3 months):
    - 659 emails sent to list (712 in previous quarter)

 - issues@fineract.apache.org:
    - 12 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 241 emails sent to list (204 in previous quarter)

 - user@fineract.apache.org:
    - 160 subscribers (up 17 in the last 3 months):
    - 143 emails sent to list (106 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Christopher Douglas]

Apache Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and
managing distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

Hadoop 3.0.0 is GA. This not only unlocks new features and development, it also
puts the project on stable footing to continue a steady cadence with less
backporting. We're not there yet, as we currently have four active release
branches to support existing users, but it is a significant milestone.

Several feature branches have merged, or are preparing to merge, for a 3.1.0
release in February.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Misty Stanley-Jones]

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of Hadoop Common
and Hadoop HDFS.

hbase-thirdparty is a set of internal artifacts used by the project to
mitigate the impact of our dependency choices on the wider ecosystem.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

HBase had three releases during this reporting period, including one alpha
release working toward 2.0.0.

- HBase 1.1.13 was released on Sun Dec 10 2017. This was the final release in
  the 1.1 branch. Thanks to Nick Dimiduk for managing releases on this branch
  for us.
- HBase 1.4.0 was released on Sun Dec 17 2017. This is the first release of
  our new 1.4 code line, the latest in the 1.x series of minor releases. HBase
  1.4.0 incorporates 660 bug fixes and improvements and several new features.
  See the 1.4.0 release announcement in the archives of our dev list for more
  details. We expect to make releases from this line on roughly a monthly
  cadence.
- HBase 2.0.0-alpha-4 was released on Mon Nov 06 2017.

In addition, hbase-thirdparty had one release.

- hbase-thrirdparty-2.0.0 was released on Mon Dec 25 2017

ACTIVITY

Development toward a HBase 2.0.0 release is going well, with the fourth alpha
released in November and the first beta around the corner. A release candidate
went up for vote for that beta, but the vote did not pass due to stability
concerns, and we are continuing work to stabilize before the first beta.
Thanks to Michael Stack for driving the 2.0.0 effort. Work toward the Beta has
continued to engage lots of discussions on the dev@ mailing list and to
increase interest in the project overall.

Work on the HBase 1.4.x line is going well, and the HBase 1.1.x line is now at
an end.

The HBase project has added five new committers during this reporting period,
with a total of 71 committers.

- Lars Francke was added as a committer on October 16.
- Rahul Gidwani and Jan Hentschel were added as committers on October 25.
- Zheng Hu was added as a committer on October 21.
- Yi Liang was added as a committer on December 20.

Thanks to PMC members, committers, and active community members for a
successful 2017 for the HBase project!

STATS

The dev@ mailing list saw a slight decrease in membership, but a marked
increase in activity. This was due to several substantial discussions about
project health, work on the upcoming 2.0.0 Beta, and discussion of new
features and design changes.

The user@ mailing list saw a slight decrease in membership and a small
decrease in the number of discussions. This is probably due to holidays.

The builds@ mailing list saw a decrease in traffic, due to significant work on
stabilizing build and test infrastructure over the past quarter.

Amaterasu

Apache Amaterasu is a framework providing continuous deployment for Big Data
Pipelines.

It provides the following capabilities:

Continuous integration tools to package pipelines and run tests. A repository
to store those packaged applications: the applications repository. A
repository to store the pipelines, and engine configuration (for instance, the
location of the Spark master, etc.): per environment - the configuration
repository. A dashboard to monitor the pipelines. A DSL and integration hooks
allowing third parties to easily integrate.

Amaterasu has been incubating since 2017-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Prepare the first release 2. Grow up user and contributor communities 3.
  Prepare documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. figuring out how to get our newest committer setup with all the things 2.
  determining how to publish to NPM during development and after releases 3.
  engaging with other "promised" initial committers who have been AWOL

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

There is growing interest in our JavaScript libraries being available via
[[http://npmjs.com/|NPM]] and we're sorting through how best to manage that
among the committers. We are also working on ''finally'' getting our newest
committer (who was +1'd back in late October) setup with an ASF account,
GitHub permissions, etc.

How has the project developed since the last report?

We have a basis API roughed in and the key dependency code will be added to
our repository once we have our NPM situation sorted.

DataFu

DataFu provides a collection of Hadoop MapReduce jobs and functions in higher
level languages based on it to perform data analysis. It provides functions
for common statistics tasks (e.g. quantiles, sampling), PageRank, stream
sessionization, and set and bag operations. DataFu also provides Hadoop jobs
for incremental data processing in MapReduce.

DataFu has been incubating since 2014-01-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Address IPMC feedback raised during graduation discussion 2. Positive
  IPMC recommendation vote for graduation 3. Continue releases

FreeMarker

FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text output
based on templates. FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class library for
programmers.

FreeMarker has been incubating since 2015-07-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  We have a large user base but a rather small group of committers. This was
  actually expected, given the maturity (and topic) of the project. While the
  FreeMarker 3 branch, which was started 11 month ago, will be much more
  appealing for contributors, development and growth due to that will
  certainly take a long time. In other respects the project is mature and
  ready for graduation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  We are eager to graduate but we're afraid that the number of active
  contributors will prevent that in the foreseeable future. But remaining in
  the incubator for several years is a growing problem as well, so at this
  point we will attempt graduation.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have two new PPMC members, Jacques Le Roux and Woonsan Ko.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There was further discussion about graduation, and we will very soon have a
  graduation vote on the podling list. We have done some preparations, like we
  have switched from freemarker.org to freemarker.apache.org as our official
  domain, created the DOAP file, adjusted home page content to align better
  with the recommendations.

  We have also made a new release (2.3.27-incubating).

Gobblin

Gobblin is a distributed data integration framework that simplifies common
aspects of big data integration such as data ingestion, replication,
organization and lifecycle management for both streaming and batch data
ecosystems.

Gobblin has been incubating since 2017-02-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make frequent releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

* Gobblin has seen an exciting growth on the community front. It has grown
  into a diverse self-sustained community, where non-committer members are
  often seen helping out each other on mailing lists and Gitter IRC (on most
  days more than the committers). Many contributors have also stepped up and
  contributed with important features and taken up ownership of critical
  components.
* 70% of commits have been from non-committer contributors.
* Email stats since last report: user@gobblin.incubator.apache.org : 92
  dev@gobblin.incubator.apache.org : 671
* Heavy activity on Gitter IRC channel (while the community uses Gitter IRC,
  it also does self policing and consciously moves any discussion-thread
  beyond casual chatter to the mailing lists)
* There have been 148 Commits since last report: git log --format='%ci' | grep
  -cE '(2017-0(9))|(2017-1(0|1|2)|(2018-0(1)))'
* 103 ie. 70% of those commits were by non-committers: git log --format='%ae
  %ci' | grep -E '(2017-0(9))|(2017-1(0|1|2)|(2018-0(1)))' | cut -d ' ' -f 1 |
  sort | uniq -c | sort -n
* Recurring video conference based meetup has been happening every month with
  healthy attendance.
* Gobblin was presented and well received in various conferences eg. Strata
  etc.
* More companies have adopted Gobblin, and different members of PPMC have
  received positive feedback and interest.

How has the project developed since the last report?

* Several new powerful features have been added to Gobblin that have enhanced
  Gobblin to be more valuable in Stream processing as it is in batch data
  world.
* Gobblin interestingly has started to evolve into an ecosystem rather than a
  singular platform with addition of major sub-systems such as
  Gobblin-as-a-Service (PaaS for Gobblin as well as non-Gobblin systems),
  Global Throttling (can be used with any distributed system) and existing
  Gobblin metrics.
* Documentation and stability has improved across the board.
* Release v0.12.0 is being voted on right now.
* The Apache way has become the normal way of doing things.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

Gobblin has made good progress on the Community front and overall as a
project. However, before calling it nearing graduation, we will like to make
atleast couple of releases.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Activity has slowed since the last report.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

We need more active committers to become more mature. Please feel free to add
your own commentary.

The GSOC period had several spurts of activity. We need to begin creating more
tickets that new committers can get involved in and find more people to do
diligent code reviews.

MXNet

Apache MXNet is an open-source, scalable, distributed and high-performance
deep learning framework that allows you to define, train, and deploy deep
neural networks on a wide array of devices, from cloud infrastructure to
mobile devices. It is highly scalable, allowing for fast model training, and
supports a flexible programming model and multiple languages. Apache MXNet
allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming flavors to maximize both
efficiency and productivity. Apache MXNet is built on a dynamic dependency
scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative
operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes
symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The Apache MXNet library is
portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple
machines.


Apache MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way --
  ONGOING. 2. Grow the community -- ONGOING. 3. Bring website up to Apache
  standard -- ONGOING 4. Identify remaining ICLAs or SGAs that need signing --
  ONGOING

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 Request the Incubator PMC to add more mentors to the project, preferably
 mentors employed with Open Source companies like Hortonworks that have prior
 experience in handling multiple open source projects that were part of an
 ecosystem.

How has the community developed since the last report?

a) Various Slack channels, dev@ mailing lists, and user discussion forums
(http://discuss.mxnet.io) are being used actively. The contributors have been
working on having all discussions on the public dev@ mailing list as much as
possible. If some discussions happen in private, they are eventually brought
out on dev@ with all perspectives well-represented. This is an ongoing
improvement process where the discussion will be put on the public dev@
mailing list so that the Apache MXNet community gets a fair chance in
influencing the final outcome/decision of the discussion.


 b) O’Reilly published a series of blogs about MXNet, including ones with deep
 matrix factorization using Apache MXNet:
 https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/sentiment-analysis-with-apache-mxnet
 https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-matrix-factorization-using-apache-mxnet

j)  MXNet 1.0 was released on 04-Dec, 2017 with extensive support and help
from various community members and timely guidance from the Apache MXNet
Mentors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

a.  The community released MXNet 1.0 that is production ready, simplifies deep
learning experience, and significantly improves performance with cutting-edge
features described here:
https://blogs.apache.org/mxnet/entry/milestone-v1-0-release-for

b. Documentation- Architecture guides, How To’s, Tutorials, and APIs continue
to be improved.

c. Support for Perl language bindings - contributed by Sergey Kolychev.

d. More advanced features (e.g. sparse tensor, advanced indexing, gradient
compression) and bug-fixes requested by the user community continue to be
added.

e. Community took complete end-to-end ownership of the continuous integration
process in order to enable reliable testing on a wide set of back ends (IoT
devices to GPU clusters).



How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  Podling is still being established in Apache and no efforts being made in
  increasing community - hence maturity == Low.

     Comments: 1. All design decisions and project
   roadmap seem to be done internally at team huddles and rarely the community
   is ever involved in making any decisions. 2. There is no effort being made
   to discuss roadmap or project issues on public mail lists. 3. All roadmap
   planning seems to happen internally. 4. No effort is being made to build a
   diverse community around the project. 5. Most committers (all of whom are
   employed by a single vendor) appear to be resistant in moving to using
   apache tools such as JIRA or adopting the Apache Way of growing diverse
   community.

NetBeans

NetBeans is a development environment, tooling platform and application
framework.

NetBeans has been incubating since 2016-10-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Donating remaining NetBeans code from Oracle to Apache. 2. Moving
  netbeans.org to Apache. 3. Voting in new committers.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Voting process for new committers has been documented for the first time,
    with mentors:
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Becoming+a+committer
  - The start has been made in voting on new committers, though because the
    process wasn't clear, we stopped and put together the document above
    before continuing.
  - All NetBeans.org mailing lists have been contacted and everyone has been
    encouraged to move to Apache NetBeans mailing lists.
  - NetBeans.org mailing lists scheduled to be deleted (they're backed up on
    MarkMail) in the first week of 2018.
  - A new Apache NetBeans announce mailing list has been created for those who
    want high level occasional announcements only, not day to day NetBeans
    e-mails.
  - GitHub commits and notifications are now sent to new dedicated mailing
    lists to reduce the noise in the Apache NetBeans dev mailing list.
  - Standard footers have been added to mails with info about how to
    unsubscribe and where to get all the mailing list info
    (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Mailing+lists).
  - Currently over 550 on Apache NetBeans users mailing list and over 350 on
    Apache NetBeans dev mailing lists
  - Continual activity on mailing lists, new pull requests coming in and being
    integrated, i.e., continually active community.
  - Status report done live with several Apache NetBeans community members,
    plus one Apache NetBeans mentor, at Devoxx Belgium December 2017:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkfX-W0tgNo

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Audit of 2nd code donation from Oracle is complete and is being processed
    for donation, see end of this page:
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Apache+Transition
  - Alpha of Apache NetBeans (incubating) has been released:
http    s://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Apache+NetBeans+9.0+Alpha
  - Beta of Apache NetBeans (incubating) is nearing completion and ready for
    vote threads:
htt    ps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Apache+NetBeans+9.0+Beta
  - A special aspect of Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 Beta is the ability
    for the user to need to specify whether they want to use the GPL-ed
    nb-javac (which is an Apache requirement, i.e., the user needs to take the
    onus of using binaries that are not compliant with Apache licensing
    requirements) or javac directly from JDK 9 (which thus complies with
    Apache licenses, though has less solid integration with NetBeans):
https:    //cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Java+Editor+Using+JDK+javac
    - see also https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-279
  - Plan was to work on Beta release during last week of the year, but holiday
    season got in the way.
  - Repo created for cleaning up netbeans.org website, with content and
    instructions included:
    https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-website-cleanup
  - New Apache NetBeans wiki-export tool has been added to
    apache-netbeans-incubator-tools:
    https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans-tools

PLC4X

PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable
logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.


PLC4X has been incubating since 2017-12-18.

Most important issues to address while moving towards graduation:

  *   Building the community: The PPMC and committer group has a large
      percentage of codecentric employees, we have been recruiting people from
      other companies, but will have to continue these efforts for
      establishing a healthy Apache community.
  *   Onboarding of new committers: With PLC4X several people on the team are
      not very familiar with the Apache Way. We have started and will continue
      our efforts on this onboarding.
  *   Podling name search: We have invested a lot of time on the name search
      prior to starting to work on the project, but we still need the official
      OK that we’re allowed to keep the Name of Apache PLC4X.
 *    Make our first release

Any Issues the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  *   In order to get access to some of the specifications the ASF will
      eventually have to become Members of some external foundations: OPC,
      EtherCat, Modbus … these memberships usually have a free level, that
      allows us to use the specifications but doesn’t result in any regular
      costs. We will have to discuss these details with the ASF and the other
      foundations.
  *   One of the external foundations (Profinet) doesn’t have a free
      membership. In general, the CEO of the European branch of the Profinet
      Foundation has signaled that it should be possible for the ASF to become
      a member and have an outside company pay the membership fees, but we
      have to discuss the details (With them as well as the ASF).

How has the community developed since the last report?

  *   We have been accepted into the Apache Incubator just a week before
      Christmas, we are still in the process of setting up
  *   Prior to joining the Apache Incubator however, we have managed to
      recruit people from other Apache projects and are working on getting
      other people familiar with the protocols and the industry involved.
      After the Christmas break we are planning on contacting a big group of
      people that have claimed to be wanting to be involved (A list of about
      20 Companies, but we can’t tell how many will be using and how many
      would also be willing to contribute)
  *   We have started the onboarding of new committers and will be continuing
      to do this (extended emails with a lot of explanations on why we are
      doing things the way we are)
  *   Project has bootstrapped quickly and we have mailing lists, website,
      JIRA etc. all set up and running.
  *   Testing coverage has been improved over the initial code base

How has the project developed since the last report?

  *   There was no last report.

How does the podling rate their own maturity?

  *   We have a mix of new participants and experienced Apache people
      involved.
  *   So far, the new participants have shown great willingness and success in
      adopting the Apache Way.
  *   However, we still need to continue:
     *   the on-boarding
     *   increasing the diversity of the team
  *   Also, will we need to decide and establish all the processes involved in
      releasing software at Apache

Traffic Control

Traffic Control is a set of components that can be used to build, monitor,
configure, and provision a large scale content delivery network (CDN).

Traffic Control has been incubating since 2016-07-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. Enhance automation to make it easier to build, install, and configure each
component. 2. Improve documentation to ease ramp-up time for new community
members and make it easier for existing community members to find what they
are looking for. 3. Complete at least two releases without license issues.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

None.

How has the community developed since the last report (October 2017)?

We held a fall summit in October in Atlanta.  This summit was attended by over
20 participants from 5 different companies.  The discussions were great and we
made sure to take any discussion that could potentially affect the community
to the mailing lists.

We cleaned up our mentors a bit by removing a few mentors who have asked to be
removed and/or have not contributed at all.

We have seen a few new users join our community, and our community has done a
good job of helping the new users get Traffic Control up and running.

The community has been working hard to get a new release out, which will be
Traffic Control 2.1.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report (October 2017), we have

  * Merged 218 Pull Requests with 392 commits from 34 contributors
  * Opened 135 Github issues
  * Closed 70 Github issues
  * 233 emails sent by 36 people on the dev@ list
  * 25 emails sent by 12 people on the users@ list

How would you assess the podling's maturity? Please feel free to add your own
commentary.

We have started discussions about graduation and we all agree that we should
try to focus on graduating in 2018.  As we see it, the biggest hurdles we
still face are: 1) Getting releases through the incubator without licensing
issues - we would like to be able to get at least two releases through without
licensing issues. 2) Removing dependencies with incompatible licenses;
specifically JSON.org and jdnssec
(https://github.com/dblacka/jdnssec-tools/blob/master/licenses/java-dnssec-tools-LICENSE.txt)
- our plan is to have these two mitigated by the end of Q1 2018.

Weex

Weex is a framework for building Mobile cross-platform high performance UI.

Weex has been incubating since 2016-11-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop more non-Chinese contributors and committers, to bring diversity
  to the community. 2. Replace Facebook's Yoga(Category X) dependency and
  release more while in Incubator. 3. Improve the developer's activity in
  mailing list, more "bad ideas".

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

The community is still learning the Apache Way,  we are making progress and
need more guidance from Mentors. An additional active Mentor would be good.

How has the community developed since the last report?

• We voted one new committer: wentao shi
• We have encouraged people to discuss more in the JIRA and dev mailing list.
  There is an obvious growth. 186(110 new issues since the last report) issues
  have been reported on JIRA, and 93(56 since the last report) of them are
  resolved or closed. And for dev@ mailing list,  more discussions were made
  in the past quarter.  Some of the discussions are about important decisions
  such as Community building roadmaps, whether to use Github issues, how to
  develop plugins conveniently, how to replace Facebook/Yoga, whether to
  create a project channel, etc. More and more non-alibaba and non-Chinese
  guys were participating in the discussions.
• More non-alibaba developers are using Weex and reporting issues, including
  developers from Tencent, Geekbang, SNDA, etc.
• Our Github repo has growth in contributors (135), forks (974), watchers
  (377) and stars (7108)
• WebSite Trends Month Active, PV(440482), UV(68347), IP(59082), New Unique
  Visitor(36063) , Session(114824)


How has the project developed since the last report?

• We have seperated the code for ducumentation & website from main repo to
  weex-incubator-site, which will be easier to contribute.
• 9 authors have pushed 36 commits to master and 36 commits to all branches.
  The community are intentionally making the committing work more slow and
  deliberate.
• Replacing Facebook's Yoga is nearly done.

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven applications
in Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We have made 1 release this quarter [1].

We believe that 1.16.0 will be the last release against version 1 of the
framework. With version 2 of the framework we plan to implement several major
changes (such as support for Java 8, compatibility with JEE 7, use of
DataNucleus 5.1 and removing deprecated functionality). Together these break
the existing API and hence warrant the increase in major version (we follow
semantic versioning).

## Health report:

The project is healthy with PMC members participating in votes and both
project members and users exchanging questions and answers on the mailing
lists.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 13 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Andi Huber on Mon Oct 09 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 13 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Andi Huber at Mon Oct 02 2017

## Releases:

 - 1.16.0 was released on Mon 08 Jan 2018

## Mailing list activity:

There is nothing significant in the mailing list activity.

## JIRA activity:

 - 67 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 74 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrea Turli]

== Description == 

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a
variety of cloud providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We have finally been able to work on adding support for OpenStack Keystone v3,
a long-standing issue that prevents us from supporting modern OpenStack
versions. We are actively testing and expect to be able to cut a new release
in the short term, which will be a significant step as this is one of the
features most eagerly awaited by the community.

Separately, the Azure ARM provider has reached a sufficient level of
completeness and stability for promotion out of the "labs" in the next
release. We have seen continuous contributions to this provider as well as
help in testing, and are happy to see that it is one of the providers getting
more attention recently.

The OpenStack Neutron API has also proven to be very stable, and we intend to
work on promoting it out of "labs" too.

Progress continues on expanding the BlobStore portable interface which now
includes storage tiers.

== Community ==

We have started to use the #jclouds slack channel and are promoting it on the
mailing list and website as an alternative to IRC. Several contributors have
already joined the channel, which has lead to productive chats about
implementation details, source code internals, etc. It seems that Slack is
more user-friendly than IRC, and it is easier to engage users there, so we
will continue to promote and use this channel.

One user has Aliyun OSS support in a private branch and we have asked them to
share this code for possible mainline inclusion.

The project continues to receive contributions in the form of code and issues
from new developers, indicating that development is healthy and that users are
feeding back their problems and feature suggestions.

There are currently 12 PMC members and 24 committers.

Last committer: 2017-02-17 (Svetoslav Neykov)

Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

- Release jclouds 2.1.0 soon, as it contains long-awaited features, especially
  around the OpenStack and Azure ARM providers
- Continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
  members

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.0.3, took place on 2017-11-30.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards for RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

There have been two releases this quarter.

## Response to previous board comment:

> Comments:
>       mt: It has been a while since a new committer or PMC member was
>        added. Is the PMC tracking any prospects?

mt, thank you for the question.

Yes, it has been about 18 months since the last PMC member was voted in and
about 15 months since the last committer was added.

The PMC is active and gets 3 or more binding votes on the hoped-for quarterly
releases. Occasionally, people outside the PMC give feedback on the release
artifacts.

No one on the PMC is employed to work on Jena; some do put in a few
work-hours.  Much of the Jena codebase is stable and "maintenance".

There are also some active contributors outside the PMC/committer base. These
people tend to focus on a specific area of the codebase and they may provide a
short burst of interaction to see through their own contribution.

We are discussing how to help sustain this engagement and translate it into
some project level interactions. We have some people on the radar and we are
discussing how to get them involved outside of their specific contribution.

## Health report:

Project activity has been significantly higher than the long-term average
because of the two releases have been done this quarter. The major new feature
in 3.5.0 needed settling into the release process. However, there was also a
bug in an unrelated area which new users could easily walk into, so the
project made another release earlier than the usual 3-4 month cycle.  In
addition, there has been ongoing development including contributions from
outside the committers.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez]

## Description:
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
   Java EE components (Java, servlets, JSP).

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Compared to last report, there has been an up-tick this quarter, where
   activity has been focused on these areas:
   * Initial support for Markdown: there is a new custom parser + renderer for
     Markdown, although not complete yet (see
     https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Markdown%20Support for
     details)
   * Fixed a bug regarding the renderer cache (JSPWIKI-1064)
   * Tests were migrated from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4
   * Generation of a test-jar, with several utilities to ease testing of
     JSPWiki custom components.
 - No questions unanswered on MLs, with at least 3 people from PMC showing up
   there.

## Health report:
 - Last report highlighted some ideas to increase contributions:
   * move to Github as primary repo: done; we're also encouraging the use of
     jspwiki as a topic on GitHub to increase contributions' visibility.
   * adopting something similar to a release train: we should release 2.10.3
     next February.
   * lower committership barrier by granting commits rights to a) any ASF
     committer. b) any other people who simply asks for it. Other than
     discussing the idea, we haven't done anything, as nobody new has showed
     up yet..

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

###########################
## Description:
 Apache Kibble is a suite of tools for collecting, aggregating and
 visualizing activity in software projects.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The past month has been quiet, between various holidays, vacations,
and illnesses. I'm sure we'll spring back into life in the coming
weeks.

We continue to hear from various ASF projects that want to participate
in the data/metric gathering part of the project.

## Health report:

 The project has sufficient (3+ PMC members) oversight.

 We remain healthy as a project, although a significant number of our
 members have been not so healthy in the past weeks.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - We voted Rafael Weingärtner in to our PMC on December 6th, 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 11 committers.
 - No new committers since graduation (October, 2017)

## Releases:

 - No releases yet. We tentatively plan to have our first release within
   the next six months.

## Mailing list and bug tracker activity:

  Activity was down over the past month, but we expect a resurgance in
  the coming weeks, particularly once FOSDEM is over.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description: 

Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues: 

No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Since the last report, we've made one minor release (1.6.0).

The 1.6.0 release focused on bug fixes, stability, and performance. Notably,
Kudu can now gracefully handle failures of local disk drives without crashing
the process.

Work over the holiday period has been a bit slower, but we continue
to make progress around similar goals of stability and easier operations
for our next release.

In response to our last report, the board offered this feedback:

  rb: Some projects find that separating committer and PMC gives you
      the opportunity to be more generous with commit rights without
      necessarily adding everyone to the PMC. It would be a shame to
      have those 6 new contributors go away feeling unwelcomed.

We discussed this briefly on the private list and the consensus seemed to be
that we haven't felt any hesitation to add committers due to the combined
PMC/committer list. In this period we added three new PMC/committers so we
don't feel like splitting the list is necessary at this point.

## Health report: 

- Subscriptions to the user mailing list are up slightly over last quarter.
  In the previous quarter we noted that mailing list traffic was significantly
  down, but in this quarter it has doubled back to previous levels.
  It appears that the quiet couple of months was not indicative of any
  trend.

- Website traffic is slightly up (unique users up 4.4%, sessions up 8.6%).
  This is within our normal quarterly fluctuation.

- Development activity as measured by code reviews and JIRA traffic is down
  a bit from the previous quarter, probably due to the holiday season.

- This quarter (Oct-Dec), we committed code authored by 17 distinct
  contributors, of whom 3 were new to the project. We added three new
  committers and PMC members.

- Collaboration continues with the Apache Impala project around our shared
  RPC library code. This has been beneficial to both projects.

## PMC/Committer changes: 

 - Currently 19 PMC members and committers (all committers are PMC)
 - Last committer/PMC additions:
 -- Andrew Wong was added as a committer and PMC on Mon Oct 30 2017
 -- Grant Henke was added as a committer and PMC on Fri Oct 27 2017
 -- Hao Hao was added as a committer and PMC on Wed Dec 13 2017

## Releases: 

 - Apache Kudu 1.6.0 was released on December 6th, 2017.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description

Apache Labs exists to incubate small and emerging projects from ASF
committers.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Another quiet period for Labs.

## Health report:

- As previously reported we have demonstrated that it is possible to generate
expressions of interest from within the committer community, but that has not
translated into positive momentum.

- Looking across the picture it is clear that, to make the service fit for
purpose we would need to adopt a git hub style of provision, and marry that up
to the benefits of ASF community membership (particularly legal), this may be
possible using the ASF->github integration, but I am reluctant to forge ahead
with this without a clear test case or better still a candidate project.

- Assuming a candidate project can be found and that the ASF->github bridge
does indeed provide us with a working option there remain two further
important hurdles, and these are more abstract.

1) The first, and most challenging of these is releases. There is a need for
a labs experiment to make releases, there is an understanding that a release
from a lab experiment would be different than a production ready piece of
infrastructure software, but when this was last discussed releases made
without proper oversight from the PMC were considered an unacceptable risk,
and proper oversight means independent corroboration of the code, which goes
against part of the lab philosophy, which is that we want to allow
already trusted people to get creative here, and not have to find another
place to kick start their one-person project. I think this might be capable of
being resolved by judicious use of branding, and a careful rephrasing of the
labs mission, but would require a board resolution to enact as "no releases"
is enshrined in the resolution that created the labs.

2) The second one is easier to achieve, we need to establish an archiving
process that allows completed and closed experiments to remain read-only in
perpetuity, which is more in keeping with the R&D spirit of labs experiments.

- Although there is a chance that this may be a solution without a problem I
personally believe that labs has the potential to play a major role in our
innovation mission, distinct from and complimentary to the incubator, and I
intend to follow up on these points in 2018.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary == 
While we are *very* slowly working towards a 4.8 release, we are
really starting to stumble. Several of the PMC and committers are still
around and semi-response to the mailing lists, but their other commitments
leave little time to help get 4.8.0 over the line to a full release. We've
started a thread to try and learn from the mailing list members what the
barriers to contribute are.

The mailing lists still see's a modest amount of traffic, questions and
answers, but it's primarily support for packages out there and less about the
work we need to do to get over the line.

Additionally, we are looking to rotate VP's of the project, but as of yet
haven't had any takers. My own obligations have unfortunately left me with
little time to actively be involved. A few of the PMC members are still around
to run the test suite and vote, and I believe we have the 3 votes required to
pass releases, but we are limping.

== Releases ==
* Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012 Working toward 4.8.0

==Board Questions==
"Missing Reports" (I'm not sure anyone explicitly asked this). As mentioned
 above, my time has been extremely limited, and we are looking to rotate our
 VP, but as of yet have had no takers. Stefan Bodewig suggests we might need
 to look towards the attic - which I believe would be unfortunate, but may be
 the reality.

== Statistics ==
* Last PMC Member Added, Paul Irwin, October 2013
* Last committer added Sept 2016, Shad Storhaug

We've adjusted our package structure with version 4.8 Beta, to be more modular
and we probably need to find a new way to report these metrics. For the older
packages:
* Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 880,370 (up from 357,422)
* Lucene.Net.Contrib 3.0.3: 202,988 (up from 95,087)

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Maven Board Report - January 2018
---------------------------

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

## Issues

  <<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

## Activity

  We've started moving more repositories to Git to improve cooperation on
  code. Until now, we used GitWIP, but this time we use GitBox: we
  were quite impressed by the self-service tooling and GitHub integration
  quality. This will surely improve a lot cooperation with developers
  community: we want to move all our projects to GitBox.

  Before moving all our (sub)project to GITBox we had to find a solution to
  keep control over the CI server jobs: Maven plugins should be tested with
  different OSes, JDKs and Maven versions. Up until now this was achieved 
  by having all plugins in a subversion folder and testing all plugins
  at once in one global "Maven plugins" Jenkins Job building. With Git 
  splitting the source code to about 40 independent source repositories, 
  this would mean maintaining 40 Jenkins jobs. Same happens for about 20 
  shared components. Maintaining single jobs for every 40 plugin and 20 
  shared component is not an option, both from development and 
  infrastructure perspectives: this would add too much jobs overhead.

  With the initiative of Stephen Connolly and support by the ASF Infra team,
  we were able to introduce a new ASF-dedicated Jenkins plugin that provide
  TLP-jobs integrated with ASF GitPubSub to reduce load on Jenkins server.
  We also wrote a shared Jenkinsfile library to ease maintenance of standard
  pipeline for Maven TLP builds.

  This cleared the path to migrate all our projects: we now have only one
  Maven-GitBox job that manages efficiently the builds for every project
  having its code on GitBox. We also have another Maven-GitWIP job doing the
  same for code on GitWIP: we expect to migrate from GitWIP to GitBox to
  benefit from extended high quality GitHub integration during the next
  months.

  There are several little bugs here and there that we're currently fixing
  to have a perfect experience, but this type of setup may be reused in
  the future for other ASF projects: we'll need to see how to efficiently
  help other projects that may be interested. Having this unusual long
  technical explanation on current board report is a first step to sharing.

  We're also currently working with Infra on an extension on this
  GitBox+Jenkins setup to build and deploy Maven site from a GitHub editing
  workflow: this may be of interest also for other projects. We'll
  probably do an Apache blog post once it is ready.

## Health Report

  We're struggling with active committers. Knowing that Maven is still the 
  defacto standard buildtool and is used by about 2/3 of the Java 
  projects/developers it is hard to take all responsibilities by keeping up 
  with the open issues and to work on the ideas we have for the next major
  versions of Maven.
  
  BOFs at conferences have been good places to make developers aware of 
  the situation. Some are offering their help at that time, but this rarely
  leads to participation in the end.

  We hope the work on Git migration with great GitHub integration will ease
  participation in the future: we've already seen some little improvement.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up 
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and 
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code 
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing 
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and 
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze 
   linked objects. The programmer are able to focus on durable object 
   oriented business logics instead of worrying about how to normalize/join, 
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity. 

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    This is a vacation month so our community has no much activities durable
    this month, basically, we have start to document tutorials, this task is 
    created by one of our contributor, and another one is to start making
    Mnemonic supporting JDK9, the JDK9 changes something that our project
    relies on, we have to migrate to JDK9 as well as be compatible with older
    versions of JDK e.g. JDK8,JDK7. Lastly we have upvoted a new committer.

Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public and no new users are appearing, but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 1 months.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 12 committers.
 - A new committer has elected and accepted to our committer base on Jan.08

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.10.0 on Mon Nov. 2017
 - Still active development on next major version (0.11.0)

JIRA Activity:
 - 15 JIRA tickets created since the last report
 - Also 3 JIRA tickets closed/resolved this period

Sincerely,
Gang(Gary) Wang on behalf of the Apache Mnemonic PMC

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
 - Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
   distribute data.
 - Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
   integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
   Java and C++ implementations.
 - Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
   including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
   MiNiFi.
 - Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
   NiFi classloader isolation model.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Conducted several releases including Apache NiFi Registry, Apache NiFi
   MiNiFi CPP and Apache NiFi MiNiFi Java. The Apache NiFi Registry release is
   a very important step forward for the community as it provides a powerful
   software development lifecycle mechanism for Apache NiFi users and answers
   a long standing request and often discussed capability.
 - Apache NiFi 1.5.0 Release Candidate under vote at the time of this board
   report writing.
 - Voted a significant number of new committers and PMC members and are
   extremely fortunate to see strong committer pipeline continue through newer
   contributors with significant contributions.
 - The PMC has identified and worked with Trademarks/Legal at Apache for a
   couple of potential trademark or licensing abuse issues.  Consensus was
   that neither issue rises to the level of requiring any specific official
   response though in one case we intend to provide a courtesy notification to
   a commercial entity that is heavily leverage Apache NiFi source code
   without any attribution.  It is more of a poor form issue than a real
   problem. Thanks to several highly experienced Apache Members who helped
   discuss the threads in detail.

## Health report:
 - Health of the community remains strong. Mailing list and JIRA activity is
   consistent. ASF Hipchat is serving as an on-ramp for new users to our
   mailing list and JIRA systems. We continue to see new users and
   contributors.
 - The PMC continues to demonstrate ability to detect and handle potential
   trademark issues though it needs to focus better on staying tight and
   prompt on security matters all the way through resolution.
 - As we called out in our previous report we anticipated significant
   recognition of earned meritocracy within the committer and PMC ranks.  That
   held true and the pipeline remains encouraging.

RELEASES

Nutch 1.14 was released on Dec 22 2017.

The last release on the 2.x branch (2.3.1) dates to Jan 20 2016.


CURRENT ACTIVITY

We released Nutch 1.14 in December with 37 issues fixed and 41 new features
and improvements, contributions made by 20 developers.

We see an increased activity on Jira and github with contributions from new
developers kept on radar for committership.

We plan to release 2.4 during the next weeks.

We hope to participate again in GSoC and continue with the project
"Graph Generator Tool for Nutch" which was started last year during GSoC 2017
by Omkar Reddy and made huge progress upgrading the Hadoop API but did not
address the graph generation as described.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description:
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open Data
Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of OData. It
currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is the OASIS version of
the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.

## Olingo Status
Olingo has no issues that would require board attention. We released a patch
for the V2 code line in December to fix small bugs but had no major new
features. The V4 code line is still seeing new features but the main new
features should come when the OData 4.01 specification is released. The
specification is in a public review since June 2017 at Oasis.

We still see good discussions on the  user mailing lists and new JIRA issues
contain patches on a more consistent basis which shows that the community is
still working with Olingo.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Peter Kovacs]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## STATUS

The activity within the project continues to grow. With the latest releases
more traffic came into different mailing lists. The release frequency is
rising. Overall showing a slow recovery of the project in different areas.
Limitations of capacity of development is an ongoing concern.


## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

There are no current topics to be concerned with.

## ISSUES

No topics

## RELEASES

The current release is Apache OpenOffice 4.1.5. It is necessary due to
regression issues that were reported recently and need to be fixed since
occurring in 4.1.4. Release Management prefered an own release for 2 reasons:

1) The new release team has build some routine with bugfix releases, which can
be seen in the shorter release cycles in the last releases. 2) The next Major
release is our next big thing. A lot of efforts has to be invested in this
release before a final release is ready. The wait time for users has been
considered as to long to wait.

The desicion to go for another bugfix release was a good one in retrospect.
The team has managed to release the regression fixes within the same quarter.
This is the first time OpenOffice has released 2 updates close together.

The next major release will be 4.2.0 with a target to publish in 2018. In
opposite to the 4.1.x releases it will include new features and bigger
enhancements but of course also bugfixes.

new PMC members remains on a stable level.

Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N. McKenna (knmc) Last PMC
member withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)

## Committers

There are 140 committers as of 2018-Jan-09. The recognition and invitation of
new committers is also on a stable level.

Last committer addition was on 2017-Dec-18 Guenter Feierabend (guenterf) Last
committer withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)

## ACTIVITY

## Organization

The project has changed its chair as Marcus Lange had the role for over 1 year
and it was agreed to change it every 12 month. Therefore we had a vote with 2
candidates. Peter Kovacs (petko) has won the election and is now the new chair
since 2017-Dec-20.

## Development and Release Engineering

Currently the project is busy with the next major 4.2.0 release. Dev builds
are already built on routine bases.Testing on a low level is ongoing, more
detailed testing will be the next topic. Upgrades to the build system is
ongoing.

Current activities focus on the reactivation of the localization team.
Documentation, process and tools are undergoing a complete review. The current
activity focus on:

+ importing the latest work by translators into the OpenOffice code.
+ updating Pootle strings to match trunk (the first Pootle update in years).
+ give translators the possibility to test their translations with dedicated
  builds.
+ add new languages to the next major release if translators manage to
  complete their work in time.

Further activities are:

+ first view tests are run on the dev builds.
+ upgrading the building environment.

The arrival of new developers is very low. But the current committers are
willing to help where possible. Improving the mentoring of newcomers and
expanding the capacity to address major issues is a key factor for the next
time. Some issues and easy tasks are selected to act as training for the new
developers.

## Fairs and events     

Apache OpenOffice is represented on a few fairs and events which is managed
regularly by a small and fine team. This will continue in 2018.

## BRANDING

In average there is nearly 1 request per month for use of the marks - but it's
decreasing in the last months. The same for reports about suspected trademark
misuse (or confusion about selling of Apache OpenOffice binaries, e.g., on
eBay).

## Board feedback (comment from the last october board meeting)

  mt: Reading the "2.0.7 release" thread on private@ it appears that the
  project is dependent on a single committer for at least a sub-set of
  regression tests. Could you explain this in more detail please. If there are
  tests the community depends on, I'd expect to see those tests in an ASF
  repository where any committer can run them.

These tests are not classic regression tests but tests on a large amount (>
500000) of files. The results are compared to the results of a previous
version and then committers investigate files with some extreme negative
differences or with new exceptions. The same is done (on an even larger scale)
for Tika, see [1] and [2]. The Tika tests need 4TB, and the files can't be
hosted on a public ASF repo or released under the Apache License because the
files largely derive from Common Crawl or the internet generally, and
copyright/licensing would pose a problem. There is a special vm to host the
described test and it is possible to grant access to all interested
Tika/PDFBox committers. Tilman already got his access bits in december, so
that at least one other committer is able to run those tests if needed. Maybe
others will follow.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Samza Project  [Yi Pan]

## Description:
 - Apache Samza is a distributed stream processing engine that are highly
   configurable to process events from various data sources, including
   real-time messaging system (e.g. Kafka) and distributed file systems (e.g.
   HDFS).

## Issues:
There were comments from board members requesting answers from PMC in the last
report. I have answered in an email earlier. Just to include the answers again
since it seems to be asked multiple times:

Board questions: jj: I am assuming the LinkedIn meet up occurred?

  rb: I'm very concerned that Mark has asked a question two quarters in a row
  and still received no response. It's not even so much that the question
  itself is urgent, but that you don't appear to be reading board feedback to
  your reports.

  ps: The 9/12 meetup at LinkedIn was announced on the dev list on 8/24 and
  9/12. It appears to have been open to all interested parties. Attendance
  does appear to have required an NDA signed by attendees. It looks more like
  info share than anything actually project dev related. Here is the link from
  the mail to the dev list:

      https://www.meetup.com/Stream-Processing-Meetup-LinkedIn/events/242656767/?_cookie-check=UErnFE0-NfeCLKWx

My previous answers to the above questions:

A. Yes, LinkedIn meetup was hold on 9/12

B. Yes we do read board's feedbacks and I have already responded with answers
to Marks question in July:
https://mail-search.apache.org/pmc/private-arch/samza-private/201707.mbox/%3CCAFvExu15wywrCpfcxEjUduC2nJs9UgFKCVyti5sFLQ7wi2moog@mail.gmail.com%3E

C. To restate what I have answered in my response to Board's feedback in July,
the meetup was announced via Meetup website, advertised via LinkedIn, tweet,
and Samza dev list. We share the usage information, discuss the features
needed and pain points user has encountered. Once a while, we also share our
development roadmap on big features coming in Samza. Those are all dev
related. Testimony in the exact link listed in the response, you can find the
following description in Redfin's presentation: "Samza is being used at
Redfin, and suggest some features that we'd like to see in Samza". And here is
another meetup where we talk about the roadmap of Samza development:
https://www.meetup.com/Stream-Processing-Meetup-LinkedIn/events/234454163/.
And new features like async API in Samza in yet another meetup:
https://www.meetup.com/Stream-Processing-Meetup-LinkedIn/events/237171557/,
and high-level API in Samza:
https://www.meetup.com/Stream-Processing-Meetup-LinkedIn/events/238303422/.

Hope that I have answered all your questions.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
 Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation
 uses to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.
 
## Activity:
 No activity of note this period. Activity is expected to pick up in the
 coming months as the annual members meeting is anticipated, but prior
 to and following the meeting. Some off-list interests in the project
 (namely hacking a bit on it) have been received - we'll see if this
 results in actual participation or not :)
 
## Community health:
 Community remains the same as last period, no changes. We conducted a
 poll on the PMC last period and concluded there was sufficient
 oversight on the project. That remains true.
 
## Releases:
 No official releases have been made yet. We will likely be reviewing
 this after the annual meeting and decide on whether to craft a release
 or not. Having a release might help add users/developers and grow the
 community.
 
 
## PMC changes:
   
 - Currently 5 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Rich Bowen on Mon Apr 20 2015

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Streams Project  [Steve Blackmon]

## Description:
- Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online
  activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets
  accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
  streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- We have completed all known PMC setup, infra, code, and website refactoring
  work due to graduation.
- We now have streams.apache.org on CI/CD with no manual steps for the first
  time ever.
- We have completed our first TLP release, Apache Streams 0.5.1.
- Apache Streams 0.5.1 adds code for interfacing with Twitter’s new account

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made two GA releases in the last quarter.
* Struts 2.5.14 - full GA release including bug fixes and feature enhancements
  (2017-11-23)
* Struts 2.5.14.1 - security fix release (2017-11-30) [1][2]

In the last quarter the team was able to focus more on improvements and bug
fixes after having to mainly deal with security issues and communications in
the previous reporting period. We also noticed increased community
contributions, which we regard as a good sign.

We had to deal with a few security reports and resulting issues, that we were
able to cope with in a timely manner. The issues were mostly related to 3rd
party libraries used by the Struts framework.

The team chose to move our repositories to GitBox [3] and seems to be very
happy with this decision, as it helps to streamline our development efforts.

In the last quarter Yasser Zamani (yasserzamani) was added as a new committer
(2017-11-14). Stefaan Dutry (sdutry) accepted our invitation to join the
Struts PMC (2017-11-06).

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [David Meikle]

## Description:
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from, a
growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognised by IANA and other standards bodies.

## Issues:
- There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

## Board Questions:

  - mt: Why was the "2.0.6 release" thread on private@ ? It looks as if it
    could/should have been on dev@
    - It started off on dev@ but it looks like Tim was trying to ask can it be
      pushed ahead of ApacheCon and 'moved' it on private@
    - We will avoid this in the future.

  - bd: Note that the names of people who haven been invited to join the PMC
    but haven't replied yet shouldn't be included in reports, in case they
    decline.
    - Apologies, will note this for the future.

## Activity:

- Apache Tika 1.17 was released in December with key updates including:
  - Automatic image captioning
  - Phonetic run handling in Excel and Word
  - Many bug fixes and improvements
- We've now changed our repository with master now focusing on the 2.x series

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop released versions 3.2.7 and 3.3.1 in this last reporting cycle.
Both were basically maintenance releases as a whole, but both included the
first official convenience releases of Gremlin.Net for the .NET community
(prior versions were just release candidates). Development has started on
the next releases in 3.2.8 and 3.3.2. These releases will again focus on
bug fixes, but may include initial support for gremlin-javascript which
will allow the Javascript community to have more native support for
TinkerPop in their language.

In the wider TinkerPop community, Amazon announced their new TinkerPop
enabled graph database called Neptune[1]. In a separate announcement, we 
have also learned that Microsoft's Azure Cosmos DB is now ready for general
availability[2]. Finally, it was learned that the Bitsy[3] graph database
and the Pixy[4] graph pattern matching and logic programming language have 
both been upgraded to support the latest version of TinkerPop 3.x (these 
pieces of software were originally developed on TinkerPop 2.x years ago, 
which is not compatible at all with 3.x so it was nice to see them available
to users again).

TinkerPop has a new committer with the addition of Kelvin Lawrence.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.2.7 (December 17, 2017)
- 3.3.1 (December 17, 2017)

## PMC/Committer:
- Last PMC addition was Robert Dale - April 2017

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]

## Description:
 - A Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java WebSocket and Java
   Unified Expression language specifications implementation.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
-  Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
   responsiveness on both dev and user lists.
-  The Tomcat event in London went very well and funds were
   set aside for future similar events. The event logs were made
   available on the http://tomcat.apache.org/presentations.html
   page on the website.
-  Similar to the TomcatCon one day event in London, another
   community conference event is pencilled in for Spring,
   probably in Frankfurt.
-  Tomcat 9 milestone cycle ended following the release of the
   new Servlet 4.0 specification, and a beta release cycle has
   started.
-  The community is exploring switching from svn to git. We have
   identified a number of questions / issues and are working through
   those on the dev@ list prior to the actual migration.
-  The community is starting to look at building out some ALv2
   licensed training material which could then be used in some
   future events.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 26 PMC members.

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 44 committers.

## Releases:
 - Apache Tomcat 7.0.82 was released on Oct 3 2017
 - Apache Tomcat 8.0.47 was released on Oct 3 2017
 - Apache Tomcat 8.0.48 was released on Dec 12 2017
 - Apache Tomcat 8.5.21 was released on Sep 19 2017

## Trademark:
 - No new trademark issues in the last 3 months
   and  there are currently no outstanding trademark issues that the
   Apache Tomcat PMC is working on.
 - Detailed history is available at:
   https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/tomcat/trademark-status.txt

## Security:
 - Detailed status:
   http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html

 - Important: Security Constraint Bypass CVE-2017-7675
   Versions Affected:
   Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0
   Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.22
   Apache Tomcat 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.46
   Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.81

   When running with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly
   initialisation parameter of the Default servlet to false) it was
   possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted
   request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained
   would be executed by the server.

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Activity:

Last Board Report was on Dec 20th, 2017 and due to holidays there is
not much activity to report, hence this report is brief.  A reminder
to the Board, the project is taking focused efforts to increase
activity and enable potential committers.  In the few days of the new
year we are seeing familiar faces who are not yet committers return
with a few PRs.  In the last week the PMC has started discussion on a
potential committer.  Both of which are good signs of a gradual
incline in activity.

TomEE 7 remains the most active branch with fixes periodically going
to TomEE 1.7.x.

Attachment CA: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]



Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to
SOAP/XML based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations.
Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within
Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite
mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed,
and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure
the project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since
SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of the art,
we don’t expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new
committers, etc...

With the holidays, not much has happened at all since we filed the special
report for the Decemeber board meeting.   There have been a few commits
to wss4j as we prepare a new patch release there and some cleanup
commits in Axiom, but not much else.

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)

Releases this period:

WSS4J - implementation of WS-Security and related technologies
* 2.1.11 - Sept, 2017
* 2.2.0 - Sept, 2017


Last releases for other technologies:
*  Axiom  1.2.20 : Oct 2016 (StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model)
*  Woden 1.0M10 : Sept 2015  (WSDL 2.0 implementation)
*  Neethi 3.1.0 - May 2017 (WS-Policy framework)
