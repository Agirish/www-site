 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month saw a lot of growth and some great steps forward for the
       ASF.  Apachecon, North America was a great success, thanks to hard
       planning and execution work by quite a few ASF volunteers.  Special
       thanks to Ruth Suehle for her leadership on this event. We also made
       good progress evaluating options for long-term financing of the ASF.
       The plans here are in early stages, but strong progress was made over
       the last month due to great collaborative effort by ASF Fundraising
       and Finance. Finally, we held a kickoff meeting to start work on the
       update to the 5-year strategic plan for the ASF.

       Project reports this month showed growth in quite a few projects and
       some success reinvigorating communities that had previously been
       struggling. Reports from Avro, Incubator, Jclouds, Nutch and Streams
       were all complimented by Directors.  Several communities were
       encouraged to share best practices and / or success stories on
       dev@community or in a success@apache blog post. There was not much
       critical feedback this month - mostly just encouragement to continue
       community growth or to help people move along from contributor to
       committer to PMC member.

    B. President [Sam]

       As we are moving into the year and past the point where timing
       considerations dominate, an all too common picture is emerging:
       fundraising exceeding targets, and spending below authorized levels. 
       This argues for either a change in the way we do planning, or (and
       probably more likely) an increased tolerance for risk as we approve
       plans, particularly given our large buffer.

       Brand Management operating normally, tracking 26 issues.

       Marketing is also operating normally, and providing considerable extra
       value through cross-committee liaisons.

       ApacheCon was a success, four events are "in flight".

       TAC provided assistance to 10 individuals and the dinner was notable.

       Finance remains a quiet area.

       As of this posting, infrastructure hasn't posted.

       The fundraising report merits special attention (and in a good way)
       and the "Endowment Preliminary Research Report" part merits brief
       board meeting time this month.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s Financial performance for the
       first five months of FY19.

       Operating Cash on Sep 30th, 2018 was $2,096.3K, which is up  $41K from
       last month’s ending balance (Aug 18) of $2,055.3K.    Total Cash as of
       Sep 30th, 2018 is $3,489.2K ( includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation) as compared to $1,727.5K on Sept 30th 2017. The Sep 2018
       ending Operating cash balance of $2,096.3K represents an Operating
       cash reserve of 13.5 months based on the FY19 conservative Cash
       forecast average monthly spending of $154.8K/month.  The ASF actual
       reserve  of 13.5 months at the end of Sep 2018 is ahead of the
       budgeted 11.4 month reserve for YTD through Sep 2018.  The ASF
       Operating reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of
       the ASF’ s size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, the ASF, with regard to Income,  was ahead
       vs the FY19 budget and has now caught up and exceeded where we were at
       this time in FY18 .  With regard to the FY 19 Income vs Budget, YTD, 
       we are up $34.3K in total. We are now ahead of where we were this time
       last year in all Revenue categories.

       YTD expenses, through Sep 30th, 2018 are under budget by $329.1K, with
       just about all depts being under budget.  Infra as noted in the Board
       summary is $89.7K under budget due to Timing of hiring of staff and
       timing of Lease web invoices.  The other major timing issue is
       Conferences is under by $115.1K, which will draw closer to the budget
       as the final bills come in.  In addition to this we will be performing
       a review in Oct to make sure all Conference related expenses are in
       the appropriate expense lines .  We have moved most of the dept
       underspending forward in the Cash forecast and will be reviewing the
       underspending with the departments as we move forward in FY19 Q2.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY 19 the ASF finished with a positive
       $40.3K NI vs a budgeted negative <$323.1K> NI or $363.3K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This was
       attributable to some timing of Sponsor payments offset by more
       Donations than were budgeted as well as underspending in just about
       all depts YTD, vs the FY19 Budget.  At this point in the FY we are
       doing well, ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses.  We
       will continue to monitor this as we move further into FY19.

 7. Special Orders

    A. Establish the Apache ServiceComb Project

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues steaming along and our monthly committee meetings
continue.  Our next meeting is on the 24th.  As of this month’s financials,
we are 40K in the black for the FY and 364K ahead of budget with revenue
ahead of targets.

Event sponsorship for 2018 has topped $195K with two more sponsors for the DC
Roadshow likely and a few more in discussions.

The Sponsor Lunch during ApacheCon in Montreal was very successful. 
Sponsorship for ACNA 2019 is being ducked in a row and a draft prospectus was
produced for the planning committee. Happy to say that 3 people took the
ambassador training with Sally at ApacheCon (Ted Liu, Craig Russell & Bob
Paulin).

We've also been exploring how Fundraising might use OfBiz

Sally, Daniel Ruggeri and KAM have been meeting with platinum sponsors to
discuss the endowment collecting answers in a spreadsheet.  The introduction
letter is at
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TV29CJvidVr1hxnkqnhi05mGVbty1ohvIIbPrzL1GL4/edit We
hope to present results from 6 meetings with sponsors during the
board meeting.*

We are working on a revised Targeted Sponsorship policy to handle
targeting just a particular project.  Several dozen comments were received on
the matter so it will take some time to properly respond.

Finally, Kevin is exploring a way to support udemy, pluralsight and udacity's
requests to work with the ASF to provide content to their subscribers.


* Endowment Preliminary Research Report 

The support for the endowment is overwhelmingly positive[1].  Daniel, Sally &
KAM spoke[2] to 5 platinum & 1 gold sponsors and, in general, they view an
endowment as a good idea and as a sign of maturity for the foundation.

Beyond that, the fundraising committee is in a catch-22 where endowment
funders definitely want “something” in return for their contribution and
“something” needs to be defined.

There were some interesting concerns such as not wanting to contribute too
little leading to negative press for being cheap as well as not allowing
investment vehicles that are pro-tobacco or pro-gun.  But overall, the
framework of only ceding the control of the corpus seems to be a viable
method to gain their trust and provide a benefit that is within the Apache
Way.  (See "What are the consortium members promised?" in
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xDGGTV9ErNEJwGe7dk_17K7AeKFvOwHkC46Kg4yZtgQ/edit)

Another tenable idea from the discussions was setting up an advisory board
from the endowment funders proving non-binding input to the board on matters
to be decided.

The people we spoke to were the contacts for the budgets for normal
sponsorship.  Overall, there will be concerns that they would be able to fund
either the endowment or the normal sponsorship.  A few stated that they would
not be the right contact for such a sponsorship but all offered to be the
conduit to the right people when we are ready.

[1] Responses:

[2] Questions Asked:
https://docs.google.com/a/gsuite.cloud.apache.org/forms/d/1-Xucr48ITEpEBDqiupJxsIYrdySw0CRnwCas-kUkVMw/edit?usp=drive_web

For the platinum sponsors, we mentioned verbally that the minimum would
likely be ~$500k

We also discussed the voting idea which might have prejudiced their answer. 
The same with the advisory boards though this was brought up by some
sponsors.  In general though, the vote and the advisory board will likely
give the sponsor evangelists something they can “sell” internally to justify
the endowment.

Introductory document:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TV29CJvidVr1hxnkqnhi05mGVbty1ohvIIbPrzL1GL4/edit

Recommended Next Steps:
- Send the Google Form to All Sponsors for their Input
- Report to the board next meeting on the results
- Discuss what the board is willing to provide as a benefit, if anything, in
  exchange for the endowment (e.g., voting, advisory board).
- Setup a Finance Committee to review chaired by the VP Finance and recommend
  a scenario to the board for the Nov board meeting

planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to
announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are
requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice
for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 11 media queries. The ASF received 1,551
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 2,285. Media coverage of Apache

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Last month we held ApacheCon North America in Montreal. By all
possible measures, it was a success. We oversold tickets by roughly
20%. We recovered costs, and even came out ahead, financially.
Comments from attendees were overwhelmingly positive.

A more complete event report will be sent to the Board of Directors in
the coming weeks, once final numbers are in.

We are now heading towards the DC Roadshow -
http://www.apachecon.com/usroadshow18/ - which is to be held at George
Mason University on December 4th. The call for papers closed 2 days
ago (as of meeting time) and schedule selection is ongoing. We have
begun promotion of the event, and will ramp this up once we have a
schedule.

Other events which are in flight are:

ApacheCon North America: we are working on a venue contract, and I
anticipate that we'll have something in-hand by meeting time. We will,
tentatively, be in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, on the week of September
8-14, 2019. This event will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the
Apache Software Foundation, and we strenuously encourage directors and
officers to plan to attend. We also ask that you reach out to
colleagues from the early days of the Foundation who may not be
reading our lists any more, and encourage them to attend the
celebration.

ApacheCon Europe: We are in discussions with a producer to have
ApacheCon Europe in the Autumn of 2019 in Berlin. This discussion has
slowed down during the ApacheCon busy period, and we hope to reboot
this in the next few weeks.

Apache Roadshow Chicago (2019): Discussion is ongoing around an Apache
Roadshow in Chicago. We do not have any details at this point, but we
do have an enthusiastic group of volunteers dedicated to making it
happen.

Coordination of all of these events happens on two lists:
dev@community.apache.org for general discussion and feedback;
planners@apachecon.com for those actually willing to volunteer and
make things happen.

Meanwhile, the VP Conferences is taking a few weeks of semi-down-time,
and you can expect renewed activity towards the beginning of November.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Not long back from Montreal so hopefully some stats to report next month.
overall though it was a TAC success; with 10 attendees helping the event
organizers make a smoothly run event. Everyone did their bit to pitch in where
it was needed. Thanks also from me go to Chris Dutz and Nick Burch for the on
site running of things.

TAC dinner as usual was a favorite among the attendees - some of our post
conference surveys are indicating this was a huge factor in helping out
attendees make the most out the week, both in terms of getting to know the
faces of the organisers and other attendees, but also that of the invited ASF
long timers, the chats had throughout the dinner are always a rewarding part
of the process.

As mentioned, please look forward next month to some stats, and to links to
public blog posts, surveys etc from our participating TAC attendees.

TAC is also still on the lookout for other smaller events to assist with
during the year.

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

Hello everyone, while it was again a relatively quiet month, with
regard to the endowment inquiry as was discussed at the Sept 2018
board meetings, some carefully selected meetings with Sponsors have
been set up and will happen in Oct. Other items of note is there has
been an increased level of discussion around the "Targeted
Sponsorship" opportunity which has led to some good discussions around
how when they occur, need to be tracked and accounted for. Take care


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Andy Seaborne (andy@) has joined the W3C Solid Community Group. As this is the
first ASF member to join, ASF has signed the W3C Community Contributor License
Agreement and acknowledged the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.

Solid CG: "The Solid project aims to improve privacy and data ownership on the
Web through a proposed set of conventions and tools for building decentralized
social applications. "


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

There are currently no known legal issues that would require board's
attention.

The transition from Chris to Roman & Henry has been completed this month with
Henry driving much needed work on grooming the backlog of the LEGAL JIRAs and
working on the ones that started to get a little stale.

As part of the transition we had a con call with Mark Radcliffe and David
Gross from DLA Piper with Roman and Chris present from the ASF side. Mark
mostly elaborated on the current state of things but also reiterated a few
points that resulted in legal-discuss thread around ICLA vs CCLA policies.

We see usual amount (roughly a couple per week) of Q&A happening on the legal
mailing list and LEGAL jira.

Roman and Henri have been assigned to lead "ASF Services - Legal" section in
the 5 years plan.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

{quote}I would like to propose that we start adding lagging
issues (over 365 days?) to the stats{quote}?

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

Clean-up focus is on issues that are more than 90 days old where no
CVE name is yet assigned (therefore still in "investigation" state)
has completed; from 17 issues in August to 2.

Stats for September 2018:

       9        [license confusion]
      15        [support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 32 (last months: 37, 32, 39)

      6	        [ofbiz]
      3	        [cloudstack]
      2	        [httpd], [impala], [jmeter]
      1	        [ignite], [incubator/airflow], [incubator/heron], [kafka], [mesos], 
                [myfaces], [openoffice], [pdfbox], [poi], [portals], [shiro],
                [sling], [spark], [struts], [tapestry], [tika], [tomcat]

     In total, as of 1st September, we're tracking 87 (last month: 89)
     open issues across 45 projects, median age 86 (last month: 113)
     days.  57 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     4 (last month: 8) of these issues, across 4 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  We expect to close at least 1 of them this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Chris Mattmann]

This month we will send an RFC to the board and legal on our updates to the
ASF data privacy policy that VPs Infrastructure and Privacy worked on. The
draft is currently in GDocs and we should move it to a draft ASF page on the
web site.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It
specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat
and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern
hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy streaming
messaging and interprocess communication. Languages currently supported include
C, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, MATLAB, Python, R, Ruby, and Rust.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

- The Arrow and Parquet communities resolved by vote to merge their respective
  C++ codebases in the Apache Arrow repository. This work was completed this
  quarter
- The project received two code donations via IP clearance: a GLib interface to
  the Parquet C++ libraries, and the Gandiva LLVM vectorized Arrow expression
  compiler
- Work has commenced on R language integration with the C++ libraries
- An initial MATLAB binding to the C++ libraries was contributed
- The community is discussing receiving a proposed native implementation of
  Arrow in C# .NET

## Health report:
- The project is very healthy, though rapid user and contributor growth has
  stressed the limits of our developer tooling and put a great deal of burden
  on the active project maintainers

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 24 PMC members.
 - Antoine Pitrou was added to the PMC on Mon Aug 20 2018

## Committer base changes:

semi-structured data.

Activity:

- Development and discussions are active, the community is healthy and
  engaged.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Henk P. Penning]

## Description:
PMC Attic is responsible for the oversight of projects which otherwise would
not have oversight.

## Issues:
FYI ; After the transfer of XMLbeans from Attic to Poi, board asked Attic to
document the "un-Attic" policy. On a attic.a.o, under "Process of leaving the
Attic again", we have added this :

+ * [option 4] Transfering to an existing PMC
+ A receiving PMC must be willing to assume all responsibilities that come
+ with running a project : maintain code, answer questions, fix bugs,
+ publish releases etc.
+ If the Board does not object, PMC Attic will transfer the project's assets
+ (code-base, TLP website, maven group-id etc) to the receiving PMC.
+ After the transfer the receiving PMC will report to the Board about the
+ project's activities, and publish project releases in the PMC's dist area.

One point remains ; Attic would like the board's advice on the following. The
Board of Directors Meeting Minutes July 17, 2013, section 7.E says :
[https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2013/board_minutes_2013_07_17.txt]
... RESOLVED, that the Attic PMC be and hereby is tasked with oversight over
    the software developed by the Apache XMLBeans Project; and be it further
    ...

As far as Attic knows, Attic is still formally tasked with this oversight.
This is not correct, because the XMLBeans software is now under the care of
PMC Poi. Attic wants to know how this inaccuracy can be formally remedied.

## Activity:
Attic retired project Lucy.

## PMC changes:
- Currently 20 PMC members.
- Jan Iversen left the PMC on Wed May 19 2018
- Last to join the current PMC : Hervé Boutemy, July 2015

## Committer base changes:
- Currently 25 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Jan Iversen at Thu Mar 16 2017
- Jan Iversen left the project on Wed May 19 2018

## Releases:
- No release can be made in attic

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Thiruvalluvan M. G.]

## Description
Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

## Issues
The project currently has no issues that requires board attention.

## Major previous milestones

* Last release: 1.8.2 on May 14 2017
* Last PMC addition: Suraj Acharya on Apr 13 2017
* Last committer addition: Daniel Kulp and Ismaël Mejía on Oct 05 2018

## Activity

The Avro project is in a state of disrepair. The committer base is extremely
bandwidth limited for reviews and running RCs. At the same time the PMC is
similary limited on time for actively mentoring contributors who are potential
future commiters. The matter has recently reached a level of concern
sufficient to start a discussion on both our private and dev lists[1]. The
existing PMC appears to still have a sufficient level of participation to
remain viable; in the sense that at least 3 binding votes are cast when a
specific VOTE is called.

The PMC is currently attempting to self-correct by way of aggressively adding
committers with the express goal of transferring project responsibilities to
those whose stated desire to contribute more to the project's health is
reflected in activity driving towards our major current project gaps: release
cadence and contribution reviews. To date we've voted in 4 additional
committers (two of which are still pending some stage of onboarding) and an
additional PMC (still pending entry into foundation records).

Current activity in JIRA / GitHub / mailing lists reflects the increased
activity from those contributors who are taking on added work with an eye
towards eventually leading the project.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

As for previous reports, activity remains on the low side. Progress on the
project has been made in further development on the new experimental core
branch.

See further information below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

Since the last report progress remained pretty slow until the PMC Chair
attended PyConUK and announced Apache Bloodhound as one of the projects
interested in running a sprint. This brought at least enough interest that
the Chair was not left working by himself! While this did not result in
anyone being interested enough to contribute directly to the project, the
willingness to help out with advice resulted in a fair amount of progress
through the addition of django-rest-framework and django rest swagger. The
results of this work have recently been added to the experimental django
based core branch in the svn repository.

In the last report it was implied that there was a desire to look into
working on the bloodhound core experiment with git. No firm progress has
been made on this but it is high on the Chair's agenda to look into making
this happen and see how other projects interact with github.

Although progress may continue to look disappointing, the PMC Chair
continues to suggests on behalf of the PMC that there is an ongoing desire
to defer the proposal to move Apache Bloodhound to the Attic to beyond the
next report to the board.

Two PMC members have also been discussing the possibility of organising a
sprint. Details of this are still to be worked out but it can be expected
that any such event will look to be accessible to a wide audience beyond
current project committers.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Michael Mior]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular, a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and its
Avatica sub-project.

Calcite 1.17.0 was released mid-July with a new multi-dialect SQL parser as
well as the use of JDK 8 features in the core. Avatica Go 3.1.0 was released
early September followed by a bugfix release shortly after.

We have continued to have a steady string of new committers with solid
contributions.

Julian Hyde attended ApacheCon on Montreal and gave two talks about Calcite.
One of these talks was part of the day-long Geospatial track sponsored by the
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), and triggered some good interactions with
other Apache projects that are doing Geospatial work; there seems to be
growing momentum for these projects to increase involvement with the OGC.

## Health report:

Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both Calcite and
Avatica.

HTTP, JMS or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: Activity this quarter centered around a few efforts:
Relatively quiet quarter, likely due to summer vacations and partially due

             replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
             and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
             with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
             servers.
 - Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
             used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
             designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
             application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
 - Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
             role-based access control, delegated administration and
             password policy services with an LDAP backend.
 - Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
             various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
             and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
             interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
             facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
             as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
             and mobile.
 - Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
             (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.
 - SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification.

## Issues:

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

Per sub-project:

 - ApacheDS: good activity: Release of 2.0.0.AM25. Code quality 
             improvements. Continued work on transaction support.
 - LDAP API: good activity: Release of 2.0.0-AM1 and 2.0.0-AM2.
             Cleanup in LDAP message encoding/decoding code.
 - Studio:   good activity: Release of 2.0.0-M14.
 - Fortress: good activity: Release of 2.0.1 and 2.0.2. Talk at
             ApacheCon NA.
 - Kerby:    good activity: More work on new "Hadoop Authentication
             Service" and 2.0.0 release preparation.
 - Mavibot:  no activity
 - SCIMple:  good activity: IP clearence done. Discussion about
             release process.

## Health report:

  Overall development activity (commits, development related mails,
  resolved issues, releases) was higher than previous quarter.
  This is mainly caused by release activity and initial high pull
  requests activity of the SCIMple sub-project.

  The PMC feels the project is healthy.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Myrle Krantz]

## Description

Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues

Pull request backlog for Fineract 1.x: there are 28 open pull requests.

## Activity

Two active development areas:

Fineract 1.x FIneract-CN (including microservices front end UI)

GSOC is winding down.  Fineract has four GSoC interns:

Dilpreet Singh Ebenezer Graham Ruphine Kengne Pembe Miriam

Newly selected committer, Aleksander Vidakovic is configuring the Apache VM
infrastructure for a public demo server for Fineract CN - a request for
additional infrastructure was made to Apache board and approved. Progress is
slow because we're all doing it in our free time.

OSCON - Fineract attendees included Myrle and Ed, both gave talks that
included Fineract articulation.

ApacheCon, keynote, three talks and a dinnertime meetup.  Fineract is
especially grateful that so many members of our project could attend on TAC.

Fineract CN APIs documentation initiated

Lowering barriers to contribution is being discussed, with the idea that
non-committers can also review pull requests.

Lazy consensus has been adopted and documented in Committer's Zone

Fineract 1.x was moved to gitbox to make merging PR's easier.

## Health report

Community development is ticking along, PR's are coming in.  On Fineract CN
they are mostly being merged; on Fineract 1.x we need to improve.  On the
whole, we're doing well.

## PMC changes

- Currently 13 PMC members.

## JIRA activity:

FINERACT 1.x & Fineract-CN together 373 open issues, many of these stale and
assigned to non-active members. Cumulative Flow Report shows increasing volume
of "to dos", a tiny percentage of "in progress" and a relatively stable number
of "done".

FINERACT project Jira creation is down and resolution is up.

- 14 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 12 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

FINCN project tickets weren't previously being captured.  With FINCN added,
the numbers now look like this.  Future comparisons should be against these
numbers.

Incubator PMC report for October 2018

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 52 podlings incubating. During the month of September,
podlings executed 10 distinct releases and there are several ongoing votes
on releases for October. We added 2 new IPMC members.

In September one podling Pulsar graduated and one podling Gearpump retired.

BatchEE still seems stuck in performing the last graduation steps and needs
some nudging over the line. Several other podlings are heading towards
graduation or retirement. There was one IP clearance.

The number of podlings (one) that didn't report has fallen from last month.
They have been asked to report next month. Of concern is Weex who failed to
respond to queries on both the dev and private list. There seem to be
little activity on the dev list other than GitHub traffic. One podling
Warble failed to get sign off from it's single mentor.

The situation with Milagro is concerning as they missed reporting many
times, the PPMC are inactive or didn't realise that they were on the PPMC
(they do now). Despite yet another strong suggestion to retire, they still
want to restart the project. It may be  difficult to do so as the project
never really got started at Apache and most of the initial committers
haven't signed ICLAs. They did however report this month.

The Superset podling (as reported last month) seems to have a few other
issues (see mailing list), but they are responding and fixing the issues
and a mentor (Jim) was sorting the situation out. However they are
continuing to make unapproved releases and Jim has retired as a mentor.
It's currently unclear if any of the other mentors are active.

MXNext had several new mentors added to help with diversity among it's
mentors.

An email was sent out to all inactive mentors and we've had 60% respond,
most of those who responded have indicated that will step down. So far 24
mentors have asked to be removed and it's likely that most of the 26 who
haven't responded are inactive and will need to be removed. Good news is 9
have asked to continue. This has left several podlings with only a one or
two active mentors, which is no change from before but now we know the true
situation. We have had a few people ask to be a mentor and several mentors
who were inactive, and who asked to stay on, have showed signs of increased
activity.

I just want to thank all the mentors for their past work and for those who
recognised that the best thing that they could do for their podling was to
step aside. Missing signing off 3 board reports in a row turns out to be a
useful metric as a proxy for mentor activity (about an 85% correlation).

In the discussion on what to do about podlings tasked with writing bylaws /
guidelines in their graduation proposal, there's general consensus that
podlings should be not asked to do this. A draft minimal default set of
guidelines has been created. This will be brought to the boards attention
in the next few weeks.

A new question has been added to the report asking podlings if they are
getting enough support from their mentors, hopefully this will identify
missing mentors earlier. A number of podling just copied and pasted from
previous reports and didn't notice this new question.

A small change to the incubator proposal template should help with podlings
taking too long to incubate or at least frame their expectations.

Airflow

Airflow is a workflow automation and scheduling system that can be used to
author and manage data pipelines.

Airflow has been incubating since 2016-03-31.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Once we make a release with the licensing fix we will move forward with
  graduation.
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
  No!

How has the community developed since the last report?
  1. Since our last podling report 1 month ago (i.e. between September 4 &
  October 1, inclusive), we grew our contributors from 548 to 580 (32 new
  contributors)
  2. Since our last podling report 1 month ago (i.e. between September 4 &
  October 1, inclusive), we resolved 151 pull requests (currently at 3114
  closed PRs)
  3. Since being accepted into the incubator, the number of companies
  officially using Apache Airflow has risen from 193 to 206, 13 new from
  the last podling report 1 month ago.

How has the project developed since the last report?
  See above : 151 PRs resolved, 32 new contributors, & 13 new companies
  officially using it.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?
  Tao Feng on Aug 3

Have your mentors been helpful and responsive or are things falling
through the cracks? In the latter case, please list any open issues
that need to be addressed.

--------------------
Amaterasu

Apache Amaterasu is a framework providing configuration management and
deployment for Big Data Pipelines.

It provides the following capabilities:

Continuous integration tools to package pipelines and run tests.
A repository to store those packaged applications: the applications
repository.
A repository to store the pipelines, and engine configuration (for
instance, the location of the Spark master, etc.): per environment - the
configuration repository.
A dashboard to monitor the pipelines.
A DSL and integration hooks allowing third parties to easily integrate.

Amaterasu has been incubating since 2017-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow up user and contributor communities
  2. Prepare documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  A concern was raised by a mentor that the community is too small and not
  active enough and that Amaterasu should consider retiring. We did a roll
  call, and identified a total of 5 individuals willing to contribute as
  volunteers.
  We'll keep tracking the activity and reassess whether to retire within a
  few months.

How has the community developed since the last report?

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Since the last report Amaterasu has hit it's first major milestone -
  the project's first release as an Apache Project.
  * Out of 27 issues for the next version 11 are done and 2 are in progress.
  * One organisation we are aware of have decided to start a project using
  Amaterasu with the intention of using it in production.

Milagro

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Rebuild the team
  2. Edit the code for the first release
  3. Expand the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We need support to restart the project management and to make the code
  released.

  This project have been stalled for several month because initial
  committers from Miracl unfortunately stopped activities from external
  reasons.
  We already have a set of codes that will work as the initial product, and
  it will need some editorial (and possibly legal?) efforts to release.
  The idea of retirement was put to the vote and was rejected, and we are
  working for restarting.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No new committers.
  Some people are joining the conversation at the dev mailing list to help
  the restart.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We are worked for the first release of the crypt library part, and the
  code seems technically stable enough to release.

Have your mentors been helpful and responsive or are things falling through

  Mentors are helpful in starting the restart.
  Sometimes the members lack very basic information about the management in
  ASF, so we will be work better if more input is given.
  It may lack the continuous help and responsive support in getting the
  things done.

  The project's open issues are:
  (1) List committer candidates with ICLA status,
  (2) Give access to the official repository for committers who already
  signed ICLA,
  (3) List all the repositories that contain codes for this project,
  (4) Analyze status of each repository, possibly including legal status
  (5) Edit and merge the code and push to the official repository.
  (6) Release

  We need help and guide by mentors to address the issues from the
  following aspects:
  (A) Input on Apache's process, source of information, or use of the
  toolset,
  (B) Helpful facilitation for communication with PMCs and the community,
  (C) Guide how the output code/document should be.

  Mentors are requested to submit a ping message on the mailing list
  regularly that asks any blockers to encourage the communication among
  mentors, PMCs and the community.

NetBeans

NetBeans is a development environment, tooling platform and application
framework.

NetBeans has been incubating since 2016-10-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. DNS handover, e.g., for netbeans.org and planetnetbeans.org, needs to
  be finalized on the Apache side, Oracle having handed everything related
  to domains over now.
  2. 3rd donation, focused on tutorials and images, and related ancillary
  items.
  3. 4th donation, focused on C/C++ features.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Three virtual meetups have taken place to connect community members and
  discuss activities, all recorded and published on
  blogs.apache.org/netbeans.
  Around 20 in attendance at these, at the last one there were reps from
  Oracle, Apache infra, and Apache NetBeans, discussing the way forward
  with the domain handovers.
  - Currently 622 (588 in last report) on Apache NetBeans users mailing
  list and 438 (422 in last report) on Apache NetBeans dev mailing list.
  - Ken Fogel to represent Apache NetBeans at ACNA 2018:
  https://apachecon.dukecon.org/acna/2018/#/scheduledEvent/7e6b57d36ccd834f2
  - Several community members to be present and present at Oracle Code One
  2018:

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Final release of Apache NetBeans (incubating) 9.0 released:
  https://netbeans.apache.org/download/nb90/nb90.html
  - Article about status published on InfoQ:
  https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/08/netbeans-apache-update-aug18
  - Roadmap put together for the first time:

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Apache+NetBeans+Release
+Roadmap
  - Current focus is on Apache NetBeans 10:
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Apache+NetBeans+10
  - Successfully completed cleaning up the root directory of GitHub repo:
  [[https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans (done together as a
  community, see
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NETBEANS/Per-cluster+repository+
layout).
  - The legal title to the trademarks has passed in full to Apache, by the
  signing of the Trademark and Domain Assignment agreement.
  - i.e., brand and domain handover have been completed on the Oracle and
  Apache sides, aside from the DNS reassignment, see above.
  - Removed single point of failure of non-Apache released binaries from
  Oracle to Oregon State University Open Source Lab:
  https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans/pull/899

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Improve feature set to attract companies and refill the gap Sun/Oracle
  and IBM left behind
  2. New collaboration feature for companies needs further documentation,
  performance testing (and be merged) to attract companies.
  https://github.com/svanteschubert/odftoolkit/blob/odf-changes/README.md
  3. Fulfil the 1.0 version

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
  Traction of new developers (esp. from companies) goes slow.
  There had been repeated government sponsorship directly last winter:
  https://prototypefund.de/project/documents-for-democracy/
  and just started for this Winter on new feature sets:
  https://prototypefund.de/project/papierloser-alltag/

How has the community developed since the last report?
  New bug reports yet no new committers.
  Presentation for HTML based real-time editors has been created and held
  at LibreOffice Conference 2018 Tirana last week.
https://github.com/svanteschubert/odftoolkit/blob/odf-changes/LibOCon2018%20
%20-%20Interoperable%20Office%20Collaboration.pdf
  Providing information on how to become an ODF application with the new
  odf-change feature.
         
How has the project developed since the last report?
  CKSource (developer of CKEdit5) have been visited, but yet without
  commitment yet.
  The documentation and performance (tests) of the ODF change
  interoperability feature has been improved, but still ongoing.
  His previous collaboration feature runs finally full-featured with
  green regression tests on his GitHub fork and was not yet merged into the
  main  branch.
  Merge needs to be done before October, so the new sponsorship can focus
  on source code generation from the ODF XML grammar loaded into Graph
  Database (Apache Tinkerpop).

PLC4X

PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable
logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.

Most important issues to address while moving towards graduation:

  Building the community: The PPMC and committer group has a large
  percentage of codecentric employees, we have been recruiting people
  from other companies, but will have to continue these efforts for
  establishing a healthy Apache community.
  Onboarding of new committers: With PLC4X several people on the team are
  not very familiar with the Apache Way. We have started and will continue
  our efforts on this onboarding.

Any Issues the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  Not at the moment.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  While the community activity had been quite low since the beginning of
  the project, things changed in August.
  Then we noticed not only new names appearing on the list, but the number
  of emails on the list grew by 400%-500%.
  Also did we get several pull requests from about 5 new names,
  contributing to multiple areas.
  Two of them got added to the Committers and PPMC groups.
  The others were one-shot contributions without any further communications.

In September Christofer Dutz had two talks on PLC4X at two conferences:

  *   Solutions Hamburg 2018
  *   ApacheCon NA 2018

  An article on PLC4X by Christofer Dutz was published in the German Tech
  Magazine: iX
  (Link to the article:
https://www.heise.de/select/ix/2018/8/1533352444905693)

  Also, just before ApacheCon we also had our first PLC4X Meetup where
  several current contributors as well as very interested new people were
  present.

  Also did we successfully vote in our first two new committers and PPMC
  members.

  *   Julian Feinauer (pragmatic industries)
  *   Andrey Skorikov (codecentric)

  Finally just before finishing this report we also finished our first
  release:
  Version 0.1.0

  Our mailing list subscriptions went up another 9 to currently 38
  subscribers.
  Our Twitter followers increased by 18 to 59 followers.

  On GitHub we now have 24 “Stars” and 14 “Forks”

  Business interest has increased dramatically as more and more companies
  are signalling their willingness to try out PLC4X and some are currently
  even in the transition phase of porting their products to PLC4X.

How does the podling rate their own maturity?

  We have a mix of new participants and experienced Apache people involved.
  So far, the new participants have shown great willingness and success in
  adopting the Apache Way.
  However, we still need to continue: the on-boarding increasing the
  diversity of the team.
  After our first official release, we will now fine-tune this release
  process and try to educate other people on the team to also be able to do
  releases.

Have your mentors been helpful and responsive or are things falling
through the cracks? In the latter case, please list any open issues
that need to be addressed.

  Yes. All of our mentors have been responsive and have helped.

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built
on top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and
query processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across
multiple nodes.
Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through SPARQL, a conventional
query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase diversity of committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The community is moving towards graduation: restarted discussion on
  graduation and started to complete the items required for this step
  * We welcome new users and contributors from Semantic Web Company. A CCLA
  from Semantic Web Company is being worked on.
  * Received multiple logo proposals. Community discussed and voted a new
  logo
  * We lost two mentors, but the remaining two mentors are very responsive
  and helpful

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Changed RdfFileInputTool to accept multiple input paths, so it can load
  RDF data from multiple folders
  * Changed from guava's iterators to Java collection's iterators to avoid
  versioning issues due to the recent change in Guava's
  Iterator.emptyIterator visibility
  * Minor improvements to code and documentation

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

## Description:

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven applications
in Java. Users only write POJOs and Apache Isis handles the database and UI
automatically at runtime.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We did a first release of version 2.0 of the framework [1]. This includes
release included upgrades and support for Java 8, DataNucleus 5.1, Wicket 8.

We were approached by diffblue [2] and received a pull-request [3] that 
contained automatically generated tests to increase code coverage. This 
initial request was made with an offer to provide, at no charge, more than
8000 generated tests. After some discussion, the PMC decided that we did 
not see significant value from the tests but instead a significant potential
maintenance burden.
  
## Health report: 

We consider the project to be healthy with PMC members participating in
votes and both project members and users exchanging questions and answers 
on the mailing lists.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 14 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrea Turli]

== Description ==

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

Project development has slowed down. Most contributions are bug fixes and
small additions, but no big features have been developed recently.

We are getting continued contributions to the DimensionData provider, and we
hope we can move it to a stable state and release it out of labs soon.

We are also actively working with the Karaf community to move our
jclouds-karaf integration to Java 8. This is taking more time than we
expected, but the Karaf community is taking ownership of this and is directly
working on jclouds-karaf. They also proposed to implement a Karaf compute
service in jclouds to leverage jclouds provisioning features to provision
applications Karaf and manage their lifecycle. We look forward to discussing
this as we think it would be a great new functionality and addition to
jclouds.

== Community ==

We continue to receive contributions from several individuals. We've found
that having the slack channel facilitates communication and training, as the
codebase has a considerable learning curve. In particular, there is a
contributor that is doing great at learning new technologies. He opened a pull
request a while ago but he is still actively addressing issues, tweaking, and
learning. His feedback and participation in slack are being valuable for us
and we are happy to see this kind of new contributions and engagement.

Mailing list activity is low, mainly because all recent contributions have
been mostly bug fixes. Also, slack conversations are mostly about training and
explaining some isolated codebase internals, so there are not many things that
are relevant to be moved to the mailing list.

Two of the most active PMC members have changed their job recently, and
although their day job was not about directly contributing to jclouds, it was
related to the project, so we expect their code contributions and related
activities to decrease since the new jobs are not related to the project. We
have not many active PMC members, so this is a situation we will have to
handle carefully and plan accordingly if we see that this change affects the
project.

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

* Release jclouds 2.2.0 with Java 8 support.
* Keep engaging the slack contributors and propose them as new committers.
* Monitor the PMC and ensure we have enough resources to properly manage the
  project.

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.1.1, took place on 2018-08-16.

We finished and released the implementation of JSR-374 and JSR-367. Current
focus is now to optimize the performance and stabilize the new features. We
also recently added "Portable Java Contracts" to provide the widest OSGi
compatibility.

## Releases:
- 1.1.10 was released on Mon Sep 17 2018
- 1.1.9 was released on Mon Sep 03 2018

## Committers and PMC membership:
The last committer we signed up was Jonathan Gallimore on May 09, 2018. The
last PMC member was Reinhard Sandtner, added to the PMC on August 30, 2016.

## Project activity:
Since the last report there was mid activity. We some some more external
contributions than usually via github.

We had 15 new Jira tickets and closed 13 tickets. On the mailinglist there a
no unanswered questions left. On the dev list we have 39 (+3) subscribers
currently and 10 msg sent per week. Since last report we saw mailing list
activity from a few new people.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez]

## Description: 

 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

 - 2.10.5 was released on September, featuring page restore functionality to 
   recover unsaved page edits on Haddock editor, improved usability for 
   mobile and touch devices, a bug fix and a few minor things
 
 - We decided to switch to 2.11, meaning we'll probably broke some backwards 
   compatibility. We'll also update to Java 8 and Servlet 3.1/ JSP 2.3 and
   finally switch to Haddock as the default template
 
 - Given that our current pace is slow, we'll probably release some 
   milestones on the following quarters. This just means we'll haven't 
   finished transitioning to 2.11, but the releases should be as usable as 
   always.   
   
## Health report: 

 - No questions unanswered on MLs, with at least 3 people from PMC showing 
   up there. No potential candidates for PMC/committership yet.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description:

 - Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
   Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues:

 - No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Since the last report, we haven't had any releases (the last release was
   1.7.1, on June 7th). However, we are working on the next minor release which
   we expect to publish in mid-October. It will include the usual bevy of bug
   fixes and performance improvements, as well as some smaller features based on
   user and operator feedback from past releases.

## Health report:

 - User mailing list subscriptions didn't grow, and traffic was up 10% this
   quarter. We've noted this in past board reports but it bears repeating: it's
   difficult to learn anything from these metrics. Questions are generally
   answered quickly and overall traffic is quite bursty.

 - Website traffic growth is down slightly: about -2% for users and -5% for
   sessions since the last quarter. This is within our normal quarterly
   fluctuation. Relatedly, the Kudu blog has been quiet for most of 2018, but
   we've been working to change that. We published two new posts in September
   which is a lot when the average monthly post count is zero.

 - Development activity (measured by code review and JIRA traffic) is down
   slightly (reviews -13%, JIRA +12%, commits -17%). Code was authored by
   28 unique contributors (+10 since last quarter) of whom 9 were new to the
   project (+6 since last quarter). So no real change in activity, though
   it's heartening to see so many different contributors, and quite a few of
   them new to the project at that.

 - We've been working on a process to publish test artifacts as part of Kudu
   releases so that other projects can better test their Kudu integrations. An
   Apache Beam contributor helped develop a proof of concept which can be found
   here: https://s.apache.org/dj5N.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache MADlib Project  [Aaron Feng]

## Description:

- Apache MADlib is a scalable, big data, SQL-driven machine learning 
framework for data scientists.


## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

- Aaron Feng (PMC Chair) visited Pivotal in Palo Alto in 
August and held discussions with a few other committers on 
the topics of new features and testing infrastructure. 

- A MADlib community call on the topic of the last 1.15 
release occurred on 2018-Aug-23.  The presenters were project
committers Jingyi Mei and Frank McQuillan who reviewed
the main 1.15 features and gave some demos using Jupyter notebooks.
Demos included: variable importance in decision trees,
column/vector operations, and momentum methods for neural
networks (multi-layer perceptron).  Here is the link to the 
community call:   https://youtu.be/9JpPWuiqweU

- Community is currently working on the 1.15.1 release which
will be 5th release as an Apache TLP project.  We expect 
voting on release artifacts in Oct.

- Ideas for the 2.0 release are being discussed in the JIRAs
and mailing list and may include model management and deep
learning, depending on community interest and contributions.

- Apache MADlib has been referred by two 2018 VLDB papers:

“In-RDBMS Hardware Acceleration of Advanced Analytics”
http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1317-mahajan.pdf
Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, Vol. 11, No. 11

“A Comparative Evaluation of Systems for Scalable Linear 
Algebra-based Analytics”
http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p2168-thomas.pdf
Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, Vol. 11, No. 13


## Health report:

The community is relatively small but very engaged with robust mailing 
list traffic, interest in doing frequent releases and new 
functionality being developed by contributors. 

The number of developers actively contributing to the code/documentation 
is approximately 9 in the 3rd quarter of calendar year 2018,
which is about the same as the last report.

We will constantly be on a lookout for new community members to be 
invited either as committers or PMC.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Maven Board Report - October 2018
---------------------------

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a standardized
coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build lifecycle.

## Issues

  <<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

## Activity

  We were hit by INFRA-16893, which caused all Jenkins jobs on Windows to
  fail. The ongoing notifications of failing jobs implied that we could not do
  reliable commits, unsure if we introduced regression or if this was caused
  by INFRA-16893. We've spent quite some time to solve this and to try to get
  most jobs back to green.

  Robert has been accepted to join JCrete this summer. A lot of people were
  shocked by the small amount of volunteers that maintain Maven. This
  unconference had a couple of results:
  - Introducing the Jira label 'up-for-grabs'
  (https://s.apache.org/up-for-grabs_maven) which should point to issues we
   expect are easy to fix. If people want to help improving Maven, these
   issues should be a good start.
  - On the final day an ad hoc hackathon was organized: How to contribute to
    Open Source projects (like Maven), hosted by Robert. He guided the group
    through the process, which resulted in a couple of Pull Request. Some are
    are available at Central by now, e.g. the latest maven-jxr-plugin.

  Hervé and Karl Heinz are doing talks for JUGs in their own country and
  Hackergartens to help get contributions. Robert is traveling to
  international conferences to talk about Apache Maven and JavaNext (i.e, 9,
  10, 11 and 12-ea).

  Preparations for a new release of Maven have started.

## Health Report

  During the summer the activities on this project were reduced, committers
  enjoyed their vacations, spending time on other important things like
  family.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

## Description:

- Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources
  away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and
  elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Community Activity:

- 2018 MesosCon planning is ongoing by members of the PMC and the
  community.

## Health report:

- The project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features, reviews
  and releases. The mailing lists, slack and IRC channels are also very much
  active with healthy discussions. Multiple active working groups
  (containerization, performance, API, community).

## PMC changes:

- Currently 45 PMC members.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Metron Project  [Casey Stella]

## Description:
Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order
to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis.  Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
The community actively worked to get the 0.6.0 release, which included a
new UI around packet capture analysis. This expands our capability greatly.

We also are more active in our use of the ASF Slack and it's been a useful
driver to mailing list discussions.  In particular, I'm very gratified to
see some procedural discussions involving how to get larger features into
the product via feature branches.  We have enough experience and at a wide
enough range of good and bad experiences to start to encode good practices
in the bylaws.  Ultimately, I am happy at how the community has reacted to
pain by discussing openly.

## Health report:
Mailing list activity is steady and, as I said earlier, we are using Slack
more.  We are vigilant to push discussions to the mailing list when they
become more involved, so I think it's not affected mailing list engagement
as I had earlier feared.

Given the sustained growth in the last 2 quarters of the UI components, I'd 
say that we should look to adding committers in that area.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 27 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Justin Leet on Sun Dec 03 2017

## Committer base changes: 

 - Currently 38 committers. 
 - Mohan Venkateshaiah was added as a committer on Thu Sep 13 2018

## Releases:

 - 0.6.0 was released on Wed Sep 12 2018

## Mailing list activity:

As you can see from the statistics below, we're seeing
dev list usage largely flat, but significant growth
in the user related list usage (106% growth for user@)
with near flat subscriptions.  I interpret that to mean 
the last two releases have resulted in users who were 
watching Metron to transition into users of the project.

Now, as you can see, the absolute numbers of emails is small,
so I will monitor this metric in the next quarter and see if
the growth is sustained.

 - dev@metron.apache.org:
    - 207 subscribers (up 4 in the last 3 months):
    - 284 emails sent to list (284 in previous quarter)

 - issues@metron.apache.org:  
    - 40 subscribers (up 4 in the last 3 months): 
    - 3221 emails sent to list (2632 in previous quarter) 

 - user@metron.apache.org:  
    - 275 subscribers (up 3 in the last 3 months): 
    - 93 emails sent to list (45 in previous quarter) 


## JIRA activity:

 - 152 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 157 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

I'm concerned that the JIRAs created and closed are so closely
aligned.  I would have hoped to see more created vs closed as
an indication of usage yielding feature/bug-fix requests.  I
will also monitor this metric in the next quarter.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Sathwik]

## Description:
   Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web services
   orchestration using flexible process definitions.

## Issues:
   Unknown if there is still a user community. There is no dev community
   anymore. Thus, the decision that a move to attic makes sense. PMC is in
   the voting period to move towards Attic [https://s.apache.org/cYNK].

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description: 
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.

## Olingo Status
The Olingo project is still healthy and has no issues that require board 
involvement. 

With the latest 4.5 release we shipped a lot of bug fixes and small
convenience features.
The V2 code line is mostly deprecated with only 4 commits in the last 3 
months. 
JIRA and mailing list discussions are on a low but steady pace.

I have also personally announced on the private Olingo mailing list that 
I would like to resign from my responsibilities as a VP. I have made 
this announcement because I currently do not have the time to contribute 
to Olingo and thus have lost the overview of what is happening within the 
community to some degree. Missing the last board report although I was 
aware of the timeline has shown me that someone else needs to take over.
There is currently a mail thread on the private Olingo list about who 
wants to take over the VP responsibilities. As there has not been a 
conclusion yet I have not send a formal resignation to the board.

Comments from last report:
  rs: is there any reason not to invite at least some of the non PMC
      committers into the PMC?
  Negligence on my part. I had lost track about who is committing on a regular 
  basis from the committer pool. Also after checking the JIRA briefly I saw some
  names on a regular basis that don`t even have committer rights. I hope that my
  sucessor will pick this up and will drive this forward.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Peter Kovacs]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## STATUS

The activity within the project has been low during summer month. People
started to be more active very late in this quarter. Our main focus is
currently divided, between OpenOffice development topics and Infrastructure
topics. Branching and volunteer recruiting receive only little attention.


## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

There are no current topics to be concerned with.

## RELEASES

We are still preparing 2 releases.
4.2.0 is the next minor release, planned to be released into a beta phase
within this year. Currently we have some blockers that have to be solved
before we can take next steps.
4.1.6 is a small maintenance release, rescheduled for November. Stuck until
recently when the release manager found time. We have now picked up speed.
Plan is until end of month to have a release candidate.

## latest Release History

2017-12-30 4.1.5 2017-10-19 4.1.4 2016-10-12 4.1.3

## PMC

There are 28 PMC members as of 2018-Apr-11.

Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N. McKenna (knmc) Last PMC
member withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)

## COMITTERS

There are 141 committers as of 2018-Apr-11.

Last committer addition was on 2017-Jan-28 Kay Schenk (kschenk) Last committer
withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)


## ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

No Changes to report. We have some new volunteers that make some first steps.

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We are processing the migration towards new VMs or the Wikis and Forums and
taking over the maintenance from infra for these systems.

However due to the summer month, we did not finish the migration, yet. We
missed our own plan. We have now a deadline of 30th of November from Infra. At
this date the old VMs will be switched off. We are confidant and eager to
finalize the migration until this deadline.

We have initiated a new VM payed from the Project Funds, for a reviving the
OpenGrok Service. So far we currently wait for the VM to be accessible.

We still use the Apache CMS for our web presence. It seems it is currently
unmaintained and unsupported. The recommendation is to migrate to a different
setup. Resolution to this issue is acceptable in a mid term time frame.

## MARKETING
The German community is producing new flyers for the Booth team in German and
English. We are looking for translators into other languages.

We have applied for an own booth on FOSDEM next year, answer still pending.

   Directors.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Virtually no activity this quarter, the project is to be considered
   as being in hiatus. There are expectations that the project will
   again start to pick up some steam as we get into the next quarter and
   thus closer to the annual members meeting.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Streams Project  [Steve Blackmon]

## Description:

- Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:

- There are a lot of changes occurring in the APIs of our supported data sources.  Due primarily to the EU's GDPR legislation, a user's ability to collect profiles and posts from accounts other than the authenticated account is being limited.
- On the other hand comprehensive data about the authenticated account (sometimes via bulk export not via API) is becoming richer, presenting an opportunity for the project to assist users in awareness of the data collected about them by third-parties, and with data portability between systems using bulk export archives.

## Activity:

- Steve Blackmon presented initial support for social media export archives and Activity Streams 2.0 at ApacheCon NA 2018.

## Health report:

Mailing list and commit participation was reduced this quarter.  Adding committers and growing the PMC needs to be a focus this year.
 
## PMC changes:

- None. There are currently 8 PMC members.  The most recent PMC addition occurred on July 19, 2017.
 
 ## Committer base changes:
  
- None. There are currently 8 committers.  The most recent PMC addition occurred on July 19, 2017.

## Releases:

- Apache Streams 0.6.0 was released on June 17, 2018

## Upcoming Project Initiatives:

- More support for RDF/JSON-LD Activity Streams 2.0 vocabulary as well as JSON Activity Streams 1.0 vocabulary.
- Continue developing the new functionality that sources data from export archives of online services (twitter, facebook, google, etc).
- Complete release version that includes binary distribution and official docker container.
- Drop remaining maven dependencies on java SDKs for accessing third-party APIs in favor of HTTP/REST interfaces via Apache Foundation code.
- Reduce disparities between normalized activities and objects of like type collected from various data sources. 
- Reduce disparities between the configuration objects that initialize similar providers from various data sources.
- More tweets and blog posts of zeppelin notebooks demonstrating data pipelines and analyses based on Apache Streams.
- More official examples in source tree demonstrating integration of Apache Streams with complementary technologies.
- Improve the interfaces by which components are created, configured, activated, and executed via SDK and CLI.
- Joint development with complementary projects including Apache Any23, Apache Juneau, and Apache Kibble.
- Refactoring work to support compiling and tests passing on newer JDK versions 9, 10, and 11.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made four GA releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.5.17 - Security fix release (2018-08-22)
* Struts 2.3.35 - Security fix release (2018-08-22)
* Struts Master 12 - Master settings feature upgrade (2018-08-28)
* Struts Master 13 - Master settings upgrade to follow new hash policy
(2018-10-04)

The last quarter was dominated by preparing two important security fix
releases to address a remote execution vulnerability reported to us by Semmle
Security [1][2]. The release along with the accompanying security announcement
caused a lot of media coverage, for us to deal with in the aftermath -- this
has to be seen in the light of the prominent Equifax hack, which was conducted
by exploiting a former Struts 2 RCE.

Again a big thanks to Sally for helping us with public communication and
monitoring media coverage. As far as we know currently, there were no
prominent incidents caused by this vulnerability so far.

Currently we seem to be back in calm waters, preparing two new feature
releases in the 2.5 and 2.3 version line. We also addressed the new hash
policy for all upcoming releases.

Last month we were contacted by Palo Alto Networks, asking if we see a chance
to share early access security vulnerability information. We asked for advice
from the Apache Security Team and both agreed that this request is not
feasible to comply with, given our current volunteer capabilities. We
therefore rejected the request.

Contributions are coming in steadily at reasonable numbers.

As requested by the last board feedback, we include the current committer and
PMC member numbers for reference in this report: Currently 59 committers and
22 PMC members.

No committers or PMC members were added in the last quarter.

Last committer addition:
* 2017-11-14 - Yasser Zamani (yasserzamani)

Last PMC addition:

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Isuru Udana]

## Description: 
Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.
   
## Issues: 
 None identified.
   
## Activity: 
There was only minimum activity of the project in this quarter. We expected to boost the project activity with a new set of contributors, but it did not happen.

   
## Health report: 
All PMC members and committers active on the project in the recent past got busy with their other work, so they couldn’t contribute to the project.
We hope to see whether we can bring back the project to life in next two quarters, if not we may have to take a decision on whether we should call it a day.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Georgios Petasis]

## Description:

 - Apache Tcl is home to the Tcl-Apache integration efforts. The purpose of
   our project is to combine the power of the Apache web server with the
   capabilities of the mature, robust and flexible Tcl scripting language.
   Currently only the Apache Rivet project is actively maintained.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Rivet released a 3.0.2 version (7 July 2018) correcting a few bugs that
   surfaced as soon as 3.0.1 was released.

 - During this period we discussed the possibility of moving our repository
   from SVN to GIT. Thus we requested the creation of
   https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/tcl-rivet.git, which is mirrored at
   https://github.com/apache/tcl-rivet. From 31 July 2018, the original SVN
   repository was made read-only.

 - Also projects tcl-websh (https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/tcl-websh.git)
   and tcl-modtcl.git (https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/tcl-modtcl.git)
   were moved to GIT.

 - On 28 August 2018, the site repository was also created, and on 9 September
   2018, the site was completely migrated on GIT.

 - All migration efforts from SVN to GIT were carried out by Massimo Manghi.

## Health report:

 - The project activity is limited to Apache Rivet.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Tez Project  [Jonathan Turner Eagles]

## Description:
 - Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which
can be used to process arbitrarily complex directed-acyclic graphs (DAGs) of
data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set of data-processing primitives
which can be used by other projects.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - A 0.9.2 release has been in progress for some time almost all
blockers have been resolved. 0.10 release line has added Hadoop 3.0
support and will provide Pig and Hive and others Hadoop 3.0 support
for Tez. Tez developers met in Sunnyvale, California and online at
developer conference to discuss Q4 goals and issues 8 tez developers
were present. Build system was switched to Yetus 0.8 to allow to
reduce friction for contributions.

## Health report:
 - Delay of Tez 0.9.2 release due to jetty 9 CVE issues. Branch 0.10.0
branch cut and issues resolved but issue since release manager is not

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Tim Allison]

## Description:

 - Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
   extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from,
   a growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
   types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and
   science data) as recognised by IANA and other standards bodies.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - The project had two releases in the last quarter.  In addition to numerous
   bug fixes, we've focused on improving robustness via tika-server and some
   new options in our ForkParser.

 - In the two recent releases, we've fixed several CVEs in our own code or by
   notifying and then upgrading dependencies. Two security researchers, Tobias
   Ospelt and Rohan Padhye, have reported numerous issues identified via
   fuzzing. We've granted Tobias access to our regression vm to continue his
   work on our 1TB of regression files.

 - We added a security page to our site to record vulnerabilities:
   http://tika.apache.org/security.html

 - Work continues on the new 2.x based master.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop is currently in the process of preparing releases 3.2.10 and
3.3.4. We delayed our major release of 3.4.0 until later in the year as
there were some outstanding issues we wanted to see handled, but we didn't
want that delay to hold up 3.2.10 and 3.3.4 as they have some useful bug
fixes and minor features that will be helpful to users and graph system
providers.

The wider TinkerPop community saw some additional growth with two new
third-party libraries:

* gremlinq[1] a strongly typed driver for .NET
* gremlex[2] a Gremlin Language Variant for Elixer and the Erlang community

We also noted a new TinkerPop graph implementation by Huawei, known as the
Huawei Graph Engine Service[2], providing yet another graph database that
supports the Gremlin language and the TinkerPop ecosystem.

There were a number of presentations related to TinkerPop and Gremlin 
during this reporting period given Graph Day[4] in San Francisco. The 
following presentations were given from TinkerPop PMC members at various 
venues:

* "Graph Based Malware Analysis"[5] - Florian Hockmann
* "Distributed ACID with JanusGraph on FoundationDB" - Ted Wilmes
* "Distributed Data Show Episode 51: Graph Tips and Tricks"[6] - Ted Wilmes

TinkerPop supplied an out of band report in the previous month explaining
the current state of a PMC discussion related to contribution recognition.
At this point, we have open up this discussion on our dev list for wider
feedback on the action items generally described in the summary post
that was provided in that report.

TinkerPop has extended two invitations to new PMC members. Florian 
Hockmann has accepted and is our newest member. We are still awaiting a 
reply on the second invitation.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.2.9 (May 8, 2018)
- 3.3.3 (May 8, 2018)

## PMC/Committer:
- Last PMC addition was Florian Hockmann - October 2018
- Last committer addition was Harsh Thakkar - August 2018

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Bryan Call]

## Description: 
Apache Traffic Server is a HTTP and HTTP/2 proxy server and cache.  What makes
ATS unique across the landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on
extensibility (plugins), HTTP and HTTP/2 protocol conformity, and performance.
ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs in the world, delivering a significant
portion of all Internet traffic.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

   campus.  We had 17 presentations and people from at least 12 different
   companies and organizations attend.
   
## Health report:

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]


Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to
SOAP/XML based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations.
Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within
Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite
mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed,
and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure
the project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since
SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of the art,
we don't expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new
committers, etc...

Activity:
Not much activity this quarter.  Some bugs were fixed in WSS4J to support 
some CXF efforts.  We hope to have releases of that soon.   Some effort
is being put forward to updated the various components to support Java 11.
We hope to start having releases next quarter targeting Java 11 support
along with any bug fixes accumulated.

PMC changes: 
 - Currently 42 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Alessio Soldano on Tue May 17 2016
