 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we had a lot of good discussion on some core issues facing
       the foundation, including contributions from quite a few members.  I
       would like to thank those who are participating constructively and
       encourage all to, as Rich reminded us, consistently assume positive
       intent and encourage others to express their views and develop
       policies and plans in an atmosphere of mutual respect and support.
       Let's try to stay focused on the issues in context today rather than
       "who gets to decide" or "how things have always been" or explicit or
       implicit ad hominems.  We are all often individually wrong.  The
       strength of our software and our foundation rests on our ability to
       get things right when we work together.

       This month we had some very good reports.  Geode, Sycope and HTTP
       Server all received positive comments.  In several cases, Directors
       encouraged PMCs to share solutions to problems more broadly.  All are
       encouraged to participate in comdev and to consider "Success at
       Apache" blog posts to share ideas on what works.  The usual comments
       about keeping things public, adding committers and ensuring sufficient
       PMC oversight were made on a few reports this month, as well as some
       comments on omitting statistics unless they support a point being
       made.  A good example of digging into the stats to really assess
       community health and future trajectory can be found in this month's
       HTTP Server report.

    B. President [Sam]

       Issues for the board: none

       There are a number of meta-issues that the board should be aware of /
       overseeing and that every ASF Member is welcome to chime in on.  The
       common theme is documenting policy/procedure.  Areas include credit
       cards, GDPR, expense guidelines, endorsement policy, and use of tools
       such as G Suite.  There is continuing tweaks being made to the
       targeted sponsorship program.  All are making progress, and I will
       continue to monitor each and prod as necessary should any one of them
       stall.

       Also coming up next month is a number of things: first
       results/recommendations on an Endowment, early input to a six month
       review of hiring of a Fundraiser, and input to the five year plan.

       Financial summary: income is on budget, expenses are under budget. 
       Some of the under-budget expenses are due to timing considerations
       (TAC, Conferences) meaning that the money will be spent, just not yet.
       The other major expense under-run is infrastructure which is looking
       to hire.

       Brand Management is operating normally.

       Fundraising is on track.  Event revenue as reported in the Treasurer's
       report is just over $70K, and in the Fundraising report is reported as
       about $174K.  The difference is Accounts Receivable.  Rich and Ruth
       are scrambling, but we need to do a better job in future events to
       make sure that potential revenue doesn't fall through the cracks.

       Finance is continuing to make slow but steady progress.  I'll touch
       bases with Tom to ensure that we have what we need for next month.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       The Treasurer has worked with the President to create a credit card
       policy governing the use of ASF-issued credit cards. This addresses as
       finding that came up during our audit. Existing card holders will be
       asked shortly to submit a signed copy.

       During the discussions about our new credit card policy it became
       apparent that we need clarity on our receipt handling policies. I am
       therefore preparing a request to our CPAs to give us an authoritative
       answer on how we should handle receipts. This is afterwards to be
       merged into our existing policy around invoice handling.

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s Financial performance for the
       first three months of FY19;

       Operating Cash on July 31st, 2018 was $2,042.5K, which is up  $58.7K
       from last month’s ending balance (June 18) of $1,983.8K.    Total
       Cash as of July 31st, 2018 is $3,435.4K ( includes the Pineapple and
       restricted Donation). The July 2018 ending Operating cash balance of
       $2,042.5K represents an Operating cash reserve of 12.9 months based
       on the FY19 conservative Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $158.1K/month.  The ASF reserve continues to be very healthy for an
       organization of the ASF’ s size.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, the ASF, with regard to Income, it was up
       vs budget but down vs FY18.  With regard to the Income vs Budget,
       YTD,  we are up $4Kin total. Compared to FY18 the variance is due to
       the timing of when Sponsor payments arrived FY18 vs FY19.   We are
       however ahead in Conference income, again based on timing which
       offsets some of the sponsorship variance FY19 YTD. YTD expenses,
       through July 31st, 2018 are under budget by $208.2K, with all depts
       being under budget.  Infra as noted in the Board summary is $75K
       under budget due to Timing of hiring of staff, timing of Travis CL
       bill and timing of Lease web invoices.  Brand Management is under by
       $78.6K.  We have moved these expenses forward in the Cash Forecast,
       as we have done with all the depts, since we are only one quarter
       into the new Fiscal year.  We will continue to review on a monthly
       basis for variances to Budget.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY 19 the ASF finished with a -
       <$13.1K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$225.3K> NI or $212.2K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This was
       attributable to timing of Sponsor payments offset by more
       underspending, vs the FY19 Budget.  As we are through Q1 of the
       Fiscal year, this type of result is not A-typical and we will
       continue to monitor it as we move into of Q2 FY19.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       After discussions with infra and legal, changes have been made to the
       release distribution policy to remove SHA-1 and replace it with
       SHA-512 or SHA-256 for new releases.

       In July, 47 ICLAs, four CCLAs, and three grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       I have received three separate keynote invitations for events in
       China. Two of them fall in the same week (late Oct). I have yet to
       confirm my availability, but I do plan to accept these two and reject
       the first. I'll reach out to others should the first conference ask
       for other ASF representatives. The topic of both keynotes are the
       Apache Way with a request to explore how Chinese developers should get
       involved.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Running under budget due to open headcount. Hiring process is in
       starting.

       Team will be present at ACNA18.

       Evaluating alternatives to HipChat - primary goal is to satisfy infra
       needs but the team are also considering wider foundational
       requirements.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Some vendor payments were missed and this may need to be made out of
       band. However, these are all budgeted items.

       Onboarding of two new Fundraising Ambassadors will take place at
       ACNA18.

       Created two media partnerships for promotion of ApacheCon.

       PR and AR proceeds as normal.

       Conferences
       ===========

       ApacheCon NA is in Montreal, Canada, September 24th - 27th.
       Registration currently stands at approx 200, but most registrations
       come in the last month.

       Planning for ACNA19 is progressing well with venue and date selection
       almost complete. A preliminary conference management proposal is
       expected very soon.

       DC Roadshow event is likely to be delayed until Nov.

       Other events are progressing slowly.

       TAC
       ===

       No report from TAC at time of writing.

       VP TAC has requested an relatively high limit to their credit card to
       assist in flight and hotel bookings. In the past this was handled by
       our EA who worked through various avenues to secure necessary funds.
       President is working with VP TAC to ensure an appropriate limit and
       safeguards are put in place.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       While we have several conduct and etiquette guides for our
       communities, there is a lack of clear explanations of which lists to
       use or how to escalate concerns at the Foundation level or across
       projects.  Focus areas for the fall will be drafting guides for
       effective communications.

       Updated services available listing and working to announce those and
       release policy improvements recently made by infra and other Members.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Synchronous meeting to kick off 5-year plan refresh

       The idea is a f2f-like meeting, but virtual, open to all. Would like to
       discuss format and timing.

       Phil would like to kick off the 5 year plan now since having a
       face-to-face at ACNA'18 is not feasible.

       Is there a three-hour time slot when the directors can get together in
       the next month (before ACNA'18)?

       Bertrand: should have some preparation before the meeting

       Phil: pick a time slot first; and then prepare materials to discuss;
       the alternative is all asynchronous

       Sam: one hour is probably do-able

       Shane: a one-hour meeting with relevant directors and officers is a
       good idea; face-to-face is not practical

       @Phil: organize the agenda and synchronous meeting time

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Brett: pursue a report or Attic proposal for Xalan
          [ Xalan 2018-02-21 ]

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Mark Thomas]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.


* OPERATIONS

Confirmed that a proposed use of OPENOFFICE screenshots was nominative and
therefore acceptable.

Directed the HAWQ project towards Sally for advice on acceptable language when
referring to project 'creators'.

Directed separate enquiries about setting up sites to support KAFKA and
TINKERPOP to the relevant PMC.

Provided advice to ARROW regarding the ability to claim component names as
trademarks.

Approved use of Apache marks for MESOSCON.

There are currently 32 tasks being tracked/monitored by the brand management
team.


* REGISTRATIONS

A draft agreement to assign the NETBEANS marks has been received and passed to
our lawyers for review.

Work continues on the transfer of the SERVICECOMB registrations.

The OPENOFFICE registration for Argentina is due for renewal and will be
allowed to lapse.


* INFRINGEMENTS


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues to go well.

KAM is firewalling the ASF while doing work with other hats using Ross'
approach about "can we talk about this later" if it comes up.

Work for additional bronze ambassador support from Tom is still delayed

Committee meetings continue to occur monthly.  Last was held on August 2nd.

Work helping fundraise sponsors for Apache Events is going well and to-date
tallies about $174K.  No more fundraising to be done for AC2018.

Work with Hopsie on issues in the donation receipts and fraud prevention
continues.

Donation for Microsoft O365 back on track.

Visited SF with a visit to Twitter as a potential event space going well. 
Too small for AC2019 but will make a fabulous roadshow.  Anyone in SF want to
lead a roadshow?

Congrats to Sally for landing Tencent as a Platinum sponsor.

And Congrats to Ted Liu for renewing Alibaba as a Silver.

SK is providing Ambassador Training a mandatory requirement for Sponsorship
Ambassadors.  Ted Liu and Craig Russell are queued to take this training
during AC18.  

Targeted Sponsorship policy revised in light of the concern over the trusted
by logo given to a minor sponsor.  The policy grandfathered the past items
and restricts them going forward.  “The ASF does not allow endorsements,
official quotes, blogs, press releases, and similar public statements
regarding sponsorship in any manner except as specified as official benefits
of the sponsorship program.  While existing blogs and endorsement are hereby
grandfathered as of August 2018, going forward, there are no sponsor benefits
for any sponsorship, targeted or normal, for values below bronze sponsorship
including in-kind donations for Infrastructure.  All statements for
sponsorship shall continue to be vetted and approved by VP Press & Media
before publication.”

We have a concerted bad actor trying to get access to the ASF who has been
impersonating Phil Steitz.  Please be careful.

The committee is looking at using CRM software for fundraising communications
with sponsors.


Corporate Items:

Certificate of Status from Delaware received 
COR from IRS requested for Emerio sponsorship 
D&O Insurance renewed


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - August 2018

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule. There are a few vendor
payments/reimbursements that missed the last payment processing cycle and may
need to be paid out of band.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues Sponsor ambassadorial
outreach with Fundraising, and will be onboarding and training Craig Russell
and Ted Liu as new Sponsor Ambassadors during ApacheCon in September. She has
been working with ASF Conferences and Community Development on promoting
ApacheCon, and supporting the ASF’s participation in several community events.
The latest "Success at Apache" post: "The Apache Legal Shield - A Pragmatic
View" is now live https://s.apache.org/tmi6 .

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the newswire
service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during this timeframe.

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 213 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 17 items, and have 49K followers on
Twitter. We posted 6 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 18.3K organic
impressions.

V. Future Announcements: one announcement is in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 4 media queries. The ASF received 3,654
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,241. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 5,226 press hits vs. last month's 5,258. ApacheCon received
no press hits vs. last month's 113.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received one analyst query. Apache was mentioned in
8 reports by Gartner; 4 reports by Forrester; 9 reports by 451 Research; and
12 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: Sally created new booth graphics for Solutions Hamburg, and is
preparing signage for ApacheCon. She also created a series of promotional
graphics for print and digital advertising for ApacheCon.

IX. Events liaison: Sally secured media partnerships with Linux Pro and ADMIN
magazines, and has launched a promotional campaign that includes print and
digital advertising, as well as email blasts and newsletters. Rich Bowen
authored a blog post that appeared in the Open Geospatial Consortium's
quarterly newsletter
http://newsletter.opengeospatial.org/issues/ogc-update-august-2018-126024 .
Sally is working with Apache Community Development regarding the ASF Booth at
the upcoming ApacheCon and Apache Roadshow. Sally will also be holding Media &
Analyst Training at ApacheCon for the 12th consecutive year. Two reporters
have registered to cover the event and participate in the training.

X. Newswire accounts: NASDAQ has sold its GlobeNewswire property to West; our
pre-paid contract and dissemination abilities remain intact. We have begun our
new pre-paid press release contract, and have 10 press releases remaining
through 2019.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Finances
========
Infrastructure is running under budget, primarily due to our open
headcount. Due to our continuing growth, we will start the process to
get that position filled.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Move svn-master.a.o
- Gitbox migrations

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Starting work on Puppet v5 and Ubuntu LTS 18.04
- Continuing work on "hermes migration" (our core email server) from
  its old box, to something maintainable

General Activity
================
- Our team has finalized travel to ACNA18 in Montreal, and will be
  meeting with the community, along with lots of time with teammates.
- Now running a script to trim all Jenkins slave nodes of old
  artifacts, which were especially problematic on a few small-disk
  nodes that we are running. This should reduce the rash of tickets
  that were filed about "out of disk" on the slave nodes.
- Investigating alternatives to HipChat, now that Atlassian sold the
  product to Slack. The Infrastructure team needs a sophisticated chat
  system for daily use, with a number of integration requirements. We
  are working through the options to meet our needs, with an eye for
  other uses throughout the Foundation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

We are now about 40 days out from ApacheCon North America, which will be held
in Montreal, Canada, September 24th - 27th. Registration currently stands in the
low 200's, but we typically get more than half of our registration in the last
month, so I'm not yet concerned.

We are in the first stages of planning ApacheCon North America 2019, with
venue and date selection almost complete. We expect to have a preliminary
conference management proposal this week or next.

We have had some unexpected delays around the DC Roadshow event, which may now
be pushed back until mid-November.

Discussion continue slowly surrounding other events, including:

* 2019 Chicago roadshow
* Collaboration with JBCNConf in Barcelona
* 2019 Berlin ApacheCon

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

VP of Finance, July 2018 Report As with the June Report there has not
been a lot of Activity, though Kevin McGrail and I did have a phone
conversation with the JCF and I am finishing my notes for that meeting
which I will share.  Also I met again with the AAF Wealth management
firm and they are preparing a proposal which I hope to have before the
Sept Board meeting.  I will be on the call on Wed Aug 15th


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Steve Blackmon (sblackmon@) has join the JSON-LD WG.

The Foundation was already participating (Adam Soroka, ajs6f@) in this WG so
no further commitment to the W3C WG participation agreement was needed.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

This month I am announcing a transition plan that will round out this calendar
year. I have been in discussion with two ASF members both of which are
interested in transitioning to the VP, Legal role, and both members of the
Legal Committee.

I suggest to the Board the following plan of action:

1. Create an Assistant VP, Legal position. Just as we have an Assistant
   Secretary, Legal issues are rising to the point where having a named
   Assistant VP just makes sense to me and there is definitely interest.

2. The person I am considering nominating for Board consideration for VP,
   Legal becomes available near the end of the calendar year. I recommend
   appointing Assistant VP, Legal before then, at next month's meeting, and
   then ensuring a smooth transition by replacing me in the December 2018
   board meeting with my successor.

Outside of the above, legal questions are getting answers due to an influx of
great support from Hen Yandell and others on the Legal discuss list.

Besides that, VP, Legal is working with VP, Infra and the office of Data
Privacy to draft a data privacy plan and set of updates to the ASF mailing
list archival removal policy owned by the infra team. We are not done yet,
though some progress will be reported in the VP, Data Privacy report this
month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

We have made a change in the way we handle the automated github
dependency security reports.  We will continue to forward them to the
projects but we no longer track and chase them or include them in the
stats.  This is because they were a huge time commitment for little
benefit (none of the issues have led to needed security releases
needed for projects).

Stats for July 2018:

      16	[license confusion]
      12        [support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 32 (last months: 39, 55, 54)

      8       [httpd]
      3       [tomcat], [infrastructure]
      2       [spark], [tika]
      1       [ambari], [avro], [axis], [camel], [cayenne], [commons],
              [cordova], [couchdb], [datafu], [db], [dubbo], [hadoop],
              [hive], [jmeter], [logging], [openoffice], [ranger],
              [trafficserver]

     In total, as of 1st August, we're tracking 95 (last month: 113)
     open issues across 42 projects, median age 112 (last month: 92)
     days.  59 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     9 (last month: 10) of these issues, across 8 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  We continue to work with these projects to get
     these closed out.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Chris Mattmann]

VP, Infra, VP, Data Privacy & Legal, and our counsel had a telecon on 7/19 and
discussed ASF strategy with respect to the EU's General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). 

We have decided to continue with our updates to the infrastructure
team's mail archival policy and our policy and procedures for how we deal
with removal requests. The policy updates are currently under review by
Legal, and Data Privacy and we expect to publish them in the next month.

We have received a few GDPR requests, with only one current request being
actively worked, and few queued as far as I can tell (less than 5).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Ambari Project  [Jayush Luniya]

## Description:

- Apache Ambari simplifies provisioning, managing, and monitoring of Apache
  Hadoop clusters.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Since the last report, the community successfully released Ambari 2.7.0
  which resolved 887 issues and CVE-2018-8042.
- Ambari 2.7 provides significant performance improvements in managing large
  clusters with across the board improvements in Ambari UI, Ambari Core
  Framework and Ambari Metrics System.
- Deployment for future Ambari 3.0 release remains very active in
  branch-feature-AMBARI-14714 that will significantly revamp the Ambari
  architecture.
- The community hosted a meetup event on June 18th in San Jose where Ambari

Attachment B: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Materne]

## Activity:
 - First tries to cut a release for IvyDE.
 - First steps to move from FindBugs to SpotBugs, because FB seems to be
   inactive.
 - As Maven explained in detail in their last report, we also fixed the Zip
   Slip vulnerability. The archive tasks now support an attribute where the
   user could configure that resulting files can't be located outsite the
   desired target directory.

## Health report:

For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done. But
basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development
- but it increased since last report.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Thiruvalluvan M. G.]

Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

The project has had reasonable amount activities during the June quarter 2018

46 JIRA tickets opened by 36 developers
21 Pull requests opened in Github by 19 contributors
18 JIRA tickets resolved
7 Pull requests merged

Status as of Aug 13, 2018 
 110 Open pull requests
 573 Open issues in JIRA

The main focus of the work are bug fixes and a very few feature enhancements.
No major extension/enhancement is in the works.

Last release: version 1.8.2 20th May 2017.

Next planned release: 1.8.3 Sep 2018

Last time a new committer elected: 24 Jul 2018: Srujan Narkedamalli

Problems: The rate at which we resolve issues is not good enough There has
been no release for over a year. User community should probably be frustrated
with the lack of fix for the problems. Our plan to make a release in May did
not materialize.

Action plan: Release the next version in Sep 2018. Prod committers to look
into outstanding issues in order to resolve them. Engage with the contributors
and those reporting issues so that they continue to contribute and maybe
become committers one day.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:

BookKeeper is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage service
optimized for append-only workloads. It has been used as a fundamental service
to build high available and replicated services in companies like Twitter,
Yahoo and Salesforce. It is also the log segment store for Apache
DistributedLog and message store for Apache Pulsar.

Apache DistributedLog is a high-level API and service layer for Apache
BookKeeper, providing easier access to the BookKeeper primitives. It is a
subproject of Apache BookKeeper.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - 4.7.1 was released on Tue Jun 19 2018
 - 4.8.0 was scheduled to be release in August. It is delayed due to some
   discussions around metadata upgrade.
 - Apache Pulsar (incubating) has fully integrated with the official
   BookKeeper release 4.7.0. The growth of Pulsar community also help grow the
   adoption of BookKeeper.
 - Deep integration between Pulsar and BookKeeper, for example Pulsar
   Functions integration with bookkeeper table service. This helps building
   the ecosystem around BookKeeper.

## Health report:

 - Development continues at a steady pace. We are merging multiple PRs per day
   on average.
 - Mailing list and slack discussions are brisk, in particularly around the
   active projects.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 15 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Brooklyn Project  [Geoff Macartney]

## Description:
 - Apache Brooklyn is a software framework for modelling, monitoring and
   managing cloud applications through autonomic blueprints.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Development continues with a regular turnover of pull requests submitted
   and merged.
 - We are happy to announce [1] that our users at Fujitsu, UShareSoft, and
   Cloudsoft have generously sponsored the contribution of a new and modern UI
   for Apache Brooklyn. This is based on the previously-proprietary Cloudsoft
   AMP UI, for those of you familiar with that.
 - As part of the work for the new UI, we have overhauled the scripts we use
   to generate LICENSE/NOTICE file inclusions, to be sure to include all the
   required licenses, distinguish between source and binary licenses, and
   support auto-recognition of license by Github [2].

## Health report:
 - The project continues with a regular turnover of pull requests and commits.
   Development is continuing and users are feeding back their problems and
   feature suggestions.
 - We continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
   members with the aim of regularly adding individuals. On this occasion, we
   have been delighted to welcome Duncan Grant as a new committer to the
   project. Duncan has been a consistent contributor for a long time not only
   in terms of code and docs contributions to Brooklyn but also through code
   reviews and responding to requests and queries on IRC. He has a very good
   knowledge of Brooklyn.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 15 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Thomas Bouron on Tue Oct 31 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 16 committers.
 - Duncan Grant was added as a committer on Wed Jun 13 2018

## Releases:

 - Last release was 0.12.0 on Wed Sep 27 2017
 - We had previously discussed doing a 1.0 release around this time, but with
   the introduction of the new UI it seems prudent to allow some time for any
   integration issues to be uncovered and fixed, after which we can release
   1.0 with the new look.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
The project is moving at a slow pace with a few commits in the last months.

## Health report: 
The project has been stable for a long while and the space of build tools 
for Java projects has been overall stagnant for a number of years.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
We have spent this quarter working on preparations for getting the community
involved and excited about the upcoming release of 4.0. This effort includes:
- Agreeing upon the timeline for a feature freeze
- Updating our site to add a blog section with our first community submitted
  blog
- Adding a Confluence space to track testing progress towards 4.0

In other news, we filed CVE-2018-8016 for a regression vulnerability.
Fortunately this had already been fixed in the latest release by the time the
issue was identified and the CVE created.

## PMC changes:
 - There are currently 27 PMC members.
 - Benjamin Lerer was voted onto the PMC. If no objections from the board are
   received, he will be invited to join shortly.
 - Last PMC addition was Sam Tunnicliffe on Tue Apr 03 2018

## Committer base changes:
 - There are Currently 50 committers.
 - No new committers have been added in the last 3 months
 - The last committer addition was Jay Zhuang on 2018-02-27

 - 3.0.17 was released on Wed Aug 01 2018
 - 3.11.3 was released on Wed Aug 01 2018

## Mailing list activity:
Mail list activity is down from the previous quarter. We see this as a
function having no new major releases in conjunction with a focus on getting
4.0 ready to freeze. Mail list interactions remain healthy with a core group
of contributors answering questions.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Cédric Damioli]

## Description:
  Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Issues:
  there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

  The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14 A few JIRA issues opened or
  resolved since last report. A little activity on both users and dev
  mailing-lists, in any case more than the previous quarter. The project is
  mainly in maintenance mode.

  Last board feedback asked if there are at least 3 active PMC members.
  Following discussion shows that the answer is positive. Last board report,
  back in May, was the opportunity to gather metrics about Cocoon usage. It
  appears from maven statistics that we still have 60k downloads per month. A
  PMC member also pointed to INFRA-15406 which may provide a way to have
  download statistics for non-Maven artifacts. We still have to figure out how
  to use them. I also proposed to cut a 2.1.x release, but haven't yet found
  the time to do it.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

# Description:

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache Projects

## Issues:

No issues require board attention at the moment.

Please note that a response to the board feedback on our last report was sent
on 16th July 2018 [1]

## Activity:

Apache EU Roadshow / FOSS Backstage
The co-located Apache EU Roadshow with
FOSS Backstage was successful. Links to all videos, photos and presentations
from the event can be found on the event website [2]. We asked for and have
already received feedback from attendees to help us improve any future events.

FeatherCast
During the EU Roadshow several interviews were recorded with
speakers or attendees. As well as audio, video interviews were recorded. A
short series of interviews called 'Board Conversations' was also launched
where ASF Board Members can talk about their role.

OpenExpo Madrid
We participated again at the Open Expo Europe in Madrid. We
had a booth and also several presentations about open source, community
development and the Apache Way. Feedback from our volunteers about the event
was very positive. Our involvement here at this event has been a good way to
spread the ASF message to Spanish speaking audiences.

OSCON
It has been a while since we participated at OSCON and so were very
happy to have a booth and several ASF related presentations there. The booth
had a constant stream of visitors and the stock of stickers/giveaways ran out
quickly.

Other Events
We have been invited to participate in three Codemotion events
later this year in Berlin, Milan and Madrid and are looking for speakers and
volunteers to help out.

For the second year in a row we have been invited to participate at Solutions
Hamburg. This time as well as presentations we will also have an Apache booth.
We are still looking for booth volunteers to help out at this event.

## Health report:
With the increased event participation activity, we have an ongoing need for
volunteers to help out at events. We are seeing new people beginning to
volunteer at  a regional level. To help support this we are now locating
banners and other booth related supplies at various locations so have setup a
page to give more visibility [3].

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------
No significant changes since last report.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Community
---------
In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC /
Commit.


Releases
--------
Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016 Apache Rat  0.11 was
released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September,
2013.

 - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
 - JPA integration and transaction support.
 - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.
 - Quartz integration

 Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
 your CDI enabled projects.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 Summer kicked in. So we had a little less activity over the last 2 months.
 Still nothing to be worried. We are trying to get 1.9.0 released in the 
 next weeks. 
 We now finally switched our codebase to Java8 as minimum requirement
 but will keep an 1.8.x branch for people who are still left with Java7.
   
## Health report: 
 As already mentioned: we have a stable user base and are mostly doing small
 enhancements right now.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache DRAT Project  [Chris Mattmann]

## Description:
- Apache DRAT is a distributed, parallelized (Map Reduce) wrapper around
  Apache RAT™ and other code auditing tools to allow it to complete on large
  code repositories of multiple file types.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Ahmed Ifhaam our amazing GSOC 2018 student revolutionized the Proteus DRAT
   web interface, combining the separate D3 viz app (historical over all
   repos) with the cockpit-style, run DRAT a repo at a time and see what's
   going on app. With his updates and work we will be able to release a DRAT
   1.0 soon.
 - Chris has been working hard along with Tom Barber to merge and test Ahmed's
   code and provide feedback.
 - The work leading up to DRAT 1.0 and the new Proteus web I/F written in
   Vue.js from our GSOC 2018 project revealed a severe stability bug in Apache
   OODT 1.2.2, leading to an Apache OODT 1.2.3 patch release to fix it and to
   stabilize DRAT.

## Health report:
 - The activity is up big time, and there are many people commenting on the
   Github issues and pull requests. Chris has done a lot of work to get the
   issue tracker cleared up in prep for a 1.0 release.
 - The plan is when we are done with this sprint for GSOC 2018 and Ahmed's
   work is finally wrapped up, we will deploy an update at
   http://drat.apache.org/demo/ and also to http://drat.apache.org/asfgit/. We
   will probably move on to give the website some love.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Rainer Döbele]

## Description: 
 - Apache Empire-db is a relational database access engine that takes an 
   SQL-centric approach in contrast to object-relational-mapping like with JPA

Attachment S: Report from the Apache FreeMarker Project  [Dániel Dékány]

## Description:

Apache FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text
output based on templates. Apache FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class
library for programmers.

FreeMarker 2 (the current stable line) produces releases since 2002. The
FreeMarker project has joined the ASF in 2015, and graduated from the
Incubator in early 2018.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Activity was low in the last months. There was some site updates regarding EU
regulations, and transition from http://try.freemarker.org to
https://try.freemarker.apache.org is done.

## Health report:

Activity is relatively low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User
question (mostly on StackOverflow) and new Jira issues are being answered
promptly. The long term goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0
branch, so that the project can innovate and the code base can become much
cleaner (and more attractive for new committers), instead of being blocked by
15 years of historical baggage. (Meanwhile, the backward compatible 2.x branch
must be maintained, and produce releases.)

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 7 committers.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Releases:

 - 2.3.28 was released on Wed Apr 04 2018

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Geode Project  [Mark Bretl]

## Description:
Apache Geode provides a database-like consistency model, reliable transaction
processing and a shared-nothing architecture to maintain very low latency
performance with high concurrency processing.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- We held up releasing v1.7.0 in favor of fixing more bugs and making our
  tests more reliable.  We closed out 40% of the open test bugs (out of 220)
  and removed the ‘FlakyTest’ category from 136 tests.
- We integrated our pre-commit tests directly into GitHub PR checks. This
  makes it super easy for committers and contributors to run and review test
  results.
- We’ve optimized test runtimes for pull requests to get results in less than
  an hour.  If someone were to run the same tests on a laptop it would take
  over 18h.
- We upgraded the project build tools to Gradle 4.9 in preparation for
  supporting Java 11.
- We merged a contribution to add thread monitoring and take action if a
  thread appears to hang.
- We discussed improvements to handling of the default SSL context.
- We discussed improvements to allow customizable trust boundaries for
  securing OQL method invocations.
- The Geode PMC discussed and approved a Geode session track at the
  SpringOnePlatform conference (see https://springoneplatform.io/2018/geode).
- Community member Addison Huddy posted a series of seven (and counting)
  youtube videos on “Geode by Example”.

## Health report:
- We’ve had a number of excellent contributions from new community members in
  the last three months.  Although the PMC did not add any committers this
  quarter we should definitely review and discuss adding new committers soon.
- By increasing test speed, reliability, and ease of access we have lowered
  the barriers for new contributions and community participation.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 46 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Dick Cavender on Tue Feb 20 2018

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 87 committers.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description: 
The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and 
persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key 
value stores, document stores, distributed in-memory key/value stores, 
in-memory data grids, in-memory caches, distributed multi-model stores, 
and hybrid in-memory architectures.
Gora also enables analysis of data with extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce
and Apache Spark support.
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
Due to two ongoing GSoC projects, activity has been refreshingly active.
Additionally, recently, a Pig module was sent via a PR. This is under
review.
   
## Health report: 
The Gora project is in a healthy state with review-then-commit
practice being demonstrated time and time again. The PMC is 
engaging in community grown initiatives e.g. GSoC and we will
look to open up the PMC books post-successful conclusion of the
current projects.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description: 

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, first class functional programming support 
and runtime and compile-time meta-programming.
 
## Issues: 

There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.
Outstanding issue:
 - The last steps to completing the website migration are still outstanding.

## Activity:

 - This quarter, 257 commits were contributed from 22 contributors
   including 12 non-committer contributors (12 new).
 - Apache Groovy was downloaded 27M+ times the past three months
   (May / June / July), across Maven Central and Bintray JCenter,
   for a total of 54M+ since the beginning of the year.
   Generally, 2/3 of the downloads are from Maven Central vs 1/3
   from Bintray JCenter. There is still a lot of users downloading
   the latest 2.4.x releases, almost as much as the 2.5.x ones.
   But it is nice to see that about 10% of the downloads are from
   users trying our 3.0 alphas.

## Health report:

 - Committee Health score: 10.00 (Super Healthy)
 - Our release train velocity has been maintained, and there seems to be a
   healthy level of discussion about project direction on the mailing lists.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
 The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
 open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
 Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
 extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current
 HTTP standards.
   
## Issues: 
 There are absolutely no issues requiring board attention at this time!
   
## Activity: 
 Nothing too exciting, considering it's been summer and activity has
 been lower than in other quarters. We released 2.4.34 and work has been
 done on TLS 1.3 integration, JSON logging and fixing up core modules.
   
## Health report: 
 The project is healthy, albeit at a slower pace due to summer holidays.
 A quick count yielded 14 active PMC members during this quarter, so
 plenty of oversight. We managed to squeeze in 420 commits from 19
 authors - a slight (and understandable) drop from previous quarter. In
 terms of people doing the heavy load, we've been at a steady figure of
 5-6 for the past two years, with no visible sign of that changing.
 Basically, this means we have around 6 people doing the main work, and
 some 25 others assisting with lighter contributions. The majority of
 active contributors have more than 5 years of contribution experience
 with the project - coupled with the rate of new committers, this seems
 to be a sign of a good amount of contributor retention within the
 project. We added two new contributors in this quarter, as listed in
 the next paragraph. Bugzilla and mail activity remains very stable in
 terms of the number of contributors - the number of tickets/emails has,
 as stated before, been lower during the summer time. As we are part of
 the Kibble experiment[1], we also have insight into the general mood of
 the project over time, and while there are signs of a somewhat brazen
 and rough tone sometimes, the past few months have seen an uptick
 towards a happier mood (except for on the users list, but that is to be
 expected, as that's where all the problems and cries for help would
 go).

## PMC changes: 
   
 - We currently have 53 members on the PMC.
 - Hank Ibell was added to the PMC on Tue Jul 10 2018 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - There are currently 122 committers.
 - New commmitters:
    - Hank Ibell was added as a committer on Tue Jun 26 2018 
    - Sebastian Bazley was added as a committer on Sat Jul 14 2018 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - 2.4.34 was released on Mon Jul 16 2018 
   
## Mailing list activity:
  Nothing particularly worthy of note here. A dip in traffic,
  likely due to summer time, but the number of contributors have been
  very steady.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Impala Project  [Jim Apple]

## Description:

Impala is a high-performance distributed SQL engine.

## Issues:

As mentioned in the May report, Impala asked Google to add a disclaimer to
their "IMPALA: Scalable Distributed DeepRL in DMLab-30"[0] acknowledging that
the ASF owns the Impala trademark. Google had declined to do so, but as of
June 5th, they
"made a decision to launch the code by reference to its full name
(Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture) - i.e. we will no longer be
 using the acronym IMPALA".

A project named "Palo" was accepted into the Incubator as "Doris". It is based
on a forked Impala code base and a few Impala PMC members have expressed
concern about some of their previous practices from a community-oriented
perspective. These were addressed directly by the Palo/Doris community in the
incubation proposal and there will hopefully be upcoming opportunities for
both projects to start more direct contributions to each other.

## Activity:

The previous three months had 364 patches to the master branch, while this
three-month period had 350.

Prominent work in the last three months includes:

 - The release of Impala 3.0
 - The start of a very large effort to enable Impala to run without catalogd,
   which can sometimes be a bottleneck
 - A number of improvements to developer workflow, including documentation
   build changes and improvements to automate our CI system even more
 - The addition of fine-grained privileges

A new book with multiple chapters about Impala was published,
"Next-Generation Big Data: A Practical Guide to Apache Kudu, Impala, and
 Spark", by Butch Quinto.

## Health report:

The project remains healthy and the cadence of most metrics (number of
commits, emails, releases) is steady compared to previous quarters.

One notable change is user@, which declined in volume by roughly 64%. The
previous quarter, some large threads dominated user@:

 - A user inquiry on local join vs. exchange (10%)
 - A user inquiry on installation on Ubuntu (10%)
 - A user inquiry on admission control (7%)
 - A user inquiry on memory estimation (10%)

Incubator PMC report for August 2018

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 52 podlings incubating. During the month of July,
podlings executed 7 distinct releases and there are several ongoing votes 
and releases for August. A couple of podlings need to ask again for IPMC 
votes and some votes are still ongoing.  We added two new IPMC members.

The HAWQ project is graduating, and serval others are heading towards
graduation. We had one project, Gossip, in the process of retiring to the 
attic. Joshua needs to be chased up as they voted to graduate but haven't
done so yet and failed to report.

There were two IP clearances.

Again a number of podlings (8) didn't report and Pony Mail has failed to 
report for the 3rd time in a row. I'll reach out again to Pony Mail but it 
may require board attention given that lists.apache.org runs off it.

One report (Airflow) is currently missing sign off but hopefully that will be
fixed by the time the board meets.

Independently I reached out to the the Spark project and they have improved 
their LICENSE and NOTICE so the incubator should have less issues in 
podlings copying what they were doing.

Edgent

Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime
that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
     around the Edgent project.
  2. Attracting at least another independent committer/ppmc member.
  3. Finding further real world users of Edgent

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Community participation, implying interest in Edgent, continues
  to be an issue.  One of the two active committer/PPMC members has
  retired at the end of February and the level of their continuing
  participation is has been significantly reduced since then. When a
  security problem had been brought up on the private list, not a single
  response from a second PPMC had been received.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * An article on Apache PLC4X has been published in the German iX magazine.
     This article co-featured Apache Edgent
     (https://www.heise.de/select/ix/2018/8/1533352444905693)
  * The previous JavaSPEKTRUM article was published on the codecentric blog
     and is now free to read for all.
     
(https://blog.codecentric.de/2018/06/edge-computing-industrial-iot-apache-ed
gent-apache-plc4x/)
  * Total, we have 77 subscribers to our mailing list, an increase
    of 1 since the last report.
  * It was almost silent on the mailing lists until two new names popped up
     asking question about a week ago.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Even if no vulnerabilities were found in Edgent, we updated some of our
     Dependencies no longer depend on third party artifacts that might 
contain
     problems.
  * According to JIRA, 1 new issue was added and none were resolved
    in the last 90 days
  * 2 commits were made in the last 90 days.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  After withdrawal of most of the active committers and PPCM members 
currently
  a new committer and PPMC base has to be built. We are still very hopeful 
that
  we will be able to accomplish this task.

Heron

A real-time, distributed, fault-tolerant stream processing engine.

Heron has been incubating since 2017-06-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Removal of binaries from code base (this is already completed)
  2. Moving from com.twitter.heron to org.apache.heron namespace (this is
already completed)
  3. How to publish the binary artifacts into the Apache Maven repo

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

We had an issue with scheduling to get the report done on time.  We will 
work to correct this for the next period.

How has the community developed since the last report?

The community has been increasing steadily.  The community has been asking 
questions through the mailing list and slack channels.  The supporting 
community has responded with answers to questions asked.   We have also had 
new individuals  come into help with cleaning the project from an outside 
perspective.  It's been very helpful to the committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

There have been mainly bug fixes and improvements to existing features.  
Some to note are
* Fixing issue with downloader for Nomad
* Updating to the latest Dhalion version
* Updating of Dockerfiles and docker build scripts
* Updates to the documentation
* Updates to Helm charts
* Added a S3 uploader

SDAP

SDAP is an integrated data analytic center for Big Science problems.

SDAP has been incubating since 2017-10-22.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Grow community
 2. Make formal SDAP (Incubating) releases
 3. Evangelize SDAP as an integrated data analytic center for Big Science 
problems

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

For the last quarter, again SDAP has been heavily advertised 
at/in tons of Earth Science technology forums. 
Members of SDAP team demonstrated the software at the ESIP
Summer 2018 meeting in Tucson, AZ with the aim of growing 
community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

The project is around a month or so away from making it's first 
Incubating release. Development is ongoing and positive.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. More activity in the User and Dev mail lists
  2. Revive Community activity (Discussion, commits)
  3. Develop a better release process

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

Lack of community discussion and activity is being addressed.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Started Bi-weekly (2 weeks) project wide community live meetings to try to 
revive development on the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Community revival is underway. Bi-weekly meetings are taking place in order 
to achieve momentum in the project. Goals are to prioritize Pull Requests 
and promote the creation of new features in the community.

Toree

Toree provides applications with a mechanism to interactively and remotely
access Apache Spark.
Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.More discussion and engagement on the mailing list as opposed to
"gitter"
  3.Continue to make releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

* We have discussed couple times about inactive mentors, and we will
most likely start a process to replace those with new more available
ones so that we can get our release and graduate process more smoothly.

How has the community developed since the last report?

* The community has been working on the 0.2.0 release,
and a new RC6 is waiting for IPMC approval.

How has the project developed since the last report?

* Regular cadence of community activity, with some increase on
mailing list activity. Having said that, lots of questions and
interactions are still happening in a very active fashion on the
"gitter chat community" but we were able to get some of those
discussions turning into JIRAs on the project.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

## Description:

 - jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
   Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification
   for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an
   implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR).

## Issues:
 - There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

 -  jUDDI - last release was 22 NOV 2017. Little development has taken place
    since then.

## Health report:

 - Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in
   all likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.
 - There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to
   potential security issues. There were no issues raised since the last
   report.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Alex O'Ree on Sun Mar 17 2013

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 7 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

## Releases:

 - Last release was 3.3.5 on Wed Nov 22 2017

## /dist/ errors: 14
 - These errors are for older versions of jUDDI in which a former PMC's gpg
   key expired. The key has been refreshed however the previous releases will
   probably not be resigned.

## Mailing list activity:


 - dev@juddi.apache.org:
    - 71 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 6 emails sent to list (50 in previous quarter)

 - user@juddi.apache.org:
    - 111 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):
    - 5 emails sent to list (8 in previous quarter)

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for efficiently storing and
processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========

We shipped 4 releases this quarter. The major release was 2.0.0, which
includes 40 KIPs and more than 240 fixes. This release includes major features
such as prefixed ACL, OAuth authentication, improved replication protocol to
avoid log divergence, better error control in Connect, better secret
configuration in Connect, and header support in Streams. This is also the
release where we dropped Java 7 support.

We are working on new features such as improving the consumer offset
semantics, making the log cleaner more robust, allowing the broker to
prioritize controller requests, etc.

Community
===========

Lots of activities in the mailing list. We have 2735 subscribers in the user
mailing list, up 69 in the last 3 months. We have 990 emails in the user
mailing list in the last 3 months, a bit less than the 1027 in the previous
cycle. We have 1212 subscribers in the dev mailing list, up 68 in the last 3
months. We have 3074 emails in the dev mailing list in the last 3 months, much
higher than the 2367 in the previous cycle (likely due the releases).

The vote for a new PMC member Dong Lin pased on Aug. 4, 2018. We are waiting
for the board notice peroid before sending an invitation. We didn't elect any
new committer this cycle. Some concern on committer diversity have been raised
in the private mailing list. We are reviewing our committer guidelines now and
will resume the committer nomination soon. We last elected a new committer on
Mar. 28, 2018.

Releases
===========
2.0.0 was released on Jul. 30, 2018.
1.1.1 was released on Jul. 20, 2018.
0.11.0.3 was released on Jul. 4, 2018.
0.10.2.2 was released on Jul. 4, 2018.

## Description:
 - The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache
   Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all
   REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Matt Sicker]

## Description:
 - The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-source
   software related to the logging of application behavior and released at no
   charge to the public.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

   Audit. This provides an audit logging framework on top of Log4j2 which can
   be used as broadly as for auditing purposes or even as specialized as for
   distributed trace logging. Log4j Audit contains a catalog editor as well to
   help predefine audit events shared by all your applications.
 - We made a new bugfix release of Log4j 2 while we continue to brainstorm on
   where we'd like to see Log4j 3 go in the future.
 - We invited Carter Kozak to join the PMC who has accepted and joined. Thanks
   for all your hard work, Carter!
 - We have a new Log4j API for Scala release in the works that migrates its
   build system from Maven to SBT along with a large reduction in duplicate
   code between different versions of Scala thanks to SBT's cross compilation
   support.
 - We have a new Log4j API for Kotlin component almost ready to release.
   Thanks to Raman Gupta for developing the initial version of this component!

## Health report:
 - The project remains active and healthy. Mailing list activity remains about
   the same as last quarter.
 - Over the past 90 days, there were about 75 issues reported and 42 closed
   across all the Apache Logging Services projects. The bulk of this activity
   is from Log4j2.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.10.0 release on April
19, 2018.  The next major release is scheduled for August 30, 2018.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did
not sign up any new committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the lookout
for new PMC members and committers.  We expect some GSOC students to be
potential new committers once their projects are completed.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been moderate to active this quarter.  Development
has involved some long-running projects, but also a fair number of workarounds
to project dependency issues.  ManifoldCF has a very large number of
dependencies due to its nature, and many of those dependencies have poor
practices concerning issues like classloader hygiene, which impact ManifoldCF
strongly.

Issues reported have been centered mainly on bugs and on GSOC students this
quarter.  I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

No new branding-related activity to report.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Phoenix Project  [Josh Elser]

## Description:
  - Apache Phoenix enables SQL-based OLTP and operational analytics for Apache
    Hadoop

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
  - Two major release: 4.14.0 and 5.0.0. The former targeted HBase-0.98 and
    1.x major release lines, the latter targeted HBase-2.0.
  - Post 4.14, we've decided to stop releases versions of Phoenix that support
    HBase 0.98 and 1.1 releases as the HBase project has made a similar
    decision on creating more releases of those versions.
  - Created a new mailing list, issues@phoenix, to reduce overall traffic to
    dev@phoenix.
  - Held PhoenixCon on June 18th in San Jose, California, USA concurrently
    with HBaseCon (same day, same space). We had roughly 150 people in
    attendance at the events, with 10 Phoenix-specific talks given. Feedback
    was overall positive. Recordings are available at
    https://phoenix.apache.org/phoenixcon-archives.html for those who were
    unable to physically attend the event.
  - We've added two new PMC members and one new committer since our last
    report.

## Health report:
  - Things largely remain the same for the project. As HBase continues to
    evolve into newer versions, it requires us to do the same in Phoenix. We
    have continued activity in the project and I believe things look OK for
    the future.
  - Continuing to support and grow new contributors is a challenge.

## PMC changes:
  - Currently 27 PMC members.
  - New PMC members:
     - Pedro Boado was added to the PMC on Thu Jun 07 2018
     - Vincent Poon was added to the PMC on Thu Jun 07 2018

## Committer base changes:
  - Currently 36 committers.
  - Ohad Shaham was added as a committer on Fri Jun 08 2018

## Releases:
  - 4.14.0 was released on Fri Jun 08 2018
  - 5.0.0 was released on Sat Jul 14 2018

## Mailing list activity:
  - List activity is largely consistent with previous months. There is a
    slight down-tick in volume to users@phoenix.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC now also oversees development of the XMLBeans project:
   XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java
   classes via XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Overall there is progress towards a 4.0.0 release, discussion is underway
   about the remaining fixes/changes that should be included before starting
   the release process.

   The main item of having a new release of XMLBeans was finally resolved by
   re-establishing XMLBeans from the attic under our PMC.

   We released XMLBeans 3.0.0 with a number of important fixes which are
   required for Apache POI, but are likely also important for any other
   project which uses XMLBeans.

   Some discussion is still underway how to handle/evolve/report XMLBeans in
   the future, for now it is reported as sub-project here while we work out
   the details.

   Suport for Java 10+ is provided now by rewriting the Zip-Bomb-Functionality
   on top of commons-compress.

   A number of bug-fixes and smaller enhancements were merged, quite a number
   of these were provided by non-committers via GitHub PullRequests.

## Health report:
 - There is discussion of bug reports/features via bugzilla and a number of
   requests which indicate that the popularity of Apache POI is still very
   good. Questions via email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   Bug influx was moderate this quarter, however also bug-fix rate is not very
   high, probably most "easy wins" are already resolved now and thus mostly
   hard to fix bugs remain.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode and was re-activated only a short while ago.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:

 - Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup search of
   network services.  Services may be implemented in a number of languages,
   while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at least), to allow
   proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:

- No significant issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 -  Minimal activity at present, initial work modular build structure has
    commenced, awaiting to be populated with River 3.0 code.

Release roadmap:

River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&   binary release) River 3.2 - Input
validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling& safe ServiceRegistrar 
lookup service.River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - River is a mature codebase with existing deployments, it was primarily
   designed for dynamic discovery of services on private networks.  IPv4 NAT
   limitations historically prevented the use of River on public networks,
   however the use of IPv6 on public networks removes these limitations.  Web
   services evolved with the publish subscribe model of todays internet, River
   has the potential to dynamically discover services on IPv6 networks, peer
   to peer, blurring current destinctions between client and server, it has
   the potential to address many of the security issues currently experienced
   with IoT and avoid any dependency on the proprietary cloud for "things".

- Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required
     prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and Gadget
     attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports IPv4
     multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so authentication can
     occur prior to downloading service proxy's, this addresses a long
     standing security issue with service lookup while significantly improving
     performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal of
     support for insecure cyphers.
   * Secure TLS SocketFactory's for RMI Registry, uses the currently logged in
     Subject for authentication. The RMI Registry still plays a minor role in
     service activation, this allows those who still use the Registry to
     secure it.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses classdepandjar, a
     bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
   * Updating the Jini specifications.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description:
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - There were three new releases over the last quarter. Version 2.1.2 of the
   XML Security for Java project was released. This contained a number of bug
   fixes as well as some enhancements to get the streaming XML Security code
   working with MTOM.

   There were two new releases of the XML Security for C++ project. Version

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial objects
for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The base of the SIS
library is modelled according international standards published jointly by the
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO).


## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

Commits in the last months include work in the storage of geographic features
in database, addition of Mollweide projection, improvement of JSR-363 (Units
of Measurement) implementation. We still have a few regressions to fix before
we can release SIS 1.0.

The Google Summer of Code project [1] is close to completion. Integration into
Apache SIS code base has not yet started (except for small parts), but we hope
to do that before the end of this year.

The source code repository migrated from Subversion to Git. We received a
first GitHub pull request from a student of San-Francisco.

Not an Apache SIS activity but related: the most well-known open source
library in Apache SIS domain, GDAL/Proj4, raised $144,000 for resolving some
long-standing problems in their library [2]. Their fund-raising page cites
Apache SIS as a source of inspiration in the "Technical details" section. Most
GDAL/Proj4 problems they want to solve were already resolved in Apache SIS for
years. However GDAL/Proj4 is a C/C++ library (SIS is in Java) and have a much
larger ecosystem of projects using their library, which explain their
capability to raise funds for work that duplicates existing Apache SIS
capabilities. We plan to make a presentation of their work (as observer) in
the Open Geospatial Meeting of September and see if we can converge to some
common API between Apache SIS and Proj4. Following that, we may include this
discussion in the "Which geospatial API for the cloud?" talk at Apache
Conference in Montréal.


## Health report:

The project is reported healthy according the Apache Committee Report Helper.


## PMC changes:

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community is healthy and active. New features are being designed
  and developed, and bug reports are being handled. Our user support
  forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers regularly.

  Our last committer additions happened in October 2017:
    Pavel Lyalyakin who has been contributing to the project's website.
    Troy Curtis Jr who has been contributing to SVN's Python 3 bindings.

* Releases

  We have released Subversion 1.10.2 and 1.9.9 on July 20 2018.

  The current supported releases are 1.10.2 and 1.9.9.

  Several bug fixes for our stable release series have been proposed,
  New patch releases can be expected in the near future.

  We have changed our supported release policy. Our plan is to publish
  new standard releases (SVN-1.x) every 6 months, with a bug-fix support
  period of 12 months. Every 2 years, a long-term support (LTS) release
  will be issued which receives bug fixes for a period of 4 years.
  Subversion 1.11.0 is therefore expected in October 2018.
  Our new release policy is documented in detail here:
  https://subversion.apache.org/roadmap.html#release-planning

  We have also changed our release signature requirements. Our previous
  policy required 6 PGP signatures from PMC members, 3 of which count
  for UNIX-like platforms and 3 of which count for Windows platforms.
  The new policy requires at least 3 PGP signatures from PMC members,
  where at least one signature counts for UNIX-like systems and another
  one counts for a Windows system. See https://svn.apache.org/r1835191
  and https://svn.apache.org/r1835195 for related changes made to our
  policy documentation.

* Trademarks

  The PMC has decided against renewing the Japanese trademark
  registration for "SUBVERSION" (Reg No.5148681). This trademark
  had been registered by CollabNet, Inc.

  Corresponding registered trademarks for US and EU are still in place.
