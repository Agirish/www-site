 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, I worked on educating myself on non-profit finance and
       worked with Sam and others on the idea for a VP, Finance to establish
       a financial analysis and planning function at the ASF.  This is
       necessary now that we are considering long-term finance strategies
       such as an endowment.  I expect to spend a significant amount of time
       over the next several months helping develop and support the finance
       function at the ASF.  I will also continue to work on educating myself
       and helping interested members come up to speed and participate in
       financial analysis and planning.

       I did not make the progress that I hoped to make last month on
       progressing the policy roadmap.  I hope to get back to this in the
       current month.

       This month’s reports included some very good ones: Bean, Bloodhound,
       DeltaSpike and Felix were all complimented for their comprehension and
       thoughtfulness.  In addition to the usual comments about long lapses
       since new committer / PMC member additions and reminder that jira /
       commit / mail volume stats are not useful unless supporting a specific
       point, there were a few less common comments this month:
       * Reminder to copy trademarks@ when dealing with potential
         infringement issues
       * Reminder that individuals contribute to ASF projects, not companies
       * Observation that some important discussions on dev or private lists
         were missing from project reports.

    B. President [Sam]

       Issues for the Board
       ====================

       See VP, Finance resolution.

       Overall
       =======

       Income running under plan.  Expenses running slightly under plan. 
       Neither are a concern.  Expenses are easier to plan for and we
       consistently under-run the plan.  Income is notoriously difficult to
       determine when individual donations will be received, so it will
       require a quarter or two before we can determine any real trends.

       Brand Management
       ================

       There are currently 36 tasks being tracked/monitored by the brand
       management team.

       Mostly "business as usual".

       Most notable: Registrations have been submitted in the US for APACHE.

       Fundraising
       ===========

       Significant cycles spent on endowment.  Details in the report.  Quick
       overall summary: based on a suggestion from Phil, this will be split
       out into a separate role and generalized to overall financial
       planning.  Tom has been nominated to lead this, with work to be done
       or brought back to a new finance@ mailing list.  Everyone that has
       contributed to the endowment discussion is welcome to participate.

       No increase of expenditures to Virtual are being asked for at this
       time.  Some of the expenses budgeted for Bronze Sponsor relations that
       have not yet been started may be redirected to expenses related to the
       development of an endowment proposal (e.g., third party review of
       proposals).

       Informal target for bringing a completed proposal for ratification by
       the board is the September board meeting.  No funds will be solicited
       until we have a board approved plan.  Meanwhile, I plan to operate
       under the assumption that I (The President) can approve or delegate
       the approval of reasonable expenditures and discussions with third
       parties (specifically items like a review of proposal seeking input,
       and specifically EXCLUDING actual solicitation).

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s Financial performance for the
       first month of FY19;

       Operating Cash on May 31st, 2018 was $1,999K, which is down $73K from
       last month’s ending balance (Apr 18) of $2,072K.    Total Cash as of
       May 31st, 2018 is $3,392K ( includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation). The May 2018 ending Operating cash balance of $1,999K
       represents an Operating cash reserve of 12.6 months based on the FY19
       conservative Cash forecast average monthly spending of $158.1K/month(
       which is roughly $55K/month higher than the FY18 avg monthly expense
       amount).  The ASF reserve continues to be very healthy for an
       organization of the ASF’s size.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, the ASF, with regard to Income, was down
       both vs budget and vs FY18.  With regard to the Income vs Budget we
       were off $94K due mostly to timing of sponsor payments. This is the
       same issue when compared to FY18 where a couple of Platinum sponsor
       payments arrived in May vs April.   YTD expenses, through May 31st,
       2018 are under budget by $40.4K, with all but Fundraising being under
       budget ( this is timing related as both the May and Jun Sponsorship
       paid service, were made in May and Infra is under due to timing of
       Lease web and staffing expenses as is Publicity due to timing of some
       vendor invoices ).  Expenses, as compared to May 2017 were $38.2K
       higher due to increases in Fundraising and the timing of some
       Publicity vendor payments, that were offset by lower Infra costs due
       to the timing of the Travis CL and Lease web payments.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), for May 2018 the ASF finished with a -
       $72.5K NI vs a budgeted negative <$18.6K> NI or $53.9K  behind the
       May 2018 budget for Net Income.  This was mostly attributable to
       timing of Sponsor payments though there were some vendor invoice
       timing issues as well so we will monitor this going forward, however
       as this is the first month of the Fiscal year, this type of result is
       not A-typical.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       The earliest cloud service credits donations are coming up for
       renewal. No concerns about lack of renewal at this time.

       Thanks to the long running work to Puppetize workloads Infra is now
       able to move services to take advantage of cost structures (e.g. low
       bandwidth charges in EU)


       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Annual Report is being prepared.

       Sponsor engagement / support continues to reap benefits.

       Mostly "business as usual".

       Conferences
       ===========

       Apache EU Roadshow was a success. There are ongoing conversations
       about further collaborations with NewThinking producers.

       ACNA18 now becomes the focus with respect to promotional work. Please
       help amplify. There is a call for volunteers open for help with items
       not covered by paid staff.

       On going discussions relating to Chicago and DC Roadshow proposals and
       early stage conversations about potential for ApacheCon in Seoul in
       2019.

       TAC
       ===

       Of the 28 that applied, 13 were accepted for ACNA.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       Met with a potential Sponsor at Apache EU Roadshow - which was also an
       amazing event!

       ASFP wiki and issues space are still quiet; still working on suggested
       guidelines for use.  Often the speed of large-subscription mailing
       lists is so fast to require a conscious decision to keep topics
       focused.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Daniel Ruggeri: 
A successful month in terms of day-to-day fundraising
activities as well as thoughtful conversations around expanding fundraising
and solidifying our future.

Endowment Conversations
* We have broached the topic of "Should we pursue an endowment?" with the
  membership at large. Lots of feedback and conversation ensued resulting in
  the gathering of data into a starting point document.
* Several folks have engaged to lend their expertise and help shape the
  potential plan on the fundraising@ list.
* A proposal has been drafted to re-purpose a portion of the fundraising
  budget to focus specifically on examining the idea of and potential planning
  for establishing an endowment.
* Conversations are beginning on what this might mean to our outreach (Sponsor
  Relations) activities

Other day to day:
* Confusion around "Sponsor+" and "Platinum+" terminology was held resulting
  in a finalized name of "Sponsor + Events". Key takeaway: This is not a new
  level of sponsorship or new fundraising program - just a way to bundle and
  recognize sponsors for the expanded support.
* "Sponsor + Events" conversations with VP Marketing & Publicity as well as VP
   Conferences have been held to ensure alignment.
* Ideas of running a yearly, more visible campaign (colloquially referred to
  as "Super Thermometer Campaign") as well as using a formal IT system for
  sponsor tracking and handling were initially discussed, but tabled due to
  the endowment conversations.
* Strong fundraising work this month. We have some excitement due to new,
  returning and renewing sponsors.

KAM:

Overall, fundraising continues to go well.  Some small points: Work for
additional bronze ambassador support from Tom is delayed pending both a
contract vehicle from Virtual as well as discussions around a pivot to use
the budget for a VP, Finance role. Committee meetings continue to occur
monthly. Continue improving our fundraising procedures and working on our
playbook website. Daniel Ruggeri now has access to my private notes and task
tracking system. The ASF Sponsor Benefits is now cleaned up and consistent
with the slide deck.

And now bigger points:

- Sponsor.apache.org is now fixed.  Thanks Infra!

- The minimum for Hopsie donations is now working at $5.  Otherwise, donating a
dollar nets us a few cents.

- Submitted annual report for Fundraising to SK:

2018 FUNDRAISING REPORT by Kevin A. McGrail aka KAM

As always, we would like to start our fundraising report by thanking our
sponsors for their continued support.  As a 501(c)(3) charity, our sponsors
are our sole source of funding.  We could not do it without them!

For fiscal year 2018, thanks to our generous sponsors, we finished with a
positive net income and raised 150% of our goals.  We also benefited from an
additional large donation that netted just under $900K from the Pineapple
Fund which opened up the ability to explore endowments for the long-term
viability of the Apache Software Foundation.

In fact, this year has been all about bringing new ideas to the sponsorship
program.

In the first quarter, the ASF Fundraising team welcomed Kevin A. McGrail to
the role of VP Fundraising after he worked to launch our individual sponsor
program with Hopsie in his role as Assistant Treasurer.  After brainstorming
ideas at two face to face meetings, we identified a lot of points where we
could improve things and set ambitious goals for the year.

In the second quarter, we worked to refine our Targeted Sponsorship program
that recognizes sponsors who support us in ways beyond normal sponsorship. 
Donated software, credits for cloud servers, graphical work, travel
assistance, legal support and more!

We also looked at creating a closely related company to help the Apache
Software Foundation do things outside of our 501(c)(3) and support the
foundation.  We decided against doing so but it was a valuable exercise.

In the third quarter, we launched our new thanks page including Targeted
Sponsorship.  We also began heavily working on three Apache events for 2018:
ApacheCon 2018 North America in Montreal in September, the Apache 2018 EU
Roadshow in Berlin in June and the Apache 2018 US Roadshow in Washington, DC
in October.

The DC Roadshow is one of the first, if not the first event that we are
looking to provide a career fair at the same time as we have a day long track
on open source!

Visit https://apachecon.com for more information. We hope to see you at one
if not all of the events.

Finally, we increased our sponsorship rates for the first time in our 18 year
history.

In the fourth quarter, we began working on the concept of an endowment in
earnest which continues with lots of debate.  Looking back over the whole
year, we had a lot of small but important news: We added routine committee
meetings.

We were chosen by Amazon for early access to Alexa Donations with Amazon Pay
("Make a donation to the Apache Software Foundation").

We began asking for multi-year commitments to bring more stability to
operations.

We grew the ambassador program to make sure our sponsors each have a contact
to improve two-way communications.

We expanded our work with Virtual to continue improving our operations,
fundraising & accounting.  This has been a wonderful partnership that we are
working to expand again further.

We completed our first ever audit with an unqualified status and brought our
Guidestar profile up to Gold status.


And finally, to recognize our “Apache Family”, we want to recognize the
support of the following sponsors:

8 Platinum Sponsors: Cloudera, Comcast, Facebook, Google, LeaseWeb,
Microsoft, Oath & the Pineapple Fund.

9 Gold Sponsors: Anonymous (we know who you are!), ARM, Bloomberg,
Hortonworks, Huawei, IBM, Indeed, ODPI & Pivotal.

8 Silver Sponsors: Aetna, Budget Direct, Capital One, Cerner, Inspur, Private
Internet Access, Red Hat, Target & Union Investment.

14 Bronze Sponsors: Airport Rentals, The Blog Starter, Casino Bonus,
Bookmakers, Casino2k, Emerio, HostChecka.com, HostingAdvice.com, HostPapa Web
Hosting, The Linux Foundation, Mobile Slots, SCAMS.info, Site Builder Report,
Twitter & Web Hosting Secret Revealed

&

4 Platinum Targeted Sponsors: Microsoft, Oath, OSU Open Source Labs &
Sonatype.

5 Gold Targeted Sponsors: Atlassian, The CrytpoFund, Datadog, PhoenixNAP &
Quenda.

3 Silver Targeted Sponsors: Amazon Web Services, Hotwax Systems & Rackspace.

11 Bronze Targeted Sponsors: Assembla, Bintray, Education Networks of
America, Google, Hopsie, No-IP, PagerDuty, Peregrine Computer Consultants
Corporation, Sonic.net, SURFnet & Virtru.

And last but not least, our 2018 event sponsors: Amazon, CloudOps, Comcast,
GridGain, IBM, Linode, Red Hat, ShapeBlue & Talener.  Thank you!

As we head towards our 20th anniversary, we welcome Daniel Ruggeri as a co-VP
of Fundraising.  Together we want to express our thanks to our very generous
Sponsors who are crucial to the Apache Software Foundation’s success!  Thank
you, thank you, thank you.

Events:

Attended BBW & FOSS Backstage for ASF to speak on How to be an Effective
Board Member: https://foss-backstage.de/session/how-be-effective-board-member

The show was a great success in my opinion.  NewThinking is a wonderful
organization and the venue was great.  Also had a number of meetings and will
have an after report done in the next few days.

After report at https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/9f6114a064e0250e7910b80c9af3f3a9b96d51495a2cf3be0c53ad98@%3Cfundraising.apache.org%3E


- Work continues on our remaining two 2018 Apache events including sponsor
agreements and pitches.  NOTE: We are almost sold out for the sponsorship
for ApacheCon.

- Attended breakfast for GMU Cyber. Key benefit was support for JP who is our
sponsor for the DC Roadshow.  A meeting is being coordinated to plan the
roadshow further now that the Berlin show is out of the way.

- (Repeat from last report): Planning to attend AC2018 to speak on Inclusion,
 Meritocracy and the Apache Way

- Framework for Sponsor + Events (previously Sponsor+) updated and approved 
by Rich.  See
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O4kz-OZY8UTXwtorctWwFe0OCZ2ChJ8vPVYva4-qoDc/edit#heading=h.sktiqud2p4nr

- Coordination for Huawei annual conference: From Chris Xie: “Huawei Connect
2018 conference has allocated one exhibition booth (about 6 square meters) to
showcase Apache Software Foundation during the conference. This is just to
give you a heads-up notice so that you can think about how you would like to
utilize this booth for ASF. Zhanghaitao(Hector) in the cc list is helping
organize this event. If you have further questions, please feel free to let
him know.”


- The endowment project is effectively on hold for anyone outside the
foundation.  Additional Key points:

Copied Sam & Roman’s notes into the overview doc. Spoke to Myrle’s mother
about the endowment.  She has recommended we talk to John H. Taylor
Consulting. Sam’s goal is to create a new role, VP Finance with a goal of
having an endowment ready for a board consideration in the Fall. Roman
obtained a proposal from the Jewish Community Foundation that he’s having
vetted to share further.


- Discussions with Dito continue about bringing GAM
https://github.com/jay0lee/GAM under the ASF Umbrella


- Two Recommendations for the Board from our events discussion:

#1 - For next year, the budget should include the max risk exposure assuming
 worst case scenarios: There is a concern that events are beyond the level of
 risk exposure that the budget was intended to allow for due to unclear
 processes at the ASF for signatory privileges:
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/af9 5e4303d2b7801a1d2da3f4841133b33b4583b8494da98859cac1b@%3Cboard.apache.org%3E

Clarify if budgets are based on the Net or Gross and if Net, then also
include a maximum risk exposure.  Real World Recommendation: The ASF CY 2019
Event Budget should be revised for a Net Loss of 100K with a max signature
authority of 250K.

#2 - We need to spend money from sponsors. 
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/66b 77312d1281c5a68867dd3c8b87c91a4bc51bd18137dac56fe7829@%3Cboard.apache.org%3E
 We cannot simply grow a hoard of cash.  Losing money on events around the
 world with a variety of roadshows and apachecon is a good implementation of
 our mission for OSS by educating people.

Based on past performance, ApacheCon is not a money maker and should not be
considered to be one.  However, it is an amazing event that should be
considered a success based on attendance not profit.

As such, we recommend the board align the CY 2019 budget for a $100K loss on
conferences as an excellent and appropriate use of our sponsor funds.  We do
not need to break even on our events as we raise funds elsewhere.

The Sponsor + Events and Fundraising improvements allow Conferences to have
financial freedom to run worthwhile events with less concern about the
financial impact and lower cost of entry for attendees.

NOTE: Only subsidize, do not give away free attendance.

- We continue working to get targeted sponsors for Infra and Legal

Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 205 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 27 items, and have 48.4K followers on
Twitter. We posted 10 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 33.2K
organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to
announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are
requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice
for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 5 media queries. The ASF received 1,241
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,999. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 4,174 press hits vs. last month's 4,690. ApacheCon received
108 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received one analyst query. Apache was mentioned in
23 reports by Gartner; 1 reports by Forrester; 8 reports by 451 Research; and
8 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: aside from production for graphics for the Annual Report, no
projects are currently underway.

IX. Events liaison: Sally continues work with ASF Conferences and ComDev
regarding upcoming Apache Community events that include ApacheCon and both
Apache Roadshows. In addition, she is assisting with securing media and
community partners for ApacheCon, as outreach has yet to be initiated by the
production team.

X. Newswire accounts: with the above 4 press releases, we have depleted our
pre-paid press release package with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire, and have now
initiated a new pre-paid contract through 2019.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Finances
========
* One of our sponsors has provided cloud service credits for Infra to
  use for running our services. These credits are running out at the
  end of September, but we have received assurances they will be
  continued. The Infra team has been working with Fundraising to
  secure the continued credits, hopefully with an increase and with
  public recognition under the "Targeted Sponsorship" program.
* Another sponsor has been providing cloud service credits, and Infra
  has been working with Fundraising to streamline, simplify, and
  recognize their donation.
* Taking advantage of our puppetized services, the team has been able
  to easily shift services around to reduce our overall costs. In
  particular, Europe has very low bandwidth charges, so we have moved
  heavy users (rsync, archive, TLP) to European data centers.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- The Apache Subversion server that we run has been having some
  difficulties related to backups. The server runs in the United
  States, and backs up to Europe. We plan to move this server to
  Europe, which will have second order effects on costs, some
  downstream services, and reliability.
- Our Jenkins build environment is due for an upgrade to the next LTS
  release, as does Jira. We will be upgrading both of these systems
  over the next month.
- In order to drop our open issue count, the Infra team is planning a
  bug bash to occur on Monday, June 18th (two days before the Board
  meeting).

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Moving our email instructure from old FreeBSD-based systems into
  newer, puppetized services has been an ongoing, difficult, and
  long-term goal. Some good progress has been made on this front over
  the past month, but we have lots of investigation, building, and
  testing before enabling the new setup of this critical service.

General Activity
================
- Confluence was upgraded to 6.9.0
- Continued work on our new status and monitoring changes
- We had some failing disks on our mailing system, which took several
  days to sort through. Additional disks were ordered, and we have two
  hot spares installed now. This should hold us until our long-term
  work enables our migration.
- We've had a project, Fineract, request a project VM with a resource
  allocation an order of magnitude higher than what we typically
  provide. We've told them that this request exceeds our ability to
  provide the service, and redirected them to the Board to seek
  funding for such a service.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Conferences Board Report, June 2018

* EU Roadshow

The Apache EU Roadshow was last week in Berlin, in conjunction with
Berlin Buzzwords and FOSS Backstage. 

Apache had a lounge, upstairs, with icecream and stickers. We had many 
great conversations with many participants.

In addition to the Roadshow-specific content, it's also worth noting
that roughly half of the content for Berlin Buzzwords was related to
Apache projects. Overall, we had a great showing here.

We had a very productive conversation with the NewThinking producers,
and we are considering cooperating with them for future events. The fit
was perfect, and the event was brilliantly executed.

* ACNA18

With the EU Roadshow complete, we're starting to focus more on ApacheCon
Montreal. This includes:

- Increased traffic on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ groups.

- Publishing videos and podcasts from the EU Roadshow, with the additional
message encouraging people to come to Montreal. This will hopefully also
give us the opportunity to promote some of these on higher-visibility
sites.

- Calls for volunteers (http://apachecon.com/acna18/volunteer.html) to
cover things that are not being handled by paid staff.

- Periodic reminders to dev and user lists of the event.

- Encouraging speakers to do their own event promotion.

Members are encouraged to amplify all of these efforts in their own
spheres of influence.

* DC Roadshow

While in Berlin, Kevin started working on the DC Roadshow website and
CFP. We should have something to announce there soon.

* Chicago Roadshow

Discussions are ongoing about doing a "Roadshow" type event in Chicago
in 2019.

* Seoul 2019

A discussion about doing an ApacheCon in Seoul in Spring 2019 is in very
preliminary stages.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Of the 28 that applied, 13 were accepted for ACNA this time around. We had a
high standard of applicants but in the end, these 13 stood out from the rest
as a group. The TAC team continue to get applicants ready for ACNA Rooms ,
flights and Visa letters are in progress but not yet complete. Not much else
happening at this time other than wait for the processes to complete. As last
year we will be using one Travel Agent for all flights. Treasurer is aware and
prepped to go for payments.

Apologies for the tardy commit of this report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

VP, Infra has provided a draft policy for GDPR that we are currently
reviewing. Progress has been slow but I expect in the next month or two to get
something finalized and posted regarding it. Most of the policy shifts the
operational day to day to infra, and appoints VP, Legal as a Data Privacy
officer for strategic review.

Given this, and also our DMCA policy which is extremely similar, I approached
the Board privately about considering the appointment of a VP, Data Privacy,
initially staffed by VP, Legal (me), but after six months, staffed by a new
volunteer, providing an opportunity for growth. It makes sense during this
time and I am willing to commit to doing so, but after six months I won't be
able to fulfill both positions and during that time, considering the wealth of
people chiming in w.r.t things like GDPR and other issues, I think finding
such a volunteer would not prove difficult. So, I specifically request that
the Board consider this officer appointment publicly in next month's meeting -
based on private positive feedback so far.

Discussions on the legal-discuss list are consistently answered in a timely
fashion, mostly by other contributors to the committee and the list.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues and helping projects clean
up the backlog of old issues and outstanding CVE names.  Signifcant
co-ordination work happened in April and May based on the "Zip Slip"
flaws reported by Snyk that were reported in more than a dozen ASF
projects.  In most cases these were not found to be security
vulnerabilities, and the affected code was fixed or removed. 

Stats for May 2018:

      6	        [license confusion]
      21	[support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 55 (last months: 54, 47, 40)

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis2 Board Report, June 2018

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

- Axis2 Java 1.7.8 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Axis2 Java 1.8 (development)

- Axis2 C 1.7 (development)

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained. We continue to receive patches from various new
users/contributors.

As the IT industry moves in droves from SOAP to JSON, Axis2 Java and my day
job are no exception and while Axis2 has an excellent REST / GSON module its
lacking docs and examples so its not used much. This next quarter the Axis2
teams expects to discuss bugfixes, docs and future direction to this module.

Another trend is Spring Boot and some projects like Log4j2 I notice has
starter kits. This next quarter we will be looking at what a starter kit for
our project would look like.

Axis 1.x has not been released since 2006 however one committer, Andreas
Veithen, has been very active in that repo for several years. No decision has
been made on a release schedule however several open threads are currently in
progress concerning what a release may look like at this point.

Axis2 C added a new committer this past December 2017, and so far that is
helping the project pick up speed. Indications are that a 1.7 release could
happen by the end of the year.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC May 9th
   2018.
## Releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.8 was released on May 19, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## JIRA Activity

- 11 JIRA tickets created in the last 90 days.
- 6 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 90 days.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as
Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Currently, Bahir provides extensions to
multiple distributed analytic platforms, extending their reach with a
diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data sources.

Community Activity:

Apache Bahir community activity has been resuming slowly, while it is working
to catch up on Spark releases, few members are also working on porting the
data source implementations to the new data source API that was released with
Spark 2.3.

There is also a conversation on new extensions being donated to the project,
but that has a dependency on Spark 2.3.

Activities around Flink extensions at the moment are very low.

Issues:
* No known issues

Releases: 

06/04/2018 - Bahir for Spark 2.1.2 
08/22/2017 - Bahir for Spark2.2.0 
07/11/2017 - Bahir for Spark 2.1.1 
05/24/2017 - Bahir for Flink 1.0
03/05/2017 - Bahir for Spark 2.1.0 
01/28/2017 - Bahir for Spark 2.0.2
10/28/2016 - Bahir for Spark 2.0.1

Committers or PMC changes (Currently 9 PMC / 37 committers) 

09/14/2017 - Esteban Laver becomes Apache Bahir committer 
04/05/2017 - Robert Metzger becomes Apache Bahir PMC 
03/13/2017 - Christian Kadner becomes Apache Bahir PMC 
11/30/2016 - Christian Kadner voted as Apache Bahir committer 
10/18/2016 - Robert Metzger voted as Apache Bahir committer

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Davor Bonaci]

## Description:

Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:

There are no issues that require the Board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

Apache Beam is now in its second year as a top-level project, and just
celebrated one-year anniversary of its first stable release.

Major technical efforts going on include:
  - Building a portable Flink runner, which adds support for Python and Go
    SDKs.
  - Beam SQL.
  - Infrastructure and automation.

Beam desires to serve as a glue in the ecosystem, interconnecting SDKs,
engines and storage/messaging systems. On the execution side, Apache Samza
runner has seen increased activity, while other prototype runners are mostly
dormant on feature branches. On the IO connector side, the healthy growth
continues, with new connectors being contributed or improved month-over-month.

IP clearances have been completed for:
  - Euphoria API.
  - Go SDK.

Recent community decisions include:
  - Publishing guidelines for becoming (and behaving as) a Beam committer.
  - Releasing Go SDK.
  - Automation of stale pull requests.

No blog posts have been published this quarter. Beam was featured at several
conferences, including Flink Forward San Francisco, and DataWorks Summit
Berlin.

Going forward, the main focus should be on the community growth, particularly
on the user side using non-proprietary engines. This goes hand-in hand with
the next major technical milestone of delivering on the portability framework,
making Beam available to Python and Go communities.

## Health report:

The community continues to grow steadily, as follows:
  - Lifetime unique contributors grew to 269, with 24 new first-time
    contributors.
  - Increased subscriptions and activity on the mailing list and in JIRA.
  - Contribution of new components into the project by external entities.

The amount of open discussion and design on the mailing list is at a new high,
benefited by arrival of new contributors and increased openness by existing
contributors.

## PMC changes:

Currently 19 PMC members. One PMC member has been added since the last report:
  - Thomas Weise was added to the PMC on Fri Jun 08 2018.

## Committer base changes:

Currently 37 committers. Six new committers have been added since the last
report. New committers:
  - Jason Kuster was added as a committer on Fri Apr 27 2018.
  - Pablo Estrada was added as a committer on Fri Apr 27 2018.
  - Gris Cuevas was added as a committer on Thu May 03 2018.
  - Charles Chen was added as a committer on Fri Jun 08 2018.
  - Henning Rohde was added as a committer on Fri Jun 08 2018.
  - Alexey Romanenko was added as a committer on Tue Jun 12 2018.

The PMC recognizes two areas for improvement: (1) diversity of affiliations
among active committers, and (2) an imbalance of contributors to active
committers. The main cause of these recent imbalances is turnover over the
last year, perhaps among some others. The general plan is to invite quite a
few new committers over the next period of time, but not too quickly to
jeopardize the community, or negatively affect where the project business is
handled.

Other recent actions include:
  - Revision of new contributor materials to be more welcoming.
  - Publishing the (subjective) guidelines for becoming a committer.
  - Adding an explicit "Community" section to the web site, highlighting
    ongoing projects to join.

PMC member Kenneth Knowles deserves (a rare) mention by name for proactively
reaching out to a large number of contributors, offering encouragement and
individual coaching to those interested. This effort meaningfully moved the
needle forward.

## Releases:

Since the last report, Apache Beam has published one release, with one more
currently in progress:
  - 2.4.0 was released on Mon Mar 19 2018.
  - 2.5.0 is currently under preparation and voting.

Version 2.0.0 was the first release that comes with API stability guarantees.
Going forward, we expect to publish a release every 6 weeks. We have been
short of our declared goal recently; however, the community is tackling this
issue.

## Mailing list activity:

Mailing list subscriptions and activity continues to increase modestly. The
number of emails on the development mailing list is up ~47%, and the number of
threads is up ~45%. We continue to see an increase in frequency and depth of
mailing list discussions, as well as better participation and diversity of
opinion compared to last year.

- dev@beam.apache.org
  - 519 subscribers (up 15 in the last 3 months).
  - 2127 emails sent to list (1393 in previous quarter).

- user@beam.apache.org
  - 548 subscribers (up 15 in the last 3 months).
  - 389 emails sent to list (456 in previous quarter).

## JIRA activity:

For the second quarter in a row, the JIRA activity is increasing, turning over
the earlier trend.

- 705 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (507 in the previous quarter).
- 368 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months (324 in the previous
  quarter).

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Peter Linnell]

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

As for previous reports, activity remains on the low side. Some progress
has been achieved with experimentation with a new core model.

See further information below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

With the previous report mainly able to focus on infrastructure issues,
such as restoration of issue tracking for the project through migration
of the main Apache Bloodhound instance to new hardware, this quarter
we have considered moving the development of new sub projects in git
instead of Apache Subversion and experimenting with Django as a means
to replace Trac as the base for the project.

The idea of moving to git appeared to have backing from the community.
While the community generally avoided spelling out their reasons for
wanting to move, it may be that the move will benefit the project from
more people being used to using git than Subversion. Progress to make
this decision final has not yet been sought but discussion of this may
be expected in the next report. Certainly the PMC is not treating this
as something to rush as it does not actively block progress.

The new bloodhound core experiment has begun with a new branch of the
subversion repository dedicated to looking at making the core database
model with Django tooling. The current state of this is still fairly
basic but flexible. With decisions to be made about the direction to
take from this point, opinions have been sought by the chair to attempt
to encourage more engagement from those that have expressed interest
in the project.

Despite perhaps a disappointing amount of progress, the project Chair
suggests on behalf of the PMC that there is a continued wish to defer
the proposal to move Apache Bloodhound to the Attic for another three
months.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description:
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
   JavaScript.

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
We had no platform releases this quarter. Regarding tools releases - we had
one for cordova-common and cordova-serve, mainly to fix small bugs and update
dependencies. We had also one plugins release, where we released new versions
for 10 plugins - which contained bug fixes.

With the deprecation of Node.js 4 support by the Node Foundation (see our
[blog
post](https://cordova.apache.org/news/2016/10/01/0.x-4.x-deprecation-timeline.html))
 we are proceeding with removing Node 4 support in all our tools and
 platforms, which will bump up all versions by a major version. This will
 bring ES6 and ES7 support into Cordova.

## Health report:
Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green.

We still have a backlog of GitHub Pull Request activity, again, same as last
quarter. We have started migrating from JIRA to Github Issues (starting with
cordova-docs) to perhaps take advantage of some automation available through
Github apps.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache DeltaSpike is  a suite of portable CDI (Contexts & Dependency
 Injection) extensions intended to make application development easier when
 working with CDI and Java EE.  Some of its key features include:
 
 - A core runtime that supports component configuration, type safe messaging
   and internationalization, and exception handling.
 - A suite of utilities to make programmatic bean lookup easier.
 - A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans
   outside of a container.
 - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
 - JPA integration and transaction support.
 - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.
 - Quartz integration
 
 Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
 your CDI enabled projects.

## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
 Activity is fine. We had quite some discussions in the Config 
 area. They derived from discussions at the ConfigJSR (JSR-382)
 which took over the core design of DeltaSpike. We had 1 person
 taking part in the discussion over there whereas in DeltaSpike
 I really got a hand full of people giving feedback. So we ended
 up implementing the feature in DeltaSpike first and then porting
 it back to ConfigJSR (as it's also ALv2). This will be in the 
 upcoming 1.9.0 release.
 
## Health report: 
 Health is ok. The project is already very stable and probably
 had it's peak. A BUNCH of features we have in DeltaSpike since
 almost forever have now been directly made part of the respective
 JSRs. E.g. CDI.current(), JSF CDI support etc. 
 We still add a lot of additional value and we allow to make the same
 code run on JavaEE6 to EE8++! This is something big companies love.

  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09
  None on the horizon.

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  I needed to miss the normal May reporting period. So this report covers the
  previous four months.

  No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

  Some minor activity on the dev list, early in the quarter.

  For the last month, Gump has been trying to be helpful by telling about
  a problem with one of our various Gump runs. No one has found the time to
  do extended investigation.

  Four PMC members were present during the quarter. This was mainly initial
  discussion of a draft new logo, that was proposed to the private list.
  People were involved and encouraging. However there was no follow-up.

  For this last month there was no presence indicated by any PMC member.

  At this report, three other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Activity: Idle
  3+ people have indicated presence, so has the potential for sufficient
  oversight.

  There was no discussion following board feedback at the previous report,
  which again wondered why no recent release, and how does the community
  benefit from any development of the past seven years.

  It does take effort to release Forrest. It is well-documented, and there
  have been past suggestions for making it a bit easier. As stated before,
  i hope to assist, but am not in a position to initiate or drive it.

  The project has been in a treading-water state for a long time, as notified
  in previous reports.

  My impression is that it is a dedicated group, that does not (in general)
  actively use or develop the project, but are still attached. However these
  days no-one has the energy to further the project.

  The project should probably again consider moving to the Attic, given the
  lack of attention to Gump and the state of no discussion about the board
  feedback.

  The abovementioned, was the state of things. Then in response to this
  draft report a non-PMC member said that they are intending to address
  the release and Gump.

  So it seems that we should continue to tread water for a while longer.

Security issues published:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  Apache Gump asked various projects if they were still interested. One of
  our committers replied that we are. Gump is still useful for us. Thanks.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache FreeMarker Project  [Dániel Dékány]

## Description:

Apache FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text
output based on templates. Apache FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class
library for programmers.

FreeMarker 2 (the current stable line) produces releases since 2002. The
FreeMarker project has joined the ASF in 2015, and graduated from the
Incubator in early 2018.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Activity was low this month. There was some site updates regarding EU
regulations, and transition from http://try.freemarker.org to
https://try.freemarker.apache.org is almost done.

## Health report:

Activity is relatively low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User
question (mostly on StackOverflow) and new Jira issues are being answered
promptly.

The long term goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0 branch, so
that the project can innovate and the code base can become much cleaner (and
more attractive for new committers), instead of being blocked by 15 years of
historical baggage. (Meanwhile, the backward compatible 2.x branch must be
maintained, and produce releases.)

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 7 committers.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Releases:

 - 2.3.28 was released on Wed Apr 04 2018

## Mailing list activity:

 - dev@freemarker.apache.org:
    - 63 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months):
    - 190 emails sent to list (152 in previous quarter)

 - notifications@freemarker.apache.org:
    - 16 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 605 emails sent to list (235 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:

 - 6 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 5 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Guacamole Project  [Mike Jumper]

## Description:
 - Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway which supports
   standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH. We call it "clientless" because
   no plugins or client software are required. Once Guacamole is installed on
   a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Several recent contributions related to improving the functionality of
   Guacamole's terminal emulator.
 - A contributor has accepted an invitation for committership. We are
   currently awaiting their CLA.
 - The scope of the 1.0.0 release has been finalized, and the release process
   has begun.

## Health report:
 - The project is still operating in a healthy manner. No significant changes
   in the last quarter. Development and community involvement continue to be
   active.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 9 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Carl Harris on Sun Nov 19 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 10 committers.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

No changes compared to the last quarter.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The Tomcat and Forrest communities are still using Gump actively.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

## Activity:

 - A branching for further componentization core module is underway, preparing
   for 0.8.0 release.

## Health report:

 - One new committer joined the community.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 10 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

         Having made the (always difficult) first release, the project
         is in good shape. They are starting to generate some publicity
         by speaking at conferences. I am encouraging them to create a
         twitter account (so that they can interact with the wider
         community more frequently) and to start thinking of a second
         release (to ensure that the release process is reproducible).

               now notifications have moved to a separate
               list
               I'm still struggling with the volume of
               notifications. It is getting easier as I
               become more familiar with the project but I do
               worry that newcomers to the project will find
               it difficult to follow.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Dave Fisher: AFAICT the SGA has not been provided and a mentor has 
  advised that this can wait until graduation.
  I don't think that is correct and it is not the same as the guidance 
  given to other podlings like Heron.

--------------------
OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able 
to execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) 
from external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional 
logic (Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST 
API-based Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support 
packaging and catalog services.  Additionally, it now provides options to 
host the platform components as Docker containers on various Container 
Frameworks such as Mesos, Kubernetes, and Compose.

OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:    

  * Produce our first source code release under Incubator (automation work 
  is now complete here https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-release).  
  We believe that the process to release will be initiated in the next 2 
  weeks.
  * Increase contributions to ensure all project repos are maintained. and 
  address Issue / PR backlog.
  * Close legal transferred of Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and 
  logo to ASF

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?    

  * Issue backlog building on incubator-openwhisk is still a major issue 
  (partly due to #3 above). As of this report, the "open" issue backlog is 
  365 and open PR is 55. Need to prioritize and work to reduce while 
  advancing performance/security/deployment issues.

  * Trying to add more active Committers to augment those who have dropped 
  off in their activity; however, we have reached an impasse where potential 
  new Contributor pull requests are not getting timely reviews/merges to 
  provide a resume' for adding to the Committer roles.

  * It seems that Apache Infra. will not provide us servers to host a 
  staging 
  environment that would help us perform needed staging testing on Pull 
  Requests.  This means that independent testing needs to be done by members 
  (companies). We have explored a corporate donation as suggested (ala Spark 
  and SystemML), but this does not seem possible at this time.  

  * Formal hand-off of OpenWhisk trademark/logo from IBM needs to be 
  executed; need to identify process for this.
  Discussion started w/ Apache legal via "legal-discuss" mailing list with 
  subject "Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and logo".
  IBM intends to hand-off ownership of trademarks at time of graduation.

How has the community developed since the last report?    

  * "dev" mailing list activity has been down with the exception of work 
  around the new Go language runtime (mostly April).  It appears that 2Q 
  conferences may be partly to blame with corporate Committers being 
  preoccupied.

  * incubator-openwhisk Github stars: 3218 (+341 since last report)

  * incubator-openwhisk GitHub forks: 616 (+72 since last report)

  * Slack community We're ~800 members and it is really active, from both 
  end users or the project and contributors

  * The  bi-weekly Zoom "Technical Interchange" continues to be well 
  received and attended. Complete videos posted to OW YouTube channel and detailed 
  notes to our CWIKI. YouTube Channel: Apache Meetings Playlist 
  (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzgShnQk8F43NKsvEYA1SA)

Pulsar
Pulsar is a highly scalable, low latency messaging platform running on
commodity hardware. It provides simple pub-sub semantics over topics,
guaranteed at-least-once delivery of messages, automatic cursor management 
for
subscribers, and cross-datacenter replication.

Pulsar has been incubating since 2017-06-01.

Most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete the Podling name search tasks. The task is in progress right 
now.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community added 7 new contributors that submitted pull-requests which
  were merged into master.

  The number of users approaching the team on the Slack channel has kept
  steadily increasing since the last report. Many users have actively 
  deployed. Pulsar for evaluation and production use cases.

  Project members from several companies have organized or participated in
  several meetups, presenting Pulsar's introductions, deep-dives and hands-on
  tutorial, including recorded podcasts. We have several scheduled talks on
  Pulsar at various conferences, 2 at ApacheCon in September, one at OSCon 
  in July and 2 others at Strata New York in September. A Pulsar dedicated 
  meetup is being organized for next July.
 
  Since the last report the number of weekly-active-users on the Slack 
  channel has increased from 53 to 88.
 
  We have reached the 1 year mark since Pulsar entering the Apache 
  Incubator.
  Here is a summary of the community developments over the past year:
 
  1. Pulsar community has done 5 Apache releases since entering
     incubator. The release process is well documented and we have
     had 4 different release managers from 3 different companies.
   
  2. We have added 3 committers and PPMC members since incubation and
     there are also other candidates who have already made significant
     contributions to the project.
   
  3. Community of users and people interested in Pulsar has expanded
     considerably. Thanks to the months long work in improving ease of
     use, documentation and blogs, many people became aware of Pulsar
     and started playing with it, then evaluating it and finally
     putting it in production for critical use cases.
   
  4. We have tried to help users getting started through any
     communication channel. Even though we keep trying to encourage
     people to use the mailing list, most of the first interactions
     have been happening through the Slack channel. We also did make
     sure that:
  
     a) No decisions are taken in Slack channel
   
     b) Developers technical discussion happen mostly in Github
        issue/Pull-Request or in developers mailing list
   
     c) Conversations in Slack are sent to dev/user mailing list in a
        daily digest form for archival and to be searchable
 
     In any case Slack has been working fairly well in engaging with
     users, by providing a tool to have very quick informal
     question/answer interactions that were very appreciated by users.

   5. Overall, there were a lot of healthy discussions, with feedback
      and collaborations from people from different companies and
      different perspectives that resulted in much stronger design
      decisions and ultimately a better system.

   6. We have taken several steps to increase awareness, like blog
      posts, meetups (both dedicated to Pulsar or dedicated to similar
      topics) and presentations to conferences, like Strata or
      ApacheCon (where we have 2 talks scheduled for next September).

How has the project developed since the last report?

  23 authors have pushed 469 commits to master in the last 3 months.

  The project has made the its fifth release since joining the
  Apache Incubator (2.0.0-rc1-incubating on May 29th). This was a
  major release that culminated several months of works and lays the
  foundation for the next stage in Pulsar development. New major
  features include:
   * Pulsar Functions (Lightweight compute framework)
   * Schema registry
   * Topic compaction
  
  Community is actively working on next milestone, 2.1 release that
  will include several new features including:
   * Pulsar IO connector framework
   * Tiered storage
   * Go client library

  Since March, 3 new PIPs (Pulsar Improvement Proposals) for major
  feature/changes, have been submitted to the wiki and discussed in the
  mailing list.
 
  To recap the project developments since entering Apache Incubator:
 
  1. Moved to Apache BookKeeper 4.7. Before Pulsar 2.0, we were using
     a fork of BookKeeper from Yahoo, based on 4.3.1 with 245
     additional commits. Thanks to a a big effort in the BookKeeper
     community (which has a large overlap with Pulsar community), all
     these changed were merged back into mainstream BookKeeper branch
     and released in BookKeeper 4.7.0, making possible for Pulsar to
     switch over from the Yahoo fork.

  2. We have received a lot of feedback from people approaching Pulsar
     and learned a lot on how to simplify tools, documentation and
     concepts to make it easier for people to get started.
   
  3. Based on the same feedback and inputs, we have been adding new
     features or extended existing features to match a new variety of
     use case, some of them outside the scope the initial Pulsar
     codebase from Yahoo.

     To summarize the "major" features added in the last year:

      - Pulsar stateless proxy
      - Non-persistent topics
      - End-to-End message encryption
      - Effectively-once semantics
      - Type-safe APIs
      - Schema Registry
      - Pulsar Functions
      - Topic compaction
      - Python client library
    
    With more scheduled for next upcoming release 2.1:
  
      - Pulsar IO connector framework
      - Tiered storage
      - Go client library
    
  4. In addition to features, we have been trying to smooth the
     deployment of a production ready Pulsar cluster, by improving the
     documentation and providing templates for more common environments,
     such as Kubernetes, DCOS or just plain VMs with Ansible.

  5. Having exposure to many users testing and using the sytem outside
     the original Yahoo use cases has proven very effecting in helping
     identifying and resolving corner cases that were not being
     stressed before. This resulted in a much resilient system that
     can adapt better to a large array of different requirements and
     environments.

       The project seems to have slowed somewhat. Development activity
       is about the same, but there has not been a release for over a

       outside of the core group. I will be concerned if things don't

  1. Re-engage PPMC
  2. Release or Retire legacy git repositories
  3. Graduate!

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Uptake in activity with GSOC students, already multiple merged pull 
requests.

  Little engagement from the wider PMC.

  Email stats dev@taverna:
  2018-05: 62
  2018-04: 41
  2018-03: 102

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Moved to Java 9 (just in time for Java 10?).

  PPMC voted on Taverna Language release, but it failed IPMC vote
  due to CC-BY licensed schema files. Will refactor.
  Some confusion as this seemed allowed by
  http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-b
  See https://s.apache.org/lang-0.16.0-RC1-vote

     Comments:  Sent following email to dev list after reading this report: 
  It seems development on Tephra has slowed quite a bit lately, with only 7 
  JIRAs filed during the last 3 months.  I know Tephra is used in other 
  projects, like Apache Phoenix.  Is this slowdown temporary?  Is development 
  slowing because Tephra is mature and only maintenance is now required?  Is 
  it continuing to be picked up by new projects or only used in 1 or 2 
  places?  I ask because it feels like it is near time for Tephra to graduate 
  (it's been incubating for over 2 years now) and what needs to be done to 
  graduate is somewhat determined by the answers to these questions.

         Having made the (always difficult) first release, the project
         is in good shape. They are starting to generate some publicity
         by speaking at conferences. I am encouraging them to create a
         twitter account (so that they can interact with the wider
         community more frequently) and to start thinking of a second
         release (to ensure that the release process is reproducible).

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Dave Fisher: AFAICT the SGA has not been provided and a mentor has 
  advised that this can wait until graduation.
  I don't think that is correct and it is not the same as the guidance 
  given to other podlings like Heron.

--------------------
OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able 
to execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) 
from external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional 
logic (Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST 
API-based Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support 
packaging and catalog services.  Additionally, it now provides options to 
host the platform components as Docker containers on various Container 
Frameworks such as Mesos, Kubernetes, and Compose.

OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:    

  * Produce our first source code release under Incubator (automation work 
  is now complete here https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-release).  
  We believe that the process to release will be initiated in the next 2 
  weeks.
  * Increase contributions to ensure all project repos are maintained. and 
  address Issue / PR backlog.
  * Close legal transferred of Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and 
  logo to ASF

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?    

  * Issue backlog building on incubator-openwhisk is still a major issue 
  (partly due to #3 above). As of this report, the "open" issue backlog is 
  365 and open PR is 55. Need to prioritize and work to reduce while 
  advancing performance/security/deployment issues.

  * Trying to add more active Committers to augment those who have dropped 
  off in their activity; however, we have reached an impasse where potential 
  new Contributor pull requests are not getting timely reviews/merges to 
  provide a resume' for adding to the Committer roles.

  * It seems that Apache Infra. will not provide us servers to host a 
  staging 
  environment that would help us perform needed staging testing on Pull 
  Requests.  This means that independent testing needs to be done by members 
  (companies). We have explored a corporate donation as suggested (ala Spark 
  and SystemML), but this does not seem possible at this time.  

  * Formal hand-off of OpenWhisk trademark/logo from IBM needs to be 
  executed; need to identify process for this.
  Discussion started w/ Apache legal via "legal-discuss" mailing list with 
  subject "Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and logo".
  IBM intends to hand-off ownership of trademarks at time of graduation.

How has the community developed since the last report?    

  * "dev" mailing list activity has been down with the exception of work 
  around the new Go language runtime (mostly April).  It appears that 2Q 
  conferences may be partly to blame with corporate Committers being 
  preoccupied.

  * incubator-openwhisk Github stars: 3218 (+341 since last report)

  * incubator-openwhisk GitHub forks: 616 (+72 since last report)

  * Slack community We're ~800 members and it is really active, from both 
  end users or the project and contributors

  * The  bi-weekly Zoom "Technical Interchange" continues to be well 
  received and attended. Complete videos posted to OW YouTube channel and detailed 
  notes to our CWIKI. YouTube Channel: Apache Meetings Playlist 
  (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzgShnQk8F43NKsvEYA1SA)

Pulsar
Pulsar is a highly scalable, low latency messaging platform running on
commodity hardware. It provides simple pub-sub semantics over topics,
guaranteed at-least-once delivery of messages, automatic cursor management 
for
subscribers, and cross-datacenter replication.

Pulsar has been incubating since 2017-06-01.

Most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete the Podling name search tasks. The task is in progress right 
now.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community added 7 new contributors that submitted pull-requests which
  were merged into master.

  The number of users approaching the team on the Slack channel has kept
  steadily increasing since the last report. Many users have actively 
  deployed. Pulsar for evaluation and production use cases.

  Project members from several companies have organized or participated in
  several meetups, presenting Pulsar's introductions, deep-dives and hands-on
  tutorial, including recorded podcasts. We have several scheduled talks on
  Pulsar at various conferences, 2 at ApacheCon in September, one at OSCon 
  in July and 2 others at Strata New York in September. A Pulsar dedicated 
  meetup is being organized for next July.
 
  Since the last report the number of weekly-active-users on the Slack 
  channel has increased from 53 to 88.
 
  We have reached the 1 year mark since Pulsar entering the Apache 
  Incubator.
  Here is a summary of the community developments over the past year:
 
  1. Pulsar community has done 5 Apache releases since entering
     incubator. The release process is well documented and we have
     had 4 different release managers from 3 different companies.
   
  2. We have added 3 committers and PPMC members since incubation and
     there are also other candidates who have already made significant
     contributions to the project.
   
  3. Community of users and people interested in Pulsar has expanded
     considerably. Thanks to the months long work in improving ease of
     use, documentation and blogs, many people became aware of Pulsar
     and started playing with it, then evaluating it and finally
     putting it in production for critical use cases.
   
  4. We have tried to help users getting started through any
     communication channel. Even though we keep trying to encourage
     people to use the mailing list, most of the first interactions
     have been happening through the Slack channel. We also did make
     sure that:
  
     a) No decisions are taken in Slack channel
   
     b) Developers technical discussion happen mostly in Github
        issue/Pull-Request or in developers mailing list
   
     c) Conversations in Slack are sent to dev/user mailing list in a
        daily digest form for archival and to be searchable
 
     In any case Slack has been working fairly well in engaging with
     users, by providing a tool to have very quick informal
     question/answer interactions that were very appreciated by users.

   5. Overall, there were a lot of healthy discussions, with feedback
      and collaborations from people from different companies and
      different perspectives that resulted in much stronger design
      decisions and ultimately a better system.

   6. We have taken several steps to increase awareness, like blog
      posts, meetups (both dedicated to Pulsar or dedicated to similar
      topics) and presentations to conferences, like Strata or
      ApacheCon (where we have 2 talks scheduled for next September).

How has the project developed since the last report?

  23 authors have pushed 469 commits to master in the last 3 months.

  The project has made the its fifth release since joining the
  Apache Incubator (2.0.0-rc1-incubating on May 29th). This was a
  major release that culminated several months of works and lays the
  foundation for the next stage in Pulsar development. New major
  features include:
   * Pulsar Functions (Lightweight compute framework)
   * Schema registry
   * Topic compaction
  
  Community is actively working on next milestone, 2.1 release that
  will include several new features including:
   * Pulsar IO connector framework
   * Tiered storage
   * Go client library

  Since March, 3 new PIPs (Pulsar Improvement Proposals) for major
  feature/changes, have been submitted to the wiki and discussed in the
  mailing list.
 
  To recap the project developments since entering Apache Incubator:
 
  1. Moved to Apache BookKeeper 4.7. Before Pulsar 2.0, we were using
     a fork of BookKeeper from Yahoo, based on 4.3.1 with 245
     additional commits. Thanks to a a big effort in the BookKeeper
     community (which has a large overlap with Pulsar community), all
     these changed were merged back into mainstream BookKeeper branch
     and released in BookKeeper 4.7.0, making possible for Pulsar to
     switch over from the Yahoo fork.

  2. We have received a lot of feedback from people approaching Pulsar
     and learned a lot on how to simplify tools, documentation and
     concepts to make it easier for people to get started.
   
  3. Based on the same feedback and inputs, we have been adding new
     features or extended existing features to match a new variety of
     use case, some of them outside the scope the initial Pulsar
     codebase from Yahoo.

     To summarize the "major" features added in the last year:

      - Pulsar stateless proxy
      - Non-persistent topics
      - End-to-End message encryption
      - Effectively-once semantics
      - Type-safe APIs
      - Schema Registry
      - Pulsar Functions
      - Topic compaction
      - Python client library
    
    With more scheduled for next upcoming release 2.1:
  
      - Pulsar IO connector framework
      - Tiered storage
      - Go client library
    
  4. In addition to features, we have been trying to smooth the
     deployment of a production ready Pulsar cluster, by improving the
     documentation and providing templates for more common environments,
     such as Kubernetes, DCOS or just plain VMs with Ansible.

  5. Having exposure to many users testing and using the sytem outside
     the original Yahoo use cases has proven very effecting in helping
     identifying and resolving corner cases that were not being
     stressed before. This resulted in a much resilient system that
     can adapt better to a large array of different requirements and
     environments.

       The project seems to have slowed somewhat. Development activity
       is about the same, but there has not been a release for over a
       year, and I do not sense any real efforts at community building
       outside of the core group. I will be concerned if things don't

SkyWalking

Skywalking is an APM (application performance monitor), especially for
microservice, Cloud Native and container-based architecture systems. Also
known as a distributed tracing system. It provides an automatic way to
instrument applications: no need to change any of the source code of the
target application; and an collector with an very high efficiency streaming
module.

SkyWalking has been incubating since 2017-12-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. IP clearance.
  3. First ASF release. (SkyWalking 5.0)
  3. Further ASF culture and processes.
  4. 5.x releases are stable for product, and have an open end user case, 
  at least.
  5. Support multiple languages agents/SDKs
  6. Integration with other pupolar OSS systems.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Have two Apache releases already. 5.0.0-alpha, 5.0.0-beta

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. .NetCore agent has three releases based on SkyWalking's network 
  protocol and data format.
  2. Node.js server side agent has three releases based on SkyWalking's 
  network protocol and data format.
  3. 5.0.0-alpha/beta has been used in product env as their primary APM 
  system, by more than 5 companies.
  4. Proposal, voted and passed Haoyang Liu, the lead of the .NetCore agent 
  project, as the new Committer.
  5. There are 38 people to contribute codes to our main repo. 10 more than 
  last report.
  6. Work with the Zipkin tracing system group, try to accept Zipkin data 
  by SkyWalking collector.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code wise the project has good momentum.
  There has been ~200 pull requests opened and accepted, and 214 commits, 
  by 21 contributors in the last month.

Taverna

Taverna is a domain-independent suite of tools used to design and execute
data-driven workflows.

Taverna has been incubating since 2014-10-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Re-engage PPMC
  2. Release or Retire legacy git repositories
  3. Graduate!

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Uptake in activity with GSOC students, already multiple merged pull 
requests.

  Little engagement from the wider PMC.

  Email stats dev@taverna:
  2018-05: 62
  2018-04: 41
  2018-03: 102

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Moved to Java 9 (just in time for Java 10?).

  PPMC voted on Taverna Language release, but it failed IPMC vote
  due to CC-BY licensed schema files. Will refactor.
  Some confusion as this seemed allowed by
  http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-b
  See https://s.apache.org/lang-0.16.0-RC1-vote

     Comments:  Sent following email to dev list after reading this report: 
  It seems development on Tephra has slowed quite a bit lately, with only 7 
  JIRAs filed during the last 3 months.  I know Tephra is used in other 
  projects, like Apache Phoenix.  Is this slowdown temporary?  Is development 
  slowing because Tephra is mature and only maintenance is now required?  Is 
  it continuing to be picked up by new projects or only used in 1 or 2 
  places?  I ask because it feels like it is near time for Tephra to graduate 
  (it's been incubating for over 2 years now) and what needs to be done to 
  graduate is somewhat determined by the answers to these questions.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

Report from the Apache Jackrabbit committee [Michael Dürig]

## Description: 
 The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
 implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
 (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
 repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
 maintained. 
 Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
 hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
 Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
 foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding  
 content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
 implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
 is not a reference implementation. 

## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time   

## Activity: 
 Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
 maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are 
 continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

 Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
 the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
 driven by dependencies from Oak. 

 This quarter saw the first few unstable releases from the 1.9 branch,
 which will eventually be leading to the next major release. 
 There is currently an effort under way so simplify Oak deployments
 by supporting a broader range of Guava versions, which Oak depends on.
 Also modularisation is being further improved by refactoring and 
 decoupling individual components.
 On the other end of the spectrum there is ideas, prototyping and 
 evaluations being done regarding cloud friendly persistence back-ends. 
   
## Health report: 
 The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
 mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 
 There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the various Jira 
 issues.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description

Apache Labs exists to incubate small and emerging projects from ASF
committers.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Labs has at last become host to a new lab! "Turbulence" from
maintainer jpgilaberte.

    Turbulence is Chaos Engineering engine for testing
    distributed environments based on Apache Mesos.
    - Test high availability cases (HA).
    - Test fault tolerance cases (FT).
    - Error prediction cases in the underlying technologies.
    - HA benchmarks, FT capabilities regarding different
        distributed architectures.
    - Productive environment sizing.
    - Environment behaviour understanding.

This is the trigger for PMC to start some modernisation activity. I
Have reached out to users@infra.a.o for advice on github integration,
I intend to engage with the board vis a vis options to overcome
the "no release" strictures, and I intend to revisit the permalink
issue, I don't think that requires board attention.

I have also created a mailinglist "tech@labs.a.o" to attempt to do some
outreach into the commiters and members. It was sparked by a thread on
members@ round the AGM where a recent member bemoaned the lack of a
place where in depth discussions of tech without specific project goals
 was on topic.
 I have yet to launch it, need to figure out how to publicise it and
 get it to critical mass. Sally suggested inviting people to do
 "fast feather" posts that could spawn threads, and I thought maybe
 hosting AMAs with people might be interesting.


## Health report:

- Labs is quiet, still, but moving along a positive vector.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 10 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Simone Tripodi on Tue Jun 14 2011

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 31 committers.
 - Juan P. Gilaberte was added as a committer on Wed May 30 2018

## Releases:

 - In accordance with our charter, Labs makes no releases

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Adrien Grand]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
- There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
The upcoming Lucene 7.4 will include:
 - support for soft deletes[1], which allows to keep deleted documents around
   for an arbitrarily long time.
 - a new FeatureField[2] which makes it easy and efficient to incorporate
   static relevance signals into the score (think pagerank for instance).
   There are ongoing discussions to support dynamic signals[3] as well such as
   recency or geo distance.
 - a new ConditionalTokenFilter[4] which allows to put conditions in analysis
   chains.
 - a Korean analyzer[5] which performs much better than other alternatives
   that we are aware of.

 The upcoming Solr 7.4 will include:
 - more stream evaluators, in particular one for Fourier transform[6] and
   another one to compute geo distances.
 - support for child roll-ups[8].
 - an upgrade to log4j 2[9], log4j 1 being end-of-life.

 - We implemented a new process to bad-apple tests that fail too regularly in
   order to get builds back to green so that the volume of failures is easier
   to process by humans. At the same time, we added reporting of disabled
   tests to make sure they do not get forgotten.
 - Both user and dev mailing-lists are very active.
 - Discussions are generally flowing in a good shape.
 - We produced 3 releases since the last report.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    In this period of reporting, A new major feature has been added to 
    Mnemonic codebase that this new feature fill in the missing building
    block of handling large amount linked objects that can not be fully
    loaded to system memory or the memory footprint may cause system 
    performance downgrading. our solution offers Mnemonic users a way
    to offload part of cool linked objects from heap in durable object level
    without destroying them from durable memory space. this approach allows
    user to keep the reference to this durable object while free up the
    memory resources that occupied by its object graphs referred by the
    durable object.
    With the support of our community contributors, the Apache Mnemonic has 
    been presented in OSTS2018 and posted in AIDev conference
    The Mnemonic code has become stable again and is ready for next release,
    so the v0.12 might be released before next report.
    
Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - 1 new PMC member added in the last 1 months.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 13 committers.
 - No new committer added since the last reporting.

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.11.0 on Apr.02 2018
 - Still active development on next major version (0.12.0)


JIRA Activity:
 - 17 JIRA tickets created since the last report (Mar. 2018)
 - Also 15 JIRA tickets closed/resolved this period

Sincerely,
Gang(Gary) Wang on behalf of the Apache Mnemonic PMC

  anything new on this
- Various bug fixes and enhancements have been contributed and committed to
  the trunk
- As usual, more details about the community activities are published in the
  official blog [1], on Twitter [2] and other social media [3]; our public
  HipChat room [4] has seen low activity as in the previous quarter

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description:
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open Data
Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of OData. It
currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is the OASIS version of
the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.

## Olingo Status
Olingo has no issues that would require board attention.

There are no new releases as the OData V4.01 specification is still not final.
As we saw no community requests for patch releases we did not create any.

The discussions and questions on the users list are declining and revolve
mostly about small issues with the library or questions about entirely new
extensions like a JPA extension for the V4 library. JIRA issues are still
created on a low basis and contain mostly bug reports.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Imesha Sudasingha]

## Description:

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Last release was 1.2.2 on March 5th 2018
- A new PMC chair (Imesha Sudasingha) was elected in April, 2018. (Previous
  chair - Tom Barber)

Improved activity compared to last reporting periods with improvements being
made on stabilizing Avro RPC implementations of OODT components and improving
logging support for OODT. Furthermore, Apache DRAT GSoC student is making
improvements to OODT APIs in order to use OODT functionalities though REST
APIs.

All these new additions will affect towards OODT being an easy to use platform
for scientific data systems in near future.

## Health report:

We are currently working on 1.9 release which will be the last in line before
completely removing XML RPC code from the project. As per now, once the above
mentioned logging improvements are done and workflow manager and resource
manager are stabilized, we are ready to release 1.9. Hopefully within the next
reporting period.

So, project activity is below average with few contributors making constant
contributions throughout the period.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Harbs]

## DESCRIPTION
Apache Royale is a new implementation of the principles of Apache Flex but
designed for JavaScript runtimes instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes.  Apache
Royale is designed to improve developer productivity in creating applications
for wherever Javascript runs, including browsers as well as Apache Cordova
applications, Node, etc.

## ISSUES
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## RELEASES
- Apache Royale 0.9.2 was released on March 16 2018.
- Apache Royale 0.9.3 in progress.

## ACTIVITY
- No releases this quarter although 0.9.2 was released between the report and
  the board meeting.  Releases have been stalled by a combination of factors.
  One is that someone volunteered to be the RM and had not released Royale
  before and ran into configuration issues. Another is that so many new files
  were added that the Maven SCM plugin would not work correctly. Another is
  that there is a disagreement about the organization of files in the release.
  There has been a lot of work done to reslove this disagreement and it looks
  like we are close to resolving it. It looks like the Maven plugin has been
  fixed so hopefully we will release soon.
- Lots of progress on a new default look (component set) for Royale apps.
- Lots of progress on migrating a large Flex app to Royale. A new "Flex
  Emulation" component set is being worked on to ease migrations.
- New names are showing up on the mailing list asking about Royale.
- The owner of an ActionScript code base that doesn't use Flex is attempting
  to use the Royale Compiler to cross compile his code to JavaScript.

## COMMUNITY
- Alina Kazi was added as committer on April 26 2018.
- No new PMC Members yet
- Two new contributors being watched to be committers.

## Mailing list activity:
 Both user and dev lists have seen healthy growth:

- users@royale.apache.org:
    - 58 subscribers (up 11 in the last 3 months):
    - 657 emails sent to list (475 in previous quarter)

 - dev@royale.apache.org:
    - 75 subscribers (up 7 in the last 3 months):
    - 1768 emails sent to list (1952 in previous quarter)

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Sentry Project  [Alex Kolbasov]

## Description:

Apache Sentry is a highly modular system for providing fine grained role based
authorization to both data and metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop Cluster.

## Issues:

There was a question asked by ASF board earlier about handling of licenses.
Here is a clarification of the issue.

Apache Sentry now uses an automated license generation process in place which
creates a license file adding pointers to the dependency's license within the
distribution. When sentry is build, license-maven-plugin which kicks in
package stage of mvn and gathers the license information of all the jars that
re ditributed. Here is the license information that Apache Sentry currently
uses/ License file is generated in sentry-dist which will have the license
information from top level LICENSE.txt and license details of all the third
party jars distributed and the path to their license files. Currently sentry
is distributing jars with licenses listed below
   1. BSD License
   2. 2-Clause BSD License
   3. 3-Clause BSD License
   4. CDDL 1.0
   5. CDDL 1.1
   6. Eclipse Public License
   7. MIT License
   8. Mozilla Public License

license-maven-plugin that is used does not provide all the information that
isneeded as the license information for a bunch of dependencies was not found.
Apache Sentry team have gone through an exercise of finding the license
information for such dependencies manually and used them as an overrides.

These steps has to be done before ever new release to make sure that license
information for the dependencies that changes are updated properly.

There are no other issues requiring board attention at this time

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- Last release was 1.4.0 on 05-May-2017

Community & Project:

- Mailing list traffic has dipped slightly in the last quarter

- There is more interesting in translating shiro.apache.org to
Chinese, but nothing concrete yet.

- Feature development is planned to continue against master.

- OSGI support is a popular feature, we get an occasional one-liner
patch. However, we do NOT have a committer with sufficient experience,
which makes supporting it difficult.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for June 2018

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

The project activities are continuing smoothly with nothing that is both new
and notable to report.

We had one project proposal for GSoc 2018 accepted and started, but it failed
when no code was submitted to a repository in time for a hard deadline imposed
by the GSoc rules. The mentor and student intend to continue work on the
project outside of GSoc 2018.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.1 on 30 April 2015.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

A release candidate for version 3.4.2 is imminent. At the time of writing of
this report, the rc is scheduled for release before the meeting of the Board.

We have previously said that this should be the last release of the 3.4 branch
before moving on with work towards 4.0, but a future 3.4.3 release is now
looking more likely in the balance of priorities to get 3.4.2 released.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description:
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.

## Issues:


## Activity:
- The community released versions 1.2.2 and 1.1.3 this month.

- The community has discussed and plans to move forward with 
  releasing some components (e.g. Apache Kafka integration, etc.)
  separately to speed up the release cycle and encourage more
  contributors to get involved in the release process.
- The community continues to make progress toward a 2.0 release.

## Health report:
- Project activity continues to be fairly consistent, with periodic lulls and
  bursts in activity.
- New contributors continue to engage and that engagement tends to keep up
  activity levels, even as some contributors move on. We continue to expand
  the PMC by regularly inviting new members.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Isuru Udana]

## Description:
Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight Enterprise Service
Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

## Issues:
 None identified.

## Activity:

We couldn’t get the release work going as expected in this quarter due to lack
of activity/cycles of the contributors.

However we expect to boost the activity of the project as WSO2 (the major
consumer of Apache Synapse) is willing to contribute again by providing bug
fixes and features they have done for their forked repository of Apache
Synapse. To encourage and make things much easier for the external
contributors, we are discussing to move our source repository to github.

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project.

The libraries need some work to make sure the code base is operational
in the newer software development studios and platforms.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Most activity has been through JIRA issue tracking. The email lists
have seen little activity.

Contributors have recently increased their activity in both the Xalan-C and 
Xalan-J projects.

There are two contributors to Xerces that have expressed an interest in
contributing to the Xalan projects.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

There are two contributors that we are hoping to become active members of
the Xalan project.  They currently support the Xerces project upon which
the Xalan project is based.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

The libraries need some work to make sure the code base is operational
in the newer software development suites. We need to ensure that the
Xalan libraries are compatible with the Xerces projects.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.
