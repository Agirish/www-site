 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we welcome Roman Shaposhnik and Isabel Drost-Fromm as new
       board members (though Isabel has served in the past) and we, once
       again, thank departing members, Jim Jagielski and Chris Mattmann for
       their service.  We had a brief meeting of the new board on April 11,
       where we agreed on officer appointments and had an informal discussion
       of what each of us thought were important topics for the board in the
       coming year. Each board member provided one or more items for
       consideration. We did not make any decisions or discuss any of these
       items in detail. We agreed that substantive discussion and
       decision-making should happen on ASF lists and/or regularly scheduled
       ASF Board meetings.  The full list of items is in the minutes, linked
       in this month's agenda.

       We agreed to ask all current officers to continue in their roles and I
       am happy to report that all have agreed.  To fill the Vice Chair
       vacancy created by Jim's departure, we appointed Shane Curcuru as Vice
       Chair. Thank you, Shane, for agreeing to take on this role.

       This month's reports included some very good ones: Fineract, Hbase and
       Nifi among them.  Each of these provided thoughtful insight into
       project state, problems and plans. Comments on individual reports
       continued to hit the following common themes:

       * Responding to the "long tail" contribution / committer bottleneck by
         making it faster / easier to earn commit
       * Same as above regarding PMC membership
       * Request to provide a more thoughtful project health summary
       * Reminder to follow IP clearance process for substantial
         contributions not developed inside the project
       * Reminder to be careful with synchronous meetings, always summarizing
         on list, etc.
       * Reminder to include date last committer and PMC member were added to
         the project

    B. President [Sam]

       Items requiring Board attention:

       Two resolutions: budget, and sponsor relations.

       - - -

       Overall, we continue to be in a good position financially, running a
       surplus where we had budgeted for a deficit.

       The FY19 budget discussions appear to all have run their course, and
       it is time for a decision and to move on.  Should the budget be
       approved as is, I will request the Fundraising team to develop and
       post a full review by the September board meeting so that the board
       can decide whether to terminate or proceed the SOW at the six month
       mark (which would be the October meeting).

       Also, if the budget is approved, I will be naming Daniel Ruggeri as
       (a?) VP, Fundraising.  As a part of that discussion, we can decide
       what title, if any, Kevin will be retaining/assuming.

       The proposal is to develop a team of individuals doing fundraising,
       and to have each member of that team empowered to "close the deal"
       with sponsors.

       Our project websites are a underutilized resource for bringing
       awareness to visitors of matters such as upcoming ApacheCons, and we
       continue to look to ways to reduce the effort required to add images
       and links across our site.  This hasn't been discussed recently, and
       merits revisiting.  See discussion item 8B.

       Brand Management is operating smoothly.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first eleven
       months of FY18.

       Operating Cash on Mar 31st, 2018 was $1,955K, which is up $150.4K from
       last month’s ending balance (Feb 18) of $1,804.6K.    Total Cash as of
       Mar 31st, 2018 is $2,847.9K. The Mar 2018 ending Operating cash
       balance of $1,955K represents an Operating cash reserve of 17.7 months
       based on the FY18 conservative Cash forecast average monthly spending
       of $110.3K/month. The ASF reserve continues to be very healthy for an
       organization of ASF’ s size, with a conservative FY18 YE estimate of
       17.5 months of Operating cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong and
       favorable showing against our FY18 budget through eleven months of
       FY18, however as I will continue to mention, because we are on a cash
       basis, the timing of Sponsor payments received (including multi-year
       sponsors) and Payables released plays a big part in how well we
       perform financially month to month and year over year.  This month we
       were under the FY 18 budget for Revenue (Timing of estimated sponsor
       payments were over but offset by a large donation that was budgeted to
       be received in Mar 2018 but was received in Feb 18).  The Foundation
       was also over the FY18 budget in Expenses as well for Mar 18 (Infra
       was over in staff and Spare parts as well as timing of paying two
       months of Lease web.  Sponsorship was also budget due to the timing of
       travel vs the budget. YTD all deps are under budget except Infra).  
       The Fundraising team continues to do an excellent job in both areas,
       servicing both new and existing Sponsors.  With total actual Revenue,
       as of Mar 31st, 2018, of $1,574.1K (up $265.5K from the Feb 18 and up
       $560.2K from Mar 2017), we are 154.6% of the way to our Total Revenue
       budget of $1,226.5K for FY18, with a month of FY18 remaining. 
       Regarding Sponsor revenue, we have received in the first 11 months of
       FY18, $1574.1K, (up $263,3K from Feb 18 and up $599.3 from Mar 17)
       which has us at 157.3% for YTD and exceeding the budgeted Sponsor
       revenue goal of $1,084K for FY18.  This is a great accomplishment as
       we still have a month left of FY 18 and we have exceeded our
       Sponsorship goal by $263.3K (and we are estimating another $161K to
       arrive in Apr 18).  As for the remaining revenue categories, we have
       received $167.3K against a total budget of $139.3K or 1.20% of our FY
       18 budget with a month of FY18 left.  I would also like to point out
       that in FY17 to this point we had $135.9K vs the $167.3K we have as of
       Mar 31st which is an increase of $31.4K or basically what we have
       received via the Hopsie platform, which again is fantastic as it is no
       real cost to the foundation but another option for Fundraising.

       YTD expenses, through Mar31st, 2018 are under budget by $103.1K, with
       Infra as the only dept over budget. We will continue to monitor the
       actual vs budget as we move through the remaining month of FY18.  As
       we finish up Apr 2018, I will be in contact with the dept. heads, to
       make sure, as we are on a cash basis, that any FY18 expenses are
       accounted for in FY18 and do not carry over to FY19.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $450.1K NI vs a budgeted negative <$193.6K> NI or $643.7K
       ahead of the FY 18 Budget for Net Income eleven months into the FY,
       which is also 233% ahead of the FY18 budget.  With the current
       conservative forecasted revenue, and expenses for the remainder of FY
       18, we are now estimating, at the Fiscal year end, a positive $413.7K
       NI vs a budgeted NI loss of -$167.8K or about a $581.6K better NI than
       the FY18 budget.  This is attributable to a combination of additional
       revenue and lower than budgeted expenses for FY18 ($511.4K more in
       revenue and $70.4K in lower expenses based on our conservative
       forecast).  I would also like to point out that YTD 18 NI vs YTD 17 NI
       we are $560.2K ahead in Revenue while Expenses were $7.3K higher year
       over year, for a $552.9K increase in NI year over year ($450.1K
       positive NI in FY18 vs <-$102.8K> NI in FY 17, as of Mar 31st, 2018). 
       Again, I want to congratulate the entire Foundation on these very
       positive Operating results now that FY 18 is ending.  It does truly
       take a team effort to achieve these types of results.  Now that we see
       what can be achieved by our efforts, we do need to continue to keep
       these efforts up as we move through the remainder of FY 18, and into
       FY19.  We need to continue to provide Fundraising all the support and
       resources to continue with the traction that has been created with in
       the last year, while keeping an eye on our expenses at the same time. 
       We should also recognize that the Foundation as compared to not only
       its FY18 budget but also to FY 17 actuals, is in “an extremely good
       place” by all measures and we should all be very proud of that fact,
       as we finish out FY 18 and enter FY19.

       Special Order 7A, Approve the 2019 FY ASF Budget, was approved
       by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

       foundation; and

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the number of Vice President,
       Sponsor Relations and their responsibilities shall be initially
       defined and subsequently amended at the direction of the Vice
       President, Fundraising; and

       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that appointments to the office of Vice
       President, Sponsor Relations, shall be at the discretion of the Vice
       President of Fundraising, to serve in accordance with and subject to
       the direction of the Vice President of Fundraising, the ASF President,
       and the ASF Board of Directors and the Bylaws of the Foundation until
       death, resignation, retirement, removal or disqualification, or until
       a successor is appointed.

       Special Order 7B, Establish Position of VP, Sponsor Relations,

       Special Order 7C, Change the Apache OODT Project Chair, was
       approved by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Publicize board-sanctioned list of services available to projects

       PMCs are sometimes unaware of the various services the ASF provides.  We
       should better publicize this concise and comprehensive list of pointers
       to all the organizational services the ASF has:

       https://www.apache.org/board/services

       @Shane: send note publicizing the list of services to the PMCs;
       precise url TBD

    B. Adopting a well-known COI policy

       As the ASF grows in number of paid positions and is working to
       secure more sponsors, we should adopt a well-known financial
       conflict of interest policy.  This is important to ensure that
       we have clear and consistent disclosures internally of
       financial interests in officer/director roles, as well as to
       show potential donors that we're following best practices for
       fiscal responsibility.

       I suggest the IRS example policy, which many non-profits use:
       https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1023#en_US_2018_publink100061018
       https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-1023-purpose-of-conflict-of-interest-policy

       This also includes an annual review statement, which should be simple to
       automate and is also reported in filing our 990s.

       There are concerns about the necessity for and the overhead involved
       in establishing and reporting on COI policy.

       @Shane: continue to discuss establishing a COI policy on board@

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Mark Thomas]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.

* OPERATIONS

The last month saw the first set of paperwork requiring the use of a
Notary Public. I now have a much better handle on the costs, which are
less than $200. Given such paperwork is only expected a few times a
year, I don't plan to put in place any process to enable it to be signed
by someone in the US.

Approval was granted for using Apache owned marks in event names for
KAFKA, NETBEANS, SPARK, HBASE and SERVICECOMB.

Approval was granted for merchandise using various Apache owned marks
including ACCUMULO.

Community members reported problems creating content on Wikipedia for
our projects due to misplaced concerns from some editors regarding
copyright infringement. I reached out to clarify that our license
permits the uses in question.

Confirmed that project documentation (including images) is provided
under the ALv2 unless otherwise stated. (I'm not aware of any exceptions
- just being cautious).

Discussion has started around re-wording the current policy for required
links to be more flexible w.r.t. http vs. https. Currently, a strict
reading of the policy is that all links should be http.

* REGISTRATIONS

We have received a demand for costs amounting to €650 from the existing
owner of a BROOKLYN trademark in the EU relating to their opposition
to our attempt to register BROOKLYN in the EU. I approved this for payment.

More generally, I have noticed a tendency for donated projects to have a
wider range of registrations than the ASF would typically apply for.


* INFRINGEMENTS

There are currently 10 PMCs working on resolving infringements by
external parties. Brand Management is providing support as required.

I have sent a C&D letter on behalf of one of our projects.

Various mailing lists were hit with spam from "Maven - The World's
Largest Micro-Consulting Platform". Concerns regarding the use of Maven
were raised with the Maven PMC who assessed that no action is required
at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Fundraising continues to go well.

In the first 11 months of FY18, *excluding the ~$900K net from the Pineapple
donation*, we have received $1574.1K, (up $263,3K from Feb 18 and up $599.3
from Mar 17) which has the ASF at 157.3% for YTD.  The budgeted Sponsor
revenue goal was $1,084K for FY18.  As such, concerns that we would be
fiscally insolvent in 5 years should be largely put to rest.

BOARD ITEM: I'd like the board to bless "1 - to set aside space on their
website for an automatically embedded and centrally maintained ASF space." as
a requirement for each project by approving adding it to the branding policy
that exists today at https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs

Committee meetings continue monthly.

Work on Fundraising for our 2018 events continues well.

On behalf of ASF, I gave an Open Source Governance speech at GMU on 4/11.
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xycSoPFDGlRui_cM-Ji-nS4yoaFc487axStVwmpzdTc/edit?usp=sharing

Attended the CIT/Mach37 United Women in Cyber event on the 29th on behalf of
the ASF as well as the WIT job fair where I met with a number of potential
sponsors.

Paper selected for FOSS Backstage.  Planning to attend BBW & FOSS Backstage
for ASF to speak on How to be an Effective Board Member:
https://foss-backstage.de/session/how-be-effective-board-member

Alexa Donations with Amazon Pay is now live.

If accepted, as of May 1, 2018 PCCC has placed a proposal for a paid role of
VP Fundraising.  Daniel Ruggeri has volunteered to also serve as volunteer VP
Fundraising where I will report to him and he will report to the President.

Work continues on improving our procedures and our playbook website.

Welcome to Ted Liu & Daniel Ruggeri to our Committee

Work continues on our three 2018 Apache events including sponsor agreements
and pitches

A Hopsie security issue was ethically disclosed and resolved.

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - April 2018

I. Budget: we are awaiting approval of our budget submission for the upcoming
fiscal year. We anticipate remaining on budget and on schedule through the
final weeks of the fiscal year.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: We published a press release in celebration of
the ASF’s 19th Anniversary https://s.apache.org/gK4Q and produced a
promotional video to accompany it https://youtu.be/Fqk_rlKiVIs . The quarterly
report for Q3 FY2018 was published slightly later than anticipated
https://s.apache.org/UtBD ; work is underway on the ASF Annual Report. We
published the latest "Success at Apache" post: "Am I there yet? A n00b's
perspective" https://s.apache.org/QyEK . Sally Khudairi continues day-to-day
Sponsor ambassadorial outreach with Fundraising, and is working with
Conferences on promoting ApacheCon and two Apache Roadshow events. She
continues to counsel a Big Data vendor on correcting their promotional
practices to align with established ASF publicity, outreach, and branding
guidelines.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

  - 26 March 2018 - The Apache® Software Foundation Celebrates 19 Years of
    Open Source Leadership "The Apache Way"

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 195 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 39 items, and have 47.3K followers on
Twitter. We posted 9 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 82.6K organic
impressions.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to
announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are
requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice
for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 7 media queries. The ASF 2,918 received
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 3,200. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 6,293 press hits vs. last month's 7,185. ApacheCon received
86 press hits.

GlobeNewswire through 2018.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
No issues to raise to the President or the Board at this time.

Finances
========
Based on "actuals" through March, Infrastructure is slightly over
budget (about 0.5%). These actuals have been used to prepare the FY19
proposed Infra budget attached to the Board's April agenda.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- One of our third party services provides us with service monitoring
  and reporting. It will be shutting down in a few months, so we have
  begun to look for replacement service(s).
- We are looking standing up a new Jenkins "master" node which should
  improve the responsiveness/throughput of our Jenkins CI cluster.

General Activity
================
It has been a relatively quiet month, though we dealt with a seemingly
email-based DoS, a two hour datacenter downtime, and a couple disk
failures on our remaining hardware (which demonstrates our desire to
continue migrating to cloud-hosted providers).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

# Events/Conferences

This has been a very busy month in the Events/Conferences world. We have
three events currently in flight, and several more that we're talking
about.

If you wish to be part of this conversation, you need to join the
planners list - planners@apachecon.com.

## Apache RoadShow Europe - Berlin, June 11-14 2018

The schedule has been posted -
http://apachecon.com/euroadshow18/schedule.html

## ApacheCon North America

The CFP has closed, and we are in review mode. We had 249 sessions
submitted. We plan to have a schedule ready by the end of the month.

We have added space for the Cloudstack Collaboration Conference, which
will run in parallel to ApacheCon, and the community is seeking
sponsorship for this additional space.

The GeoSpatial community has put together a one-day track.

A reminder: There is a committer discount. This information was sent to
the committers@apache.org mailing list. If you want your communities to
turn up in force, it's time to make them all committers.

Volunteers are needed for many parts of the show. Please see
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VWJsUp0HSa2oH6yCbOJJqw5pgdxKt_m0R8yXUcQUA8A/edit#gid=0
if you want to help.

## Apache DC RoadShow.

Kevin is putting together an event in DC in October. We have a date and
a venue, and will be promoting additional information as soon as we have
a website up.

## 2019

A venue search has begun for ApacheCon North America 2019. We are
focusing on the San Franciso Bay area, for the 20th anniversary. Once
again, please join planners@apachecon.com to participate in planning
this event.

The goal is to announce ACNA19 at ACNA18. A stretch goal is to also
announce ACEU19 at ACNA18, but nothing has been done towards that end,
yet.

We are also considering several smaller events. These might include
any of the following:

    * ApacheCon Africa
    * ApacheCruise
    * Apache RoadShow North America
    * Apache RoadShow Asia

Any of these events may or may not happen depending on interest,
project involvement, and sponsorship. We are beginning to pitch
entire-year sponsorship packages, rather than per-event sponsorship, as
this tends to be easier for corporate budgets, and ends up being a
better deal for everyone.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

TAC is rolling along  quiet but active in the background. Judges are scoring
applications as they come in. We have 13 applications currently, we expect
many more to come in over the final 2 weeks with applications being closed on
1st May.

No other activity currently. A discussion regarding directed sponsorship to
TAC has stalled and needs reviving.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

A question arose about the redistribution of OpenJDK in Apache projects. 
Legal committee members and others on the mailing list provided advice
advising that doing so violates Apache legal policy regarding Category-X
dependencies. The project was informed and moved forward and will not be
redistributing OpenJDK.

A handful of questions about the EU’s GDPR initiative arose including one from
our VP, Infra. After discussions, VP Legal and VP Infra agreed that VP, Infra
will draft a short policy document, and then review with VP, Legal and
eventually post that policy on a public Apache web page. Likely we will employ
a similar tactic as we do with DCMA policy by having a “registered agent”
concept.

A discussion surrounding whether a modified version of the Apache license is
still “the Apache license” arose, and guidance was provided that modifications
to the license, along with naming rights for the license, necessitate changing
the license name if modifying it.

Questions surrounding Software Grants and associated materials provided with
them continue to be ongoing with ASF Secretary and ASF projects. VP, Legal has
Referred the matter to the ASF Secretary for resolution.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It
specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format for flat
and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern
hardware. It also provides computational libraries and zero-copy streaming
messaging and interprocess communication. Languages currently supported include
C, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Rust.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - We received a donation of a Go implementation since the last report
 - New contributors have started developing native Rust bindings. Given its 
   early development, community will likely start by doing regular Rust-only 
   releases at a higher velocity than primary releases (similar to JS)
 - Given the number of different artifacts developed, the build and release 
   complexity has gotten too difficult (too many manual steps). The 
   community is discussing ways to improve the process to simplify development.

Project is very healthy with a growing developer and user community.
Overall development activity has increased since the prior quarter
with the addition of two new programming languages (Go, Rust) to the
project.

### Tickets and pull requests:
   * 48 JIRA tickets opened by 37 developers
   * 18 JIRA tickets resolved
   * 30 Pull requests opened in Github by 19 contributors
   * 8 Pull requests merged
   * The main focus of the work are mostly bug fixes and a very few
     feature enhancements. No major extension/enhancement is in the works.

      * 397 messages (previous quarter: 408)
   * user@avro.apache.org
      * 40 messages (previous quarter: 44)

As can be seen from the numbers resolution rate is a small fraction of issue
creation rate. Will nudge the committers to resolve the tickets one way or the
other.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Michael Mior]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and its
Avatica sub-project.

Avatica 1.11.0 was released early March, quickly followed by Calcite 1.16.0.
Both of these releases dropped support for JDK 7 and Avatica added support for
JDK 10. Calcite depends on this newest release of Avatica and also adds an
adapter to support Apache Geode along with improvements to the Druid and JDBC
adapters.

A paper, "Apache Calcite: A Foundational Framework for Optimized Query
Processing Over Heterogeneous Data Sources" has been accepted for publication
in SIGMOD 2018. This paper is a result of collaboration between several PMC
members and academic researchers.

We have continued to have a steady string of new committers with solid
contributions.

  list group discussion, we observed that most of them focused on using these
  features: spark 2.2.1 integration , pre-aggregation, partition optimization,
  streaming ingestion.
- We are doing for version 1.4.0 : firstly we are continuing to improve the
  above mentioned features, such as : support partition with pre-aggregation,
  support streaming with pre-aggregation. secondly we are doing CarbonData
  support cloud storage, like AWS S3 or other cloud object storage.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description: 
 - Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
 and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop. 
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
 - This quarter was relatively quiet and was primarily focused on fixing
 small bugs in the HBase, Kafka, and Hive integrations that Crunch provides.
 A number of these fixes came from Clement Mathieu, who looks like a good
 candidate to be a new committer on the project along with Stephen Durfey,
 who became a committer in February.
  
## Health report: 
 - Crunch continues to move at a steady pace of commits and bug fixes,
 but there has not been a major push from the community to add or update
 the existing functionality beyond the set of things that Crunch does well
 already. The biggest obvious improvement to the project is an upgrade of
 the APIs for the HBase dependency, but that isn't necessarily the
 kind of work that a developer would be interested in doing for fun (as
 opposed to as a result of a specific need for their work and a desire to
 contribute that work back to the community.)

Attachment S: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description: Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: Activity this quarter centered around a few efforts:
This was a busy quarter, but not really for positive reasons.  Java8 update 161
contained a behavioral change in the included JAXB implementation that broke
some CXF tests and use cases.   We scrambled to get a fix out (in 3.2.2), but
subsequent user testing identified additional cases that were not fixed as
well as cases that then broke with the new fix.  We needed to follow
up with additional releases fairly quickly to address those issues.

One note: April 16th will mark 10 years since CXF graduated from the incubator

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Stefan Seelmann]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
 - ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
             written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
             compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
             Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
 - LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
             replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
             and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
             with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
             servers.
 - Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
             used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
             designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
             application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
 - Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
             role-based access control, delegated administration and
             password policy services with an LDAP backend.
 - Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
             various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
             and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
             interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
             facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
             as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
             and mobile.
 - Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
             (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Myrle Krantz]

## Description

Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues

## Activity

We've added committers.

We've started adapting Fineract CN (formerly mifos i/o) to its new home at
Apache. There is still a lot of work to do, and it isn't all captured in
tickets yet.  In particular, Fineract CN is not yet through IP clearance with
the incubator.  Those committers interested in Fineract CN are having trouble
keeping up with the significant interest from contributors.

We've almost released 1.1 containing the following major improvements:

-- Integration of data import tool and enhancements for usability and better
   performance

-- Integration of staff notifications framework including the introduction of
   a topic-subscriber model architecture

-- Support for two-factor authentication with OTP delivery via SMS or email
   and the configuration of remember-me tokens

-- Create and schedule ad-hoc queries to run and generate reports.

-- Support for equal installments with equal amortization of principal and
   interest.

## Health report

We are struggling again with unmerged pull requests. Currently, the oldest
open pull request is from May 2016.The number of open pull requests has
increased from from 16 to 23. Of these, only 9 have received no comment.  The
oldest of those 9 is from November 2017. However it is not that these are
lacking attention as we've tagged several of these pull requests for the next
release, Fineract 1.2, but are still awaiting review of these from committers
who have little time to do so yet.

In an effort to move towards more regular time-driven releases (monthly), we
successfully transferred knowledge about the release process to several
additional committers but have still become bottlenecked in release management
with committers not having time to review the tagged pull requests.

Efforts are also under way to utilize Apache virtual machine infrastructure to
set up a publicly accessible demonstration instance for Fineract CN. Progress
is stalled though as the committers who have volunteered for the effort don't
have the requisite knowledge to complete the task and the volunteers willing
and able to do the work need to be added as committers.

Discussion led by Yannick Awasum has begun around addressing the hibernate
dependency in Fineract CN which needs to be addressed prior to any release;
unfortunately there has been little to no participation from other community
members in this regard.

Functional discussion around features for the Fineract CN roadmap have begun
but are also proceeding more slowly than desired. Discussion related to key
components for migration of users of Fineract 1.x to Fineract CN (i.e. group
lending support, data migration tools, etc.) has been lacking and once again
it relates to low input from our PMC and older committers.

Discussion led by individual product management volunteers around domain areas
such as machine learning and credit analysis, reporting, regulatory
compliance, etc. is ongoing but slow as well.

Documentation for Fineract CN is growing and Isaac Kamga has led a webinar on
customizing a microservice. He is also leading work on live documentation of
APIs via Spring REST Docs which will be made available in the upcoming
quarter. Nonetheless, more documentation is needed and we continue to recruit
volunteers to take on these tasks.

Evaluation of students for Google Summer of Code is taking place with an
emphasis on projects related to Fineract CN including a data import tool,
additional microservices, containerization, enhancements to Fineract CN
mobile, and support for group-based lending operations.

We continue to add committers at a steady clip.  We haven't had any new PMC
members in a while however.

The addition of new committers and ideally the addition of new PMC members is
essential right now as a good proportion of the current base of our PMC
(primarily the original set of PMC members adding during incubation) have been
idle and providing little active contribution. New committers and PMC members
have been taking up additional work loads but are being overwhelmed with
requests to assist.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Fluo Project  [Keith Turner]

## Description:
 - Apache Fluo is a distributed processing system built on Apache Accumulo.
   Fluo users can easily setup workflows that execute cross node transactions
   when data changes.  These workflows enable users to continuously join new
   data into large existing data sets with low latency while avoiding
   reprocessing all data.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Voted to merge committers and PMC
 - Made Fluo available at hub.docker.com/r/apache/fluo/
 - Discussed accepting some external Fluo test and example projects
 - Documented how to test/verify a release

## Health report:
 - 60 GitHub PRs opened and 58 closed [1/10-4/11]
 - 15 issues opened and 4 closed [1/10-4/11]
 - 70 commits from 5 committers and 4 contributors [1/10-4/11]

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache FreeMarker Project  [Dániel Dékány]

## Description:

Apache FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text
output based on templates. Apache FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class
library for programmers.

FreeMarker 2 (the current stable line) produces releases since 2002. The
FreeMarker project has joined the ASF in 2015, and graduated from the
Incubator in early 2018.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We have graduated from the Incubator on 2018-03-21, and have transferred the
resources out of the Incubator.

We have released FreeMarker 2.3.28 on 2018-04-04, which is our first
non-incubating release from Apache.

There was some activity around Eclipse plugin development, as JBoss has
officially stopped maintaining the current plugin (after 12 years). Thus, we
have considered bringing that over to Apache (under the FreeMarker project),
which looks somewhat complicated legally. But as one of our users has started
another plugin, now we are waiting to see if that will reach a state where we
should adopt that instead.

## Health report:

Activity is relatively low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User
questions and new Jira issues are being answered promptly.

The long term goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0 branch, so
that the project can innovate and the code base can become much cleaner (and
more attractive for new committers), instead of being blocked by 15 years of
historical baggage. (Meanwhile, the backward compatible 2.x branch must be
maintained, and produce releases.)

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 7 committers.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Mailing list activity:

 - dev@freemarker.apache.org:
    - 62 subscribers (up 3 in the last 3 months):
    - 241 emails sent to list (188 in previous quarter)
    - This list is used both by developers and users; note that support is
      mostly provided on StackOverflow, not on the mailing list.

 - notifications@freemarker.apache.org:
    - 15 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Romain Manni-Bucau]

## Description:
 - Apache Geronimo project is stilll moving from a full EE server activity to
   a JavaEE/EE4J/Microprofile umbrella project and hosts EE utilities as well
   as specification API and implementations.

## Issues:
 - some discussion across Geronimo and TomEE community (which have a huge
   overlap in terms of people) to host jwt-auth can lead to have 2 concurrent
   projects and split a bit the communities, we need to take care of that
   point
 - we still need to put our spec releases in the dist area

## Activity:
 - discussion on revamping the website was relaunched, we are expecting some
   more activity on that in the coming months
 - a simple jcache implementation has been created
 - a microprofile jwt auth module has been created (but not yet provisionned)
 - a new xbean released has been done

## Health report:
 - Microprofile still drives activity but we got some EE activity too
 - XBean has been released too

ECharts

ECharts is a charting and data visualization library written in JavaScript.

ECharts has been incubating since 2018-01-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Get repo moved to https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts.

  3. First pushed to https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

Currently the setting page of GitHub is not visible to us. There may be a
problem when we need to configure it (e.g.: see if anything goes wrong when
building gh-pages branch) but communication is delayed via email. So we'd like
to ask if it is possible for at least one of us core committers to have the
admin right.

How has the community developed since the last report?

We released the information that ECharts has become a repo of Apache, and
received positive feedback from the community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

None.

Milagro

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Sort out infrastructure issues
  2. Enable NTT to handle operational tasks and project management
  3. Build the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware

There is an ongoing vote for retirement of the Project, votes so far are 6
against and 1 neutral. There is an expressed concern that the development of
the project is happening away from the Apache. This was addressed by the main
contributors (MIRACL and NTT), they pointed out the reason for that were
infrastrucure and procedural issues. They will update the Apache repos and
keep the development there once those issues are resolved.

How has the community developed since the last report?

There were no new commiters added to the project since the last report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

There is an ongoing discussion around dealing with infrastructure issues
obstructing the project development. NTT suggested that they take responsibity
for operational tasks and management of the project.

     Comments: Retirement vote got a crop of NOs, though
   some of those may have misunderstood its purpose.  I'm proposing those who
   support continuation make concrete progress in time to report (on time) in
   May.  Failing that, I will support retirement.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  johndament: In order to survive, the podling needs to move development
  activities to Apache.  Continuing to develop under Miracl's repositories
  means it is not an Apache project.

MXNet

A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning

MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way --
   ONGOING.
2. Grow the community -- ONGOING.
3. Bring website up to Apache standard -- ONGOING
4. Identify remaining ICLAs or SGAs that need signing -- ONGOING

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 None

How has the community developed since the last report?

a) Various Slack channels, dev@ mailing lists, and user discussion forums
(http://discuss.mxnet.io) are being used actively. The contributors have been
working on having all discussions on the public dev@ mailing list as much as
possible. This is an ongoing improvement process where the focus will be to
reduce the scope of private discussions to only a few individuals before it is
put on the public dev@ mailing list so that the Apache MXNet community gets a
fair chance in influencing the final outcome/decision of the discussion.

 b) O'Reilly published a series of blogs about MXNet:

How has the project developed since the last report?

a. The community released MXNet 1.1 that makes MXNet more stable and
production ready: https://blogs.apache.org/mxnet/entry/1-1-0-release-makes

b. From a statistics perspective, based on the Github insights, found here:
https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pulse/monthly, in Mar 2018, 60
authors pushed 164 commits to master, with updates to 624 files including
23.1K additions and 5.6K deletions. Historically, in Dec 2017, 51 authors
pushed 115 commits to master, with updates to 489 files including 13K
additions and 9K deletions. Historically, in Sep 2017, 62 authors pushed 171
commits to master, with updates to 467 files including 26K additions and 7K
deletions. We are working on finding more contributors to the project.

c. Documentation- Architecture guides, How To's, Tutorials, and APIs continue
to be improved.

d. More advanced features (e.g. ONNX support, mixed precission modeling, Scala
inference API, MKL-DNN integratino etc) and bug-fixes requested by the user
community continue to be added.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

 Podling is still being established in Apache - hence maturity == Low.

PLC4X

PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable
logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.

Most important issues to address while moving towards graduation:

Building the community: The PPMC and committer group has a large percentage of
codecentric employees, we have been recruiting people from other companies,
but will have to continue these efforts for establishing a healthy Apache
community. Onboarding of new committers: With PLC4X several people on the team
are not very familiar with the Apache Way. We have started and will continue
our efforts on this onboarding. Make our first release

Any Issues the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

In contrast to previous reports some of the concerns regarding availability
and usability of specifications have been resolved. Especially for using the
Modbus and the OPC-UA specifications Christofer was able to get official
permissions from the corresponding foundations to use the specifications.
These permission Emails have been filed in the private list for documentation.

One of the external foundations (Profinet) doesn’t have a free membership. In
general, the CEO of the European branch of the Profinet Foundation has
signaled that it should be possible for the ASF to become a member and have an
outside company pay the membership fees, but we have to discuss the details
(With them as well as the ASF).

How has the community developed since the last report?

Christofer has invested most of his time in March spreading the word about
PLC4X. A first POC has been created for a company which is currently going
into production An article about Apache Edgent and Apache PLC4X has been
published as a cover-story in the German JavaSPEKTRUM magazines Industrial IoT
special edition (https://www.sigs-datacom.de/digital/javaspektrum/). One PLC4X
talk has been accepted to the Apache EU Roadshow 2018 in Berlin and one will
be at the Silpion Techcamp in Hamburg (https://techcamp.hamburg/) in the first
April week.

The dev-list subscriptions has gone up by one from February, we are hoping to
increase the number in the next few weeks (However quite some emails come in
from un-registered users that have to pass moderation).

We now have a Twitter account: https://twitter.com/ApachePlc4x as another
channel of communicating interesting PLC4X facts.

How has the project developed since the last report?

We have been working hard on making better use of the ASF build
infrastructure. Especially regarding setting up our project VM at
plc4x-vm.apache.org this effort will be continued. After receiving the
permission to use and implement the Modbus protocol, the Driver skeletons have
been setup, but no real implementation of the protocol itself has been done
yet. We are still hoping for volunteers to step up as interest in implementing
the Modbus protocol has been explicitly mentioned by community memebers. The
work on the RawSocket Netty transport which is a requirement to implement
protocols that are IP based, but are not TCP or UDP has continued and we are
currently working on some of the quirks on Linux based operating-systems. We
added Netty support for IO over serial ports and will be using this in the
Beckhoff module as a first protocol. We are still working on the S7 Protocol
fragmentation and hope to be able to finish this in April. Also we discussed
on the list about how the others would think of initiating a first release of
PLC4X.

How does the podling rate their own maturity?

We have a mix of new participants and experienced Apache people involved. So
far, the new participants have shown great willingness and success in adopting
the Apache Way. However, we still need to continue:
the on-boarding increasing the diversity of the team Also, will we need to
decide and establish all the processes involved in releasing software at
Apache

Quickstep

Quickstep is a high-performance database engine.

Quickstep has been incubating since 2016-03-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Adoption of the Quickstep technology.
  2. Grow the Quickstep developer community.
  3. Work towards a second release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

None

How has the community developed since the last report?

A paper that describes the Quickstep system was accepted in a premier database
conference Very Large Databases (VLDB). Link to the paper:
http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p663-patel.pdf This paper should help the
system and the community to increase its reach further. We are already getting
emails from readers who are finding interest in the system. We are encouraging
the readers to be a part of the community.

We have submitted a keynote proposal ApacheCon. If accepted, the
paper/presentation would help to increase the awareness of Quickstep project
in the Apache community.


How has the project developed since the last report?

We have continued development of the code base. Apart from the routine bug
fixes, there are ongoing efforts for three main development directions
(respective JIRA issues have been opened):
1. Enhancing the type system used by Quickstep
2. Supporting concurrent queries in the system
3. Developing a distributed version of Quickstep

We are planning another release before summer.

   This is shaping up to be a vibrant, but a pretty small community. Another

     Comments: I don't see finishing the existing JIRA
   tickets as the key to graduation.  This podling has added new committers
   and done releases, but they continue to move at a very slow pace.  I am
   concerned about them having enough engagement to have 3 PMC members
   available to vote.  Seeing more consistent engagement is to me the criteria
   for graduation.

Traffic Control

Traffic Control is a set of components that can be used to build, monitor,
configure, and provision a large scale content delivery network (CDN).

Traffic Control has been incubating since 2016-07-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. A successful graduation vote by project community
2. A successful graduation vote by the IPMC
3. A successful acceptance of our graduation resolution by the apache board

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

None.

How has the community developed since the last report (January 2018)?

Since January the Traffic Control community has worked on the following:
* Getting Traffic Control 2.1 released
* Getting Traffic Control 2.2 ready for release candidates
* Supporting new users with installing and configuring traffic control
* Tie up loose ends and prepare ourselves for graduation
* Planning a spring summit to be held April 2018 in Boston, MA

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report (January 2018), we have

  * Merged 199 Pull Requests with 673 commits from 27 unique contributors
  * Opened 217 Github issues
  * Closed 214 Github issues
  * 301 emails sent by 46 people on the dev@ list
  * 26 emails sent by 10 people on the users@ list

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

We have started the graduation process!  We voted on starting the graduation
process, chose a project chair, and have started the Project vote on the
graduation resolution.

Weex

Weex is a framework for building Mobile cross-platform high performance UI.

Weex has been incubating since 2016-11-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop more non-Chinese contributors and committers, to bring diversity
  to the community.
  2. Replace Facebook's Yoga(Category X) dependency and release more while in
  Incubator.
  3. Improve the developer's activity in mailing list.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

The community is still learning the Apache Way,  we are making progress and
need more guidance from Mentors. The project has an ongoing problem with lack
of mentor engagement.


How has the community developed since the last report?

* WeexConf 2018 was held in Hangzhou, which brought a lot of new users and
  contributors who is intrested in the project, and Weex meetup in other
  cities will come soon.
* 278(91 new issues since the last report) issues have been reported on JIRA,
  and 145(52 since the last report) of them are resolved or closed.
* More non-Chinese developers are using Weex and contributing to the
  community, including developers from India, Russia, Singapore, etc. The
  first non-Chinese committer will come out soon.
* Our Github repo has growth in contributors 145(10 new since the last
  report), forks 1168(192 new), watchers 451(74 new) and stars 8730(1622 new)
* WebSite Trends Month Active, PV(542124), UV(91873), IP(76598), New Unique
  Visitor(47883) , Session(168065)

How has the project developed since the last report?

* Excluding merges, 11 authors have pushed 16 commits to master and 14 commits
  to all branches.
* Replacing Facebook's Yoga is done and will be released next month.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrea Turli]

==Description ==

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We have released jclouds 2.1.0, which support for OpenStack Keystone v3, a
long-standing issue that prevented jclouds from supporting modern OpenStack
versions. This has been eagerly awaited by the community and we have already
received (although off-list) some positive feedback from users. In this
release, several providers have reached a good level of maturity and have been
promoted out of "labs": Azure ARM, Packet and OpenStack neutron for compute,
and Google Cloud Storage and Backblaze B2 for storage.

Another discussion that is taking place is the need to move to Java 8 as our
officially supported Java version. This presented some compatibility issues
with the Guava library, which is widely used in the project, but we have
finally been able to come to an agreement on the upgrade plan. There has been
valuable feedback from the community regarding this topic and we now feel
comfortable in moving forward with the Java and Guava versions.

== Community ==

The project continues to receive contributions in the form of code and issues
from new developers, indicating that development is healthy and that users are
feeding back their problems and feature suggestions. We're also working to see
if an Aliyun user can contribute work done on a private branch back into the
open-source repository.

It has been great to see a contributor-initiated effort to move the project
forward to Java 8 and a newer Guava version. It is not an easy change given
our codebase and we are happy to see people is not afraid of trying to change
the project core, as one recurrent topic is that the learning curve to
understand the jclouds core is quite high.

Last committer: 2018-01-26 (Jim Spring)

Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

- Upgrade to Java 8 to support newer Guava version. This will have a
  significant impact on users but we hope it won't be an issue at this point.
- Continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
  members

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.1.0, took place on 2018-02-21.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description: 

Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem.
   
## Issues: 

No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Since the last report, we've made one minor release (1.7.0).

The 1.7.0 release included some major improvements to our design for
re-replicating data after machine failure, support for DECIMAL types,
and various other smaller features and improvements based on user and
operator feedback from prior releases.


## Health report: 

- User mailing list growth continues at historical rates (8% this quarter).
  User list traffic is down again after a bump up in the previous quarter.
  Looking historically it seems like "messages sent" is a pretty noisy
  metric with big bursts of activity due to popular threads, followed by
  periods of quietness. We don't believe there is anything to be learned
  from this.

- Website traffic grew again slightly - sessions +2.7%, users +2.3%.

- Development activity grew substantially (measured by code review and
  JIRA traffic): reviews +34%, jira +119%. In the previous report we
  mentioned that it was down due to the holiday season so this is likely
  just the normal activity resuming in the new year.

- This quarter (Jan-Mar), we committed code authored by 22 distinct
  contributors (+5 since last quarter) of whom 8 (+5 since last quarter)
  were new to the project.

## Activity:

Activity this quarter has been low. The team hit a larger blocker with a very
ambitious multi-artifact release; while upgrading scala and spark versions
shifting IP restrictions and life for an all volunteer team has made it
difficult to get over this hump.  As well the the team, spread very thin in
the past quarters, took on several other large tasks, leaving all overworked.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Maven Board Report - April 2018
---------------------------

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a standardized
coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build lifecycle.

* Issues

  <<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

* Activity

  With the new release train of Java we can expect a new release every six
  months. This means we need to test early with these versions and where
  possible make the libraries and plugins more robust so there's no release
  required with every new Java version. ASM seems to be a critical library
  which must be updated every time, but as long as the interface stays the
  same new releases are preferred but not required, since it is possible by
  developers to upgrade dependencies of plugins in their poms. Most activities
  were related to make our projects buildable with JDK 10. This is actually a
  risk: every minute we need to spend on making our projects run on a new Java
  version will reduce time to work on the improvements on Maven and its
  plugins. We have good ideas for Maven 4+5 and some are required to better
  support on building with these latest JDKs, but with the current resources
  it will be hard to do both.

  All our gitwip repositories have been migrated to gitbox. We are a bit
  disappointed about this process. We requested the migration a long time ago.
  When we received the message that the migration was planned it took a long
  time before it really happened, even when we asked for status updates. Our
  idea was to do the Maven release from the new gitbox repository, but after a
  while we had to decide to go for a release from gitwip because we had no
  idea when the migration would happen. Moreover, with this migration, all
  commit links in JIRA
  ("Fixed with ${SHA-1}") are broken, because they still point to
    git-wip-us.a.o instead of gitbox.a.o: having a redirection from the old
    canonical repo links to the new would be useful.

  We auto-closed all issues that were inactive for over 3 years. This should
  help us focus on the "real" issues. Only a small number of issues were
  reopened as requested by the reporter or other interested user, because they
  are still valid. The number of unresolved issues used to be between 2000 and
  2100, now it's between 1600 and 1700, see also https://s.apache.org/7tkk

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
 - Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
   distribute data.
 - Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
   integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
   Java and C++ implementations.
 - Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
   including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
   MiNiFi.
 - Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
   NiFi classloader isolation model.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

We are working hard to make the Nutch 1.x branch stable after the upgrade
to the new MapReduce API (NUTCH-2375), a huge change over 200 files
which introduced several regressions.

The release of 2.4 is on the agenda.

We still hope to participate again in GSoC but have no student applications
yet.

## Websites & Infrastructure

In the last Quarter our provider SourceForge a data center migration and
critical technical difficulties. Our Software has been unavailable for several
days. As a reaction some PMC Members have concerns about our lack of Plan B.

The project is taking over one VM from Infra. So far the process is slow,
since we discussing with infra and our community the modernisation of the
software we use. From our site the process is constructive.

## Fairs and events

OpenOffice, as usual, had a significant presence at FOSDEM, both with a few
talks at the Open Document Editors devroom and with a booth running for the
entire FOSDEM weekend. The AOO Project will work with the ASF organisation
more closely on FOSDEM 2019 in order to ensure that the needs of AOO and ASF
are met. We are looking into different options already.

## BRANDING

We had a long and constructive discussion with brands team on brands topic.
The details have already been reported in the brands report. We have currently

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

The project is still in sleep mode. No activity on the dev list and no
progress in terms of commits. The last commit was pushed in March 2017
but there is no work happening towards a 1.0.1 release at the moment.

There has been an initiative to place a GSoC project and we have a
student which is interested. Discussions about the scope of the
project are currently made.

Beside the fact that not much is happening there is no issue which
requires board attention at the moment.

Subscribers on the dev list: 219

Last new committer was
  Cristian Petroaca on May 7th, 2015

Last new PMC member were
  Cristian Petroaca on July 28th, 2016
  Rafa Haro on July 28th, 2016

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
 Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation
 uses to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 The annual members meeting used STeVe for the voting process.
 Things went fairly smoothly, with a minute number of bugs detected,
 among them a unicode bug in the email functions.
 Not much in terms of response this time around, but we did get some
 ideas floating on the dev list[1]. Jim and I (Daniel) have both indicated
 an interest in pursuing these ideas at a later stage, when time permits
    
## Health report: 
 The project is pretty much in chronic hiatus/stand-by mode for the time
 being. We have sufficient PMC oversight (>= 3 active members), but
 little time to devote to the project and not a whole lot of new
 volunteers. If anyone reading this wants to contribute, please let
 us know at dev@steve.apache.org :-). It is probably worth noting, that
 we have sufficient person-power to address bugs and vulnerabilities...
 not that we've had anything serious to address yet.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 5 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Rich Bowen on Mon Apr 20 2015 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 9 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Pierre Smits at Tue Dec 15 2015 
   
## Releases: 
   
 No releases yet. We have been running members meetings on a trunk
 philosophy for the past few years and it's worked out well enough.
 If we get indications of a desire to use STeVe outside the foundation,
 we will of course consider pushing a release out.
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 Very low activity, nothing worth going into details over.
   
## Bug/issue activity: 
   
 - 4 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 0 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Streams Project  [Steve Blackmon]

## Description:
- Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online
  activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets
  accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
  streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:
- There are a lot of changes occurring in the APIs of our supported data
  sources.  Due primarily to the EU's GDPR legislation, a user's ability to
  collect profiles and posts from accounts other than the authenticated
  account is being limited. On the other hand comprehensive data about the
  authenticated account (sometimes via bulk export not via API) is becoming
  richer, presenting an opportunity for the project to assist users in
  awareness of the data collected about them by third-parties, and with data
  portability between systems using bulk export archives.

## Activity:
- We are preparing to release Apache Streams 0.6.0 - the first to include a
  binary artifact allowing users to run Streams classes from their terminal
  without building the project or wrapping it's modules in custom code.
- We ran a comprehensive audit of dependencies (including transitive
  dependencies) and removed all items with undesirable licenses.  The license
  audit now gets published to the website, and the maven plugins involved can
  used to help us maintain our NOTICE file.
- We revamped the way that configuration details are provided to classes
  rather substantially, making it more flexible, powerful, and easier to
  understand.
- The secondary apache/streams-examples repository has been integrated into
  apache/streams.

## Health report:
Streams graduated to TLP on July 19 2017.  New features and platform
improvements are happening at a steady pace.  Adding committers and growing
the PMC needs to be a focus this year.

## PMC changes:
None. There are currently 8 PMC members.

## Committer base changes:
None. There are currently 8 committers.

## Releases:
- Apache Streams 0.5.1 was released on January 09, 2018
- Apache Streams 0.6.0 is targeted for release this month (April 2018)

## Upcoming Project Initiatives:
- Integrate new binary release with Apache Kibble, and with the Apache
  Software Foundation instance of Kibble.
- Add new providers that source streams from export archives of existing data
  sources (twitter, facebook, google).
- More tweets and blog posts of zeppelin notebooks demonstrating data
  pipelines and analyses based on Apache Streams.
- More official examples in source tree demonstrating integration of Apache
  Streams with complementary technologies.
- Drop remaining maven dependencies on java SDKs for accessing third-party
  APIs in favor of HTTP/REST interfaces powered by Apache Juneau Remoteable
  Annotations.
- Improve the interfaces by which components are created, configured,
  activated, and executed via SDK and CLI.- Reduce disparities between
  normalized activities and objects of like type collected from various data
  sources.
- Reduce disparities between the configuration objects that initialize similar
  providers from various data sources.
- Add official support for Schema.org and Activity Streams 2.0 data types.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made one GA releases in the last quarter.
* Struts 2.5.16 - full GA release including bug fixes and feature
enhancements (2018-03-16)

Furthermore we released two security announcements
* advise users to upgrade commons-fileupload to version 1.3.3 [1]
* a crafted XML request can be used to perform a DoS attack when using
the Struts REST plugin [2]

In the last quarter we released Struts 2.5.16, with many improvements
feature-wise as well as bug fixes. Community contributions and
development activities were on a constantly decent level.

We had again a few incoming security reports and resulting issues, that
we were able to deal with in a timely manner. The issues were again
mostly related to 3rd party libraries used by the Struts framework.

No committers or PMC members were added in the last quarter.

Last committer addition:
* 2017-11-14 - Yasser Zamani (yasserzamani)
Last PMC addition:
* 2017-11-06 - Stefaan Dutry (sdutry)

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Thrift Project  [Jake Farrell]

Apache Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

Project Status
---------
The Apache Thrift community recently switched canonical repository location from
Apache git-wip to Github via the ASF Gitbox service and this has caused some
unanticipated pain for our user and dev communities. We are working to address
these client library integration problems as fast as possible and Apache Infra
has been a great help with this when needed. While addressing these issues we
are progressing towards our next release candidate and focusing on improving our
processes arounds test automation and simplifying our workflows.

While work has not yet truly started, we did open up a new branch of
development for the 3.4.x line of code. It is still up for discussion in the
community to determine what this release will contain.

TinkerPop did invite someone to join the PMC, but that person politely
declined and preferred to continue to contribute as they have been doing.

There were a number of talks on TinkerPop and TinkerPop-enabled technology
in the last several months. Here is a selection of those made by PMC
members:

- "Gremlin's Anatomy" at DataStax NYC Meetup by Stephen Mallette[2]
- "Powers of Ten Redux" at Data Day by Jason Plurad[3]

Finally, we received a nice comment from someone on our user mailing list
who said that our user list was, "One of the most active google groups I
have seen in recent times, kudos for that !!!"[4] It's a simple anecdote,
and we tend to see comments of its like from time to time, but we found this
one to be unique in its wording of "thanks" in that it directly complimented
the attention that our community pays to its users.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Issues

The community had a situation similar to the previously reported June 27th
incident that spawned the "Suffocating development environment" [1] thread.
The subject matter was different, but the dynamics and people involved were
largely the same with a commit that caused immediate harsh feedback and was
immediately reverted.

On February 2nd a discussion was started on potentially implementing
MicroProfile JWT in TomEE, which started some at first healthy discussion on
where this should go.  There was a perspective that this has come up before,
is yet unresolved and should be discussed.  There was also the perspective
that all code that implements the MicroProfile brand should belong to
Geronimo and TomEE can use them, but never create them.  As well that
Geronimo is the proper place for a reusable components under the Java EE
umbrella.

On February 12 a commit came in [2] during this discussion, was perceived as
attempting to circumvent the conversation, infringe on Geronimo's territory,
and generated some immediately harsh responses [3][4].  The committer
reverted his own commit and sent an email largely with the tone "I quit this
project" [5].  A wider discussion was had on the incident [6] and some
apologies were made for jumping to conclusions, however the underlying belief
that Geronimo is the proper owner of the MicroProfile at Apache remains.

In the last 12 months to date, only 3 people have committed to Geronimo, 2 of
them are TomEE committers.  There are no evildoers in any of this, but the
overlap does add to the complexity of the issue and results in most of the
discussion naturally taking place on the TomEE lists.

## Health

Developer mailing list activity spiked up significantly due to the above
discussion.  Activity of any kind is a good thing as the lists have been
generally quiet.  Here are the stats from this reporting period vs the same
period last year:

2017

- Jan, 38 
- Feb, 39
- Mar, 60

2018

- Jan, 42
- Feb, 202
- Feb, 212

While people are no agreeing, they are talking which is a good step forward.
As reported in December, commits had been dominated by largely one person for
the first six months of 2017, but were dramatically transformed in the six
months after the June 27th 2017 triple-commit-and-revert incident.  So while
the incident in this report may sound negative, it's my belief this is
another step in the project regaining balance and growing.  I suspect as
before in six months time we'll see a major improvement that can be traced
back to this event.

## Activity

Implementation of the MicroProfile JWT specification was the major activity.
The code allows for the validation of RSA signed JSon Web Tokens in TomEE
sent over the 'Authorization' header of incoming HTTP requests.  A PR was
created consisting of a handful of integration changes and 19 new java files
that was extensively reviewed by two others, one of whom is a new
contributor.  Due to the unclear stance of this subject in general, a vote
was held on if the code should be merged.  Results were 11 +1s, 1 0 and 1 -1.
6 were binding and 7 came from community members, which is also encouraging
as voter turnout has been low.  After discussion on the list and with the
board, it was determined the -1 issues on the grounds the code should live in
Geronimo is not a binding technical veto.  A separate, non-technical vote,
was held to determine if the project had desire to make the reusable library
that seems to be desired.  That vote concluded with 6 +1s, 1 +0 and 2 -1s.
Both -1s were on the grounds the work should be done in Geronimo.  No further
work has been done yet.

Work on Java 9 and 10 support has started in both the Apache TomEE 1.7.x and
7.0.x branches.  Code dontations of Sheldon and Chatterbox, \ mentioned in
the December report, have completed.  Releases of that code have not yet been
made.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Bryan Call]

## Description: 
Apache Traffic Server is a HTTP and HTTP/2 proxy server and cache.  What makes
ATS unique across the landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on
extensibility (plugins), HTTP and HTTP/2 protocol conformity, and performance.
ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs in the world, delivering a significant
portion of all Internet traffic.

## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity:
 - There was a QUIC Hackaton in January in Tokyo, Japan.  There were 6 people
   that attended and worked on the design and implementation of IETF QUIC
   inside of ATS.

 - We have an ATS Spring Summit schedule in Cork, Ireland for the week of May
   6th.  18 people have signed up and there are going to be presentations and
   planned events around cleanup of the code and bug reports.
   
## Health report: 
 - We had a successful 7.1.2 release in January and there at least two major
   companies running the release in full production.  The first 7.1.3 release
   candidate came out this week and we are in the middle of voting on it.

Attachment BX: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to
SOAP/XML based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations.
Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within
Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite
mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed,
and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure
the project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since
SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of the art,
we don't expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new
committers, etc...

At the start of the quarter, we did make an effort to apply some bug
fixes and get some patch releases out.  There have been some fixes
applied to WSS4J since then and we do expect to do some more patch
releases soon.

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)

Releases this period:

WSS4J - implementation of WS-Security and related technologies
* 2.1.12 - Jan 2018

Attachment BY: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Report from the Apache Wicket project [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework.

## Noteworthy items:

 - skipped prior report in the normal schedule, this report follows up on that

 - 2 releases were performed

 - Wicket 8 is technically done, waiting for site adjustments, announcements,
   press release to be written

 - Infoworld published a listicle of 15 Java frameworks to give developers a
   boost [1], and Wicket was one of the reviewed items

## Issues:

 - No issues require board attention.

## Activity:

 - We are on the cusp of releasing Wicket 8, so we still plan on working with
   Sally for the corresponding press coverage.

 - There's some frustration that we haven't pushed Wicket 8 due to not having
   the PR ready.

 - We're also discussing the future plans of Java releases and the impact on
   Wicket releases: how to work with breaking Java changes in our project

 - We (just as the other Java web frameworks at Apache) were interviewed by
   Paul Krill from Infoworld about the future of Java web frameworks in
   general and Wicket specifically.

## Health report:

 - The community is stable as is to be expected from a mature server side Java
   web framework. We don't anticipate a sudden large growth or large decline.

 - Questions to the user list and dev list are answered, resolved and
   discussed.

 - We have joined several other projects on the-asf slack, and created a
   #wicket channel. Not much happening over there, but it is nice to have a
    chat venue available
