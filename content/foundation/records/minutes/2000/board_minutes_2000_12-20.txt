 4. Officer Reports

    A. President  [Brian]
     Brian reported on the status of locus, and on the server upgrades
     for the various ASF projects. Brian also informed the board of some
     private, non-ASF related discussions with Stallman regarding the
     APL and the GPL.

    B. Treasurer  [Randy]
     Randy reported a current balance of $108,011.92 in the ASF bank
     account. This included 2 donations: $746.86, from O'Reilly
     royalties, and $1,400, for Linux NewMedia. As of this date, the
     ASF had not yet received the payment check for ApacheCon2000 - Europe.
     $688.55 was spent on the crypto research effort.
     
     Randy also at this time reported that efforts were still underway
     in creation a relationship with Colley Gorward LLP to serve as the
     ASF's legal council.
     
     Efforts are also underway to obtain a merchant account for the ASF, to
     allow for the use of credit card donations. The delay has been due to
     the fact that the bank that Randy had been working with has been taken
     over by Well Fargo.

    C. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]
     Jim reported little activity required during the last month. It was
