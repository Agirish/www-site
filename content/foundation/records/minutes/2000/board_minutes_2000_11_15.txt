 4. Officer Reports

    A. Treasurer

    Randy reported that he is working on reimbursing the ASF expenses
    that were incurred at ApacheCon during the ASF Hackathon event.  He
    will commit a copy of the current financial accounts to the foundation
    CVS repository (Roy may need to convert it to PDF).

    B. XML/Apache

    Dirk reported that he had been thinking about the notion of a genesis
    or incubator PMC, as discussed at the members meeting, and was wondering
    how we are going to manage the reporting of projects to the ASF board.
    Roy suggested that one or two could be invited to each board meeting,
    and that a special status file for each project should be kept in the
    foundation repository.

 5. Committee Reports

    A. Apache Conferences Committee

    Ken reported rough figures from ApacheCon Europe 2000 of about
    1200 attendees, with half expo-only.  It should result in upwards of
    $30,000 in funds for the ASF.

    Submissions are already coming in for the next ApacheCon in Santa Clara.
    Some new sponsors have expressed interest as well.  A site for the
    next non-US conference has not yet been picked.  Rasmus suggested
    that Linuxcare Australia may be able to help with an ApacheCon if it
    were to be held in Sydney.

    Ken reminded the board that the conference committee should be re-elected.  
    Roy suggested that a call for nominees should be sent to the members
    first.

    Ken also noted that the doc subproject of httpd is going well, with
    very active commits from several new contributors.  Also, the special
    order for ASF members t-shirts has been sent to copyleft.

 6. Special Orders

    A. Trademark

    Dirk suggested that we should make an effort to officially register
    the use of Apache and the multi-colored feather as an ASF trademark.
    This led to a general discussion about retaining counsel for the ASF
    (next item) and will be postponed until such time as that relationship
    is established.

    B. Engage in a relationship with Cooley

    Randy recommended that the ASF establish a formal relationship with
    the law firm of Cooley Godward LLP, San Francisco, so that we would
    have a quick resource for legal issues.  <http://www.cooley.com/>

    The following resolution was approved by unanimous vote of all directors
    present [Ken, Roy, Rasmus, Doug, Randy, Dirk].

       RESOLVED, that the officers of the Foundation are hereby directed
       to engage in a relationship with the law firm of Cooley Godward LLP
       in order to retain them as counsel for the Foundation.

 7. Unfinished Business

    A. Funds for legal review of member employee agreements

    Ben Hyde has proposed that the Foundation budget funds for legal
    review of the employee agreements that many of our members are
    asked to sign as part of their full-time jobs outside the foundation.
    These agreements impact the foundation because they often stipulate
    that all of the employee's intellectual property must be assigned to
    the hiring company by default, along with other egregious clauses.

    Roy emphasized that this would only be legitimate use of our funds
    if the review was requested by the Foundation and the results of that
    review published to all members, since otherwise we would be covering
    what would normally be a personal expense.

    Further discussion of this item was tabled until after we have
    established a relationship with Cooley, at which time the process
    (and typical cost to the ASF) for doing this type of review can be
    more accurately determined.

 8. New Business

 9. Announcements

    Ken announced that we had received the first request for a targeted
    donation.  The donor wants the ASF to have 501(c)(3) status.

10. Adjournment

    Meeting adjourned at 10:03am PST -0800.
