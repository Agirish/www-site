 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       Overall, a quiet month for the board.

       The board is considering making a public statement on the
       impact of IBM's departure from the Harmony project.  Related,
       we're contemplating the ASF's ongoing role in the JCP EC.  No
       final decision has yet been made in either regard.

    B. President [Jim]

       Runtime-wise, the foundation is operating smoothly.
       
       We received quite a number of applications for the EA task, and
       we are now at a point to budget for the position. My expectation
       is that after today's meeting I will be able to offer the
       position to the current front-runner and hopes that he/she would
       be able to attend ApacheCon.
       
       There has been major discussions within the foundation (and
       external, of course) regarding the "fallout" after IBM announced
       that there were dropping support for Harmony and instead focusing
       on OpenJDK. I did speak with Gavin Clarke of The Register about
       this but basically said that ASF is built around the concepts that
       developers come-and-go and so we hope that the Harmony community
       "recovers" swiftly. I also noted that the decision does not bode
       well for Oracle ever abiding to the JSPA agreement with the ASF
       and allowing for TCK access minus the FOU, but time will tell for
       sure. More detail can be found in the VP of JCP and the Harmony
       report.
       
       I provided a blog post for GigaOM entitled "The Cloud is Open
       Source" available at: http://s.apache.org/iL
       
    C. Treasurer [Geir]

      Books are up to date - $20 discrepancy remains (haven't spent time).  
      Current balances are total cash of $475,841 at Wells Fargo and 
      $30,095.66 at PayPal.  
      
      In terms of lockbox, we've had  :
        - $40k check from AMD (deposited 9/27)
        - $10k check from Basis (deposited 10/4)
       
      Tasks Done:
        - all bills paid

      In Progress:
       - preparation for FY2010 US Tax filing.  Still working on QB but 
         CPA and I are active on this 
       - find the $20 discrepancy in checking

       to serve in accordance with and subject to the direction of the
       Board of Directors and the Bylaws of the Foundation until
       death, resignation, retirement, removal or disqualification, or
       until a successor is appointed.

    Approved by unanimous roll call vote.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Public statement about Harmony

    IBM has announced that it is reducing its involvement in Apache
    Harmony in favor of increasing its involvement in OpenJDK. 

    The board agreed that this is a serious setback for the project
    but the future of the project is in the hands of the Harmony PMC,
    which has the full support of the board regardless of what direction
    the PMC wants to take.
    
    B. Public statement about Oracle's decision on the TCK's FOU

    The board discussed ASF's response to the crisis in the JCP now 
    that Oracle has made it clear that it is prepared to negotiate a 
    JCK license for the Apache Harmony project only if it includes a 
    Field Of Use restriction.

    Discussions among the members as to the foundation's response to this 
    have surfaced myriad possible responses, from abandoning the Harmony 
    project, quitting the JCP, quitting Apache's JCP Executive Committee 
    seat, abandoning existing Apache Java projects, to suing Oracle. 
    The effects on other Apache projects have also been called into question.

    The board reiterated its commitment to all Apache Java projects 
    that implement Java specifications. There is nothing being considered 
    that would require any Apache project to stop what it is doing based 
    on the JCP crisis. Projects that currently license TCKs will continue 
    to do so. If maintenance leads for JSRs propose to change the terms of 
    license for existing TCKs then Apache will vigorously lobby against 
    these changes. New projects will continue to be considered on their 
    merits and on the appropriateness of the proposed licenses.

    In a word, existing projects are not in any danger.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

JCP Face-to-Face
================

Two weeks ago, I attended the quarterly meeting of the JCP EC in
Bonn, Germany.  It was an extended meeting - scheduled to last 2 
full days - and the main agenda item was the ongoing Apache-
Oracle dispute over the TCK licensing for Java SE.  Since the 
acquisition of Sun by Oracle, Oracle has held off giving any 
response to the ASF regarding this issue.

At the meeting, Oracle stated that with respect to the ASF's request 
for a TCK license for Java SE, they would be continuing Sun's policy
of refusing to offer a TCK license without the "Field of Use" 
restrictions.  These "Field of Use" restrictions limit how and where
a user can use a compliant, tested version of Apache Harmony, and 
further,  requires that the ASF notify users of these restrictions.
Obviously, such limitations aren't compatible with any open source 
license, and thus we have to reject Oracle's terms.

In addition, Oracle announced that they were committed to getting
Java SE moving again, and would soon be filing JSRs for Java SE 7 
and Java SE 8.  They further informed us that they will be moving
Java forward - if the EC doesn't allow those JSRs to proceed, they
would be moving Java forward in some other way.  (Another way to
interpret this is that the ECs votes really don't matter here.)

To summarize the ensuing discussion, it's clear that there is
quite a bit of support in the EC for getting Java moving again
and EC members are willing to support the JSRs when they are filed.
Many of the EC members see that the risk to Java not moving due 
to the stalemate over the licensing is much higher than the 
risk to Java by allowing Oracle to continue with its breach of
contract by not complying with the terms of the JSPA.  It's clear
that many who have supported our position will be voting for 
the SE JSRs.  They still claim to support our position, but 
various factors are forcing the switch in their vote.

I will continue to lobby for support of our position - that Oracle
isn't complying with the rules of the JCP, and therefore shouldn't
be allowed to create new JSRs until the problems are resolved.

There is an open question that needs to be resolved - there are 
members that believe they can't in good conscience vote for a 
Java SE 7 JSR because Oracle's behavior violates the JSPA, yet 
they don't want to be put in the position to vote against the
resumption of progress in Java.  To that end, I've asked on
behalf of those members that before the JSRs are filed, we 
(the EC) discuss that specific issue.  There is a conference 
call on this topic right before the board meeting this week and 
I can report on that verbally at the meeting.  To that end, I may be
a few minutes late (the call overlaps the board call by 30 min).

Re-nomination for JCP EC Seat
=============================

The ASFs 2-year term on the JCP EC is over in November, and Oracle
has re-nominated the ASF for the EC seat.  After consulting with 
the board and membership, I've accepted the nomination on behalf
of the ASF.

Miscellaneous
=============

There has been a lot of internal discussion on board@ and members@
regarding the Oracle decision, the re-nomination, and our future 
in and around the JCP.  I think that this is a healthy airing, and
will help us together decide on the road forward depending on the 
Java 7/8 votes, the EC seat election, and related.

With the announcement that IBM will be moving its corporate support
from Apache Harmony to OpenJDK, there has been some concern and 
questions on how this will affect the project, and further, speculation
on how this affects JSRs and the JCP.  I'd like to state that the ASFs
work on JSRs and the JCP is independent of any single project and any
entities contributions to a project.  On board@ we've been putting 
together a public statement related to the IBM announcement, and it's 
almost ready for distribution or release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

No board-level issues noted. [1]

Operations And Community
========================

Apache Project Branding Requirements have been sent to pmcs@.  
The policy includes a checklist of brand-related items that PMC 
chairs are requested to include in their future quarterly board reports 
until their project is compliant.  Projects were asked to comply 
with branding requirements by the end of Q1 2011.

Several PMCs have responded with clarifying questions, as well as 
several reports of potential infringement of their products' 
marks by third parties, which will be followed up on trademarks@.
I've also asked the Incubator PMC to work on updating the 
Podling guidelines to ensure they will match the branding 
requirements when new TLPs graduate in the future.

External Requests
=================

Requested assistance of VP, Legal and counsel to assist with 
potential misuse of our Maven mark; investigation is ongoing.

I attended the Lucene Revolution conference and answered a number 
of questions at our booth about Apache branding.

[1] Note that a number of trademark-related issues crossed over to 
board@ this month; please let me know on trademarks@ if the board 
has any specific response to issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

This was a good month for fundraising.  No issues for the board to address.

BIG PICTURE
This winter, it'll be a year that I've been in this role, so I wanted to 
give a brief recap.  A lot of time was spent coming up to speed and
understanding what was involves, and here are the highlights of what's been
accomplished so far:

- thank you letters were sent to 2009 individual donors
- corrected and organized book royalty payments from Packt
- new sponsors: Facebook (gold), AMD (gold), Basis (silver),
  Matt Mullenweg (silver), Lucid Imagination (bronze).

I feel good about involving Sally and Greg and others to help develop and
maintain sponsor relationships.  I have an update for sponsors that I will
be sending to them this week... I'm rather excited about this and have more
info below.

SPONSORS
Lucid Imagination is officially a new bronze sponsor as of October 1st.

Yahoo should have been invoiced last month, but I have a call scheduled with
their new point of contact this week to discuss.  I've heard that we are a
line item in their budget.

AMD's new machine should be purchased by ApacheCon as part of their gold
sponsorship.

At the f2f in Boston, I talked to Sally about having her help with sponsors,
and she has been extremely helpful!  I plan to talk to her and Greg and
others at ApacheCon about how we can build the sponsorship program.

OTHER FUNDRAISING
I answered some book donation royalty questions from a committer who is
directing payments from Packt to us.

Shane introduced me to people at Lulu, and I am talking to them about the
option for committers to direct their royalties to the ASF.

Thank you letters are 3 months away!  They should go out quickly in January
to those who donated via PayPal, with some addition letters sent later once
we identify the checks and wire donations.

UPDATE TO SPONSORS
I have been struggling to determine what to send to sponsors as a regular
update, as all of them want to hear more about us and where their money is
going.

While there are a wide range of news sources on what is going on at the ASF,
I recently came to the conclusion that the update to sponsors should focus
on the foundation, not the projects.  It is impossible for me to know about
each release and which projects matter to which sponsors.

So I will focus on the foundation-level news.  For this first update, this
will include:
- A new board was elected (I'll include a few sentence bio on each member)
- New trademark policy put in place
- Infrastructure hardware refresh

In future updates, I'll cull the members meeting notes and will look for
other foundation-level news that would be relevant to sponsors.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

STATUS:

I. Budget: we purchased a second retractable vertical banner (for Lucene
Revolution, ApacheCon, SC10, and other US-based events), and Sally's
flights for ApacheCon and SC10. We will be investing in additional
promotional materials to be used for ApacheCon and related events; Sally
will continue to work with Sam on using his credit card for pre-paid
supplies and services.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Serge and Sally had a
face-to-face meeting regarding Sponsors and general fundraising during
the Board Meeting in Boston. Follow up is ongoing via email, with Shane
participating as needed.

III. Press Releases: we issued the following press release over the PR
NewsWire:

- 6 October 2010 "ApacheCon Announces Keynote Presentations by Thought
Leaders Dana Blankenhorn of ZDNet, Daniel Crichton of NASA Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, and Bob Sutor of IBM Corporation"

IV. Future Announcements: a media alert on Maven 3 is scheduled for
distribution on Wednesday, 20 October, and are coordinating edits on a
supporting press release by Sonatype. We are already receiving requests
for interviews as part of our ongoing news pre-announcement to a subset
of our media/analyst list under embargo (all requests to maintain
confidentiality during the embargo period have been honored thus far).

In addition, we may possibly announce the upcoming new release of
Subversion, and await further details from the PMC. No other PMCs have
contacted us regarding any major project news at this time.

V. Informal Announcements: we're continuing to successfully distribute
news to our dedicated press/analyst list, as well as the ASF blog and
Twitter feed. Many popular posts are widely retweeted, including the
ASF's millionth commit and Apache Solr powering the search capabilities
for http://www.whitehouse.gov/

We are still seeking success stories for the "Did You Know?" Twitter
campaign: please forward suggestions to Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org.


VI. Media Relations: we've been extremely busy over the past month as
we're ramping up for ApacheCon. The Apache blog on ComputerWorldUK has
launched; archives are available at
http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/apache-asserts/

VII. Analyst Relations: Sally has been in communications with RedMonk
regarding the IBM/Oracle/JCP situation. Conversation/feedback loop is
ongoing.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is overseeing conference promotion and is
the day-to-day contact for PR activities. We will be placing no fewer
than 7 articles on various ASF projects and activities to help promote
ApacheCon (thanks to everyone, who participated!), as well as new
Feathercast interviews on specific tracks/sessions/topics.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison (in partnership with
ConCom): Sally, Shane Curcuru, and Glen Daniels manned the ASF during
the Lucene Revolution event 7-8 October. This was a commercially-focused
conference, and was helpful for us, as we met a variety of Apache users,
obtained some great data for the "Did You Know?" campaign, and had a
chance to meet with some new Sponsors, as well as spread the word on ASF
Sponsorship and general fundraising.

Upcoming - 15-19 Nov: SC10/New Orleans - Sally will be at the
".org/nonprofit" booth in partnership with the Linux Fund. Jim Jagielski
will assist; we're still looking for help! Please contact
press-AT-apache-DOT-org if you can join us.

X. PR Newswire account: 9 of the initial 10 pre-paid flat-rate press
releases on PR Newswire have been used. Our second set of 10 are
available until 30 April 2011.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

No board level issues.  In fact, no change from last month's report.

Concurrent with ApacheCon will be the W3C TPAC conference.  My plans are
to attend ApacheCon.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

We signed onto the amicus brief to Microsoft's petition to the US Supreme
Court in the Microsoft v. I4I case which was prepared by the EFF.  Special
thanks to Larry for bringing this to our attention and driving this issue.
Based on everything I have seen, our participation has been well received.

As the board has decided not to pursue establishing a General Counsel at this
time, I plan to start the process of documenting the various roles and
responsibilities.  During this process, I will be looking to expand
participation in the Legal Affairs Committee.

Three JIRA issues opened, and three closed this month.  Most significant, JIRA
issue 80 (NTLM Inclusion) was approved.  This previously had been a board
action item.

We've received a request from the TAC to write/review a waiver of medical
liability. 

Larry and Sam have been participating in discussions relating to the JCP
contract dispute.  Nothing specific to report at this time.

The Legal Affairs Committee also continues to support the work of the VP of
Brand Management.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For September 2010: There continues to be a steady stream of reports
of various kinds arriving at security@apache.org.  These continue to
be dealt with by the security team.

2      Support question
2      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
3      Vulnerability reports of which
       1      Vulnerability report [subversion, via security@apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [libcloud, via security@apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [Archiva, via security@apache.org]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

ApacheCon North America, Atlanta 2010
==============================
Registration continues, and numbers are comparable to last year. Meetups,
key signing, BarCamp etc are beginning to come together, and look like
everything will be in good shape at the event.

Apache Retreat Hursley
==================
27 attendees, from Europe and the US, made it to Hursley for a weekend Retreat
in September. The Apache Subversion and Apache Tuscany projects got
particularly involved, with several representatives present, and some in-depth
discussions were reported that helped resolve issues within the projects. 

One suggestion coming out of the Retreat was to engage PMCs/core community
members early, to help projects get critical mass at such events, to get
maximum benefit.

The cost per attendee, to the Foundation, was not at a level we would like to
see from future events - however, this was always going to be an experimental
endeavour, and did come in under budget.

Where next?
==========
Discussions on the future of Apache events are ongoing. Noirin and Sally were
to draw up an RFP for future conference-style events, but work on ApacheCon
has delayed this. Hopefully it will be possible to do this at ApacheCon, with
the intention of giving our current producer a "first option", and soliciting
alternative proposals in the new year.

In order to ensure some degree of continuity, for our community and for the
conference, ConCom request that the board sanction a single-year extension of
our current contract for an event in North America in 2012. This has been
added to the agenda, #11 B.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Helios (zones) has been decommissioned, replaced by FreeBSD jails
on sigyn.

5 new TLPs were processed: pig, hive, shiro, juddi, karaf.

We still need to purchase an Opteron-based box per the sponsorship
agreement with AMD.

Tony Stevenson fixed our busted zfs-snapshot-to-tape script on bia
(backups).

Upgraded all our Linux hosts to deal with the announced local root
exploit bug.

Bruce Snyder continues to pursue a VMWare VSphere installation for
us.

Coding work on the CMS has completed: for details see

http://www.staging.apache.org/dev/cms.html

We are planning to go "live" during Apachecon once the new templates
and stylesheets are available for www.apache.org.

We received a DMCA takedown notice regarding some content in the
logging and Hadoop wikis.  The PMCs have been notified but have not
reported back on their progress.

Specced an FC card to allow us to reuse the helios array, providing
sigyn with more storage space.  Estimated cost ~ $1000.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

Since the last report we have finalised flights and hotel bookings, 
conference registrations etc.
We opened applications for any changed circumstance applications for one 
week and we had one more applicant in that time which was accepted.

Talks are under way with Barcamp organisers as to what TAC attendees will 
be able to help with there, we also need to organise on what they will 
help with for the rest of the Conference, balancing between of course 
letting them enjoy the experience!

Our next report will be post conference, good luck all going to ApacheCon!

ECS/ORO/Slide, and XML's Crimson.

- after an initial standstill, migration of the above is chugging along.

- no issues requiring board attention at this time


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Avro Project

== Issues ==

There are no issues that require the board's
attention at this time.

== Community ==

We added a new committer, Patrick Wendell, to the
project in August.  Patrick contributed a number of
patches focused on adding RPC trace capabilities to
Java.

Mailing list traffic on the developer list since our last
board report has averaged about 10 messages/day.
There were good discussions around the python HTTP/RPC
service, genavro implementation, Pig to Avro translation,
Avro MapReduce APIs, enhanced schema parsing, Java
RPC tracing, .NET Avro implementation, SASL support
and your typical bug reports.

Mailing list traffic on the user mailing list remains
around 1-2 messages a day.  Most questions on this list
pertain to Avro best practices, questions around building
a schema, etc.

== Releases ==

On September 18th, 2010, we released Apache Avro 1.4.0
which included 16 new features, 33 improvements from
15 different authors.  Some of the new features included: a 
new PHP implementation Avro, Java RPC tracing, Hadoop 
MapReduce support for Avro files, a Netty-based RPC 
transceiver and server implementation.

A vote just passed on October 14th to release Avro 1.4.1.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Releases:
DOSGI 1.2 was released
2.2.10 and 2.2.11 patches were released.
The long awaited 2.3.0 release finally occurred.  Yea! 


New committers:
No changes to the PMC or committer list occurred this quarter.   This is a 
first for CXF.


Community update:
Several exciting things happened this quarter from a community perspective.
1) The 2.3.0 release is obviously a major event.   The developer community 
came together nicely to get 2.3.0 to pass both the JAX-WS 2.2 and JAX-RS 1.1 
TCK's, which is no small effort.   

2) GSoC - all three GSoC projects were a success from a coding standpoint.   
While none of the three were ready for 2.3.0, we hope to get them into 2.4.0.   
Two of the students have remained active in CXF and continue to work to help 
clean things up in their projects. 

3) User survey - CXF conducted an anonymous user survey to help gauge who our
users are and what interests them to help plan ideas for 2.4.0 and beyond.   
We had over 130 responses and the results definitely were educational to the 
community.

No issues requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache DB Project

Development in the DB project continued over the last quarter:

1) The PMC elected Kristian Waagan as its next chair, pending board approval.

2) Derby approved a maintenance release, 10.6.2.1. Planning has started for a 
10.7 feature release later this year.

3) Derby's 3 summer-of-code projects completed successfully.

4) Tiago Espinha was elected as a Derby committer.

5) JDO published a maintenance release, 3.0.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Directory Project

Community:
   o No new PMC members
   o No new committers
   o Finalization of 2010 GSoC projects
   o Increase in users interacting on our mailing lists -
     qualitatively it seems more users are using ADS/Studio and
     participating on our user mailing lists with various
     issues/shortcomings they're encountering. 

Releases:
   o Nothing since last quarter when the new LDAP API was first released

Summary:
   o What seems like a quiet quarter really had lots of preparatory
     activity for 2.0 releases 
     - skins for site and documentation
     - switch to docbook for (manuals) documentation
     - revamped installers and subproject cleanup (installers and
       daemon subprojects) 
     - interface consolidation refactoring and cleanup in shared
   o Everything seems to be in order and nothing is warranting the
     attention of the board 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Geronimo Project

The Geronimo community has had another active quarter. There have been
multiple releases from the community. The community has been
actively working on Geronimo 3.0, which will support Java EE 6, and
has made significant progress running against the Java EE6 TCK. In
addition, the community is preparing for releases from our 2.1.x and 2.2.x
server branches.

RELEASES 

* aspectjrt, aspectjweaver, derby, sxc, and woodstox bundle components 
  were released,
* Tomcat, transaction/connector component were released,
* maven-eclipsepde-plugin was released
* JavaMail providers and merged mail jar was released
* Annotation, JAXB, and EJB 3.1 spec jars were released

JUGS and CONFERENCES

A Geronimo track has been planned for ApacheCon.

New Committers:

* Hong Fang Han (Janet)

New PMC Members:

Four new members joined the Geronimo PMC:
* Ming Xia (Forrest)
* Lei So Wang (Rex)
* Xuan Dai (Delos)
* LinQuan Jiang (Shawn)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Hadoop Project

Hadoop status report for July 2010 to October 2010

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and
managing distributed applications running on clusters of commodity
computers.

The 2rd annual Hadoop World was held on 12 October in NYC. It had 900
attendees.  before the conference. The program is available here:
http://www.cloudera.com/company/press-center/hadoop-world-nyc/agenda/.

The divestiture of sub-projects has continued. We have promoted Hive,
and Pig to be top level Apache projects and Chukwa to the
Incubator. This has had the positive effect that the majority of the
current PMC is involved in the core projects (Common, HDFS and
MapReduce).

The Hadoop PMC removed one member, who has completely dropped out of contact:
* Jim Kellerman
and as part of moving subprojects out, the following PMC members resigned:
* Alan Gates
* Ashish Thusoo 
* Daniel Dai
* Namit Jain
* Olga Natkovich
* Pradeep Kamath

The tension between Cloudera and Yahoo has dramatically increased this
quarter and is past the breaking point. This was exacerbated by the
board's sudden insistence that the Hadoop project pick a new PMC chair
without discussing the issues with anyone other than the Cloudera
employee sitting on the board. Over the last 2.5 years, I've done my
best to do what was right for the Hadoop project and it is too bad the
community has degenerated to the current state. I sincerely want to
get the problems resolved so that we can get back to developing
software and enjoying a community that can work together.

Critical issues for the Hadoop PMC to address:
  * Change is difficult and this will involve change.
  * We need to enact bylaws so that there is a clear understanding of
    the rules.
  * The PMC needs to define and document the goals and processes that the
    project will follow going forward.
     * Expectations about committers reviewing each other's patches
     * Expectations about becoming a committer and PMC member.
     * Policies about expecting PMC members and committers to stay
       involved. People without skin in the game who vote without
       working on the project are just signing up other people for
       work.
  * Poisonous people within the project need to be managed.
  * Cloudera's abuse of the Hadoop trademark in their product names needs to be
     halted.

Three GSOC students completed their projects successfully. This
resulted in significant new functionality being added to the project,
and some renewed interest from a contributor standpoint. Two of the
three students have indicated that they are interested to continue
working in the community.

The discussion to move ZooKeeper to TLP status has been reopened and
is in progress at the time of this writing.

Feedback and community involvement has been slowly increasing, we
frequently meet with users during Hadoop meetups and hold site visits.

Attachment I: Status report for the Apache HBase Project

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD'S ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

We made three releases over this period: a new patch release of our 0.20 branch
-- this is our current 'stable' offering -- and two 'developer
releases' from TRUNK
named 0.89.DATE_OF_RELEASE (See [1] for more on what our
'developer releases' are):

* July 30th, 2010: HBase 0.20.6 released
* August 9th, 2010: HBase 0.89.20100726
* October 5th, 2010: HBase 0.89.20100924

TRUNK is currently under feature freeze as we stabilize before cutting
a 0.90.0 release candidate in the next week or so (0.90.0 will be the
version of our next major release [1]).

COMMITTERS

We added no new committers this period.  We proposed a contributor
who has made > 20 quality patches but he declined our offer.

COMMUNITY

HBase had a respectable showing at Hadoop World, October 12th [2].  The
night before we held our first NYC user group meeting which was well
attended [3].

Mailing list traffic is about constant with this period last year in
the user mailing list, though September traffic was up by about 50%
over last year.

Our Google Summer of Code student completed his 'table snapshot'
assignment -- hbase-50 -- though it is yet to be committed.

There has been healthy debate up on the mailing lists around what will be
included/excluded in our next major release.

Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Hive Project

Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Hadoop.  It provides SQL to
query and manage data stored in Hadoop in table and partitions and
provides a metastore to metadata information about the data stored in
hadoop.
 
Hive became a apache TLP on 2010-09-22. So, it has a new PMC.
 
Releases:
0.6.0 branched and we are priming up to release it pretty soon.
 
New PMC:
    Namit Jain (Facebook)
    John Sichi (Facebook)
    Zheng Shao (Facebook)

New committers:
  All the above PMC members.
 
Community:
* 217 contributors (commented, filed bugs or contributed to Hive).
  This was 164 at the last report time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Things are going well, with no apparent need for Board intervention.  Marcel
Offermans has joined the Incubator PMC, which is the only change in PMC
composition.

During the discussion of the Alois project, there was extensive and good
discussion about real-time communication versus the ASF's requirement that
decisions be made on mailing lists.  Similarly, there was discussion
about -dev and -user mailing lists for Incubator projects.  Finally, in
terms of Apache Way discussions, there was further discussion of why NOT git
until (and if) the ASF Infrastructure Team provides it.

There was discussion regarding process for how patches might be accepted,
e.g., posted to JIRA, reviewed on mailing lists, CTR, RTC, when a CLA is
necessary.

Alois, log collection and correlation software with reporting and alarming
functionalities, has begun Incubation.

Gora, an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache
Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop, was voted for Incubation.

You can also say "hello Kitty" (sorry, it had to be said) to Kitty: a
lightweight, production-class Java application server performance diagnostic
& administration utility.

We've also discussed Celix, which is intended to be an OSGi like
implementation in C with a distinct focus on
interoperability with Java-OSGi, but there needs to be follow through if
they want to Incubate.

SocialSite, for which a code grant was never received, has been locked and
put into dormant state.

The Imperius community has been making little to no progress towards
graduating, despite repeated nudges from their mentors.  Unless there is
progress prior to its next board report, a recommendation has been put forth
to stop the incubation process for Imperius.


----------------------------------------------------------

= Ace =

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to centrally
manage and distribute software components, configuration data and other
artifacts to target systems. ACE started incubation on April 24th 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring board or Incubator PMC attention.

Community

There have been active conversations about how to best document building and
running ACE as we're finalizing the transition to Maven. Several committers
of ACE will be present and talking at ApacheCon NA 2010.

Software

Toni has done initial testing with Maven 3, making some changes to the build
system to support it. Premek Brada, a researcher and software engineering
lecturer at University of West Bohemia, Czech Republic, has been researching
component compatibility methods and their applications to industrial
technologies, in particular OSGi. He is considering donating software to
analyze changes in code and what their impact should be on versioning
changes.

Licensing and other issues

None at the moment.

Things to resolve prior to graduation

Make a release. Grow the community some more.


= ALOIS =

ALOIS stands for "Advanced Logging and Intrusion Detection System" and is
meant to be a fully implemented open source SIEM security information and
event management) system.

ALOIS is incubating since 22nd September 2010.

Things that are already done:

 * Enabled Mailinglists for ALOIS
 * Enabled JIRA for ALOIS

First steps todo will be:

 * Create user accounts - CLAs are on file
 * Prepare source code for public (review code, add licensing and more
comments)
 * Ensure required libraries/dependencies are available for public
 * Publish source code to Apache infrastructure
 * Publishing internal bugreports to https://issues.apache.org/jira/


= Bluesky =

BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008. It is an e-learning solution
designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education
between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.

The team is improving RealClass -- one of the two major subsystems of
BlueSky -- meanwhile we will discuss the next version of RealClass which
would related to web browser.

 * committed QT version of Tserver;

next step:

 * To cut down the code quantity, replace Tserver with QT's lib, especially
the communication part;
 * Gradually commit the source code of modified DTU/Teacher/Student;
 * Discuss the next version of RealClass;


= Chemistry =

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in Java,
Python, PHP, JavaScript (and possibly other languages). Chemistry entered
incubation on April 30th, 2009.

Issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 * First non-Java release (PHP, Python).

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

 * None.

Community development since the last report:

 * None.

Project development since the last report:

 * A first release of the Java subproject (OpenCMIS 0.1) was done.
 * Work to refine the Java APIs continues.
 * Continued work on the draft browser binding (JSON protocol) in the
sandbox.


= Chukwa =

Chukwa is a distributed log collection and processing system built on top of
Hadoop. Jiaqi Tan has been voted to be a committer by Chukwa community.
Chukwa is transforming to use HBase for storing data to reduce data latency,
the existing data collection on Hadoop and map/reduce is still supported.

Chukwa entered incubation on August 5th, 2010.


= Empire-db =

Empire-db is a relational data persistence component that aims to overcome
the difficulties, pitfalls and restrictions inherent in traditional Object
Relational Management (ORM) approaches. Empire-db is on the Apache Incubator
since July 2008.

Issues to address in the move towards graduation:

We still have not tackled the fact that we need to do more advertising of
Empire-db on major development forums/sites/blogs.

Community development since the last report

New names pop up on the user list/jira which indicates a (slow) growth of
our user community.

Project development since the last report

We're trying to work towards a new release before the end of the year as
several issues have been fixed/new features have been implemented.


= Gora =

Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache
Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  Port Gora code and license headers into ASF license headers
  Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with
    injection into existing ASF projects like Nutch and Hadoop
  At least one Gora incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

There was a lot of positive interest from the Incubator community during the
Gora proposal and voting process. Most of the existing Github community is
in the process of moving over to the ASF. Mailing lists were *just* set up,
so we expect the community to continue to blossom as we can now begin to
effectively communicate out in the open.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.

We've got mailing lists setup (INFRA-3017), SVN space (INFRA-3018), JIRA
(INFRA-3019), and Confluence (INFRA-3020) thanks to Henry Saputra. Enis
Soztutar just completed the code drop (see r1006024 and INFRA-3038) and
created GORA-1 to track the issue. Enis also created GORA-2 to track
standing up the Gora website. Enis and Andrzej Bialecki went through the
Software Grant process, which was received and ACK'ed by Craig Russell in
r25057, r25058, r25060, r25061, r25070, r25071, r25072, and r25073 of the
foundation repository. Full steam ahead.


= Imperius =

2010-October Imperius Incubator status report

Imperius has been incubating since November 2007.

Imperius is a rule-based policy evaluation engine based on the CIM-SPL
language from Distributed Management Task Force (dtmf.org).

Communication continues to be intermittent or non-existent.

Things to resolve prior to graduation:
* Grow the community
* Next steps and future of Imperius at Apache.


= Isis =

Isis is an ASL 2.0 licensed implementation of the Naked Objects pattern.  It
is based on contributions of the original Naked Objects Framework along with
a number of sister projects that were developed for the recent book, "Domain
Driven Design using Naked Objects".

Isis was accepted into the Incubator in 2010, September 7th.

Last quarter, we have worked on the following items:

 * Podling setup activities.
 * Collecting the CCLA from Naked Objects Group Ltd for its contribution of
the Naked Objects framework.
 * Collecting all iCLA(s) from all committers (this includes the sister
projects)
 * Setting up SVN committership, Wiki and JIRA accounts for the initial
committers
 * Uploading code from the existing Subversion repositories (residing on
Sourceforge) and converting over the package names and Maven POM
groupId/artifactIds.  At the time of writing this is still in progress
(Naked Objects codebase uploaded, awaiting sister projects to be uploaded).
 * Due diligence on IP clearance progressing

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

 * putting good documentation site out as start-off to building larger
community
 * getting first release out to demonstrate credibility
 * ensuring existing committers all happy with transition to Apache

None of these issues requires Board attention.

Community Development (first report)

 * mailing list got setup and shows increased usage; committers are moving
onto it from the old mailing list
 * first pages being created on Isis wiki, contributions from several in
community
 * interview at http://jaxenter.com/apache-isis-interview-30780.html.
 * session accepted at JFokus 2011 conference, hoping for v0.1 out in time
for that.
 * 2 expressions of interest to contribute on isis-dev

Project Development (first report)

 * imported the SVN history from the old projects into a
''contrib/initial-imports'' area in SVN.
 * performed initial converted over package names and Maven POM
groupId/artifactIds.
 * performed further work refining new module structure and corresponding
DocBook guides to be carved out from existing material
 * Started moving code that has passed IP clearance into trunk



= JSPWiki =

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

Only a few minor bugs were fixed.

No progress in the incubation process. The project still needs to make an
official Apache release.

Things have slowed down the last few months for an unknown reason.  Also the
mailing lists are very quiet.

There is still considerable interest in the project. The developer list
currently has 90 subscribers, no change; and the user list has 195
subscribers, no change.


= Lucy =

Lucy will be a loose port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C
and targeted at dynamic language users.

Lucy was voted into the Incubator on July 22, 2010.

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

 * License issues have been resolved with legal-internal. We are currently
doing a code grant for Kinosearch so that we can move forward with a code
drop. Marvin has already uploaded the code drop to LUCY-122.

Progress since the last report:

 * Software grant prepared. Marvin led the charge and put together a form
email to send out to all the individuals that were part of the grant. Since
there are so many parties involved, there have been many commits in the
foundation repository (e.g., r25096, r25097, r25098, r25099, r25100, r25101,
etc.).

 * We now have confirmed SGAs from all but two of the major copyright
holders and Marvin will contact both of them directly again on Monday
October 11, 2010.

 * Some development discussion regarding FieldType default properties helped
to flush out some Lucy design. Marvin Humphrey, Peter Karman and Simon
Willnauer participated in the discussion.


= NPanday =

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven. NPanday allows .NET projects to be converted into Maven projects thus
allowing them to fully utilize the other technologies driven by Maven.
NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.

The development of NPanday started at Apache on September 8, 2010 when the
source code was successfully imported to
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/.

The issues from the previous issue tracker in Codeplex was also successfully
imported and the new issue tracker for NPanday can be found here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NPANDAY. There has been quite a number
of newly filed issues and a few people have submitted patches as well.

NPanday's development is gearing up for version 2.0. Two branches were
created in https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/branches/ for
the major issues that would be included in the next major release of
NPanday:

 * removal of the uac
(https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/branches/npanday-uac-rem
oved/)

 * support for VS 2010 and .Net Framework
(https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/npanday/branches/npanday-vs2010-
support/)

The NPanday website was deployed to http://incubator.apache.org/npanday/ and
the PPMC has been established.

The top priorities towards graduation are:

 * create initial status file and update incubator web site

 * work through IP clearance and other items from status file

 * work on creating an initial release

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.


= Nuvem =

Apache Nuvem will define an open application programming interface for
common cloud application services, allowing applications to be easily ported
across the most popular cloud platforms.

Nuvem was accepted for Incubation on June, 2010.

The Nuvem Project is slowly getting started. The community is discussing
project Roadmap. We presented at JavaOne 2010 and had a completely full
room. We showed couple demos using Apache Nuvem and we are already seeing
couple people from the session showing up on the mailing lists.

Top things to resolve prior to graduation: Increase the number of active
committers.


= Olio =

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability,
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing a
reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

Things have been fairly quiet on both the user and developer list this
quarter. Olio is being used as part of VMmark2.0 (VMWare's benchmark).

Graduation From Incubation:

Diversity of committers is no longer an issue - we now have committers in 3
organizations.  However, the user base is not showing a strong growth. Since
this is a test application/workload, it is being used as such for short-term
projects.


= Shiro =

Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security framework
that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise session
management and cryptography.

Shiro has been incubating since June 2008.

The team is pleased to report the the Apache Software Foundation Board of
Directors has accepted Shiro's Top Level Project graduation proposal during
their Wednesday, September 22nd 2010 board meeting.  Apache Shiro has
officially graduated from the Incubator to become an Apache Top Level
project!

This will be the last Incubator board report made by the Apache Shiro team
to the Apache Incubator PMC. The process to remove Shiro from the reporting
schedule will be complete by the time the Incubator reviews this report.

The status is being maintained at
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shiro/STATUS


= Socialsite =

Officially dormant.  Will no longer report.


= Tashi =

Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.

The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud
computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data). The
idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that
are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and
computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.

Tashi has previously encompassed just the tools to manage virtual machines
using Xen and KVM, but is gaining the facility to hand out physical machines
as well.

Development activities have included assimilation of adopted code to Zoni
(Tashi's physical machine reservation system), inclusion of support for
controlling APC brand switched rack PDUs, addition of DNS CNAME management,
and bug fixes.

The project is still working toward building a larger user and development
community. User groups have been identified in Ireland and Korea, and the
developers are trying to reach out to them. Connections have also been made
with Georgia Tech.

Items to be resolved before graduation:
        * Prepare and review a release candidate
        * Develop community diversity (currently Intel and CMU committers)


= Thrift =

Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between a variety of
programming languages. Thrift entered the Apache Incubator in May 2008.

 * Thrift 0.3 released
 * Thrift 0.4 released
 * Thrift 0.5 RC currently under voting
 * Graduation process underway, resolution drafted, Bryan Duxbury to chair
the project
 * Anthony Molinaro and Roger Meier granted committership
 * Various build improvements, continued feature development and bugfixing


= VXQuery =

The VXQuery Project implements a standard compliant XML Query processor. It
has been in incubation since 2009-07-06.

Recent activities:

 * progress has been slow due to the small team/community size and external
commitments of the current developers

Top issues before graduation:

 * Increase development speed
 * Build community (developer and users)
 * Create a release


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Jakarta Project

Jakarta status report, October 2010. There are no issues requiring board
attention at this time.

* General

After a couple of rounds of discussion, we decided to move two subprojects
which were in maintenance mode i.e. no new development was planned, to the
Apache Attic: Jakarta ECS and Jakarta ORO. We have asked the Attic PMC to
take over and as a result, we will no longer include a status on these
subprojects in future board reports. Most of the tasks associated with these
Attic moves have been completed.

We elected one new committer this quarter, Milamber, based on his
contributions to the Jakarta JMeter subproject.

* Releases
  - None

* Subproject news

* BCEL
Couple of mailing list posts. Some code cleanup done by Mark Thomas this
quarter.

* BSF
No notable activity this quarter.

* Cactus
Few posts to the mailing lists. Stefan Bodewig made some build changes to
allow building via Gump.

* ECS
Moved to the Apache Attic in this quarter.

* JCS
Some user list posts but no development activity this quarter.

* JMeter
Mailing list activity continues as usual. Improvements and minor bug fixes
to the code continue.

* ORO
Moved to the Apache Attic in this quarter.

* Regexp
No activity - maintenance mode.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache JAMES Project

=== JAMES Status Report: Oct 2010 ===

The Apache JAMES Project delivers a rich set of open source modules
and libraries, written in Java, related to internet mail  which build
into an advanced enterprise mail server.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

We are currently get ready to release a milestone of the imap library.
The same is true for the protocols library. Both are currently in the
VOTE process. After the VOTE will (hopefully) pass we will concentrate
on getting JAMES Server 3.0-M1 out of the door. We expect to cut it
within the next 2 weeks.

GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE

Tim Erwin Mundt was able to successfully complete a Maildir
implementation for our mail store. His work was committed to trunk.

COMMUNITY

We add one new Committer and one new PMC Member since the last report:

* Tim Erwin Mundt (Committer)
* Eric Charles (PMC)

Tim was voted in after his work on Maildir (which was part of GSOC)

RELEASES

We did no releases in this quarter, but as said above there are
currently 2 in the VOTE process.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache jUDDI Project

jUDDI is now a TLP project which consists of the combination of jUDDI and Scout.

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3)
specification for Web Services.

Apache Scout is an open source implementation of the JAXR implementation.

We are currently migrating the project resources to our new home at
juddi.apache.org. We are working on another maintenance release for
jUDDI. Other then that no news.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Mahout Project

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The project is in "code freeze" leading up to a final 0.4 release
planned for this week. The 150 issues resolved for this release
can be viewed here:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?
  pid=12310751&fixfor=12314396

As of 0.4, the project will still be in a state of significant
change and evolution. We still plan an 0.5 release in 6 months
before contemplating a 1.0 release. However we believe the project's
code base is beginning to stabilize, as relatively more effort is
going into code cleanup, tests, polishing, removal of stale code.

Judging by volume of mailing list messages and diversity of senders
we have reason to believe usage of Apache Mahout is beginning to
significantly expand.

NEW COMMITTERS

Sebastian Schelter was elected as a new committer in recognition of
work on distributed recommender implementations.

GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE

Mahout completed its GSoC projects. Two did not complete due to lack of
student participation. Two completed successfully. One remains in progress.

MAHOUT IN ACTION

The book "Mahout in Action", published by Manning, has reached 15/16
chapters complete and will soon enter final review.

PROJECT BRANDING

We've reviewed the Apache Mahout home page (http://mahout.apache.org)
just this week, per the e-mail request regarding branding.

Project committer Robin Anil is addressing the following issues in
this regard:

- Add standard www.apache.org links to navigation
- Ensure "TM" is used appropriate in names and logos
- Add a DOAP file (we are having issues with the generator but that
  can be taken up offline)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Maven Project

Maven Board Report - October, 2010
---------------------------

* General Information

 Most significant news this period is the final release of Maven 3.0 was 
 released on October 8th. 
 In the week since the release, no major issues have been reported against the

Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache MINA Project

Releases
--------

Three releases has been made since the last board report
MINA 2.0.0, a major milestone for the project and one that's been
worked on for a significant time.
Vysper 0.6, the XMPP server subproject. A release with some
significant new features.
FtpServer 1.0.5, The FTP server subproject, a bug fix release

Community
---------

* The GSoC student, Bogdan Pistol, did a successful project and was
later voted in as a committer

Development
-----------

* Work is ongoing on the first bug fix release on the MINA 2.0 branch.
No major new features are planned for 2.0.x, these efforts are instead
going into 3.0. Lots of design discussions on 3.0 are currently
happening. The HttpComponents project, which currently have a NIO client
implementation, has also shown interest in collaborating on the design
of MINA 3.0
* All MINA sites has been redesign to a more modern look and feel
* The MINA user guide has been significantly updated together
with the MINA 2.0.0 release.
* Vysper development has calmed down but new features are continuously added.
* FtpServer development is still fairly slow with focus on bug fixes
* SSHD development is also mostly based around user reported features and bugs.

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Nutch Project

=== Nutch Status Report: October 2010 ===

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

In September the project released a 1.2 release from the stable branch.

Nutch trunk has been merged with the so called "nutchbase" branch,
which constitutes a major architectural change - Nutch storage layer
uses now an object-relational mapping API called Gora (currently
undergoing incubation), with implementations for SQL databases, HBase
and Cassandra. This means that data collected and processed with Nutch
becomes now available to all third-party tools that can work with
these storage frameworks. The merge is complete now and bugfixing
continues, with the goal to reach a 2.0 release some time during Q1.

Additional branch was created with a snapshot of codebase before
merging the Gora framework, but which includes other refactoring and
delegation of functionality to external projects (such as Tika and
Solr). The purpose of this branch is to allow for some level of
backward-compatibility with Nutch 1.2, though most efforts now
concentrate on the trunk.

COMMUNITY

Markus Jelsma was voted as a new committer.

Andrzej Bialecki gave a talk on "Integration of Solr with crawlers:
Nutch, LCF and Aperture" at the Lucene Revolution conference in
Boston. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache ODE Project

== Status ==
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

== Release ==
No release to report this quarter. We should have a 1.3.5 or 1.4 release
in the next quarter.

== Development ==
Most development efforts have been put into JPA refactoring (driven by
Jeff Yu) and several bug fixes and improvements. Next steps on the road
map are: Finalizing the JPA refactoring, solving backward compatibility
issues (i.e. supporting evolution of OModels and runtime states) and
backporting features (extension activities, process context) from our
experimental branch.

== Community ==
Veresh Vain has been voted as a new committer.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

A few releases are in the works.  A 3.0.3 release is pending.  This branch is
fixes only.  The anticipated 3.1.3 release is up for a vote now and includes
new features and fixes.  After the 3.1.3 release, the 3.1.x branch will
likely go to minor fixes and enhancements as 3.1.x development has slowed
since the 3.2.x branch started.  A 3.2 beta release is hopefully not too far
off.

Java EE 6 certification efforts continue in the 3.2 branch and in concert
with Geronimo and OpenWebBeans.  Things are largely feature complete with
regards to EJB 3.1.  Work on CDI integration with OpenWebBeans is
progressing.

The project welcomes Andy Gumbrecht, Ivan Xu, and Thiago Veronezi who have
been voted in as committers.  As well Jean-Louis Monteiro and Kevan Miller
have been voted into the PMC.  Dev list traffic is up and user list traffic
is down over the last quarter.  User list traffic, which had been steadily
increasing over the last two years, dropped to half in May and has stayed
there over the last quarter.  It's our guess that this is in reference to
Nabble.

A significant percentage of the user list traffic has come from Nabble over
the last two years or so.  It has recently come to our attention that Nabble
often does not deliver messages to the lists, yet still shows them in their
website as part of their "OpenEJB" forum.  The result has lead some users to
think they were being ignored.  I find Nabble's misrepresentation of their
service and the impact on users perception of the project to unacceptable.
Either they are an archive with posting capability or they are separate forum
with its own separate support community.  I have done an audit of the months
missing threads that only show up in their false representation of our
archives and sent them a message asking for the corresponding Message-IDs.
No response so far.  I will continue pushing the issue with them.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

There are no items requiring board attention at this time.

Highlights

OpenJPA made two maintenance releases: 1.0.4 and 2.0.1. 

OpenJPA has decided to stop support of JRE 1.5 starting with 2.1.0,
so the last release that supports 1.5 would be the 2.0.x series.

Community

We're implementing a plan to give more users write access to the
wiki to encourage contributions.  The hope is that contributors to
the wiki will become committers over time.

Mailing lists continue to be very active, with an average of close to 250
messages per month on the dev alias and approximately 150 messages per
month on the users alias.

OpenJPA continues to experience a modest increase in email subscriptions and
activity. There are about 150 subscribers to dev and over 240 to users.

Governance

There have been no changes to the committer or PMC rosters;
a vote is underway for a new committer.

We continue to monitor contributors for possible committers and committers
for PMC members.

Releases

The project released OpenJPA 1.0.4 which implements JSR 220, 
and OpenJPA 2.0.1, which implements JSR 317.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache PDFBox Project

Apache PDFBox is an open source Java PDF library for working with PDF documents

General Comments
----------------

There are no issues that require Board attention.

Community
---------

There is a steady stream of contributions and bug reports from the
community.
Two of our committers will soon become Adobe employees through an
acquisition. Adobe is the creator of the PDF format, so we see this as
an opportunity for PDFBox.

Releases
--------

We are preparing for the next release 1.3.0. Jukka volunteered as release manager.

Development:
------------

PDFBox 1.3.0 will again include a lot of improvements and bugfixes:

- JPEG2000 support
- improved font encoding (CID, CFF-fonts) when extracting text
- made the parser more lenient handling out of spec pdfs
- improved text extraction
- as the additional CMAP files from Adobe are now published under a
more suitable license (BSD), we were able to include them directly in
svn instead of downloading them as a part of the build process (see
LEGAL-36)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Pig Project

Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a
high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled
with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient
property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to
substantial parallelization, which in turn enables them to handle very
large data sets.
 
As of September 22, 2010 Pig became a TLP. Prior to this move Pig was
a subproject of Hadoop. The vote is in progress for the proposed
by-laws: http://wiki.apache.org/pig/ProposedByLaws.
 
In August, Pig held its Second Contributors Workshop attended by 10+
developers. We have discussed a wide range of issues including use
cases, new features, upcoming releases, and changes to the process.
 
Releases:
* Branched for Pig 0.8.0 release. Expected to release in early November.
 
Community:
* 485 subscribers to user mailing list (452 in the last report)
* 197 subscribers to dev mailing list (191 in the last report)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache ServiceMix Project

Status report for the Apache ServiceMix project - September 2010 (Missed
2010-09-15, resubmitted for 2010-10-20)

Project Status
--------------

We continue to have an active community with high levels of participation
from users on mailing lists, IRC, and issue reporting in Jira.

No issues for the board to consider.

Community
---------

* Voted and accepted Dan Kulp as Comitter
* Chris Custine assumed role as PMC Chair


Community Objectives
--------------------

We are currently working towards a release of ServiceMix 4.3.0 and
associated
dependencies. This will be the primary objective for the next quarter.

We are actively pursuing new methods of maintaining our static web site as
well as documentation for each release. Page naming limitations of
Confluence
make it difficult to maintain multiple versions of documentation for fix
releases and historic reference.

Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Shindig Project

Apache Shindig is an Opensocial Reference implementation in wide use by
both social networks and enterprise software.  Shindig graduated from the
Incubator in January 2010.

The Shindig PMC has no issues that require board attention

COMMUNITY

 * New committers Gagandeep Singh, Bastian Hofmann and Han Ngyen
 * We started using a dedicated external hudson host for doing Shindig
   builds and testing.
 * Diversity level of committers has gone up overall.  New committers
   from IBM and vz.net have expanded the projects base.

RELEASES

 * 2.0.0 released September 9, 2010
 * 2.0.1 maintenance release in process, expected to ship October.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Shiro Project

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:
- In the few weeks since graduating from the Incubator, we haven't yet
 released a new version, although we plan on making our first TLP release
 (version 1.0.1 or 1.1) in the next month.

Community & Project:
 - No new committers or PMC members
 - All project migration issues are complete and http://shiro.apache.org
  is up and running.
 - Community interaction and user list traffic is growing steadily after
  graduating from the Incubator.  Google Analytics reports that our
  web site has received about a 40% average increase in site visitors
  after going TLP.
 - Significant new features are slated for 1.1 later this month, notably
  improved salting support for authentication tokens and a much-improved
  JNDI-based LDAP realm for using LDAP for authentication and authorization


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

The Struts team released Struts 2.2.1 as GA in August, but otherwise
the quarter was a very quiet one, with little other activity within
the development community.

The Struts zone was deleted as part of the overall infrastructure
changes, but the Struts team elected not to replace it with a jail
since the zone had not been utilized for some time. We added a new
moderator for our security alias, with the goal of improving our
responsiveness when such issues appear.

Nils-Helge Garli Hegvik (nilsga) elected to go emeritus this quarter.
There have been no other changes to the team.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

Work on Tapestry 5.2 has accelerated, with a goal of a GA release in Q4.
The first alpha release, 5.2.0, was released in August, and the first beta
release, 5.2.1, in October.

In addition, we've voted in another committer, Josh Canfield.

Quite a bit of effort has been expended moving documentation from individual
Tapestry modules (in Maven's documentation format APT) and onto the Tapestry
Confluence wiki.

Howard Lewis Ship presented _Apache Tapestry: State of the Union_ as a
birds-of-a-feather session at JavaOne in September.

Mailing list activity has been steady, running at 1100 - 1500 messages per
month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Tcl Project

Massimo continues to work on improving Rivet, and has been fixing up
the Debian packages.  Others have contributed patches to ensure that
RPM's can be built.

Not much other than that.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache Tika Project

Releases
=========================
Progress towards an 0.8 release continues. There has been some recent
activity by Jukka Zitting [1] towards allowing for easily using Apache Tika
in environments requiring Compressed RTF / TNEF / LZFU parsing. Along these
lines a broader discussion [2] of how to use Apache Tika with parsing
libraries that are GPL-licensed ensued and it was determined that plugins
could be developed and hosted externally (e.g., at Github) and used with an
official Apache Tika release from the ASF just by dropping the plugin jars
onto a deployed version of Apache Tika's classpath. This provides a great
solution for folks who want to use Apache Tika in environments where they
need to parse formats which require non-ASLv2 friendly libraries.

We've had some nice documentation updates occur since the last report as
well. Arturo Beltran contributed a "get Tika parsing up and running in 5
minutes" quick start guide in TIKA-464 [3]. Nick Burch also added
documentation on the Container-aware Tika detection capabilities in TIKA-477
[4]. Paul Jakubik started a great wiki discussion on container-based
Metadata formats in [5], the first major use of the Tika wiki [6]. Chris
Mattmann has since done a bit of reorganizing of information, adding the
Tika logo to the wiki as well.

Other various notable development items include an RSS Feed Parser (TIKA-466
[7]) from Julien Nioche and Chris Mattmann, Container-aware Mime Detection
(TIKA-477 [4]) from Nick Burch, Jukka Zitting et al., and various Charset
improvements (e.g., TIKA-471 [8] and TIKA-529 [9]) from Ken Krugler.

Tika's website is now hooked up to SVNpubsub thanks to Jukka Zitting [10].

One of the blockers to the 0.8 release, getting NetCDF pushed to Maven
Central, has seen some good progress as of late. Chris Mattmann has created
a space for the NetCDF jars in the Sonatype OSS free hosting area that is
synced to Maven Central [11].


Community
=========================

There have been no new Tika PMC members or committers elected in this
quarter.

A podcast for Tika recorded in April 2010 between Chris Mattmann and Rich
Bowen was posted on the Feathercast.org website and mentioned on the Tika
mailing lists [12].

The Tika community was consulted for two website updates. The first site
update was to post a link and image of the Tika in Action book [13]. The
second site update was to allow for the selection of search engine provider
used to search the Tika website [14].

Tika In Action
==========================
Chris Mattmann and Jukka Zitting are writing a Manning book called "Tika in
Action", and it is progressing steadily. We are currently doing our 2/3 book
review and Chapters 1-5 of the book are now available [15] through Manning's
Early Access Program or MEAP.

Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Traffic Server Project

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the boards attention.


Community
=========

The community has added one new committer since our last report, Igor
Galic has joined as a committer. We are seeing continued increase in
mailing list traffic as well as IRC chat room.

Apache Traffic Server was presented at OSCON 2010.  We got some very
positive feedback about the software and the progress we're making with
our community building efforts.

A proposal for a Bylaw is being developed, and discussed on the dev@
mailing list.


Releases
========

We have made three releases since the last report:

    v2.0.1 - Primary a security release, to improve DNS resilience.
    v2.1.2 - Same DNS fixes, and a number of other improvements.
    v2.1.3 - Fixes for the cache corruptions introduced earlier.

v2.1.4 is expected to be released soon, which we hope will be the final
release before the next stable release, v2.2. Detailed descriptions of
all releases are available on our website.

Finally, we are very excited to announce that support for intercepting
(aka transparent) proxy has landed on trunk. This is currently only
supported on the Linux platforms.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project

The Apache Web Services project contains a collection of software primarily
relevant to XML/SOAP/WSDL Web Services.

== Releases ==

* XmlSchema 1.4.7 (September 27th)
* WSS4J 1.5.9 (October 3rd)

== Community ==

Three new PMC members were elected - Dan Kulp, Colm O hEigeartaigh, and
Sagara Gunathunga.

We've been doing some cleanup, and several inactive PMC members have gone
emeritus.  We expect several more in the coming months.

There was a great suggestion by Dan Kulp to try to pull the somewhat
fragmented community together by merging all the individual subproject -dev
lists into dev@ws.apache.org, which is in process.  Benson Margulies is in
the midst of cleaning up our long-neglected website.

jUDDI has been promoted to TLP and is outta here, and we're still discussing
the disposition of the other subprojects.  One thing we've just arrived at is
that perhaps the full-on Attic isn't necessary when we retire things, esp
since we already have an "archive" area for old projects in our SVN.  We
should probably still have an Attic web page at least, but conversations
about this are ongoing (and we need to bring the Attic community into those).

We want to pull the "commons" projects up to be normal sub-projects ASAP, so
that's under discussion even if we end up retiring or promoting a couple of
them in the coming months.

We're all looking forward to a leaner, meaner Web Services project with a
more functional community.

== Subprojects ==

Current subproject descriptions follow, but no particular subproject news
below means nothing specifically requiring the board's attention this quarter.

* Apache Woden

Woden is an open source Java implementation of the W3C WSDL 2.0 specification.

Now that Sagara is on the PMC, moving this forward will hopefully be somewhat
smoother.  He doesn't have too many cycles lately, however, so it would be
nice if we could expand the active committership here.

* JaxMe2

JaxMe 2 is an open source implementation of JAXB, the specification for
Java/XML binding.

* Apache WS-Commons

Apache WS-Commons is a collection of projects that are primarily used as
parts of various WS projects but useful even outside the WS space. WS-Commons
houses Apache Axiom - the streaming XML object model, Apache XmlSchema - an
object model to manipulate XML schema documents, Apache Neethi - the
WS-Policy implementation and various other smaller projects such as tcpmon.

See "Community" above re: dissolving commons.

* Apache Muse

Apache Muse is a Java implementation of WS-ResourceFramework,
WS-Notification, and WS-DistributedManagement. It provides code generation
tools and APIs that aid users in creating standards-compliant interfaces for
manageable resources. Muse-based interfaces can be deployed in a J2EE or OSGi
environment.

Muse is still pending final discussion, but is 99% certain to end in our
archive/the Attic.

* Apache XML-RPC

Apache XML-RPC is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a popular protocol that
uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure calls.

* Apache WSS4J

Apache WSS4J is a Java implementation of the OASIS Web Services Security
(WS-Security) from OASIS Web Services Security TC.

See above re: new release - steady work here.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

There have been no releases this quarter for Xalan-C or Xalan-J.

There has been a small to moderate amount of activity on the project's mailing
lists.

There was a dispute over licensing terms for a patch that a user provided,
which has been resolved. The PMC will be deciding whether or not to accept
this patch. Details may be found here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XALANJ-2438


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

The community around XMLBeans remains the same, traffic seems steady
on the mailing list, and people are asking lots of questions while
others are answering them timely. Number of check-ins is getting
lower, due probably to the fact that XMLBeans is a stable technology
and also due to the summer time.

There were no new committers, changes to the PMC or any other issues
requiring board’s attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache Subversion Project

This is an out-of-band report to the Board, to ensure that the Board
is aware that we have released Apache Subversion 1.6.13, on October 1,
2010. This release is under the pre-Apache copyright notice and
license, and the primary download point is at tigris.org. We have also
placed the (signed) tarballs on archive.apache.org for long-term
archival storage (where we have also duplicated all pre-Apache
releases).

Subversion 1.7.0 will be our first release under the Apache banner,
with the appropriate copyright header, licensing, and standard release
location. We expect to branch for the release by the end of this year,
with the actual release occurring 30-60 days after that.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

Apache Harmony are not scheduled to report to the Board on this cycle,
but given recent events are choosing to file a brief report.

There are two recent issues that The Harmony PMC would like to bring
to the Board's attention.

 - Oracle's definitive statement on the TCK dispute

The VP of JCP is expected to report on the details of the recent
statement made by Oracle during the last EC meeting, regarding Apache's
request for the Java SE JCK.  The statement is a direct challenge to
Apache Harmony achieving its goal of becoming an independently
implemented certified Java SE implementation.

The Apache Harmony PMC are discussing the implications in private at
the moment since Oracle's statement is not yet public.

 - IBM's indication of future participation in OpenJDK

Within the last few days IBM have issued a press release stating that
OpenJDK will be their primary location for open source Java SE
development.  It is unclear how this will affect the IBM sponsored
PMC members and contributors to Apache Harmony.

Approximately half of the Apache Harmony PMC members, including the
PMC Chair, and half of the committers who have made a change within
the last six months are recognized to be IBM employees.

The Apache Harmony PMC will continue to keep the Board abreast of
significant project events.


------------------------------------------------------
End of minutes for the October 20, 2010 board meeting.
