 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       Thanks to all who helped put on another successful ApacheCon.
       I talked to a number of folks there who very much appreciated
       ApacheCon as a place for them to meet.

       The board has published several Java-related statements in the
       past month.  We restated our support for the Harmony project in
       the light of IBM's reduced involvement.  We expressed our
       pleasure at being re-elected to the Java Community Process
       (JCP) Executive Committee, but also our concern that we might
       be forced to soon leave the JCP if Oracle does not start
       honoring its agreements there.

    B. President [Jim]

       The 2 main events from the last month have been ApacheCon NA 2010
       and the growing interest, publicity and notice regarding our thoughts
       regarding the JCP, the EC and our continued involvement therein.

       Regarding the former: From what I heard and experienced, most of the
       attendees were quite happy with ACNA2010. Trainings seemed somewhat
       less well attended than previous years, but the sessions themselves
       seemed quite crowded. Also, the general agreement was that the content
       was some of our best. While at ACNA2010, I talked with many reporters
       and analysts regarding event #2 (the JCP). As expected, some of the
       details got lost or misrepresented, especially regarding some of the
       finer points of the issue, but these were quickly corrected. It will,
       of course, be interesting to see how all this pans out.

       I have contacted Karen Sandler regarding drafting a consultant
       agreement for our EA. The first draft was delivered on the 12th and I
       am working some final details on that draft to return to Karen.
       Basically, it's in clearly specifying that the EA will be a
       contractor and not a part-time employee.

       While at ACNA2010, I was asked to speak at Georgia Tech regarding Open
       Source and "The Apache Way". The presentation was during a computer
       engineering class and was quite well received. It was also good since
       it reinforced the fact that the whole concept of "open source" still
       needs external advocacy. Most of the students simply knew about the
       GPL and associated the ASF with the web server only; that is, only
       a very surface understanding of FLOSS!

       This week I will be attending the SC10 Conference in NOLA. The ASF is
       sharing a booth with The Linux Fund. Sally will also be at the ASF
       booth with me.

       I attended the #infra working lunch-and-meeting at ACNA2010. Topics
       included the support for git (as mentioned in the infra report) as well
       as preliminary budgeting for next year.

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

 8. Discussion Items
 
    A. Brand Management budget for graphic designer to improve our image. 

    There are two issues: First, our main graphic mark, the feather, needs major
    work to make it suitable for many purposes: web, print materials, 
    and branded items. Second, the new cms-based web site is live but needs
    continued attention. 

    Roy suggests that a competition is usually the approach for an open source
    project to get graphic design help. 

    Shane agreed to plan and run a competition but if not successful would
    like to pay for the services of a graphic talent.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Roy:    Update /dev with rule that invitation only dev meetings are OK,

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

Focus has been on one subject since the last report, namely the 
upcoming JCP EC vote on Java SE 7 and 8.  In addition, I'm 
pleased to report that the ASF has been ratified for another
term on the EC with a large show of support of the voters.

There has been a bit of interaction with the press on this subject
and overall, we've done well handling it.

We've put out a public statement regarding the ratification of the
EC seat, as well as a call to action for the EC regarding the 
vote for Java 7 :

https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/statement_by_the_asf_board1

The vote has started today (Tuesday, November 16, 2010) and I 
plan to :

1) Vote 'no' with an explanation of why
2) Engage the press on our 'no' vote and explanation
3) Write to the EC as a whole and provide a clear explanation/review
   of our position, mainly for those that are new to the EC or 
   simply confused by the complicated nature of the dispute (as well
   as the calculated FUD).  I'll also publish this statement publicly
   as well.
4) Prepare a statement for publication for either possible outcome
   of the vote.

I also plan to do some personal blogging on this matter, and will make
it clear it's not the position of the ASF.

This has been a long and arduous journey for all of us, and I've been 
honored to be able to serve the foundation in this manner.  Thanks to all 
for the support over the years.  It hasn't been boring :)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

One board-level request: potential funding for graphic designer (Discussion).

Volunteer graphical design energy is historically difficult to find and 
especially keep active.  Hiring/contracting a part time graphical designer 
could go a long way to improving the public image of our websites - both 
a.o and project websites.  Key tasks: making a.o style actually look good; 
producing a proper set of feather image variants (including ones for 
inclusion on TLP pages); offering graphic design service to projects.   

Operations And Community
========================

Some positive reactions to the Branding Requirements have come back from PMCs, 
as well as a few discussions and improvements.  Next step is to publish 
Trademark Policing Procedures to committers@ next month, so that all 
committers are aware of what to do about trademarks.  Awareness of trademarks,
both in general and allowable uses, seems to be widely varied across committers.

I will contact projects about including the branding checklist in their 
quarterly reports until each project is updated.

Discussed upcoming marks actions with several PMCs to get project feedback 
on various third party uses.

Discussed many branding issues at ApacheCon with a variety of PMC members, and 
also with some external analysts.  Requested RedMonk to assist on branding 
strategy as part of our existing engagement.

Working with Subversion PMC to normalize trademark policy; they still have 
their legacy trademark policy from pre-Apache time posted.

External Requests
=================

Contacted third parties about the use of our Solr mark on their websites.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

SPONSORSHIP

IBM is officially a new gold sponsor.  We are working to process the invoice 
on their end by having us setup us up as a vendor and answer legal questions
around the sponsorship.

FuseSource is a new bronze level sponsor.  We are generating an invoice for
this as well so that they can move forward.

I did not send updates to sponsors as I mentioned in the last report. The
activity around ApacheCon consumed a lot of time and want to move forward on
updating sponsors on what is going on.  I expect to move on this in the
coming month, and have begun identifying sources of information to send
sponsors.  I also plan to create an unstructured text file in subversion.

DONATIONS
We have about 1.5 months left for individual donations for this year...
the thank you letters are good, but we aren't positioned to really push this.

OTHER FUNDRAISING
The new website launched, and I made a few updates to the thanks and other 
pages after this transition.  I like that updates happen quickly, though I
feel like there is a bigger need to work through some of the structural and
content changes to the fundraising pages since the site is less 
navigation-driven.

Writing out documentation in SVN of the fundraising tasks including W-9 
forms, non-profit status, process for thank yous, list of contacts, etc....

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

STATUS:

I. Budget: we produced new promo stickers, badges, and a retractable vertical
banner, and also purchased a flat screen monitor, all used at ApacheCon and
the upcoming SC10 conference; all items were shipped using the ASF's FedEx
account. We've successfully used Sam Ruby's ASF credit card for production
expenses and to purchase the monitor.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally Khudairi has been working
with Serge and Greg on Sponsorship-related matters. 

III. Press Releases: we issued the following press releases over the PR 
NewsWire service:

- 6 October 2010 ApacheCon Announces Keynote Presentations by Thought Leaders
  Dana Blankenhorn of ZDNet, Daniel Crichton of NASA Jet Propulsion
  Laboratory, and Bob Sutor of IBM Corporation
- 20 October 2010 The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache Maven
  Version 3.0

We received two requests to issue a press release:

- the new release of Mahout v0.4. We reserve formal press releases for major
  version releases (e.g. 2.0, 3.0, etc.), and so blogged the news as a "The
  ASF Asks:" top-level snapshot on the project which was also forwarded to the
  ASF media/analyst lists.

- the upcoming BarCamp in Sydney, Australia. Doing so is to recognize the
  sponsorship provided by Sydney University; this will likely take place in
  the form of a joint announcement. To reach our target audience of attendees,
  we will be posting event details on the ASF blog, announce@ list, and
  Twitter feed. We'll also likely Tweet a few updates pertaining to sponsors,
  additional details, etc..

IV. Informal Announcements: the following announcements were distributed to
our dedicated press/analyst list (only; not PR Newswire), as well as posted on
the ASF blog and Twitter feed:

- 20 October 2010 Media Alert: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache
  Maven Version 3.0
- 21 October 2010 Statement by the ASF Board on recent Java-related events
- 29 October 2010 Read Beyond the Headers
- 3 November 2010 The ASF asks: Have you met Apache Mahout?
- 6 November 2010 Apache News Roundup from the ApacheCon Show Floor
- 9 November 2010 Statement by the ASF Board on our participation in the Java 
  Community Process

The "Did You Know?" Twitter campaign continues to go strong, with many people
stopping at the ASF booth during ApacheCon and commenting "I didn't know
that!". We're still seeking success stories -- please forward to Sally at
press-AT-apache-DOT-org.

V. Media Relations: we have been actively working with The Register, IDG,
ZDNet, the Bitsource, Linux User, and eWeek to coordinate interviews with Jim
Jagielski and Geir Magnusson. The ASF blog on ComputerWorld UK continues, with
the addition of Isabel Drost to the list of bloggers.

We've been tweeting/promoting Feathercasts as they've become available. Sally
would like to support the Feathercast effort by bringing in some of the
responsibilities in-house, and will discuss options with Rich Bowen.

VI. Future Announcements: No press releases are planned at this time.

VII. Analyst Relations: we are following up with Gartner Group, as they've
issued their "Top 10 Computing Trends for 2011" (Cloud Computing remains at
the top of the list for the second year). Michael Cote, James Governor, and
Stephen O'Grady of RedMonk have been supportive and offered insight on several
Java-related incidents over the past few weeks. Cote attended ApacheCon,
participated in the Media Training, had several in-depth briefings on Apache
TLPs and Incubating projects, and has produced write-ups on Apache Mahout and
libcloud. James Governor has been promoting the benefits of ASF Sponsorship to
an array of Apache-centric companies. Aside from proactive outreach with
press-oriented news, no additional direct analyst activity has taken place
during this timeframe.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: we've actively pitched the conference on Twitter and
the  announce@apachecon.com list. Sally oversaw promotion with the conference
PR firm and managed the day-to-day outreach. We secured 7 media partners to
help spread the word and received excellent press coverage during and
post-con. The team worked with Rich Bowen to produce Feathercast interviews to
help promote tracks, with participation from Nick Burch, Marcel Offermans, and
Sander Temme. Both Sally and a member of the conference PR team manned the ASF
booth for the duration of the conference. In addition to overseeing event
promotion, Sally served as conference program chair, secured the keynote
speakers, and performed general MC activities. We have begun discussions on
ways to improve marketing efforts for the 2011/Vancouver conference.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison:

- 7-8 October: Lucene Revolution/Boston we were offered complimentary expo
  space (via ConCom); Glen Daniels, Shane Curcuru, and Sally staffed the
  booth. The event was commercially-focused (although the backbone of the
  talks were technical in nature); several attendees were curious as to why we
  were physically there, but pleasantly surprised to see us. Also, Sally
  connected with new Sponsors Basis, and had several fundraising-focused
  discussions with interested individuals and organizations.

- 13-19 November: Supercomputing (SC10)/New Orleans we will be sharing a
  booth with the Linux Fund. Sally will be there with support from Jim
  Jagielski.

- 11 December: BarCampApache Sydney, in cooperation with ConCom. We will be
  issuing a joint announcement with Sydney University to support additional
  outreach tactics to promote the event.

X. PR Newswire account: we have 10 pre-paid, flat-rate press releases
available through 30 April 2011.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

No issues requiring board attention.

TPAC in Lyon, France came and went without any change in status of the
proposal to offer the HTML5 specification under a more liberal license.

HTML5 continues to progress towards a Last Call in May of 2011.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Three JIRAs created, zero closed.  Mostly this has been a steady state
(similar number being opened and closed), will watch to see if this is an
anomaly or if we will start to accumulate a backlog.

Larry and Karen fielded some trademark questions.  I'm not seeing any signs
that the split between Branding and Legal Affairs is causing any confusion
(it had in the past).

Miscellaneous discussions include JXTA/JXSE (which uses and older version of
the Apache License) and Fair-use data in SVN.

Much discussion regarding Harmony and the state of the JCP, one concrete
outcome of that was a blog posting entitled "Read Beyond the Headers".

I've not proceeded as promised on expanding the Legal Affairs committee or
documenting processes, mostly due to travel and lack of time.  I still
intend to follow through on this.

Legal Affairs approved of the signing of the agreement with Google regarding
Apache Extras.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For October 2010: There continues to be a steady stream of reports
of various kinds arriving at security@apache.org.  These continue to
be dealt with by the security team.

4      Support question
2      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
6      Vulnerability reports of which
       2      Vulnerability report [couchdb, via security@couchdb]
       2      Vulnerability report [tomcat, via security@tomcat]
       1       Vulnerability report [httpd]
       1       Vulnerability report [shiro] CVE-2010-3863 [CLOSED]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

We specced and ordered an Opteron-based Dell R515 machine
for virtual machine hosting- cost ~ $12.5K.  A FC card was
thrown in (for reuse of the decommissioned helios array)
at no additional cost.

Chris Rhodes was given root@ karma.

We held a team meeting on Monday Nov 1 during ApacheCon.
Highlights were posted to infrastructure-private@.

Daniel Shahaf was made a member of the Infrastructure Team.

www.apache.org was converted to the CMS with new templates
and stylesheets provided by Chris J. Davis.

HP has offered to supply our replacement servers for SARA.
Tony Stevenson is leading this conversation, as it could save
us roughly ~$30K from our budget.

Discussed the fact that Apple has EOL'd Xserves while we just
recently racked a donated pair of them.

Renewed the service warranty with Dell on baldr (jails) for 1y.

Plan drafted on what it would take for Git to be able to be
used as a project's primary source code repository. Currently
dependent on volunteers driving the effort.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

Gavin has been unable to send in a proper report due to connectivity issues.
We'll do a full report for the board next month.

As a quick update in the mean time, we had 13 TAC recipients at ApacheCon
(the 14th was denied a visa so unable to attend). All the recipients seemed
to have a good time, and pleasingly almost all seemed much more confident
and happy to engage with other committers by the end. The organisers also
seemed happy with the work put in by the TAC recipients to help with the
conference.

A meeting was held after ApacheCon to discuss how the process has worked for
ApacheCon plus the two recent retreats, and how things should work into the
future. Minutes will hopefully be circulated shortly for wider discussion,
then we can hopefully draw up a policy for how+when we can support smaller
events.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Abdera Project

Abdera continues with a fairly quiet low level of activity.

There have been no releases this quarter but a number of patches have
been submitted and a new release to get those out is now underway.

We voted in one new committer however so far he has been unable to get
approval from his employer to sign the ICLA. There have been no PMC
member changes.

The user list has a small steady stream of user posts, often which get
answered by other users or developers.

There are no board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Ant Project

Ant Status Report - Nov 2010.

o Release Status

Core
---------
Ant 1.8.1 was released on May 7th, 2010 and remains the current
release. Some initial discussions
regarding Ant 1.8.2 have taken place but there is nothing firm at this time.

Ivy
-------
Ivy 2.2.0 was released on October 7, 2010

Ivy-DE 2.1.0 was released on Aug 20, 2010.

o Code Donations

Ant has voted to accept the Bushel project code to become part of Ivy.
Stefan Bodewig is
shepherding the code through the Incubator.

There has also been some preliminary discussion about whether Ant
would sponsor the EasyAnt
project through the incubator.

o Community

No issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Buildr Project

We made two releases in the past 3 months, Buildr 1.4.2 and 1.4.3, both
containing a number of bug fixes and minor enhancements.

We also voted one new committer (Peter Donald) and one new PMC member (Antoine
Toulme), bringing us to a total of 8 committers and 6 PMC members. The project
team remains very diversified with no committers affiliated to the same
commercial organization.

User and dev mailing lists are healthy, we're seeing sustained adoption and
contributions from the community.

In terms of marketing, there was a Buildr presentation in September at JavaZone
2010 and there's a repeat planned in January at the San Francisco Java User
Group. (Unfortunately, we had no representation at ApacheCon.) We also set up a
new Twitter account to mirror questions asked on StackOverflow and we continue
to use our Twitter account and CoTweet to follow comments made about Buildr on
the Twittosphere.

There are no current plans to make another release before the end of the year,
although this may change based on user/developer motivation and discussion.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project

Notable changes since previous report (September 2010):

  No project activity since the last report.

Future plans:

  I'm considering stepping down as chair of stdcxx. I haven't had
  time to spend on the project or to help interested contributors
  become committers. Unless another committer steps up willing to
  take on the responsibility stdcxx might need to be retired.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Cassandra Project

Cassandra is a distributed database combining the best of Google's
Bigtable and Amazon's Dynamo.

--Highlights--

The ApacheCon Cassandra/NoSQL track went extremely well, with great
talks that often saw standing-room-only attendance.  The Cassandra
meetup at ApacheCon also saw a good turnout.

Cassandra got a lot of positive attention recently when Digital
Reasoning announced that the US Government has a 400 node Cassandra
cluster.

--Releases--

0.6.5, 0.6.7, 0.6.8
0.7-beta2, 0.7-beta3

0.7-final is taking longer than expected, primarily because of some
corner cases of the new schema modification code.  While we work out
those last details, we've branched 0.7 so work on new features for the
next major release can proceed in parallel.

--Community--

Cassandra has been getting a lot of positive attention at conferences,
including JavaOne, CME, Oredev, Devoxx, and NoSQL Japan, as well as
ApacheCon.

We have no new committers since the last board report, but we do see a
long tail distribution of contributions from the community -- we
recently passed the 100-person mark of contributors who have had at
least one patch accepted.  With luck we will be able to help some of
these move towards becoming a full committer.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Click Project

Apache Click is an easy-to-use page and component oriented Java web framework.
There are no board level issues at this time.

Infrastructure
-------------------
No issues

Development
------------------
Currently working up a new Apache Click 2.3.0 release candidate.

Community
----------------
Mailing list traffic has been lighter than usual.

Some committers now returning from other commitments.

Henning Schmiedehausen and Will Glass-Husain who helped with the
project incubation are now going emeritus on the PMC.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

There have been no new releases or development. Traffic on users list is
steady, with mostly silence on the development list.

Started the process of identifying active PMC members. By last count we
have 11 active PMC member, 17 members who have not responded/decided,
and following 21 PMC members became emeritus:
   Ard Schrijvers        Arje Cahn              Bertrand Delacretaz
   Carsten Ziegeler      Christian Haul         Felix Knecht
   Giacomo Pati          Helma van der Linden   Jeremy Quinn
   Jeroen Reijn          Jorg Heymans           Marc Portier
   Marcus Crafter        Ralph Goers            Ross Gardler
   Simone Gianni         Steven Noels           Timothy Larson
   Torsten Curdt         Ugo Cei                Upayavira

Branding guidelines have not been implemented yet. Preliminary conclusion though
is that project website is compliant with "Project Website Basics", "Project
Naming And Descriptions" and "Project Metadata" sections; need to be updated to
include links in "Website Navigation Links" section, and has no trademark
attributions as per "Trademark Attributions" and "Logos And Graphics" sections.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Community Development Project

Status report for the Apache Community Development Project

Project Status
--------------

The Community Development is progressing well, although a little more slowly 
than some would have hoped.

The planned mentoring project has still not been formally launched. Largely 
due to the loss of the labels module in JIRA which was previously used by 
projects to indicate issues appropriate for mentoring. An alternative will 
be put into place very soon.

Work on a project to provide hosting for Apache related software projects is 
progressing. Legal documents have all been signed, draft usage guidelines and 
a FAQ are available and PMCs have been contacted to reserve project names.

We have taken ownership of party@ mailing list (no changes in usage are 
proposed).

Google Summer of Code completed - thanks to all involved. It is noticeable 
that once again we have failed to generate any press (we never produced a 
press release for press@).

We applied for the Google Code-In (Google's contest to introduce 
pre-university students to the many kinds of contributions that make open 
source software development possible) but were, unfortunately, unsuccessful.

Ross Gardler has spoken at a reasonably large number of events around Europe 
addressing two key themes - The Apache Way and Innovation at the ASF.

No issues require board attention at this time.

Community
---------

An increasing number of volunteers are becoming engaged with Community 
Development PMC and contact from external participants is increasing (although 
still low).


Objectives for next period
--------------------------

- Gain support from at least 5 PMCs for the mentoring programme
- Formally launch mentoring programme
- Launch hosting facilities for Apache related projects 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project

Below are the important events that happened in the project since August.

Releases
--------

No releases since the report in August.

Development
-----------

Development activity has been very quiet this quarter. Some work on
distributed build continues on trunk.

Community
---------

Continuum project name is reserved on apache-extras.org

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.

Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Hadoop Project

    Hadoop status report for October 2010 to November 2010

    Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and
    managing distributed applications running on clusters of commodity
    computers.

    Discussions have started on the issues that the board identified; we
    seem to have a general agreement on some issues, but we need an official
    consensus on the proposals, and have them discussed openly in the public
    mailing lists.

    Specifically:

    * Everyone is in general agreement that we need to release more often.
      The question revolves around how we test them to ensure they keep to the
      quality that Hadoop releases are known for.

    * The discussion of having 'mentors' to help guide new committers was 
      started.

    * The Cloudera branding issue was forwarded to the trademarks group, where
      Shane & Karen are deciding how best to pursue the issue of their
      certification courses and branding on their website.

    * Bylaws have been discussed on general@

    * Owen will be the release manager for the 0.22 release schedule later
      this month.

    * The ZooKeeper project has voted to become a separate TLP. This has been
      raised for the board's consideration.

    * people have started using reviews.apache.org to discuss patches

-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

Community
---------

Ranier Jung was added to the PMC roster.  Sander Temme organized a track
of httpd content and a well attended httpd meetup on various topics related
to the state of httpd at this past ApacheCon.  A large majority of active
httpd committers were in attendance.

Branding
--------

The http://httpd.apache.org/ site should now entirely conform to the current
guidelines.  Corrections are welcome to the PMC list.

Subprojects
-----------

httpd activity has picked up during the ApacheCon face time.  The project
is very nearly at a 2.3.9 tag on the development branch, and there has been
a great deal of activity in the docs@ effort.  2.2.17 and 2.0.64 were both
released since the last report.  This is registered as HTTP Server and as
httpd at apache-extras.

mod_fcgid was released the first week of November on a short voting cycle,
in order to put a security fix out to those administrators who allow the
authoring of fastcgi apps by untrusted users.  This is registered at
apache-extras.

mod_ftp was tagged; after one month there are insufficient votes for a new
release.  Interest by at least three PMC members will be evaluated in this
coming period.  This is registered at apache-extras.

libapreq has reemerged from its cocoon and is actively soliciting the correct
license assignment for outside world/vendor patches, in anticipation of
a new release candidate.  This is now registered as both apreq and libapreq
at apache-extras.

mod_mbox is enjoying some resurgence of patch activity.  This is registered
at apache-extras.

Three http://httpd.apache.org/modules/ references, to mod_pop3, mod_snmpd
and mod_arm4 appear to be abandoned; these were never released, and are not
registered at apache-extras as it appears that the authors or any champions
could consider moving the code there.  Over the coming period the project
will consider their fate (to the attic, or to apache-extras if they enjoy
even one advocate).

mod_python references and dist files have been removed, with a single pointer
remaining to the attic.  Releases persist at http://archive.apache.org/ and
this has not been registered at apache-extras, to allow fewer developers to
restart this effort in that context.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache HttpComponents Project

Status

Overall the project remains active.

Releases

HttpCore 4.1-beta2 was released on the 1st of September

HttpClient 4.0.3 GA has been released on the 19th of September, as an
emergency release following the 4.0.2 release on the 10th of September

HttpComponents LICENSE and NOTICE maven plugin 0.0.1 was released on
the 5th of November to support the future releases of the main artifacts

Community

We've voted in Jonathan Moore as a committer

Ortwin Glueck (Odi) has decided to go Emeritus. We thank him for all his
work on the HttpComponents project, and wish him luck with his future
endeavours.

Development

The new HTTP caching module is being improved to add a file system based
cache implementation


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

There are no issues for the Board.

New PMC Members: Hadrian Zbarcea, Isabel Drost, Siegfried Goeschi, Mohammad
Nour El-Din (pending his acceptance).  Henning Schmiedehausen has left the
PMC.

Infrastructure has proposed that the Incubator switch over to the new CMS.
It seems that early next year will be the timeframe.

The PMC has voted to submit OODT for TLP status.  Congratulations to the
project.  Kitty, Celix and Stanbol have been voted to start Incubation.

  - Kitty: lightweight Java application server performance diag & admin
utility
  - Celix: OSGi-like C implementation with focus on interoperability with
OSGi
  - Stanbol: software stack and set of components for semantic content
management

Jena, a semantic web framework in Java, is currently being discussed.
Bertrand and other have discussed coordination amongst the semantic content
projects: Clerezza, Stanbol and Jena.

We also found strong support to start an android-interest mailing list to
help build a critical mass of developer support for Android-based projects
at the ASF.

Finally, based on prior discussion with the Board, and the benign results of
subsequent experiments, the Incubator is discussing looser rules for
projects to vote on their own Committers.

Missing reports: Droids, HISE, Stonehenge

  - Droids appears to have no activity since September.  People asking
questions are not getting answered.  Perhaps the project should be
mothballed.
  - HISE has some activity, although October was quiet.
  - Stonehenge appears to have been dead since July, when it made a
milestone release, and is discussing being archived.  There appears to be
disappointment over the perceived disappearance of Microsoft and WSO2.

An e-mail has already been sent to start the discussion of mothballing or
otherwise handling these projects.

-----------------------------------------------

= ALOIS =

ALOIS stands for "Advanced Log Data Insight System" and is meant to be a

= Amber =

Amber is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v1.0, v1.0a and v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows
users to authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources
they control while avoiding the need to share their username and password
credentials.

The most important issues that must be addressed before graduation are:

 * attract new users and developers
 * making a release

The Incubator PMC / ASF Board should be aware that:

 * community activity is very low and committers/mentors have been quite
dormant lately

How has the community developed since the last report

 * No change

How has the project developed since the last report

 * A couple of issues on spec-api have been fixed.
 * Site has been prepared and is being published.
 * Amber has been presented at latest Apache Retreat in UK, a couple of
people talked about possibly contributing OAuth v2.0 implementation.
 * Work being done on signature-api to fix RSA algorithm.


= Bluesky =

designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education
between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.

Current status of developing the next version of RealClass: * Learning QT
network API, and tried to encapsulate it into new class * Testing
Video/Audio/Screen encode/decode API of FFempeg, including sending and
receiving, this job had almost been done; * Making UI of new system, ongoing
next step:

* Finish message parse and socket plus encode/decode class before Dec 1st *
Finish UI design and commit UI code in 2 weeks


= Chukwa =

We're mostly marking time. We have a dependency on HBase, but their latest
version broke some things we rely on. Waiting for them to fix, (which they
are scheduled to do) pending a Chukwa release. People are still supplying
bug fix patches. We're also still adding documentation.


= Clerezza =

Clerezza (incubating since November 27th, 2009) is an  OSGi-based modular
application and set of components (bundles) for  building RESTFul Semantic
Web applications and services.

There are currently no issues requiring board attention.

Recent activity:

 * First real life usage with heavier load, leads to significant performance
improvements and to the fix of stability issues (Performance test results
are available in issue CLEREZZA-348).
 * Removed jersey code from triaxrs (license conflict with CDDL 1.1 and GPL
2)
 * Interaction with the Jena team on TDB was already happening, with Stanbol
and Jena coming to the Incubator there's a very promising ecosystem for
Clerezza.
 * Summary about clerezza architecture written (CLEREZZA-334)
 * Improved User documentation

Next steps:

 * Make our first release
 * Voting for logos and website theme
 * Add documentation and tutorial to website

Top 2/3 Issues before graduation:

 * Improve our website with tutorials and "getting started" content.
 * Prepare some easy-to-run demos to get people interested in Clerezza.


= Deltacloud =

providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In addition, it
consists of a number of implementations of this API for the most popular
clouds.

Infrastructure:

    * Hudson configured to trigger build after commit
(https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/apache-deltacloud-core/)

Latest activity:

    * Deltacloud API was proclaimed as stable and version 0.1.0 was released
    * A new EC2 driver for Deltacloud API (in review process)
    * Client improved to be more stable
    * Deltacloud API is now Ruby 1.9 compatible

Current issues:

    * Support for buckets (streaming)


= Droids =

DID NOT REPORT.


= Gora =

Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache
Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

 1. Port Gora code and license headers into ASF license headers
 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with
infection into existing ASF projects like Nutch and Hadoop
 3. At least one Gora incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

The community is slowly migrating over from Github. Mailing lists activity
is mainly from Gora committers and mentors, though we have fielded a user
question or two since the last report. Enis sent a link regarding the
spring-data framework, a NoSQL solution from the Spring community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.

Work has effectively begun at the ASF. An Apache Forrest-based website has
been stood up (GORA-2) at http://incubator.apache.org led by Enis Soztutar
and Henry Saputra. Andrew Hart contributed a logo for GORA in GORA-3.
Andrzej Bialecki has been leading the development of several Gora backends,
including Ehcache (GORA-13), JDBM2 (GORA-14) and Solr (GORA-9). Other
bugfixes and development discussions (e.g., GORA-12) have been churning
along (with contributions from Dogacan Guney and others. The project's
development is moving forward.

A software grant was recorded on October 5, 2010 and Chris Mattmann set up
the initial Gora Incubator tracking status page at
http://incubator.apache.org/projects/gora.html in GORA-10.


= HISE =

DID NOT REPORT


= Isis =

Isis is an ASL 2.0 licensed implementation of the Naked Objects pattern.  It
is based on contributions of the original Naked Objects Framework along with
a number of sister projects that were developed for the book "Domain Driven
Design using Naked Objects".

Isis was accepted into the Incubator in 2010, September 7th.

Project Development (month 2 of incubation):

 * All code now uploaded (including sister projects); code now building.
 * Worked on Maven website, stubs for documentation; first-cut
logo/branding; site now building.
 * Initial site uploaded (some issues still outstanding here).

Community Development (month 2 of incubation):

 * Mailing list shows increased usage from previous month.
 * Wiki starting to get some useful content.
 * Vangjel Stavro showed interest in contributing to Wiki documentation.
 * A number of new individuals have expressed an interest in contributing in
various areas... no contributions yet, but hopeful.
 * Informal "spreading the word" and introducing others to what is Apache
Isis and what it can do for their software development at ApacheCon 2010.
 * Lightning talk scheduled at LJC OpenConference, Nov 2010.
 * Session accepted at REConf 2011 conference, on
the Isis "BDD Viewer" (Concordion integration).
 * Got permissions to create Hudson build jobs for Apache Isis, expected to
be finalized maximum by the end of this month November 2010.

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation:

 * Putting good documentation site out as start-off to building larger
community.
 * Getting first release out to demonstrate credibility.
 * Ensuring existing committers all happy with transition to Apache.

None of these issues requires Board attention.

New Releases

 * There is currently no incubator release yet.


= Kitty =

Brand new, and just getting started.  Podling setup has begun (mailing list
creation, svn, jira, web site, etc.), but is not yet complete. Hope to see
the Kitty community going real soon.


= Libcloud =

Libcloud is a unified interface into various cloud service providers,
written in Python. Libcloud joined the Incubator on November 3rd, 2009.

Our last major release was 0.4.0 on 12 October 2010.

Over the past few months we have accomplished:

 * Code cleanup, including removing Zope dependencies
 * New driver for !ElasticHosts
 * Bug fixes and improvements for GoGrid, EC2, Linode, Slicehost, and
   RimuHosting.
 * Sandbox creation, hosting the Java version

Documentation is still currently lacking, and a refresh of the website is in
order. Both will facilitate new driver contributions and project adoption.

With the introduction of a Java counterpart of Libcloud, many questions
arise on the direction of the project as a whole.  Initially, library and
API development were one in the same in Python, but with interest in other
languages (Java, Ruby, etc), we need to determine how to best establish
standards so to provide some sort of consistency between languages.

The direction and formation of a polyglot Libcloud will likely be the final
hurdle before graduation.


= NPanday =

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven. NPanday allows .NET projects to be converted into Maven projects thus
allowing them to fully utilize the other technologies driven by Maven.
NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.

The top priorities towards graduation are:

 * create initial status file and update incubator web site
 * work through IP clearance and other items from status file
 * work on creating an initial release

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.

There were a couple of issues filed by some new users and they've also
submitted patches.

The two major issues that are highlighted for the 2.0 release were merged
into trunk.


= Nuvem =

Apache Nuvem will define an open application programming interface for
common cloud application services, allowing applications to be easily ported
across the most popular cloud platforms.

Nuvem was accepted for Incubation on June, 2010.

The Nuvem Project is slowly getting started. The community is discussing
project Roadmap. We presented at ApacheCon 2010 in the community track with
a good number of attendees.

Top things to resolve prior to graduation: Increase the number of active
committers.


= PhotArk =

Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application
including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access
control layer, and upload capabilities.

 * PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008.

 * Issues before graduation :
  * PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have
grown the community to the minimal 3 independent committer size required for
graduation and have been seeing slow but continuous interest in the project.
The community started discussion graduation and based on mentors feedback we
are going to recruit couple committers before we start the graduation
process.

 * PhotArk community members are working on the M3 release which
incorporates GSoC contributions.
 * PhotArk project was featured in ApacheCon with a talk from Avdesh in the
Tuscany Track.


= SIS =

Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users
can use to build applications containing location context. This project will
look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities,
services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further,
the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level
community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores,
REST-ful interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under
the Apache umbrella.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

Not at this time

Community progress since the last report

The SIS community elected Nga Chung as an SIS committer on September 1, 2010
in recognition of her contributions in SIS-3. SIS'ers need to follow up
after the meeting with ESRI to determine if they are interested with
participating in the community. Much of the other activity continues to be
from the mentors and committers.

Project progress since last report

SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.

There has been a wealth of development activity over the past month in
preparation for the 0.1-incubating release. Chris Mattmann proposed to be
the RM for the release, and has pushed out 3 release candidates so far,
addressing comments from the IPMC community. As it stands today, the SIS
0.1-incubating rc #3 VOTE is set to pass around 7pm PST tonight. The initial
version of SIS 0.1-incubating includes the ability to load data from GeoRSS
(SIS-19 and SIS-22), a REST-ful location service (SIS-16), and a demo JSP
file in the WAR webapp that shows the SIS point-radius and bounding box
queries using a Google Maps search interface (SIS-15, SIS-18 and SIS-23).


= Stonehenge =

DID NOT REPORT

= VCL =

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.

Community Involvement

    * The Apache VCL user community continues to grow. We really need to get
more committers. We have asked on our development list for more people to
get involved and also individually contacted people encouraging them to get
involved, but are still having trouble getting people on board.

Plans for next Release

    * We announced our second release through ASF on Oct. 5th
    * We plan to reduce the number of items to go in to the next release in
hopes of decreasing time between releases.

Top Issues Before Graduation

    * Continue to increase contributors from multiple institutions


= Whirr =

Whirr provides code for running a variety of software services on cloud
infrastructure.

Whirr was accepted into the incubator on 11 May 2010. Status information is
available at http://incubator.apache.org/projects/whirr.html.

Progress since the last report: We have made an initial 0.1.0 release and
the second 0.2.0 release is being voted on this week. We continue to get
contributions from outside the initial committer base, and have added one
committer (Adrian Cole). Whirr is being covered at industry meetups (e.g. at
Devoxx later this month). The website and infrastructure are all up and
running smoothly.

Plans for the next period:

 * Do a third release.
 * Support the existing services on more cloud providers (beyond Amazon EC2,
Rackspace Cloud Servers).
 * Add more services (probably HBase next).

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

 * Increase community involvement in the project
 * Make several incubating releases
 * Support at least three services on Whirr


= Wink =

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of REST
style web services. The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311)
standard. The project also introduces a client runtime which can leverage
certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink will deliver
component technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of
environments.

Apache Wink has been incubating since 2009-05-27.

Notable Activity:

 * In the process this week of releasing Apache Wink 1.1.2.
 * Asynchronous HTTP client provided by Sonatype contributors
   (Jeanfrancois and Jason), JCDI support, logging debug improvements,
   and general bug fixes were added.
 * Interesting presentation by Luciano Resende related to Apache Wink
   at ApacheCon:
http://lresende.blogspot.com/2010/11/apachecon-session-building-restful.html
 * Voted in Mike Rheineheimer as a PPMC member.  Looking to add more
   committers.

Planned Activity:

 * More Java EE 6 integration
 * Interest from Jeanfrancois to provide support for Atmosphere in
   Wink for asynchronous processing so may add some support here.

Top issues before graduation:

* Build community


= Wookie =

Wookie is a Java server application that allows you to upload and deploy
widgets for your applications. Wookie is based on the W3C Widgets
specification, but widgets can also be included that use extended APIs such
as Google Wave Gadgets and OpenSocial.

Wookie has been incubating since 17th July 2009

Community:

    * the community is slowly diversifying but we need to see more active
contributions from new people before graduation. A release will help in this
regard.
    * There was a Wookie session at ApacheCon and a meetup discussed
potential for the creation of a widget "portal" solution possibly using
Wookie
    * started process towards first release
(https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WOOKIE/Wookie+First+Release)

Recent activity:

    * removed all previous non Apache-licensed dependencies (removed major
dependency on hibernate)

= Zeta Components =

Zeta Components is a high-quality library of loosely-coupled PHP components.
It has entered incubation on 2010-05-21. The infrastructure is mainly in
place and the project is working in direction of a first release.

Since August 2010:

 * The license / copyright change has been performed
 * Almost all infrastructure is in place
 * A new committer has been voted by the PMC (needs verification from IPMC)
 * Several external contributions have been proposed

The 3 most important issues to be tackled are:

 * Create a release process (in discussion)
 * Perform an initial release
 * Attract more contributors


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache jUDDI Project

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the 
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification 
for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an 
implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR).

- jUDDI converted off Apache WS infrastructure to her own infrastructure. 
The jUDDI website now runs on http://juddi.apache.org.
- jUDDI released version 3.0.4. Some bugs where fixed in the core jUDDI 
code, and the jUDDI-client was extended to support the next item on this list.
- jUDDI is now integrated into the RiftSaw (RiftSaw is Apache ODE running 
on JBoss). Upon un/deployment BPEL processes are un/registered into jUDDI.
- We are working towards version 3.0.5, which should see some enhancement

Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Lenya Project

Apache Lenya is a Cocoon based XML/XHTML content management system.

Issues:

  No board level issues at this time.

Development:

  Further work on editor support.
  Continued development on version 3 architecture.

Community:

  Richard Frovarp presented on the project at ApacheCon NA.

Branding:

  Project Naming And Descriptions : Mostly complete. Need to conduct
    another run through the site to make sure nothing was missed.

  Website Navigation Links : Completed

  Trademark Attributions : Will complete by the end of the year.

  Logos and Graphics : Will complete by the end of the year.

  Project Metadata : DOAP file is updated and correct.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Logging Project

- Community

No new committers this period.  Ralph Goers attended ApacheCON.
There is still consensus to have a project virtual "annual meeting"
to address recurring issues and the PMC chair in a focused manner,
however no agenda or set of proposals was prepared during this period.

- Project Branding Requirements

The project and log4j logos on the project web site have been updated
with TM marks.  The generic logging services content
and log4j-extras content should be updated within the week.
Other content will be updated during their next release
cycle or as implementation period closes.

The log4j logo uses uppercase letters while all other mentions
of log4j are lowercase.  The original vector art was not committed
at the same time as the image and altering or redrawing to use
lowercase letters would appear to be difficult.

- Development

log4j 1.2:

A few bug fixes and enhancements.  To support the pending
Chainsaw release, several log4j "companions" need to have
new or initial releases and log4j 1.2.17 should be released.
apache-log4j-extras 1.1 has had  one release vote and another
release candidate is imminent.  Release votes for the other
companions and log4j 1.2.17 are expected to follow.

log4j 2.0:

Ralph Goers has continued work during this period.

log4cxx:

A log4cxx release that is compatible with Visual Studio 2010 and
that addresses a persistent problem with crashes on shutdown
(particularly with 64-bit systems) is (still) long overdue.

log4net:

Two commits, typical mailing list activity, no progress on NET 4.0
release.

log4php:

Five commits, typical mailing list activity.

Chainsaw:

Chainsaw has been by far the most active development area
again this quarter.  A formal Chainsaw release is hopefully in
sight, but first several log4j "companions" need to be
pushed to their first formal release.

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Pig Project

Pig status report for October 2010.

Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a 
high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with 
infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property of 
Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial 
parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle very large 
data sets.

As of September 22, 2010 Pig became a TLP. Prior to this move Pig was 
a subproject of Hadoop. Project by-laws have been approved by the PMC: 
http://wiki.apache.org/pig/ProposedByLaws.

Pig held its Third Contributors Workshop attended by 10+ developers 
some of them remotely via Skype. We have discussed plans for Pig 0.9 
release as well as issues around user function management. Please see 
the notes here: http://s.apache.org/S4I

Releases:
*In the process of releasing Pig 0.8

Committers:
* Corinne Chandel became Pig committer in the documentation area.

Community:
* 492 subscribers to user mailing list (485 in the last report)
* 196 subscribers to dev mailing list (197 in the last report)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache POI Project

Community
---------
In the last quarter, we haven't added any new committers. One community
member we had been planning to offer committership to has vanished this
quarter, but we'll aim to offer it if they return. One other person has been
submitting several good patches via bugzilla, but not participating via the
mailing lists. Yegor is hoping to have the time to reach out and provide
some mentoring on this front, with a view to committership if all goes well
with increasing their community engagement.

Talks on POI at ApacheCon seemed well attended compared to others in their
tracks, and everyone seemed to enjoy them!

Traffic on the user and dev lists was steady until the 3.7 final release
went out, traffic on the user list since then has risen pleasingly.

Releases
--------
We released POI 3.7 beta 3 in September, then 3.7 final during ApacheCon.
The rough plan is for 3.8 in the summer, and the first beta in the spring
once the fixed-bugs-count is high enough to warrant one!

Branding
--------
Our website was largely compliant with the new branding requirements
already. Some tweaks to navigation titles/links for consistency have been
made, and we're aiming to tweak titles and logos shortly to add TM, now that
3.7 is finished.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Qpid Project

November 2010 Status report for Apache Qpid.

Apache Qpid implements the latest AMQP specification, providing transaction
management, queuing, distribution, security, management, clustering, federation
and heterogeneous multi-platform support and a lot more. And Apache Qpid is
extremely fast. Apache Qpid aims to be 100% AMQP Compliant.

We have no issues to report at this time.

Releases:
- Qpid is at RC1 for the 0.8 release of Qpid, expected to be released soon.
- This release brings support of 0-10 to all brokers and client
- Brings new API's, and many enhancements.

Community and Project
- Chuck Rolke voted into the project as committer
- Steady churn of questions/ activity on users list
- Continued work on the project from the dev community.

No issues to report at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Roller Project

Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based weblogging package that works
well on Tomcat and MySQL, and is also known to run on other servers and
databases.

We're currently working to release a major revision of Roller.
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ROLLER/What's+new+in+Roller+5.0

Since the last report the project has made a second release candidate
available for Roller 5.0 ( http://s.apache.org/apacheroller50rc2). Changes
have been limited to bug fixes and small improvements. Recently some testing
has revealed that the way we include OpenJPA in Roller may cause problems on
some non-Tomcat app servers and we're discussing ways to ensure that Roller
can run on the widest possible set of app servers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

The Apache Santuario project is aimed at providing implementation of security
standards for XML.

It has been a reasonably busy quarter for the project. Since the last board
report, Werner Dittman and Axl Mattheus have left the project PMC (gone
emeritus). A large number of website fixes were reported and fixed in the last
quarter.

Several bug fixes were made for the Java project in the last quarter, including
several important issues such as a JSR 105 classloading issue, a concurrency
problem on some static initialization code, and a fix for a long-standing
problem with DOM parsers that don't intern Strings. A vote was called to
release 1.4.4, but later withdrawn, as a critical issue was reported and it
was decided to address this issue in 1.4.4 rather than wait until the next
release. A new vote has been called to release 1.4.4 and it is anticipated
that it will be released in the next few days.

There has been some discussion on the desired features of a new Java 1.5
release planned for next year. Two significant features would be more complete
support for XML Signature 1.1 and dropping support for JDK 1.4, which would
allow us to take advantage of JDK 1.5 language features and new APIs, such as
the JCE ECC APIs. We intend to continue this discussion and to capture the
requirements for this release in an issue tracking system next quarter.

The C++ project added an additional XML Sig 1.1 extension (X509Digest), added
support for removing References after signature creation and did some work on
the build system. The first Release Candidate for 1.6.0 was released.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Shiro Project

Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security framework
that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise session
management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:
- We are proud to announce that we have made our first release as a
 TLP, Apache Shiro version 1.1.0 on November 1st, 2010.

Community & Project:
 - No new committers or PMC members
 - Community interaction and user list traffic has grown significantly
  since becoming a TLP, with over 400 emails on the user and dev
  mailing lists last month.  This is more than double the average
  monthly traffic we had while in incubation, showing
  continued growth and a healthy community as a TLP.
 - We experienced our first security vulnerability CVE issue.  It wasn't
  handled as appropriately as it should have, with the issue becoming
  public (in a roundabout way) before it should have been made known.
  We dealt with the issue, fixed the source code, and very shortly
  thereafter released version 1.1.0.  This was a bit difficult as this
  CVE issue overlapped with the other issues required for 1.1 and because
  we had not yet released a TLP version, we couldn't simply create a
  point release and just 'get it out the door' quickly.  Instead we
  needed to coordinate the fix in the context of our first TLP
  release, which was a little more challenging.  In any event,
  it was a great learning experience, and we are confident any
  further CVE issues will be handled appropriately.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Subversion Project

The project filed an extra report last month to report its 1.6.13
release and its status as "not quite Apache", along with our 1.7.0
plans which *will* be a true and proper release from the ASF. The
project is preparing a new 1.6.14 release at the time of the Board
meeting, and 1.7.0 is still on track for a release in Q1 of 2011.

In the past month, we have added three new PMC members:

  * John Szakmeister (jszakmeister)
  * Daniel Näslund (dannas)
  * Stefan Fuhrmann (stefan2)

John has been a "full committer" for years, so he has effectively been
on the PMC. His addition this month is simply clearing up the paperwork.

We added one new committer, Johan Corveleyn, to work on an
experimental branch.

At ApacheCon, CollabNet sponsored a Subversion meetup, but the event
saw very few in attendance. The community is trying to determine
better methods of outreach and marketing, and/or whether it is simply
a reflection of Subversion's maturity and lack of "new hotness".

Some discussions have begun recently about usage of the Subversion
(registered) trademark. The community has had a usage policy for quite
a few years and is trying to figure out the right alignment with the
standard ASF policy, and if any policy changes need to occur. There is
significant external usage that has been causing concern, but the
community is also worried about hurting the very people who contribute
most to the project. As is typical, the right answers are not obvious,
and the Subversion project is working with the Trademarks group to
figure out the right course.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Thrift Project

Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

This is Thrift's first report as a TLP project.

Community
We've added one committer, Christian Lavoie, since graduating. In general, 
the traffic on the user and dev lists has picked up nicely. A steady amount 
of work is being done to improve the build system and bring some of the 
lesser-maintained language libraries up to date. There appears to be a 
growing set of users who would like Thrift to be usable natively on Windows.

Releases
We haven't made any releases since graduation, though we have likely 
accumulated enough fixes to warrant an 0.6 release.

Branding
A branding audit has not yet been undertaken.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Turbine Project

Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Tuscany Project

Apache Tuscany, the SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA, is
about to be five years old having being accepted for Incubation on the
7th of December 2005.

Releases in the last quarter have been a milestone release of the 2.x
code and a maven plugin release. There are also two releases with
voting currently in progress, 1.6.1, and 2.0-Beta1.

There has been one new committer made, a GSOC student who continued to
participate after GSoC has finished, and there is a new PMC member
currently being discussed.

The BarCamp day at the Apache Retreat in Hursley had a good Tuscany
turn out and was an enjoyable and useful day for all. At JavaOne there
were a number of Tuscany talks and ApacheCon had 6 Tuscany sessions,
so kudos to all those involved.

Some stats:

370 current subscribers to the user list and during this quarter about
300 emails on the user list.
272 subscribers to the dev list and about 1400 emails in this quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter subscribers are down slightly, emails
are up slightly.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project

== November 2010 Board Report ==

=== Status ===

Another quiet quarter in Velocity land.

The Velocity project currently has no board-level issues at this time.

=== Community changes ===

Antonio Petrelli was voted onto the Velocity PMC.

The Velocity PMC has voted to change the chair from Henning Schmiedehausen to 
Nathan Bubna.

=== General Project news ===

Some fixes to the Velocity site build enable building the site off-line and 
outside the Velocity zone.

=== Velocity Engine project ===

Reorganization and bug-fixing of the engine code continues. We expect to 
release the last version of the 1.x code base soon and then switch to 2.x


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

There have been no releases this quarter for Xalan-C or Xalan-J.

There has been a small to moderate amount of activity on the project's 
mailing lists.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J

The developers have primarily been focused on completion of the XML
Schema 1.1 processor and Schema Component Designators (SCD) support,
with significant work done over the last month in integrating
support for xs:override and the new complex type restriction rules,
as well as making many bug fixes. The SCD and xs:override
implementations were developed by our students during GSoC and will
be featured as part of our upcoming Xerces-J 2.11.0 release which
is currently planned for the end of November. Two of the three GSoC
students from this summer are still contributing to the project. One
has shown an interest in eventually becoming a committer which is
very encouraging.

Xerces-C++

No development activity during the reporting period except for a
couple of bug fixes. Mailing list traffic has been moderate; about
100+ posts on the c-dev and c-users lists since the beginning of
September.

Xerces-P

There was no development activity over the reporting period and no
posts to the p-dev mailing list. Note that Jason Stewart left the
project earlier in the year so Xerces-P is currently without a
maintainer. Theoretically any of the Xerces-C++ developers could
pick this up if they were interested.

XML Commons

A proposal was recently posted to the development mailing list to
complete XML Commons' migration out of the XML project and on to the
Xerces domain. This includes moving the website, download area,
mailing lists, bug tracker (Bugzilla to JIRA) and SVN location. If
no one objects to the plan we would start the process of moving
things over in the next few weeks / months. It has otherwise been
quiet the last 3 months, with a few minor commits and one user
query about upgrading to a newer XML Commons External (i.e. XML
APIs) release.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

These have been acknowledged but for the most part have not been
assessed yet, though can confirm at this time that the project site
is up at xerces.apache.org, has many of the required links and that
up to date DOAP files exist for each of the sub-projects and their
components. Updates to the website to meet any outstanding
requirements will occur gradually.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache XML Project

Quiet quarter, as usual, in XML-land. No issues requiring board
attention, no new releases, no new committers. And no work on the way
forward, that is what happens now that XIndice (where no development
activity is happening, though lists are monitored and questions
answered) is the only project left.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

General Comments

There are no issues that require Board attention. Developer activity
has been rather low for all three subprojects, apart from the FOP work
on Complex Scripts. Java 1.5 has been accepted as the base version of
the platform.

XML Graphics Commons

XGC's Gump builds started causing error reports when the build
infrastructure was moved from sun to openjdk. This is due to a
dependency on com.sun Java classes, especially on the com.sun JPEG
codec. Very recently this dependency was removed, so that the project
builds are successful again.

Batik

There have been practically no changes to the codebase in the last
three months. User list activity has gone down a bit but questions are
mostly getting answers. Gump builds currently fail as well for the
same reason as with XGC. Batik still depends on com.sun classes for
JPEG encoding. This is expected to be resolved soon by adding XGC as a
dependency tor Batik (and thereby reducing code redundancy between the
two subprojects).

Fop

Support for Complex Scripts in FOP is being developed by Glenn Adams,
who is sponsored for this work by Basis Technologies. Completion of
this work will make FOP truly global, as is required in today's world,
but this will take some time. The current phase focuses on Arabic
scripts. Because FOP depends on XGC, its Gump builds failed as well.
With the help of infrastructure, we have realised nightly builds for
FOP. Old Renderer implementations for AFP, PCL, PDF, PS were removed,
to reduce redundancy in the code. Glenn Adams introduced a policy of
no checkstyle, javadoc and ant warnings.

Deployment to Maven repository

With help of a fellow ASF committer the artifacts of the XML Graphics
Commons 1.4 and FOP 1.0 releases were deployed to the Maven
repository, one month after the release of FOP.


------------------------------------------------------
End of minutes for the November 17, 2010 board meeting.
