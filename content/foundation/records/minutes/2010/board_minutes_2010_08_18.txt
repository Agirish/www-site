       The foundation is currently coordinating the appointment of the
       Exec-Officers of the ASF; nominations have been submitted and
       discussions are proceeding. We expect the appointments to be
       performed at next month's board meeting.
       
       Before then, we will be having a semi-formal f2f meeting in
       Boston the weekend of Sept 10th, coordinated by Sally. Thanks
       to Sally, et.al. for setting all this up (and the various polls,
       surveys, etc...).
       
       Finally, we are sorry to see Henri tender his resignation from
       the board. He would be truly a valuable asset to the board but
       we do hope he continues to attend board meetings when he
       can.

    B. President [Justin]

       Things are largely running in cruise-control right now as we
       await the naming of my replacement, but that doesn't mean I've
       been idle!

       I attended OSCON and gave my talk on open-source infrastructure
       on a shoestring along with representatives from kernel.org and
       OSUOSL.  We had lots of great questions from the audience about
       what lessons we've learned over the years - I hope it was a
       good experience for those who attended!

       After our talk, we had a get-together lunch with infrastructure
       people from other OSS orgs (Perl, KDE, kernel.org, OSUOSL among
       others from the oss-infra mailing list).  We traded a lot of
       stories and advice.  Thanks to Google's Shawn Pearce for picking
       up our lunch tab at Red Robin!

       Along with Sally and others, I also manned our OSCON booth and
       got to talk to a lot of people about the ASF.  I find it's always
       fun to talk to people and learn how they are using our software and
       help broaden their understanding of what we're doing.  Our booth
       also serves as a great meeting point for our contributors - so there
       were always people milling around in front of booth.

       Other obligations forced me to cancel my trip to Shanghai to
       keynote the Roadshow, but Aaron Farr was able to step in and
       deliver an "Apache Way"-style keynote at the event.  Aaron has
       posted some pictures from the event on Flickr:
         http://s.apache.org/farra-shanghai-photos

       As mentioned in a previous report, we provided support for
       Bill Stoddard to attend the 2010 Open Source China Open Source
       World Summit.  His writeup is now available at:
         http://s.apache.org/stoddard-china-report

       Sander and I are coordinating with the infrastructure team to
       order replacement hardware for our EU facility at SARA.

       I plan to join the Board face-to-face meeting next month in
       Boston.  See ya'll then!

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

      Apologies for lateness - just coming off of personal vacation time.

      All transactions are booked, but we have a $20 discrepancy.  Current 
      balances are total cash of $496,111.05 at Wells Fargo and $27,519.24 at Paypal.  

       Lockbox checks since the last report was a single deposit of checks totaling
       around $3000 from Network for Good, Car Program, Microsoft Matching Gifts Program
       and Cafe Press.
       
      Tasks Done:
       - all approved bills paid. 
       - wired USD 5250 to UK travel agency as balance for TAC
       - submitted request for automatic extension for US tax return

      In Progress:
       - preparation for FY2010 US Tax filing.  Still working on QB but 
         CPA and I are active on this 
       - find the $20 discrepancy in checking

       Greg asks if there were any problems as a result of the atypical
       changing of the chair. Noirin was given the action item
       to follow up with the PMC.

       Approved by general consent.

    N. Apache Incubator Project [Noel J. Bergman / Doug]

       See Attachment N

       The consensus of the board is that the PMC is responsible for
       the process of adding new committers. The PMC provides oversight
       of changes made by committers, not the use of infrastructure.

       Since no resolution was provided for the board to vote on,
       there is no official board action. Greg was given the action item
       to communicate to the incubator PMC the board's consensus.

       Missing podling reports were discussed. The board would like to
       see some specific action by the incubator when podlings miss a
       report. Norin was given the action item to communicate this to
       the incubator PMC.

       Approved by general consent.

    O. Apache Karaf Project [Guillaume Nodet / Jim]

    R. Apache Perl Project [Philippe M. Chiasson / Roy]

       See Attachment R

       The apparent lack of activity and lack of change of committers 
       and PMC members raised as a concern. The consensus is that there
       are several items that each PMC should report on to the board.
       Action item to work on a standard template for board reports was
       taken by Shane.

    AB. Apache Xerces Project [Michael Glavassevich / Sam]

       Approved by general consent.

    AC. Apache XML Project [Gianugo Rabellino / Shane]

       See Attachment AC

       Should the XML project take responsibility for consolidating the
       web presence of all XML projects? Perhaps, but the projects need
       to be in order before the consolidation, specifically DOAP files
       for each release that is made. Currently there is no guideline
       to update DOAP files as part of the release process, although
       many projects have this in place.

ATTACHMENTS:

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

From a formal JCP POV, another quiet month.  There was a
JCP monthly concall and there's nothing to report.

Tangential to formal JCP activity, Oracle is suing Google
for patents and copyright that they claim are infringed by
parts of the Android stack.  This is relevant to us as 
Google is a contributor to and user of Apache Harmony.

As there is ongoing discussion w/in the foundation I don't 
believe there is anything appropriate to report as VP, JCP
to the board regarding this matter at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

No board-level issues noted.

Operations And Community
========================

Overall it was a very quiet month.

Apache Project Branding Guidelines will be sent to to pmcs@ 
next month; delay due to lack of volunteer time this month.

External Requests
=================

A Lucene subproject approached trademarks@ asking about the 
suitability of their proposed Incubator podling name.  The 
conversation was moved to legal-internal@ to discuss the 
specific legal issues around the name.

An external vendor approached trademarks@ in relation to using 
the Tomcat logo on a button at events; working with concom@ 
to provide an answer since it's event-related.
 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

Sorry for the lateness of the report.

AMD is officially a new gold sponsor (check came).  Some tasks to work
through to finish this off that are in progress.

Matt Mullenweg upgraded from a bronze to silver sponsor. (I hadn't realized
until the check came in as he had only mentioned he was renewing, not
upgrading).

Had a f2f with Greg about getting Yahoo! renewed as a platinum sponsor.  We
also talked about some other ideas of pursuing more bronze sponsors, with
discussion to be started on fundraising@.

We have a face-to-face planned with Sally and Shane in September 10/11 in
Boston.  Few key items: - Figure out what we can do to announce sponsorships
below the a formal press release. - Discuss conferences that I should be
attending or at least aware of ahead of time so I can prepare for when
sponsors will be expecting us. - Discuss licensing merchandise.

I'll be around during the board meeting if there are any questions for me.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

STATUS:

- Budget: we produced new promo cards and a retractable vertical banner
for OSCON, shipped both items to France using the ASF's FedEx account (to
be used at Open World Forum), and have forwarded Sally's travel expenses
for reimbursement for MEAOSS Forum and OSCON. We've successfully used Sam
Ruby's ASF credit card for production expenses.

- Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: the second face-to-face has been
scheduled the same weekend of the ASF Board Meeting in September. Serge
will fly to Boston to join Shane and Sally.

- Press Releases: we issued the following press release over the PR
NewsWire service:

-- 21 July 2010 The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache FOP
Version 1.0 

We received two requests to issue a press release:

-- the upcoming new release of Subversion. We reserve formal press
releases for major version releases (e.g. 2.0, 3.0, etc.), but are able to
blog the news and write a "The ASF Asks:" top-level snapshot on the
project. Both would be forwarded to the ASF media/analyst lists.

-- deltacloud's acceptance into the Incubator. The ASF prohibits formally
publicizing projects that are undergoing incubation (i.e., no press
releases, but the project can blog about it).

- Informal Announcements: the following announcements were distributed to
our dedicated press/analyst list (only; not PR Newswire), as well as
posted on the ASF blog and Twitter feed:

-- 21 July 2010 ASF Director Greg Stein awarded O'Reilly Open Source Award
at OSCON

The "Did You Know?" Twitter campaign is ongoing. We're still seeking
success stories -- please forward to Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org.

- Media Relations: the ASF blog on ComputerWorldUK will kick off before
the end of the month. Confirmed bloggers are Bertrand Delacretaz, Paul
Fremantle, Grant Ingersoll, Gianugo Rabellino, and Greg Stein, with backup
from Nick Kew and Santiago Gala.

Brian Fox participated in a podcast with DZone on Maven 3 (DZone were
media partners of ApacheCon last year; we'll be following up with them for
Atlanta).

We coordinated an interview with Andrus Adamchick and Aristedes Maniatis
on Apache Cayenne 3.0 for InfoQ, as well as several interviews in response
to the Oracle/Google suit with Geir Magnusson, Sam Ruby, and Larry Rosen
for Dow Jones Newswires, Wall Street Journal, and the SF Daily Journal.

We've been tweeting/promoting Feathercasts as they've become available.

- Future Announcements: The press release announcing the opening of
registration for ApacheCon will be issued via PR Newswire this week. The
discussion to launch/promote Apache Extras mid-August has dropped over the
past month and will unlikely be announced prior to US Labor Day. No other
press releases are planned at this time.

- Analyst Relations: James Governor of RedMonk provided a quote for the
Apache FOP press release. No other direct analyst activity has taken place
during this timeframe.

- ApacheCon liaison: Registration opened on 12 August; details on the
Website and registration functionality have been fine-tuned before
announcing on Twitter and announce@apachecon.com on 15 August. Sally is
overseeing conference promotion and has selected a PR firm to manage the
day-to-day outreach (will be announced once Charel's paperwork is signed);
work will begin on 17 August. We're seeking media partners to help spread
the word and have commitment from the Bitsource again this year. Sally
will also be working with Rich Bowen to interview all ApacheCon Track
chairs on Feathercast to help promote tracks/sessions/projects (we're also
discussing formalizing Feathercast's role as an ASF M&P communications
channel.)

- (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison (in partnership with
ConCom):

-- 19-23 July: OSCON/Portland, Oregon – Sally manned the ASF booth with
assistance from Justin Erenkrantz, Leif Hedstrom, Paul Querna, Craig
Russell, and Henri Yandell. Lots of ASFers stopped by to say hello and
lend support. Our new banner and promo cards were forwarded to Emmanuel
Lecharny to be distributed at the Open Source Forum. Greg had a lunch
interview with Gavin Clarke of The Register. Recommend in future that
promo cards be used for direct marketing/mailing purposes and that we
consider distributing t-shirts, tchotchkes, etc. Also, would like to
provide a more interactive experience by running the “Did You Know?”
campaign along with other factoids on a monitor – many attendees stopped
to read parts of the banner, often commenting “I didn't know that!” (in
relation to certain projects and datapoints).

-- 30 September-1 October: Open World Forum/Paris – Sally is coordinating
cross-promotion. Other than a press release issued 2 weeks ago, things
seem rather quiet.

-- 7-8 October: Lucene Revolution/Boston – we've been offered free booth
space (via ConCom) but haven't decided whether we'd like to be there or
not. Sally is in Boston and may be there but is unable to confirm at this
time.

-- 13-19 November: Supercomputing (SC10)/New Orleans – we've been offered
the chance to share a booth with the Linux Fund. Sally will likely be
there and is following up on this; ideally we'll have at least one other
ASF-er there as well.

- PR Newswire account: we have used 8 of the 10 pre-paid flat-rate press
releases on PR Newswire. The remaining 2 releases are available until 6
October 2010. Our additional set of 10 are available until 30 April 2011.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

No board level issues.

The FSF has rejected the proposed W3C license for HTML as not being GPL
compatible.

The HTML5 WG is building a backlog of bug reports, issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Exceptionally quiet month, with the exception of one resolution on
today's agenda.

Routine matters dealing with license headers, trademark due diligence,
incorporating public domain code, and verifying that a specific patent is
covered by our license/Jira/ICLA/CCLA processes.

We reaffirmed that we will not accept custom CCLAs from corporations that
are inclined to treat our agreement as a template.

We have begun to discuss the subject of appointing a General Council.

On the subject of Henri's resignation, he will be sorely missed.  It is no
secret that he was a large part of what effectively is a very small community.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

At DefCon a vulnerability in Apache Struts2 (CVE-2010-1870) received a
Pwnie award (http://pwnies.com/winners/) not just because the flaw was
remote and serious, but because of the mishandling by the ASF
("receiving no response from security@struts.apache.org").  This is
not completely correct: although the reporter did have to send his
report to security@struts twice, the second time it was acted on and a
conversation with the reporter took place.  However the vulnerability
is still not fixed in any released update to Struts, and the Security
Team has found it hard to engage the Struts PMC about this and had to
contact individual Struts committers, also without much success.

Once the Struts team are more back from holidays we'll engage them in
a postmortem of this event to improve future vulnerability handling.

'Security Curmudgeon' mentioned that they have a number of issues they
are tracking in osvdb.org for various Apache projects which may have a
security consequence and should get CVE names.  These issues are
mostly all fixed, but just with undisclosed security context.  The
Security Team intend to work on this list, split it by project, and
contact each of the projects to clean this up.  It will take some
time.

For July 2010:

1      Support question
2      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
1      Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
3      Vulnerability reports of which
       1      Vulnerability report [commons, via security@apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [httpd, via security@apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [struts, via security@stuts.apache.org]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project
 
ApacheCon North America, Atlanta 2010
=====================================

Registration is now open, and we're working out some of the glitches in
the website.

Noirin has signed the contract addendum, and will get it into SVN as
soon as possible!

Apache Retreat Hursley
======================

Work continues on the Retreat, and several committers have registered.
The timing with regard to the board meeting is unfortunate, but we still
expect a great event.

Other news
==========

The Apache Dev House will not be held as originally planned, because of
the clash with the board meeting :-)

Noirin has some productive decisions with the OSCON team while in
Portland, and hopes to provide a report to ConCom soon.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Daniel Shahaf and Dave Johnson and Niklas Gustavsson were granted
infra-interest karma.

Norman Maurer brought new athena (mx1.us) online.

Sander Temme shipped the pair of Xserves in his possession to OSUOSL.
They have been racked and are currently being configured for use.

Ari Maniatis has been in touch with the University of Sydney for
the purpose of both hosting a svn mirror and to provide facilities
for an Apache conference/barcamp.

We looked into the idea of holding an infra-thon before Apachecon
in November but the timing didn't seem to work out.  We will probably
try again in early 2011.

Began the process of speccing replacement hosts for our EU gear hosted
in SARA.

The replacement host for minotaur has arrived, been racked in OSUOSL,
and is currently being setup by Philip Gollucci.  Note that we are running
out of current capacity (amps) in our racks.

Gavin McDonald reached out to pmcs with zones on helios to tell them about
our migration plans: replacing those zones with FreeBSD jails.  Most have
responded in a timely manner.

Odin has been decommissioned and the vmware instances it hosted for vmbuild
and vmgump have been transferred to nyx.

One of our disks in the brand new eos array was defective.  It's been
taken out of service and is to be shipped back to Silicon Mechanics for
replacement.  We have also ordered a pair of spare drives from them
as well.

We ordered an array from Silicon Mechanics to be shipped to Bart van der
Schans in the Netherlands for ~$6000.  The array is to be part of our
replacement plan for aurora (www.eu) in SARA.

We've moved the Hudson master to a new machine (aegis) and begun
using LDAP for Hudson, thanks to Tony Stevenson and others.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

Travel Assistance Report August 2010
====================================

Atlanta
-------

* All flights are booked
* Organiser has the hotel details, we've got the rooms, just 
waiting for confirmation that the hotel has the names
* We're waiting for our discount code to go live in the reg 
system before telling people to register

Hursley
-------

* Extended application dates are now closed
* We have 6 applicants, at least some of whom look promising
* The other two judges have vanished into the ether, having scored
   nothing... chasing these up but replacement Judge(s) will be in 
   place if their circumstances mean they can not judge.
* Nick is happy to liaise with the travel agents to book the flights 
  as needed, once we've done the judging

Atlanta late applicants
-----------------------

* We have some of the Atlanta budget left over (purposely held back)
* The rough plan was that not too long before, we'd have a 2nd round 
  of applications, only for people who have had their circumstances 
  change a lot - not for people who forgot to apply before!

General
-------

No other news to report, the main list has been quiet this month.
Thanks to Nick for keeping things running and providing a summary 
of events which make up most of this report!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Abdera Project

Abdera continues with a fairly quiet level activity. There was a
flurry of development around the time of the 1.1 release but it's been
fairly quiet since then though there are regular posts to the dev and
user lists which do get dealt with.

Abdera has done one release this quarter, 1.1, and there's a 1.1.1
maintenance release being discussed which should happen in the next
quarter.

There has been one new PMC member has been added, Christine Koppelt.
There were no new committers.

The user list has a small steady stream of user posts, often which get
answered by other users.

There are no board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Ant Project

Core
----
Ant 1.8.1 was released on May 7th, 2010 and remains the current release.

Jon Schneider and Jesse Glick

o Community

No issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Buildr Project

We finally released Buildr 1.4.0 in June, reaching the end of our
8-month development cycle integrating many new features. We also
released Buildr 1.4.1 in July as a maintenance release to address what
were mostly installation + platform-specific issues.

Thanks to Antoine Toulme, we now have continuous integration builds
running on Hudson covering many different platforms (Windows, Ubuntu,
Native/MRI Ruby, JRuby, JDK 5+6).

We're seeing sustained adoption and contributions from the community.
In fact, we've just received a contribution to add Clojure support,
reinforcing our language diversity ("polyglot programming") marketing
story.

We are planning another release (1.4.2) towards the end of August that
will contain various fixes and minor improvements.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Cassandra Project

Cassandra is a distributed database similar to Google's Bigtable
or Amazon's Dynamo.

--Highlights--

The first Cassandra Summit was held in San Francisco on August 10
with almost 200 attendees.  The 0.7 release is coming along nicely,
with a large amount of new features and performance improvements.

--Releases--

0.6.1, 0.6.2, 0.6.3, 0.6.4
0.7-beta1

--Community--

Gary Dusbabek has been added to the PMC.  Brandon Williams was added
as committer.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Click Project

Apache Click is an easy-to-use page and component oriented Java web framework.
There are no board level issues at this time.

Infrastructure
-------------------
No issues

Development
------------------

22 May 2010 - Apache Click 2.2.0 was released on 22nd May 2010

Currently work is progressing on adding AJAX support to the framework,
and discussions have begun around what a Apache Click 3.0 would look like.

Community
----------------
Mailing list traffic has been lighter than usual.

Recent interview on SDTimes below:
http://www.sdtimes.com/blog/post/2010/07/21/Java-app-framework-just-a-Click-away.aspx


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

No changes to projects PMC or committers. No new releases. This has
been the quietest quarter during lifetime of Cocoon project, with
email traffic dropping to ~130 emails to users and ~60 emails to dev
lists in a quarter.

Surge of maintenance activity on the Cocoon 2.1 branch which has
started in the last quarter has tapered off; no plan for the
maintenance release was set. Development activity on Cocoon 3 has
slowed down, however interested committers stated that development
will resume in the nearest future. Stefan Bodewig made progress in
restoring Gump builds, with all of Cocoon 3 and some of Cocoon 2.2
building successfully.

Slow down in activity spurred discussion on the PMC list on future of
the project. We might start with identifying active and emeritus
project members, and go from there.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Community Development Project

Project Status
--------------

The Community Development Project is starting to ramp up again after the
Google Summer of Code efforts. We have merged the women@a.o list into the
dev@community.a.o and are commencing work on rolling out the mentoring
program.

No issues require board attention at this time.

Community
---------

The women@a.o mailing list has been closed and an autoresponder inviting
people to post to dev@community.a.o has been set up. The vote to merge the
women@a.o list was passed unanimously. One, previously unknown, community
member voted -1 (non-binding). However, the owners of the women@.a.o list
reassured the ComDev PMC that the list had been largely unsuccessful in
meeting the defined objectives and welcomed the opportunity to work with
the ComDev PMC in ensuring that the successes of women in the ASF are duly
recognised.

The local mentors program and local speakers program both continue to
grow. We now have 53 local mentors, and 27 local speakers. If discussions
on them on foundation-wide lists is anything to go by, they continue to be
of use!

Interest is growing in the mentoring programme with a number of enquiries
to the development list. Ross Gardler reports that there will be between
10 and 40 students approaching the ASF for mentoring as part of their
formal education in September. The draft process is already
[defined|http://community.apache.org/mentoringprogramme.html] and will be
refined during August in consultation with interested PMCs.

There was one appeal from a GSoC student that failed in the mid-term
evaluation. This was examined by both Google and the ASF admins. It was
felt the mentors decision was fair and that our selection process was not
at fault. A minor tweak relating to the communication of our expectations
to the students has been implemented. Full details can be reviewed at
http://markmail.org/thread/dsn6v2dagrm5nv7q

Objectives for next period
--------------------------

* Gain support from at least 5 PMCs for the mentoring programme
* Launch the mentoring programme in September (no press at this stage)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project

Releases
--------

No releases since the report in June.

Development
-----------

Development activity has been quiet this quarter. Some work on distributed
build continues on trunk.

Community
---------

VMBuild was rebuilt as a VM on nyx. All of the long-standing issues in the
INFRA JIRA were resolved and it seems to be running much more smoothly.
Thanks primarily to Gavin McDonald for his help in the transition.

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache CouchDB Project

Apache CouchDB is a distributed JSON document database with HTTP API.

1.0.0 and 0.11.1 Released In July.

Discovered a data-inaccessibility bug pertaining to the 1.0 release. 
Community developers quickly released a detailed announcement and repair tool
both receiving praise from users. http://couchdb.apache.org/notice/1.0.1.html

Just released 0.11.2 and 1.0.1 as maintenance versions, the later containing a 
fix for the aforementioned bug

CVE-2010-2234: "Apache CouchDB Cross Site Request Forgery Attack" versions
prior to version 0.11.1 are vulnerable to cross site request forgery (CSRF)
attacks.

Filipe Manana and Robert Newson were added as CouchDB committers.

Jason Smith released and maintains turn-key Apache CouchDB installer for Linux
users.

Lots of name recognition on a CouchDB application hosting and reporting the
Afghanistan Wikileaks data.

Couchio ported CouchDB for Android. Download and update through the
marketplace. iOS support is underway.

Cloudant makes fascinating teaser blog post about their high-availability

Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  Ross Gardler asked to be moved to emeritus state. That was effected early
  in this quarter.

General status:
  Development is quiet.

  On the dev mail list, the developers are assisting each other.

  Questions on the user mail list are being attended to by a couple of PMC
  members. That list is quiet.

Progress of the project:

  A few PMC members did some more work towards sorting out the issues needing
  to be addressed prior to our upcoming release.

  Upgraded some supporting products.

  Commenced assessment of the status of all plugins.

  Improved the presentation of plugin details.

  Commenced moving our zone to the new server.

  We now have Apache Gump again building Forrest. Many thanks to Stefan Bodewig
  for the assistance.

  A couple of PMC members did some assessment of the well-known XML
  vulnerability that was recently discussed in other project reports.

  No releases since 0.8 on 2007-04-18.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache HttpComponents Project

Status

The last status report was sent in July, and thus there isn't a lot to be
reported. Overall the project remains active.

We are working on realigning our release process with the best practices
used by other ASF projects such as Apache Commons (special thanks to Sebb).


Releases

None since the last report (submitted on the 21st of July). New releases
of HttpCore and HttpClient are planned for August/September 2010.


Community

Nothing to be reported


Development

The new HTTP caching module is being improved to add a file system based
cache implementation


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Matt Benson, Srinath Perera, and Michael McCandless all joined the
Incubator.  Several more will be joining this week.

Shiro is set to graduate, and it seems that at least a couple of projects
are in good shape to graduate in the near future.

On to a topic for the Board's attention.  There has been some lively
discussion this past week, initiated by Joe Schaefer regarding making
Incubator projects more self-governing.  Although a valid goal, the actual
proposals appear troubling in terms of ASF governance structure.

A specific proposal, for which Joe would like a formal vote, amounts to
whether the ASF Board approves the granting of Committer status without PMC
approval, and bypassing the PMC on the matter.  Individual current and past
Directors have already engaged, but it is requested that the Board consider
the issue, and respond.

------------------------------------------------------

= Amber =

Amber is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of
the OAuth v1.0, v1.0a and v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism
that allows users to authenticate and authorize access by another
party to resources they control while avoiding the need to share their
username and password credentials.

The most important issues that must be addressed before graduation are:

 * attract new users and developers
 * making a release

The Incubator PMC / ASF Board should be aware that:

 * Involved people have been very busy due to personal/business issues in
the last month.

Latest activity:

 * apply the API definition choices approved by the community.
 * started implementing the Signing algorithms.

Next steps:

 * finalize the API definition.
 * implementation of different specification versions (client and server).

Community:

 * The community is in the first stages of formation and solely
consists of the developers, though a few users start to appear on the
mailing lists.


= Bluesky =

Did not report, but has reported several months running.  The only activity
observed is the following e-mail:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-bluesky-dev/201008.mbox/%
3CAANLkTi=NAfBWOofuU1fAXKxYxAiQf2rAt5ZQDcL1p6=f@mail.gmail.com%3E


= BeanValidation =

Apache Bean Validation will deliver an implementation of the JSR303 Bean
Validation 1.0 specification. BVAL entered incubation on March 1, 2010.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation.

 * First release of artifacts - Done
 * Grow the community and committer base - ongoing
 * Decide on graduation target of TLP or subproject - TBD

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of?

 * None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 * Committer offer was extended and accepted by Matt Benson.
 * A couple of new users on the dev list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 * Currently a 0.2-incubating RC2 release vote is underway.


= Chukwa =

Chukwa is a distributed log collection and processing system built on top of
Hadoop.  It is a former Hadoop subproject. CLAs are on file and ASF holds
all copyrights.  We have been in incubation since July 13, 2010.  Since
then, we have switched to incubation SVN naming and updated our website to
reflect this change.  We still need to move mailing lists to incubation.
[Pending on Bernd.] We still need to move our website to
incubator.apache.org [Pending on permissions].  Should bring onboard more
committers; Bill Graham would be the first Chukwa committer not originally
part of the project.


= Clerezza =

Clerezza (incubating since November 27th, 2009) is an  OSGi-based modular
application and set of components (bundles) for  building RESTFul Semantic
Web applications and services. The are currently no issues requiring board
attention.

Recent activity:

 * Added support for roaming users with WebId
 * Added support for ssl
 * Started support for editing own foaf-profile with client certificate
generation
 * Faster ScalaServer Pages using Scala 2.8.0
 * Improved User documentation

Next steps:

 * Streamline architecture around type-handlers and type-renderer
 * Add ability to easily overwrite the styling in full or partially
(skinning) with a bundle


Top 2/3 Issues before graduation:

 * Improve our website with tutorials and "getting started" content.
 * Prepare some easy-to-run demos to get people interested in Clerezza.
 * Prepare for a first release


= Deltacloud =

Deltacloud is a cross-cloud RESTful abstraction API. The are currently no
issues requiring board attention.

Recent activity:

 * Grant of initial code finalized: code relicensed under ASL2.0, iCLA's of
all contributor's on file, cCLA from Red Hat for initial submission also on
file, code imported to subversion
 * First draft of an API specification sent to developer's list
 * Initial content for project website in svn; need to clear up some
technical hurdles to make it live
 * Added support for executing commands and copying files into cloud
instances
 * Work on adding blob storage to API under way
 * Work on publishing reports from a private Hudson instance to a public
site (since it seems we can't get access to Apache's Hudson)
 * Numerous bug fixes and smaller enhancements

Next steps:

 * Continue work on API additions
 * Finalize initial API (including the spec)
 * Prepare for an initial release with a stable API

Top 2/3 Issues before graduation:

 * Make an Apache release
 * Make a diverse community of active committers
 * Improve our website with tutorials and "getting started" content.


= Droids =

Droids is an Incubator project arrived from Apache Labs. Droids entered
incubation on October, 2008.

It's an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows one to create and
extend existing web robots.

What we've completed in the last months:

 * new elected committers: Bertil Chapuis and Richard Frovarp, there have
been a miss-understanding of the vote calling for this committers. We have
to redo them on the general list.
 * many people have joined the last three month and the incoming patches are
getting applied by a couple of "old committers"
 * release preparation are under going, but stop due to the lack of a
release manager

Issues before graduation :

 * Do a release
 * IP clearance


= HISE =

DID NOT REPORT


= Libcloud =

Libcloud is a unified interface into various cloud service providers,
written in python. Libcloud joined the Incubator on November 3rd, 2009.

LibCloud are pleased to have added two more committers to the project in
Eric Woods and Roman Bogorodskiy - welcome to you both. Since the last
report LibCloud codebase has been moving along nicely, with the introduction
of a Java codebase, many issues resolved from the issue tracker and working
towards an imminent 0.40 release.

Many new features are being discussed and implemented and existing drivers
are being well maintained. There is healthy discussions happening on the
development mailing lists and the diverse developers are working well
together. Overall the project is doing well.

(Mentors Note: LibCloud as a project is going along nicely on its own, this
quarter although I watch the lists, yet again as a non-coding mentor I find
I have had nothing to do. However this next quarter I fully expect to see
about helping to move the project towards graduating by the end of the next
quarter if not sooner.)


= Lucy =

Lucy will be a loose port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C
and targeted at dynamic language users.

Lucy was voted into the Incubator on July 22, 2010.

Issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 * Make a 1.0 stable release as quickly as possible.
 * Concentrate on community expansion.
 * Disperse knowledge of codebase among developers.

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

 * None.

Progress since the last report:

 * Accounts requested for new committers Peter Karman and Nathan Kurz.
 * Existing JIRA and MoinMoin Wiki installations transitioned.
 * Mailing lists requested. (INFRA-2901)
 * Trademark inquiry begun. (LUCY-121)
 * Subversion repository created.
 * Existing Lucene subproject codebase moved from lucene to incubator.
  (LUCENE-2563)

Community development since the last report:

 * During the Incubator proposal period, Lucy added Mentors Upayavira and
Mike
  McCandless, and committer Simon Willnauer.


= NPanday =

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven. NPanday allows .NET projects to be converted into Maven projects thus
allowing them to fully utilize the other technologies driven by Maven.
NPanday has been incubating since August, 2010.

NPanday was accepted just days before the Incubator report was due, so is
only just getting started on setting up. Expect a more complete report on
infrastructure and status in September which will be the first official
report.

The first steps for the podling will be:
* establishing mailing lists and a PPMC
* deciding how to approach the code history when importing from Codeplex
* starting discussion on NPanday 2.0 development

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.


= Nuvem =

Apache Nuvem will define an open application programming interface for
common cloud application services, allowing applications to be easily ported
across the most popular cloud platforms.

Nuvem was accepted for Incubation on June, 2010.

Nuvem infrastructure is ready, and project is slowly getting started.


= PhotArk =

Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application
including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access
control layer, and upload capabilities.

 * PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008.
 * Issues before graduation :
 * PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have
grown the community to the minimal 3 independent committer size required for
graduation and have been seeing slow but continuous interest in the project.
We might be soon in a position to discuss graduation if others don't see an
independent, active but small community as an issue.

 * PhotArk M2 released.
 * The PhotArk community continues to make good progress code wise
particularly around GSoC projects


= SIS =

Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users
can use to build applications containing location context. This project will
look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities,
services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further,
the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level
community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores,
RESTful interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under
the Apache umbrella.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

Not at this time

Community progress since the last report

There was a few projects undertaken in Chris Mattmann's CSCI 572: Search
Engines and Information Retrieval class regarding SIS, in particular, one by
Nga Chung, wherein which she implemented a full R-tree spatial index in Java
from scratch, as well as bounding box and point-radius queries. Nga has
kindly signed up for the mailing list, and allowed for the contribution of
her code to SIS. In addition, a few other projects included representation
of spatial data in GeoRSS format (from William Quach, another 572 student),
and those projects will be packaged up and contributed also. SIS'ers need to
follow up after the meeting with ESRI to determine if they are interested
with participating in the community. Much of the other activity continues to
be from the mentors and committers.

Project progress since last report

SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.

Chris Mattmann led the development of the SIS website and stood the site up
at http://incubator.apache.org/sis/, completing SIS-2. The code prepared in
CS572: Search Engines and Information Retrieval at USC will be packaged up
and attached to JIRA and committed to SIS. In particular, the R-tree
implementation as well as the point/radius and bounding box implementations.
The GeoRSS code will also be packaged up and contributed to SIS. Patrick
O'Leary is investigating map projections and coordinate systems including
transformations to Polar coordinates which should help on the observational
data side.


= Stonehenge =

Stonehenge has been incubating since December 2008. Stonehenge includes  a
set of example applications for Service Oriented Architecture that spans
languages and platforms and demonstrates best practices and interoperability
by using currently defined W3C and OASIS standard protocols.

Since the last Stonehenge report in May, the Stonehenge community has
concluded very extensive testing of the M2 milestone. M2 was released on
July 10th with a rich feature set:

-       Added a StockTrader implementation based on the Sun/Oracle Metro
stack fully exercising the WS-* features in Metro
-       Introduced support for WS-Trust, WS-Federation and WS-Security specs
in all of the supported implementations of StockTrader.
-       Added claims based access using active and passive STS for .NET,
Axis2 and Metro
-       A slick configuration UI that allows for dynamic configuration of
backend services, selecting any service from each tack

The community also has welcomed the addition of two new committers based on
their hard work in M2, Pablo Cibraro and Nicholas Hauenstein.

The community is currently reviewing strategic options for the project
moving forward.


= VCL =

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.

Community Involvement

   * As stated in the previous report, the Apache VCL community continues
to grow. We're seeing more people start to contribute to our online
documentation and file JIRA issues.
   * As reported in the last board report a few people from the community
have been contacted by PPMC members encouraging them to become more involved
in the project. There was positive interest from a few, they submitted
iCLA's but have yet to contribute anything for the PPMC's to review for
acceptance.
   * We see people from new locations asking questions on the vcl-dev list
which shows that interest in VCL is growing.

Plans for next Release

   * The next release has been delayed slightly to make sure all jira
issues were satisfied correctly. The new target date is to have the next
release candidate out available by the end of August 2010.

Top Issues Before Graduation

   * Continue to increase contributors from multiple institutions


= Whirr =

Whirr provides code for running a variety of software services on cloud
infrastructure.

Whirr was accepted into the incubator on 11 May 2010. Status information is
available at http://incubator.apache.org/projects/whirr.html.

Progress since the last report: We continue to get contributions from
outside the initial committer base. More work has been done to add Whirr
infrastructure (Hudson). We did not do a release this month as planned (we
have been held up on upgrading to the latest jclouds release, amongst other
things), but we plan to cut a release in the next period.

Plans for the next period:

 * Do an initial 0.1.0 release.
 * Set up the website.

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

 * Increase community involvement in the project
 * Make several incubating releases
 * Support at least three services on Whirr


= Wink =

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of REST
style web services. The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311)
standard. The project also introduces a client runtime which can leverage
certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink will deliver
component technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of
environments.

Apache Wink has been incubating since 2009-05-27.

Notable Activity:

*  Released Apache Wink 1.1 and 1.1.1.  1.1.1 fixes a potential security
vulnerability which affected several projects using XML parsers.  See
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/wink/trunk/security/CVE-2010-2245.
pdf for details.
*  Changes to logging and trace code for the project as well as other fixes
and features.

Planned Activity:

*  Java EE 6 integration

Top issues before graduation:

Build community

Signed off by mentor: kevan

= Wookie =
No issues currently require IPMC or Board attention

Notable activities:

 * Added pluggable persistence component
 * Integrated RAT into Wookie build and corrected issues found
 * JIRA Activity continues to grow

Items to be resolved before graduation:

 * Remove GPL dependencies
 * Create a release
 * Develop community


= Zeta Components =

Zeta Components is a high-quality library of loosely-coupled PHP components.
It has entered incubation on 2010-05-21. Therefore the project is still in
ramp up phase.

In the past month,

 * the code drop has been finalized and license has been changed
 * the website has been created
 * development discussions have been started

The 3 most important issues to be tackled are:

 * discuss and realize potential copyright notice changes
 * collect missing iCLAs from previous contributors
 * finish setting up infrastructure (CI, etc.)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Karaf Project

Since the last July report, Apache Karaf 2.0.0 has been released.

Several patches have been supplied by contributors, but due to the
holiday season, development has slowed down a bit during the past
weeks.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Lenya Project

Apache Lenya is a Cocoon based XML/XHTML content management system.

Issues:

  No board level issues at this time.

Development:

  Working on providing best set of editors possible.
  Work has began on the architecture for Lenya 3.

Community:

  Florent Andre was elected in as a committer.
  Florent organized a community meeting at the RMLL LSM meeting in
  Bordeaux, France at the beginning of July.
  Richard Frovarp and Rudolf Korhummel presented an Apache Lenya
  session at LSM, which included an overview of the ASF.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Logging Project


- Community

Ralph Goers was added as a PMC member and Ivan Habunek was 
added as a committer to log4php by PMC votes in early June.

Just prior to the filing of last quarter's board report,
a large body of code for consideration was unexpectedly committed
as a development base for log4j 2.0.  As was noted in last
quarter's report, the scope of the contribution suggested that
IP clearance through the incubator should have been performed.
The issue was raised to the board for guidance and the code
was accepted as committed without additional action.

private@logging was active in mid-May and early June with
discussions on the lack of vitality, progress or new contributors
to the project.  A PMC Chair election was suggested,
though a formal call was delayed to allow a PMC member on vacation
to reengage in the discussion (which did not occur) and then
got lost in the summer doldrums.

A Logging Services blog was created (http://blogs.apache.org/logging/).


- Development

log4j 1.2:

The OSGi metadata in log4j 1.2.16 (released in April)
contained a duplication that prevented the bundle from
properly loading in an OSGi container.  The problem was 
fixed in the SVN in June but the expected log4j 1.2.17
release did not occur.


log4j 2.0:

The month of May saw substantial activity after several years
of dormancy.  Ralph Goers contributed a logging framework
for consideration for log4j 2.0 in mid May.  Javadoc
tags were used to mark questions and concerns and there was 
healthy discussion on the log4j mailing list.  I restarted my
earlier log4j 2.0 work that had been suspended due to lack of
active reviewers.  There are substantial differences in the 
approaches, though both primary developers expect
that they can be eventually complementary.  Unfortunately,
active development did not continue into the summer.

log4cxx:

A log4cxx release that is compatible with Visual Studio 2010 and
that addresses a persistent problem with crashes on shutdown
(particularly with 64-bit systems) is long overdue.

log4net:

Mailing list is active.  One bug fix this quarter but no
other development activity.

log4php:

Ivan Habunek was added as a committer during this quarter,
the mailing list and SVN was active.  A post incubator
log4php release is still on the horizon.

Chainsaw:

Chainsaw has been by far the most active development area
this quarter.  A formal Chainsaw release is hopefully in
sight, but first several log4j "companions" need to be
pushed to their first formal release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Perl Project

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since the last report.


--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since the last report; however, 
work is progressing towards a 2.0.5 release in Q4 2010 after
all dual lifed modules have been released.


--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

No new Apache-Test releases since the last report.


--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Apache-SizeLimit 0.92 is pending release, RCs are being tested at the moment.


--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Apache-Reload 0.11 is pending release, RCs are being tested at the moment.


-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

No new Apache-DBI releases since the latest report.


-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
applied with due consideration for our production userbase.


-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is, as always, thriving.  nothing noteworthy
has happened since the last report.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened during this quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache POI Project

Community
---------
In the last quarter, we haven't added any new committers, though
we remain on the lookout as ever.

One of our committers, Mark, who has previously been our user list champion
has taken a new job, and had to cut back how much time he spends helping out
people on the lists. Other committers have stepped up to respond to the
harder user questions which Mark used to tackle, though not with quite the
same speed and detail as Mark used to manage...

The problems from the last quarter with how long patches took to be applied
seem to have largely been resolved, as people have found a few more cycles
to do this in. This is particularly good, as the number of submitted patches
seems to have been rising of late!

Traffic on the dev and user lists are slightly up on last quarter.

Releases
--------
We've done two beta releases in the last quarter, POI 3.7 betas 1 and 2.
We're aiming to get the final 3.7 release out before ApacheCon, with maybe
another beta release first, as dictated by user feedback.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Qpid Project

Since the last report, not too much to report. Project remains very
active with steady work to the upcoming release. Additional API
bindings have been added, and continual stream of patches from the
community. Project has also updated the web site, and format.

Most noteworthy is that an additional committer has been voted onto
the project (Andrew Kennedy) last month. One new committer (Cliff)
voted on in previous period also.  Qpid will probably start preparing
for the next release in a month or so as there are a large number of
enhancements and changes on the trunk. The next release date has not
yet been set, but I expect I will be reporting on that in our next
report.

No concerns from PMC or myself to report at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Roller Project

Since the last report we've made slow progress towards a Apache Roller 5.0
release. We've gotten a small amount of feedback on the RC1 release
candidate and fixed a dozen or so bugs found. Mailing list traffic continues
to be slow. No new releases, no new committers.

We should be able to muster enough votes for a Roller 5.0 release when the
time comes, but to stay viable we really need some new PMC members soon.
To encourage more participation in Roller, we updated the "how to
contribute page" and tried to make it easier to read:

   http://s.apache.org/contribute-to-roller

I also did some totally unofficial and not-speaking-for-Apache blogging to
explain how Roller works, how folks can help and why they benefit from
pitching in.

   http://rollerweblogger.org/project/entry/roller_needs_you

The ASF blog server blogs.apache.org is running Roller 5.0 built from
(almost) latest trunk code. There is now a custom build script in
 /infra/infrastructure/trunk/roller that builds Roller, adds some ASF
themes, plugins and configurations. As part of that and to support
Ross Gardler's ASF Newsletter proposal, a blogs-to-newsletter plugin
has been coded up and is ready for testing (see also http://s.apache.org/blog-newsletter).

For the board and anybody else reading: if you've got ideas for
improving blogs.apache.org, the Roller PMC would like to hear from you,
or just post an issue here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA
(component: blogs).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

It's been a busy month for the Santuario project since the last
report. We initiated a PMC discussion on the board's request to fully
complete the transition to a TLP (thanks to Dan Kulp for advice on
this issue). The result of this discussion is the Infrastructure JIRA
(INFRA-2924). We have also agreed to get a cwiki up and running, to
possibly replace the Santuario website in the future, and have asked
the infrastructure folks for advice on the best way to transition from
Bugzilla to JIRA.

The active PMC members are also in the process of contacting some
dormant members to query whether they are still interested in being
PMC members or whether they wish to go emeritus.

Chad La Joie was voted in as a new committer to the project.

On the Java side, some work was done on the build system to make the
project more portable. An interop bug with XMLBeans was also fixed.
Hopefully we will get a 1.4.4 release out the door before the next
report, as there are only a few more outstanding bugs remaining.
The big work item this last month was to add support for the XML
Signature 1.1 ECDSA algorithms to the Java implementation of
Santuario. The work is currently being done on a private branch and
will not be merged back to the mainline until more testing is done and
further progress on XML Signature 1.1 is made. As it has an API
dependency on Java SE 1.5, it will form part of a future 1.5 release.

On the C++ side, work was completed on adding openssl-based EC key
support to the library, and added ECDSA signing/verification support.
Some simple interop testing with a limited set of test inputs was
completed, but there is more testing planned. A handful of additional
XML Signature 1.1 extensions were also added to the code. An
additional work item before 1.6 is done appears to be to implement
full configure-time support for building the library against NSS,
which was left undone by the original author.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Subversion Project

** Board Issues

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

** Community

Since our last report, in May, we have added two more committers.
These are "partial" committers, meaning they are restricted to certain
portions of the tree. The first, artagnon, is a GSoC student for
Git(!) and is adding a new "svnrdump" client-side tool to produce or
load Subversion dump files remotely (eg. for fast-loading into Git).
The second, stefan2, is working on a branch with a broad set of
performance improvements across the system.

No new PMC Members ("full committers") have been added.

** Releases

We released 1.6.12 on June 21, and the development team is hopeful to
begin cutting 1.7 alpha releases in a few months. Subversion normally
does not produce "alpha" or "beta" releases, but with the major
changes in the 1.7 working copy, we wanted to return to a mechanism
that will get early releases into more peoples' hands.

A graduate student produced some initial work on a new MySQL-based
backend for Subversion. His school term ended, along with his
available time to work on the project. However, he has signed an ICLA
and provided a large patches for his work. This is due to land in our
tree, on a branch, Real Soon Now. Our hope is that others will be
interested and can investigate and continue his work, and that having
it in our tree will make that process easier.

elego's "Subversion Day" was considered very successful by all
participants. elego hosted a hackathon for the committers over four
days, and was an excellent host. Several guests from the community
were also able to join in, and an Apache Dinner was scheduled during
this time for a broader mingling of Subversion developers with their
new Apache friends.

SubConf is approaching in mid-September, to be held in Munich.

As noted by the Trademarks report in June, the Subversion (registered)
mark has been transferred from the Subversion Corporation over to the
ASF. We are in-process on pulling together all prior licensees of the
mark, and working to re-issue a new license between the ASF and those
licensees. The intent is to honor all prior commitments that
Subversion Corporation made to those entities.

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Turbine Project

Status
======

The Turbine project has as usual seen fairly low levels of
activity in the last quarter.

The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.

Community changes
=================

No new committers were voted in since the last board report.

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

Turbine core project
====================

The Turbine core project continues with occasional commits
thanks mostly to Thomas Vandahl.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board
report.

Fulcrum component project
=========================

Work on migrating the build process of the Fulcrum components
to Maven 2 continues thanks mostly to Siegfried Goeschl.
There are also a few new components in the pipeline.

Releases of fulcrum-pbe and fulcrum-hsqldb have been voted on,
but have not been released in time to make this report.

META project
============

There has been no activity on the META sub-project in this quarter.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Tuscany Project

Apache Tuscany is an SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA.
There are no board level issues at this time.

In the last quarter there have been two releases, a 2.0-M5 milestone
release of the new 2.x code stream, and the first release of a travel
sample which provides a separately downloadable model SCA/Tuscany
application. The first beta release of the 2.x code is now being
planned.

One new committer has been added, a GSoC student working on a Tuscany
project give commit rights to help with getting the project now.

The GSoC project seems to have been making good progress. A group of
Tuscany committers are planning to attend the Apache Retreat in the UK
in September.

Mailing list traffic on both dev and user lists is steady but down
slightly, perhaps due to summer vacations


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project

[Received late, from Will Glass-Husain on behalf of vacationing chair.]

This has been a quiet quarter for the Apache Velocity project.  

Anthony Petrelli has reorganized the Velocity Engine code base and
build system to be based on Maven.

Traffic on the user lists seems slower than typical, with a new inquiry
every couple of days.  Responses remain fairly quick, with 3 or 4 committers
actively monitoring the lists and responding to questions.

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

There are no issues requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J

Xerces-J 2.10.0 was finally released on June 18th. Among many other
new features (such as JAXP 1.4 and the StAX event API) this release
introduces experimental support for XML Schema 1.1, including the
PsychoPath XPath 2.0 processor from Eclipse (used for processing XML
Schema 1.1 assertions). One of our committers works on both projects
so there's been some good collaboration across the communities.
We're planning on having another release (2.11.0) in November.

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is wrapping up again. Our three
students (Ishan, Udayanga and Sanjaya) have just completed their
projects. Some have expressed interest in continuing to contribute
after GSoC ends which is an encouraging sign. It would be great to
have more committers.

Xerces-C++

No development activity during the reporting period except for a
couple of bug fixes.

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

With Crimson's recent move to the Attic it's looking like the XML
project is slowly shutting down. This is probably a good indicator
that we should start thinking about moving the website, download
area, mailing lists, bug tracker, etc... over to the Xerces domain.
All of XML Commons infrastructure is still in the xml.apache.org
space (we had left it there for convenience).

Nothing else notable to report. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache XML Project

This quarter Crimson officially left the XML project on its way to the
Attic. This leaves the XML project with just XIndice left. Consensus
is to have a discussion within (what's left of) the XIndice community
to see what's next, with three option on the table: XIndice goes TLP,
xml.apache.org is renamed to XIndice or XIndice moves to the Attic.
Another discussion will then ensue on what to do about the XML PMC and
its only remaining asset, that is the xml.apache.org website.

Development activity on Xindice remains low, however all questions
on user's list are answered.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

General Comments
================

There are no issues that require Board attention. Developer activity
has gone up, due to release activities and work on Color. Jeremias is
working on color in all three subprojects. Contributed patches are
still not processed in a timely manner anymore.

XML Graphics Commons
====================

Version 1.4 was released.

Batik
=====

There have been practically no changes on the codebase in the last
three months. User list activity has gone down a bit but questions are
mostly getting answers.

Fop
===

Version 1.0 was released. Because we finally decided to bump the
version number to 1.0, we gave this release some special attention. In
cooperation with the PMC, Sally Khudairi prepared a press release at
short notice, which was released at OSCON.

In addition to the work on color, Vincent is working on Truetype fonts
in PostScript. User list activity has become just a bit lower than
last quarter. No big changes there.

Deployment to Maven repository
==============================

The build processes of XML Graphics Commons and FOP produce Maven
bundles, but no member of the teams runs Maven, so that we are not
able to deploy the bundles to the Maven repository. A call for help on
the members mailing list has so far not resulted in successful
deployment.

Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project

* Notable Happenings

We voted to retire the WSIF project to the Attic [1], and to promote the
jUDDI and Scout subprojects to a TLP [2].  We also voted to retire the Muse
subproject, but a team of researchers indicated their interest in continuing
the project (see [3]), and as such we tabled that resolution for the moment
pending the results of that conversation.

* Code Releases [since the last report]

 - Axiom 1.2.9

* Subproject News

Apache Woden

Woden is an open source Java implementation of the W3C WSDL 2.0
specification.

Woden is slowly pulling together an M9 release. Only one real active
committer, which is something to watch moving forward.

JaxMe2

JaxMe 2 is an open source implementation of JAXB, the specification for
Java/XML binding.

JaxMe is a very low-activity project, but has occasional JIRA activity. It
is likely our next target for the Attic.

Apache Scout

Apache Scout is an implementation of the JSR 93 (JAXR), which is a java API
to XML registries such as jUDDI. Business as usual, Scout v1.2.2 (bug fix
release) was released in July.

See above, proposed for promotion.

Apache jUDDI

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) specification for
Web Services. jUDDI v3.0.3 (bug fix release) was released in July, things
are moving along smoothly.

See above, proposed for promotion.

Apache WSIF

Apache Web Services Invocation Framework (WSIF) is a simple Java API for
invoking Web services, no matter how or where the services are provided as
long as it is described in WSDL.

See above, proposed for termination.

Apache WS-Commons

Apache WS-Commons is a collection of projects that are primarily used as
parts of various WS projects but useful even outside the WS space.
WS-Commons houses Apache Axiom - the streaming XML object model, Apache
XmlSchema - an object model to manipulate XML schema documents, Apache
Neethi - the WS-Policy implementation and various other smaller projects
such as tcpmon.

Axiom released 1.2.9, and is undergoing active 1.2.10 development. Nothing
major to report on the others. We will likely promote these
"sub-sub-projects" to subprojects (or TLPs) very soon.

Apache Muse

Apache Muse is a Java implementation of WS-ResourceFramework,
WS-Notification, and WS-DistributedManagement. It provides code generation
tools and APIs that aid users in creating standards-compliant interfaces for
manageable resources. Muse-based interfaces can be deployed in a J2EE or
OSGi environment.

See above, proposed for termination but on hold pending discussion.

Apache XML-RPC

Apache XML-RPC is a Java implementation of XML-RPC, a popular protocol that
uses XML over HTTP to implement remote procedure calls.

Very sporadic list traffic, no new development. Also a future candidate for
the Attic.

Apache WSS4J

Apache WSS4J is a Java implementation of the OASIS Web Services Security
(WS-Security) specifications.

Development and mailing list traffic has been steady, and the team is
gearing up for a 1.5.9 release.
