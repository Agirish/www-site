 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Jim]

       After the last board meeting there was quite a rigorous discussion
       thread regarding the board's modification of the submitted Axis TLP
       resolution before voting on it. It was noted as a reminder that the
       board has ultimate responsibility and authority over the content of
       resolutions, but it was also suggested that what the board "should
       have" done was table the resolution and bounce it back requesting the
       changes be made and re-submitted. It was noted that the former is
       actually an indication of a "well-running" board and that a
       dysfunctional board would have taken the former action.
       
       A legal issue was brought to the board's attention and was referred
       to the legal cmmt for follow-through.
       
       I sent a reminder to the board that our Delaware Annual Report, for
       our corporate status, is due by March 1.
       
       A member's meeting still needs to be scheduled.
       

       Big uproar on the mailing lists over the board taking initiative, but
       the general consensus of the board is that the board did what it should
       have done. Waiting wouldn't have served any purpose.

    B. President [Justin]

       This last month has been quiet as expected.  By the end of this
       month, I will begin asking all of our committees to start
       formulating their 2010-2011FY budgets.  I do ask that the
       Treasurer/Asst. Treasurer help in this process by providing the
       historical YTD expenses to our committees.  I continue to expect
       that we should have a draft budget before the Board in time for
       the March 17th meeting.

       Unless there are any objections, I will take the point on the
       contract negotiations with HALO for their services.  (The current
       contract expires on March 1.)

       As mentioned previously, I have a number of speaking engagements
       in February and March representing the ASF - all within California.


       Jim volunteered to help with HALO's negotiation, Jim and
       Justin will work out offline the division of labor.
       
       Shane requested that Jim/Justin give the board a heads up
       should there be any significant changes in scope or budget.
       Justin indicated that he did not expect any significant
       changes.

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

       Justin noted that Sunstar does not need a 1099 as he is a
       company instead of an individual. Geir will check into this,
       and indicated that he filed a 1099 for this last year.
       
       Roy asked if we should start planning for an audit. Geir
       believes that the books are ready on an ongoing basis.
       
       Jim asked to verify that we are planning to have a formal
       audit, and plans to figure out what it takes to reconstruct an
       Audit committee. (The previous audit committee was dissolved
       in February of 2009)

    D. Secretary [Sam]

       Minutes drafted, minutes posted for review, and minutes posted to the
       site.

       35 ICLAs, 5 CCLAs, and 1 Grant processed this month, mostly via
       eFax, then by email, with a few postal mail.  Craig continues to handle
       the bulk of these, and one working day turnaround is generally the
       norm.  Some further investment in automation has resulted in additional
       streamlining.

       We are looking at revising the ICLA form itself to indicate that
       direct email is an acceptable alternative (in fact, it is the preferred
       alternative).  We have had people send in, and we accept, pictures
       of signed documents, which we convert to a PDF for archiving.  (Both
       svn and the mail archives show the full trace of all transformations)

       Finally, some time this month we plan to experiment with sending back
       email confirmations at the time a document is committed.  This email
       will be sent to the email address in the document itself, and will copy
       the person who sent in the document, if the document was sent by email
       and the address is different.

    E. Executive Vice President [Sander Striker]

       It's yet another short report for the EVP office. It's been a rather
       uneventful month. Press inquiries have all been handled by others. No
       speaking opportunities this month. No tasks to be handled requested by
       the President.  Not even hard drives to order for Infra. In other
       words: "Nothing of significance to report to the Board".

       That said, I should have mentioned my vacation, especially given the
       lack of connectivity. Last year I was close to an open network, I
       naively assumed the same this year. To cut this short, I'll be back
       on Jan 31. Should you need me in this timeframe, please do call my
       cell.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

There continues to be activity and interest around TCKs, recently
around the shrapnel from Java EE 6 spec completion - servlets, JavaEE,
JPA, et all.  There's an request for the EL TCK, which I thought we'd 
have, but Sun has now informed me we need to get a separate license
so I will do so.

I attended the January JCP EC F2F in Santa Clara.  I presented our
model of Incubation to the group - there's been some recent interest in
'incubators' as a possible way of helping specs get started, so I described
the Apache model in a session that included the Eclipse incubation process
as well as W3C.  I also gave an session to the newest EC members for both
ME and SE/EE on the Apache/Sun dispute.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

No board-level issues noted.

Operations And Community
========================
Policy discussion quieted down over the holidays, but is expected to 
pick up soon to better define our trademark guidelines.

Apache Pivot was warned about a potential trademark conflict with a 
Microsoft project named Pivot (that they appear to have applied for a 
registered trademark on), however the PMC preferred to keep 
their name.  

Our previous two SpamAssassin trademark registrations were allowed 
to go abandoned (last month; was omitted from SpamAssassin report).
Given the well-established use with our software product, I don't 
believe this will be an issue going forward.

Planning on attending February meeting with Sally and Serge to work 
out details of PRC break up, including budget and responsibilities.

External Requests
=================
Answered various non-infringing related questions.

VP, Concom signed the Memorandum of Understanding between the Apache 
Software Foundation and Cloudera with regard to Hadoop World, after 
consulting with counsel and trademarks@.  The agreement is for a year, 
at which point both our overall trademark use guidelines and any 
event-specific guidelines (worked out in conjunction with Concom) 
should be well defined, ensuring that any future agreements comply 
with our overall guidelines.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

Fundraising remains largely in an assessment and planning phase.  I
prioritized the areas I would work through as:
 1) sponsors,
 2) donations, and
 3) other areas.
I'll go through those three areas and then discuss coordinating with 
other areas at the ASF in this board report.

SPONSORS
This is going pretty well.

Sally handed off all sponsor relationships to Greg Stein and myself.  I 
had a face to face meeting with Greg, and he is interested in serving as 
the primary liaison to all existing sponsors and to help with closing new 
sponsors.  Greg successfully helped close Facebook as a new gold sponsor.

Greg and I will be using a google docs to track sponsors.  We are 
looking to track key administrative tasks such as primary points of 
contacts, date of renewal, and last invoice number.  It is on Greg's 
plate to put together the first revision and share with me.  We will 
grant access to the google docs upon request to any foundation or board 
member.

I prompted some discussion of sponsorship on fundraising@ with limited 
feedback.  I will be emailing all sponsors individually to provide a 
second point of contact at the ASF, and also to solicit any feedback on 
the sponsorship program.

I feel we will need to create some form of a proactive push of updates 
to sponsors, though the shape, frequency, and targeting of these updates 
has yet to be defined.

I'll be gradually documenting the sponsorship process over the coming 
months, including:
 1) sponsor coming aboard (coordinating with press@ and treasurer@, 
updating spreadsheet, updating thanks page, etc..)
 2) sponsors leaving, and
 3) sponsor maintenance activities.

I have put the task of finding new sponsors on the back burner until 
I've gotten more of what's under the fundraising umbrella understood and 
under control.

DONATIONS
I define this as all the cash donations coming in.

This is my next task now that sponsorship is getting under control. 
I've been trying to get the list of 2009 donors, without success. 
5 emails to Geir over the past 5 weeks, and I only have received a 
partial list of transactions from mid-Dec 2009 thru early January 2010. 
I have not been able to get answers to questions on where this money 
is going and how I can get access to it, but this was over the holidays 
and I expect to push much more actively on this in the coming month.

So next month, I get a clue of where money is going and put in place 
what I need to reliably track and report on this.  Without this in 
place, I will not be able to effectively measure the impact of any 
changes to the donation program.

I will look to review how we could improve the donation program later 
this spring.  Some people have volunteered in spot areas, and there have 
been some suggestions on fundraising@ already and emails to me 
expressing interest before fundraising@ was re-launched.  I will likely 
expect to reach out to members@ as this gets going.

OTHER AREAS
This includes book revenue sharing deals, car donations, and whatever 
else that was setup by temp volunteers in the past or just handed to the 
ASF.  My sense is that right now this information is the most fragmented 
and unknown.  As I get data on the donations program, I expect some of 
these activities will be illuminated.  I expect this to be largely a 
trickle of money, and the debate to be had is whether the resources 
needed to track and manage these programs is worth the revenue they are 
generating.

COORDINATION
I'm flying to Boston in February to meet with Shane and Sally as the 
first official face-to-face of the ASF marketing team.  I'm looking to 
understand areas of responsibility and build camaraderie to make our 
jobs easier.

I'd like to ask the board for more access to the foundations financials. 
Access to the PayPal account would be very helpful and I expect 
facilitate some of the reporting I need for donations (and sponsors).

I also do not know what else I need access to.  I'd like to discuss 
where else money is arriving and how I could get access to that, this 
would be great.  Slaps on the head accompanied by a path in SVN are 
certainly appreciated too.

Also I have access to the Quickbooks files, but it would be easier for 
me if the ASF could move to the online hosted variety so we're not 
checking out and opening a static binary file.  I may not have a recent 
enough version of Quickbooks, assuming the ASF QBW file is getting 
upgraded regularly.  So if we're not going to move to the hosted 
version, I will likely request budget to buy a copy of Quickbooks for 
myself.

As always please feel free to send me or fundraising@ any questions you 
have, and I appreciate everyone's assistance getting this going.  Thanks!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

STATUS/SUMMARY:

Sally exchanged emails with Greg Stein and Serge Knystautas, handed over
all Sponsor Relations activities to Greg, and liaised a personal
introduction between each Sponsor and Greg. Sally also worked with David
Recordon and the Facebook PR team on their new Gold Sponsorship
announcement and creating an official ASF statement in support of that
event.

Sally will host a face-to-face worksession in Boston with Shane Curcuru
and Serge, who will be flying up from Baltimore for the day. The primary
agenda item will be the separation of responsibilities and budget with the
Fundraising and Brand Management groups. Other items are detailed in the
"Liaison" section below.

We are seeking an ASF Member to act as a spokesperson who is based in
Europe, as well as an Asia/Australasia/Oceania-based backup. We've received
a small handful of requests from journos who would prefer to speak with
someone within their own timezone so that they can be productive during
their workday without having to wait for the US to wake up. Preferably
this would be a Board or PMC member. Media Training is required: all
participants need to be able to *work* in a press environment.

Media/analyst relations outreach continues, with the intention of
introducing the new M&P team, updating records, and inviting interested
parties to be added to a newly-created press/analyst-specific distribution
list (to be used for for higher-level Foundation announcements, the first
of which was the Facebook Sponsorship news referenced above); response has
been overwhelmingly positive, with more than 30 additions to the list
within 24 hours of first communication sent. Feedback includes:

-- "Thank you for asking: not everyone does."
-- "By all means add both myself and David to your press and analyst list."
-- "Thank you for asking. I appreciate the courtesy. Yes, please add me."
-- "Thanks for getting in touch. I'll sign up for the RSS feeds, but please
   also add me to your Apache press list too. I suspect the volume of
   messages on the general lists would quickly train me to just hit
   delete ... (I) would be especially interested in contact details
   for anyone in Europe willing to talk to the press about Apache and
   related projects: it can be frustrating having to wait till early
   evening for US contacts to wake up! I'd also settle for contact
   details of  nightbirds on the Pacific coast, or any English speakers in
   Asia. Thanks again."
-- "Yes please do sign me up. Thanks."
-- "Great to hear! I am glad Apache will have a more cohesive approach to
   PR. I want to know about everything Apache does. Every project, every
   release."
-- "That would be great. I'd appreciate being on the 'regulars' list.
   Also, I do some blogs and podcasts, covering Microsoft and separately
   covering security. If there is any news or potential podcast guests about
   security (or Microsoft if that happens), I'd appreciate it if they might
   be on a podcast."
-- "I would like to receive and cover news from the ASF for TB. All help
   and response on your part will be hugely appreciated. Please feel free to
   add me to your list."
-- "I'm certainly interested in keeping up on the latest with the Apache
   Foundation and its many technologies and communities..."

Sally has been working with Greg Brown and the Pivot team on their press
release and dissemination tactics to support the announcement of their
graduation from the Apache Incubator and the release of Pivot v.1.4

Sally has also been discussing promotion strategy/tactics/timeframes with
the Apache Cayenne and SpamAssassin teams and has proof-read/edited Jim
Jagielski's interview with Software Design magazine of Japan.


Media hits, clippings audit and management: The ASF received 

- 150 press hits in December 2009 (primary interest: post-10th Anniversary
  coverage, year-in-review lists), and 
- 195 press hits in January 2010 (thus far; primary interest Facebook
  Sponsorship announcement, top technologies that have influenced computing,
  Apache HTTP Server v.1.3/2.0 deprecation, Geronimo)

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

Larry is now a member of the W3C Patents and Standards Interest Group, and
has participated in calls.  Among the current topics being discussed is the
request by the HTML WG for a more liberal license for HTML5 standard (i.e.,
the document itself).  This will likely result in the W3C soliciting opinions
from the Advisory Council representatives.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

JIRA: 6 closed, 13 worked on, 0 opened; mostly during a blitz by Henri on
19 December (Thanks Henri!).

Discussions of note:

* Moving Copyright notices (a.k.a. dealing with an uncooperative donor)

* Public Domain (primarily example code)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For December 2009: There continues to be a steady stream of reports
of various kinds arriving at security@apache.org.  These continue to
be dealt with by the security team.

   2       Support question
   2       Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
   1       Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
   6       Vulnerability report of which
           1       [juddi, via security@apache.org]
           2       [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org]
           3       [httpd, via security@apache.org]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Apache Roadshow Asia 2009 (Nov. 28-29 (Beijing); Dec 4-6 (Colombo))
========================================================
No report was received from the Colombo team, despite requesting same in
December.

The Beijing team reported a successful event, with huge thanks to key
people "on the ground" (particularly Peter Cheng, Xiao Feng, and Robert).
Intel's support was also greatly appreciated. The team did report
difficulties with co-ordination between the two events, and found that the
lack of a dedicated co-ordinator keeping things in sync made for several
small-but-significant hassles.

Apache Retreat, Ireland 2010
=======================
Registration continues to climb slowly. Noirin and Colm have both been
travelling since the beginning of the year, but we're still planning to
publicly announce the BarCamp in January, and do another registration
push before the end of the month.

Other events
==========
The TrafficServer and httpd projects are holding a hackathon & meetup on
January 25 & 26th at the Google Campus. This event is supported by Google,
and presented at no cost to attendees or to the Foundation.

Simon Willnauer and Isabel Drost are planning a Hadoop-focused event in
Berlin in May. ConCom is currently discussing support for this event, and
may seek funds from the board next month to do this. Several issues with
the ConCom Supported Events policy have come to light in this process, but
the organising team have been patient with ConCom as we work things out!

Memorandum of Understanding with Cloudera
====================================
The Memorandum of Understanding between the Apache Software Foundation and
Cloudera with regard to Hadoop World has been signed by both parties. We
plan to renegotiate within a year, with the aim of ensuring this agreement
falls in line with the Trademark Policy currently being developed at the
Foundation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

De-racked 4 decommissioned machines: freyr, freyja, idunn, fireswamp.

Introduced ckl, a communication tool for distributed sysadmin teams,
into our workflow.

Tony Stevenson acquired a 2 year wildcard SSL certificate from Thawte.
All top-level project websites, including www.apache.org, are now
available over https.

Sketched out some preliminary plans for migrating the zones on helios
to jails on sigyn.

Replaced a failed disk in hermes(mail).

Ordered a pair of SSD's and a JBOD enclosure to house them from Silicon
Mechanics for ~$2400.  The order is expected to ship before Feb 1 and
will be used to beef up performance on eris (svn).

Ordered a corresponding PCIe 2xSAS card for eris (svn) to communicate with
the SSD's for ~$400.

Dan Kulp was granted root on brutus to assist with confluence admin.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General News
------------

Not much activity since the last report.
Nick Burch has been completely revamping the webapp to make it Easier 
to use for both the applicants and judges, streamlining And making it 
configurable 'per event'.
There has been some initial talk on how we might be able to Handle smaller 
more focused events, what the criteria should be, Etc. No decisions have 
been made and has been put on the back Burner whilst we concentrate on our 
current event, the Apache Retreat In Ireland.

Although we have some lurkers on the TAC list, no new volunteers have 
stepped forward as yet to offer their time. We have enough TAC members to 
cope with the current situation but it would be nice if in future events 
we were able to do more rotation. This is just a quiet mention to note that 
if any ASF Members would like to help out at TAC they are more than welcome 
to join us. Ideally, we are looking for one or two more people, and, as 
with projects, we would be looking at dedicated stayers rather than short 
term help.

Apache Retreat - Ireland.
-------------------------

We are just about to start our preparations for providing assistance to Those 
that might qualify, for the Apache Retreat in Ireland. We expect to Open 
applications within the next few days.
This is our first of this type of smaller event and we have a slightly 
Different criteria and process. Nicks work on the webapp includes retreat 
oriented changes so this should help make things easier. We have our 3 Judges 
in place.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache ActiveMQ Project

Community:
* The ActiveMQ project has had another very busy but quiet quarter.
* The development and user lists continue to stay vibrant.
* Tim Bish has joined the ActiveMQ PMC

Development:
* The Apache.NMS.Stomp project has begun development of its first release.


Releases:
* ActiveMQ-CPP 3.1.0


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Attic Project

No issues for the board.

* Beehive has been Attic'd
* Xang has moved into the Attic from the xml.apache.org project
* Crimson still expected at some point (pending XML PMC).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Axis Project

This is the initial board report for the new Axis PMC.  Cc'ing the WS PMC for
only this first report.

I recently submitted https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2441 after a
good bit of discussion on the WS PMC list about the correct way to set up the
new PMC and handle the SVN structure, mailing lists, and migration.  While
there are still open questions as to how our new SVN layout will work (or
rather, how to cleanly transition old code to a new structure), I think we
should be able to get started on moving the mail traffic and the website over
to their new locations soon.

After the requisite bumps involved in getting set up, I'm expecting 2010 to
be a good focused year for Axis2 development, and that we'll wrap up Axis1 in
a few months time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Beehive Project

This is a dead project.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Click Project

This is the inaugural Click board report.

We have recently submitted
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2425 to migrate Apache
Click from the incubator to a TLP.  Once the project has been migrated
we will release Apache Click 2.1.

There has been an up kick of activity of late with new community
members, bug fixes and ideas. There has also been a book published
"Getting Started with Apache Click"
http://www.fdaoud.com/clickbook/.

I think 2010 is going to be a very good year for Apache Click.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Releases:
2.1.8 was released
2.2.5 was released
DOSGi 1.1 was released

Final preparations for 2.1.9 and 2.2.6 releases are occurring now and will
likely be in the process of being voted on by the board meeting.

The CXF developers have decided that 2.1.9 will be the last patch release for
2.1.x (which has been out for 22 months) so we can concentrate more on getting
2.3 finished.  Users have been notified to start migrating to 2.2.x.

Committers:
Cyrille Le Clerc added as a committer


Community:
The CXF committer community did an amazing job this quarter doing JIRA triage
and bug fixing.    The "bug" count in JIRA is now under 25 open bugs (with
several blocked on bugs in external dependencies) and under 130 total open
issues.

User and dev list traffic remains pretty steady and generally questions and
issues are answered promptly.    Vacations and such over the holidays did
cause some minor delays and backlogs, but that seems to be cleared up now.

Another exciting development has been the publication of the first technical
books about CXF.    Previously, there were not any books about CXF which was a
short coming.   In December, TWO books were published about CXF.
1) Apache CXF Web Service Development: http://cxf.soaweb.co.in/
2) Developing Web Services with Apache CXF and Axis2 (3rd Edition):
http://www.agileskills2.org/DWSAA/index.html
Neither were written by CXF committers so it really was the user community
responding to a need.    (And thanks to Brett Porter for being a reviewer on
the first one.  :-)     Also, a section about CXF's JAX-RS implementation was
put into Bill Burke's "RESTful Java with JAX-RS" book.

Attachment G: Status report for the Apache DB Project

Development in the DB project continued over the last quarter:

1) Derby is working on a new feature release, 10.6. Derby's summer-of-code
   mentees continue to contribute.

2) JDO is preparing for a maintenance release, JDO 2.3.

3) Torque is relatively quiet, some ideas are being discussed for a major
   4.0 release.

4) DdlUtils and ObjectRelationalBridge did not report any status updates
   this quarter.

5) For the first time in my memory, a security issue came to the DB PMC.
   We are following the Apache security process (
   http://www.apache.org/security/committers.html ) and have mapped out a
   solution which satisfies the person who raised this security issue. Given
   the small number of vulnerabilities which come to us, we are not inclined
   to create a special mailing list for DB security discussions; the full PMC
   list seems adequate.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Directory Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Geronimo Project

No major issues to report. The community has been active on the
dev and user mailing lists. Several releases were created. The

Feedback and community involvement has been slowly increasing, we
frequently meet with users during Hadoop meetups and hold site visits.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache iBATIS Project

iBATIS 3 is a greenfield reimplementation of iBATIS. We've been
releasing betas about every 3 weeks. Beta 8 was released on January
10th. There were only 4 issues discovered during this beta period,
but more importantly, they were quite minor and quite low level. Two
could be classified as non-functional/performance related. So the
kinds of issues we're finding now are in the "tweaks and tuning"
classification. This gives me a lot of confidence that iBATIS 3 is
nearing GA.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The Incubator appears to be running smoothly, with nothing regarding Board
level attention.

Shindig, Cassandra and UIMA are all talking about graduating. Shindig was
voted on last week, with the vote closed this morning in time to try to make
the Board meeting. Cassandra, which is not reporting this period, is
discussing graduation to TLP status. As noted separately, below, UIMA is
preparing to graduate in the very near future.

Proposed or newly entered:

 OODT --- a grid middleware framework for science data processing,
information integration, and retrieval
 Lucene Connector Framework
 JPPF : a parallel processing framework for Java

There is a 4th proposal, which resulted in some discussion regarding (code)
clearance vs (community) incubation. It should be resolved shortly so that
the project can move forward.

Subversion, rather ironically, given the membership of the project, failed
to provide a monthly report for January. Thrift also failed to report.
Notes on each are below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

= Ace =

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to centrally
manage and distribute software components, configuration data and other
artifacts to target systems. ACE started incubation on April 24th 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring board or Incubator PMC attention.

Community

* Toni Menzel accepted our invitation to become a committer, after
considerable contributions since the start of ACE which include support for
launching using Pax Runner, various patches and the migration to Maven.

* Brian Topping accepted our invitation to become a committer, after
learning about ACE at ApacheCon US 2009. Brian is helping out with the
migration to Maven.

* Jean-Baptiste Onofre accepted our invitation to become a committer, after
approaching us to work together on integrating ACE with AutoDeploy/Kalumet.
He has since also helped out with the migration to Maven.

* Marcel Offermans presented ACE at the ApacheCon US 2009 as part of the
OSGi track

Software

* Migrating from an Ant based build to Maven. Current trunk holds both
builds.
* Currently its about aligning the Maven output with their Ant originals.
After that, the ant project will be moved out/removed. (Overview: ACE-62)
* CI build is going to be moved to the Hudson grid. (see ACE-71). Awaiting
account creation in INFRA-2419.
* Agreed on new terminology for some of the core concepts in ACE after
Carsten started a broad discussion about them.

Licensing and other issues

* None at the moment.

Things to resolve prior to graduation

* Make a release
* Grow the community some more


= Bluesky =

BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008. It is an e-learning solution
designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education
between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.

Last month we tried to pack the release candidate package and place it at
http://people.apache.org/~mabowen/. However, we made some mistakes when
producing the package, first, a improper version number, second, forget to
start a release audit before making the release candidate package. These
faults are the things we'd restore the next step as soon as possible.

top 2 or 3 to resolve prior to graduation:

* Complete the release audit and clarify the last legal issues;
* Revise the release version number and repack the release candidate;
* Start a new round of release vote at bluesky dev-mailing list;


= Chemistry =

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide a Java (and possibly others, like
JavaScript) implementation of the upcoming CMIS specification. Chemistry
entered incubation on April 30th, 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring board or Incubator PMC attention.

Community

* Another project (OpenCMIS) targeting a Java implementation of CMIS, like
Chemistry, has been proposed to the Incubator. Discussions between OpenCMIS
and Chemistry developers have identified areas of possible collaboration but
the OpenCMIS incubation status has not moved forward.

* Chemistry is now being used by companies or individuals outside the
initial developers.

Development

* Development continues at a steady pace, mostly driven by Florent
Guillaume.
* Chemistry now targets CMIS 1.0 CD 05 draft, soon to be 06.
* Nuxeo will contribute a command-line shell for CMIS in a few days.
* SOAP bindings are planned in the coming days as well.

Issues before graduation

* Stabilize the general interest into a sustainable development community.
* Set up Hudson builds.
* Create an Apache release of the Chemistry codebase.


= Clerezza =

Clerezza (incubating since November 27th, 2009) is an OSGi-based modular
application and set of components (bundles) for building RESTFul Semantic
Web applications and services.

The are currently no issues requiring board attention. Recent activity:
* All the Clerezza code has been imported in the podling's svn repository
* Hudson continuous integration activated service interface
for extracting/creating metadata on upload
* thumbnail generator based on the above
* some fixes around security and sparql
* started utilities to make "tagging" with skos concepts easy (front end
widget, and rest service querying remote sparql endpoints)
* bug fixes in sparql and security (cookie authentication)
* move to felix 2.0.2 with its security framework
* look for synergies with apache wink
* scripting engines (mainly scala): use common code base with sling
* webdav support
* offline site generation, to generate clerezza website with clerezza
* implement graph-isomorphism algorithm for proper implementation of
Graph.equals
* Stable serialization: review proposed patch
* migration of Jena TDB to 0.8.4 version

Next steps:
* integration with UIMA
* integration with Tika

Top 2/3 Issues before graduation:
* Get our website online, currently it's just a placeholder
* Prepare some easy-to-run demos to get people interested in Clerezza
* Prepare for a first release


= Empire-db =

Empire-db is a relational data persistence component that aims to overcome
the difficulties, pitfalls and restrictions inherent in traditional Object
Relational Management (ORM) approaches. Empire-db is on the Apache Incubator
since July 2008.

We accepted Benjamin Venditti as committer, this after his work on the code
generator through jira-posted patches. The code generator already got the
attention from other community members as well. Our maven-based release also
seems to have helped growing the community, the activity on both the user
and the dev list went up. We are still hoping to get one or two extra
developers involved in our development team.

The project's top 2/3 things to resolve prior to graduation:

* Grow a larger community
* Roll out a second maven-based release


= HISE =

HISE is Human Interactions Service Engine - an implementation of
WS-Human-Task specification.
It is in incubation since 2009-11-06.

For graduation, it needs:
* remaining task operations implementation - currently it's about a half
complete,
* building community of users and diversifying community of developers -
currently all committers are from a single company.

Currently project has a basic WAR distro, which enables to do some basic
WS-Human-Task operations, like:

* basic path for Task lifecycle: receiving a claim via Web Services,
claiming ownership, forwarding, completing a task and sending response via
Web Services,

* it has authentication support via WSS4J and holds an internal persistent
structure of user logins, passwords and their group memberships; potential
owners for tasks can be looked up by user's group attributes.


= Imperius =

Imperius has been incubating since November 2007.

Imperius is a rule-based policy evaluation engine based on the CIM-SPL
language from Distributed Management Task Force (dtmf.org).

Candidate for the first release of Imperius was voted and accepted by the
Imperius community. The vote was then forwarded to the general mailing list.
Currently, we are waiting on one more binding vote to complete the release
and make the binaries publicly available.

In general, communication within the community continues to be limited and
sporadic.

Things to resolve prior to graduation:

* Create an Apache release
* Grow the community


= JSPWiki =

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

Significant progress was made in Stripesifying the jsp's. We also
introduced a new content-inspection package and integrated CAPTCHA. We
upgraded to the priha 0.7.0-alpha release which passes all tests from the
JSR-170 test suite, and offers better performance.

A number of bugs were fixed and 27 new unit tests were added, the current
unit test compliance has dropped a bit to 96.8 %.

Of the 27 items on the graduation checklist, still only 18 are complete, so
in that area there has been no progress. All open items are documentation
and ASF process and infrastructure related. There still is no
3.0.0-incubating-alpha1 release.

The developer list currently has 82 members, a minor decrease from 86; and
the user list has 191 members, an increase from 187.


= Libcloud =

Libcloud is a unified interface into various cloud service providers,
written in python. Libcloud joined the Incubator on November 3rd, 2009.

Migration of infra services complete. Mailing list activity in this early
period has been good. More accounts were requested and have been processed.
A few Jira issues have been created and some early commits are happening.
The project API docs are being built and hosted on the ASF Buildbot, and it
runs RAT for us. There was a meetup in early December and by all accounts it
went rather well with a good turnout. New contributors are appearing and
showing interest by interacting on the mailing lists and providing patches.
Informal talk goes on in the #libcloud IRC channel. Work is underway to
interface with more external vendors. Libcloud is continuing to progress
towards a release.


= Olio =

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the
suitability, functionality and performance of various web technologies by
implementing a reasonably complex application in several different
technologies. We currently have 3 implementations in PHP, Rails and Java.

We made our second apache release: Olio 0.2 version on January 13. This
release had some major enhancements to improve performance and better
alignment between the 3 versions of the application. This is the first
release for the Java version as well. We have closed a large number of JIRA
issues for this release.

Olio is continuing to gain users especially within the academic community
and is being used for diverse purposes from performance testing cloud
services to specialized file system and databases. There are 35 subscribers
to the user list and 30 subscribers to dev, slightly more than in October.

Graduation From Incubation:

Diversity of committers is the primary issue with the project - although we
have users, we haven't been successful in converting them to
committers (yet).

We could use the PMC and Board's help in spreading the word about Olio to
get better traction.


= Shiro =

Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security framework
that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise session
management and cryptography.

Shiro has been incubating since June 2008.

During the period, the project has made steady progress towards releasing
the first 1.0.0 release as part of Apache incubator. All IP clearance issues
have been resolved and the team has verified there are no known remaining
issues open. Previous issues related to project's name change have been
largely resolved.

Community involvement remains high and many users are eagerly waiting for
the first official release. The team is planning on making the release
during the next period. There's been an on-going effort to clean up the
codebase and prioritize open JIRA issues before the release.

Project's API documentation (javadoc) is in a fairly good state, but the
remaining issue is where and how to automatically publish the javadoc for
general consumption. In addition, a wiki-based documentation effort for
creating a reference guide was launched.

The project team is not considering graduation at this point, but after the
first release, the team will decide on a roadmap targeting graduation.

The status is being maintained at
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shiro/STATUS

Signed off by mentor: Craig L Russell


= Socialsite =

SocialSite is an open source Social Networking Service based on Apache
Shindig (incubating). The software is not simply a "canned" Social Network
or Facebook-in-a-box type of web application; it's something different.
SocialSite is designed to add social networking features to existing web
applications and web sites. SocialSite is made up of two parts: 1) a social
data server that supports the OpenSocial APIs and extensions and 2) a set of
OpenSocial gadgets that provide a complete user-interface for social
networking.

SocialSite is in the process of entering the incubator. Status page and SVN
space have been created but no user accounts. Committers have sent in ICLAs
but we're still waiting on Sun to deliver the code grant. During the last
month, out contacts within Sun have finally gotten permission to donate the
code to Socialsite -- so we are hopeful that we'll have code in SVN soon


= Subversion =

Subversion entered the Incubator on November 7, 2009. Subversion is a
version control system.

Mailing lists have been migrated to ASF infrastructure, and the old lists on
tigris.org have been turned into read-only mode. No progress has been made
to backfill archives, though some discussion has occurred. (Backfilling of
archives is not required for graduation.)

The most recent RAT report for Subversion shows only 32 unknown licensed
files. Work continues on either removing inappropriately licensed files from
the distribution tarballs or adding licenses to files found deficient.

The Apache Subversion web presence at subversion.apache.org is being filled
with content migrated from the existing website at subversion.tigris.org.
Once migrated, the Subversion community plans on culling unneeded
information, and better organizing existing content. (You don't get to
redesign your page hierarchy everyday!)

The community's plans to create a new patch release, have been a bit bumpy,
due to a number of technical issues caught during the signing/validating
period. These have been resolved, and the new patch release should be
imminent. It should be noted that although this release will be made under
the old license (to avoid having to relicense mountains of code on the
release branch), the release process will be observed and monitored by the
Incubator PMC as part of the podling's progress toward graduation.

The podling remains optimistic that a rapid progression to graduation is
possible in the next month.

The project is very active, with over a 1100 commits in December and ~200 so
far in January; 100s of messages per mailing list.


= Tashi =

Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.

The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud
computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data). The
idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that
are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and
computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.

Development activities have included work on the aws compatability layer, a
few minor bug fixes, a port of nmd to python, adding support for tagged
bridges in xen, and importing Zoni.

The project is still working toward building a larger user and development
community. Michael Ryan, an active committer on the project, has taken a
new job and is unable to actively contribute to the project any longer.

Items to be resolved before graduation:
* Prepare and review a release candidate
* Develop community diversity (currently Intel and CMU committers)


= Traffic Server =

Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid and
Varnish (but better). Traffic Server has been incubated since July 2009.

Recent activities:

* 2009-12-28 George Paul joins the project as a new committer.
* 2009-12-04 Buildbot system setup, with automatic RAT reports.
* 2009-12-02 John Plevyak joins the Traffic Server PPMC.
* 2009-11-16 John Plevyak joins the project as a new committer.
* 2009-11-16 Diane Smith joins the project as a new committer.
* 2009-11-16 Paul Querna joins the Traffic Server PPMC.
* 2009-11-11 Paul Querna joins the project as a new committer.
* 2009-10-29 Source code migration to Apache Subversion completed.

Significant code contributions has been made since the code was initially
released, including 64-bit support, IPv6 and ports to most popular Linux
distributions. Work is actively done on ports for Solaris, FreeBSD and
MacOSX. A development branch is made for new large code changes, there are
already some very exciting additions, including dramatic cache improvements.
We're keeping our trunk as stable as possible (bug fixes primarily) in
preparation for code freeze and our first Apache release. The plan is to
release Apache Traffic Server v2.0 in Q1 2010. Three new, non-Yahoo
committers have been added since incubation, further increasing the projects
diversity. The number of RAT reports / issues has been reduced
significantly, and we expect to have them all covered this month.

A joint hackathon with the HTTPD crowd is planned for January 25-26. Some
details at http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/HTTPD+TS+Hackathon.

The top three things in the way for Traffic Server graduation are:

* We have a potential license issue with a dependency on Berkeley DB.
This needs to be resolved

* The TM on Traffic Server issue. Yahoo! has offered two possible solutions
for ASF to consider, and we'd like for the board to pick one (see details
below).

* We need to make an official Apache release (planned for Q1 2010).

The Trademark issue is that Y! holds several TMs for the name "Traffic
Server", most of which expires soon. Our legal team has proposed two
possible solutions, the first being the easiest for us.

1. Yahoo! provides ASF with a letter of assurance stating that we own all
right, title and interest in and to the TRAFFIC SERVER mark and the four
active registrations and that we will not take any action against ASF or
any of its licensees during the life of these registrations (and we'd express
our intention of letting them lapse and expire in this letter).

2. Yahoo! will assign all right, title and interest in and to the TRAFFIC
SERVER mark including the four active registrations to ASF [though we'd
probably want to make this contingent on getting through the incubator stage].


= Thrift =

*** DID NOT REPORT

Thrift is running, and did put out a release in December. There were 199
developer messages (a large percentage of which are JIRA posts), a handful
of user-related messages, and roughly a score of commits.


= UIMA =

UIMA is a component framework for the analysis of unstructured content such
as text, audio and video. UIMA entered incubation on October 3, 2006.

Some recent activity:

* 2.3.0-RC9 is out for testing and being voted as 2.3.0-incubating, and
just past the release vote; the IPMC will be asked to review now.
* UIMA and Semantic Search presentation at IKS 2nd workshop (see
[[http://incubator.apache.org/uima/iks09.html|here]])
* new incubating project Clerezza planning to integrate with UIMA
* New committer voted in (Bhavani Iyer)

Items to complete before graduation:

* UIMA is ready to graduate, and plans to start the graduation process
after the current release activity is finished.


= VXQuery =

The VXQuery Project implements a standard compliant XML Query processor. It
has been in incubation since 2009-07-06.

Recent activities:

* all CCLAs in place

Attachment N: Status report for the Apache JAMES Project

James Board Report - January, 2010

Releases:
* James-Project 1.5 is currently in the vote process ( acts as parent
pom for all James subprojects)

After the James-Project will be released we will start to vote for
james-imap 0.1-M1 and james-server 3.0-M1.

Code:

* james-server:
 - underwent a big refactoring to replace Phoenix with Spring as Container
 - now use JSR250 annotations for dependency injection as replacement for Avalon
 - removed ant build in favor of maven2
 - use OpenJPA implementation of IMAP Mailboxes in place of Torque


* imap
 - OpenJPA implementation is now used in james-server

* mime4j
 - Stefano Bagnara did a big refactoring of mime4j to remove cycle
dependencies and make it more consistent in its handling ( currently
in review )

* hupa
 - Manuel Carrasco Moñino is constantly workin on hupa to get it ready
for a Milestone

Committers:
No new committers


Community:
With the replacement of Phoenix / Avalon, it seems like more people
are getting interested in james-server again. Also some people talked
about the plans to write a JCR based and Maildir based imap store. We
received some contribution from non committers which is a good sign ;)

Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Maven Project

Maven Board Report - January, 2010
---------------------------

* General Information

Since the last report, we've had 4 more Maven 3.x Alpha releases and are
close to calling it Beta. There was also a large effort to review and
clean the Jiras. This resulted in many duplicates being closed, and issues
validated against 3.x and closed. We have a total of 500 open Jiras across
all versions, but this is probably half of what we had prior to the
cleanup.

Sonatype has offered to donate the Nexus Indexer code to the Maven
project. You can read more about the indexer here[1]. The PMC has voted to
accept the code and the 3 new committers to maintain it. We are just
beginning the process of preparing the code for IP clearance and subsequent
import.

The development community has started to become more active again as the
3.x releases gain popularity and some parallel efforts to produce parallel
builds have started.

On the repository front, http://repository.apache.org has been upgraded
and Apache branding applied. We have also enabled automatic pgp validation
for all releases being staged on the repo. This checks that the artifacts
are properly signed and the key is publicly available for validation. We
have 32 projects in total using the new repo.

Attachment R: Status report for the Apache ODE Project

There are no specific issue relevant to the board at the moment.

 Release

No release to report this quarter.

 Development

Beside usual bug fixes, 3 major area of work this quarter have been the
implementation of ODE's process context specification, clean up of our
JPA support to merge Hibernate and OpenJPA modules and the development
of a Maven build.

 Community

HISE, an implementation of WS-Human-Task Specification, has entered
incubation with ODE as the sponsoring entity. As such we expect some
cross-project work and a possible extension of the ODE community.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

Main areas of development activity include OSGi support, upgrading JAX-WS and
support for JAX-RS, and Java EE 6 @ManagedBean support. More detailed
planning has also begun for the remaining EJB 3.1 work.

Overall user list activity continues to increase with October and November
both being record months in terms of volume. Diversity in developers
responding to user requests has also been greatly improved, quite stellar in
fact, with more committers pitching in and resolving user issues. A wonderful
trend. Holidays had their usual impact on December activity.

OpenEJB Eclipse Plugin 1.0.0.alpha was released in late October and a
screencast created which shows how to get started with it was put up in the
project blog and website.

An informal get together is planned in Milan, Italy for the last weekend of
January. Information has been sent to the user list and anyone is welcome to
come. Primary goal is just to meet each other and have a few beers, but
there's certainly room for tech talk and some will likely occur. Anything
substantial will reach the dev list as with any offline communication.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

Highlights

OpenJPA is wrapping up implementation of the latest JPA 2.0 JSR-317,

Mailing lists continue to be very active, with an average of close to 220
messages per month on the dev alias and approximately 220 messages per
month on the users alias.

OpenJPA continues to experience a modest increase in email subscriptions and
activity. There are over 150 subscribers to dev and over 230 to users.

Governance

No changes in the PMC list for the quarter. We continue to monitor contributors
for possible committers and committers for PMC members.

Releases

A maintenance revision, OpenJPA 1.2.2 has been released.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache OpenWebBeans Project

OpenWebBeans is an ASL-licensed implementation of the JSR-299: Contexts and
Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform which is defined as JSR-299.

OpenWebBeans has graduated from the Incubator in 16, December 2009.

--Summary--

* Migration of Incubator to TLP has done.
* Cleaning of Incubator side has done.
* Started to work with JSR-299 TCK.

--Current Development Status--

* Steadily coding on implementation to cover all specification.
* Working on JSR-299 TCK-Standalone for being fully compatible.
* Working on documentation project to improve guides etc.

--Future Development Plans--

* Release a M4.
* Starting to integrate with Geronimo Server.
* Working on JSR-299 TCK Integration tests.

--New Releases--

none

-- Discussions--

* Talking about automated site deployment
* Decided to pick hudson as the automated build environment for OWB

--Community--

There were some discussions in the PMC-private about the new PMC
members of the OpenWebBeans (that were voted by OWB PPMC/community,
IPMC, and approved by the board) and about some of old incubator
committers current and future status.

PMC of the OWB has decided about issues as follows,

* Enable committer status of Matthias Wessendorf.

* Disable committer status of Mohammad Nour El-Din and email
  to him about fact. Because he expressed that he will not contribute
  more because of interests with other projects.

* Disable committer status of Conny Lundgren and email to
  him about fact. He has never participated in community. He
  was just proposed as an initial committer of the incubator project.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache PDFBox Project

General Comments

There are no issues that require Board attention.

Due to christmas there was not that much traffic on the mailing lists in
december. But now people are returning.

JempBox

No new releases, no new issues.

FontBox

We are still working on integrating Villu's patch which adds support for
Adobe CFF/Type2 fonts to FontBox. It contains a lot of new classes which
have to be reviewed before we can add them.
Probably the CFF/Type2 support will give us an alternative to solve a major
issue with embedded true type fonts (PDFBOX-490).

PDFBox

We changed some external libraries to more recent versions.
We received a lot of promising patches from different contributors in the
last months. E.g., there were several patches from Mel Martinez including
notable performance improvements for the parser, which Jukka already added
to the codebase. As some of the other contributions include substantial
changes to the codebase, we have to ask the contributors to sign a CLA first.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Pivot is a platform for building rich internet applications in Java. Pivot
graduated from the Incubator in December 2009. Version 1.4 was released last
week to coincide with the graduation, and the team is currently in the
process of migrating content from the Incubator to pivot.apache.org. We are
also actively working on version 1.4.1, which will primarily include bug
fixes and minor feature enhancements.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

Just normal bug fixing. Quiet quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

This last quarter saw only one new release, that of Struts 2.1.8.1 as GA.
As one might expect, this is a patch release that resolves issues with our
2.1.8 release. Discussions are underway on the goals of Struts 2.2, and a
new JSR 299 / CDI / WebBeans plugin has been created in our sandbox.

The IP Clearance process for bringing XWork to Struts is largely complete,
pending only the filing of final paperwork, which should be completed shortly.

A new Confluence wiki space has been created for the purpose of reorganising
the Struts 2 documentation and adding new tutorials. An effort is also under
discussion to migrate the Struts 1 documentation from XML in Subversion to a
Confluence space. Hen has made forward motion on merging the separate Struts
JIRA instance into the main ASF JIRA instance, but apparently has run into
problems.

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

This has been a good quarter for Tapestry involvement: several critical
bug fixes were backported from the Tapestry 5.2 code base to Tapestry
5.0 (as release 5.0.19) and to Tapestry 5.1 (as release 5.1.0.7, still
pending). Andreas Andreou has spearheaded the release process, as well
as the use of Apache's Nexus server (to stage releases) and Hudson server
(for continuous integration builds).

We are investigating how to get xfvb (X virtual frame buffer) and
FireFox installed on the Hudson server (a requirement for running the
Tapestry 5 test suite).

Work on Tapestry 5.2 has been accelerating, with over 80 bug fixes already
in place, and with a newly-added module to support JSR-303 (Bean Validation).

Traffic on the mailing list has been good, currently running about 74
messages a day.

We've voted in a new committer, Ulrich Stark. In addition, we've expanded
the PMC, voting in Thiago H. de Paula Figueiredo. We expect to continue
expanding the size of the community in the near future.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Tcl Project

Nothing much to say - we are basically in 'active' maintenance mode -
if there's something that comes up, people are available to respond to
it quickly.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project

* Notable Happenings

As of the December board meeting, all the Axis-related and Axis2-related
subprojects will be moved to the new "Axis" TLP. This will therefore be the
final report dealing with these projects in this context.

The WS project split was a long time coming (over a year of on-and-off
discussion), and we're looking forward to more focused and streamlined
efforts in both the Web Services project and the new Axis project.

The forward-looking plan is to evaluate the rest of the projects in WS
over the next few months and either 1) promote them to TLPs, 2) retire
them to the Attic, or 3) leave some in place in WS as common libraries
for at least Axis2 and CXF.

* Code Releases [since the last report]
 * Axis2 1.5.1 was released on October 23rd
 * Scout 1.2 was released on October 23rd
 * jUDDI 3.0 was released on October 26th
