 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Jim]

       After last month's Chairman report, and the resulting discussion
       at the board meeting, I sent an Email to the membership and
       the PMCs with the main point of:

         I encourage all members and all PMCs to really, really
         review what it means to be an ASF member and what it means
         to be an ASF project. After that, be honest with yourself
         and ask whether or not the ASF is the place for you and/or
         for the project. And for projects, that decision should be
         discussed in the open, with the entire community. They
         deserve that much.

       This resulted in quite a bit of discussion and debate, some good
       and useful, some less so (imo). After maybe a week or so of
       intense email postings, the issue has died down. One good result
       of the discussion was a blog post [1] spearheaded by Bertrand
       Delacretaz regarding some "basic, invariant" guidelines and rules
       for/of Apache projects. As far as how many members and PMCs actually
       performed the requested "naval gazing", no one knows.

       I'll be speaking at the US Library of Congress July 2010 NDIIPP
       Partners meeting next month as part of a panel discussion. My
       focus will be on the history and "lessons learned" behind the
       creation, growth and continuance of the ASF.

       I scheduled the next Annual ASF Members meeting for July 13-15;
       as with most of the previous ones, this will be held via irc.
       As a reminder, it is at the annual meetings that we elect not only
       new members but also new directors for the board. My own personal
       opinion is that this board and officers have done quite a good job
       and my thanks and appreciation goes out to them.

    B. President [Justin]

       I exchanged some emails with Gavin Clarke from The Register
       concerning Apache Harmony and potential fragmentation within the
       Java ecosystem.  A writeup from that is available at:
         http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/06/09/harmony_android_oracle_apache/

       I will be speaking at the TransferSummit in Oxford next week:
         http://www.transfersummit.com/programme/66

       Next month, I will be presenting at OSCON:
         http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13789

       And, I plan to give a keynote at the Apache Asia Roadshow in
       Shanghai in August.  I was also invited to an NSF workshop in
       Washington D.C. at the end of August, but I have put the
       organizers in touch with Jim as he's more "local" than I am.

       As mentioned previously, Bill Stoddard will be representing us at
       China Open Source World in Beijing at the end of this month
       thanks to our support.

       Also, I am providing financial support for one of the speakers at
       TransferSummit (David Woollard) out of my discretionary funds as
       his employer does not currently have the budget to support him to
       attend and I believe the topic and his perspective is especially
       appropriate for this event:
         http://www.transfersummit.com/programme/62

       In this last month, I have handled a number of items from our
       sponsors ranging from requests for quotes to feedback about their
       open-source programs to finding open-source developers interested
       in working on specific projects.  Where appropriate, I have
       looped in specific projects and VPs.

       Lastly, I'd like to thank everyone in the ASF for the opportunity to
       serve as a Director and Executive Officer for the last five years.
       However, as all good things must, my time now draws to a close.
       I will not run in the upcoming Board elections and I will ask the
       new Board to seek and appoint a new President.  I, of course, will
       do my best to assist in the transition to my appointed successor.

    C. Treasurer [Geir]
      Books are currently up to date as of 2010-06-16 for checking,
      savings and credit card accounts.  I've been very loaded at work
      but believe that all is up to date and  in order.

      Contributions:
       - Current PayPal balance as of  6/16 is $24,073  basically same as last
         month. This is not included in financial statements below.
       - Received $10,000 check from Basis
       - Generated invoice for Gold for AMD at Serge's request

      Tasks Done:
       - all approved bills paid. We pre-paid the remaining contract amount to 
         Halo.  I'm still working to get a payoff amount from Dell.  There 
         remains what appears to be 2 paid invoices in the approved
         section that we need to sort out.
   
      In Progress:
       - preparation for FY2010 US Tax filing.  Still working on QB but 
         CPA and I are active on this.  Missed my self-imposed deadline of 
         today but believe 6/30 is a reasonable new deadline for myself.

      To Do:
       - need to start gathering CC receipts from CC holders. E.g ACON09
       - ensure we're tracking JE's new card so it gets paid

    D. Secretary [Sam]

       [verbal report]

       No issues for the board.  ICLAs/CCLAs/Grants continue to be processed
       in a timely manner by Craig Russell.  Thanks go out to Jim and the
       infrastructure team for resurrecting the automation of the updates to
       the committers.html file, as many PMCs rely on this.

    E. Executive Vice President [Sander Striker]

       Last month I have been mostly keeping track of the discussions
       in the membership after last board meeting.  That discussion has
       died down and has been replaced by nominations for members and
       board.  I'll reiterate to the membership that members are free
       to attend board meetings.

       I've assisted in booking travel for David Woollard, partly due to
       the President's replacement credit card not having arrived yet.  As
       with this experience I appreciate the TAC's request for a travel agent
       when it comes to booking multiple trips.

       I failed to follow up on my task of posting our RFP for EA, contrary
       to my previous reports statement of having it up on the 24th of last
       month.  The intent was there, the execution lacked.

    Executive officer reports approved as submitted by General Consent.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

Truly a sad month.  

Bright side is that the new repo of TCKs seems to be working well, all 
thanks to Mark and Daniel et al.

Dark side is that Oracle unilaterally cancelled the quarterly JCP
f2f meeting that was to be held next week.  I suspect that was a
great lesson to the new EC members in what the JCP is really about.

Dim side is that we've asked (again) for the EL TCK.  Oracle confirmed
receipt of the TCK license application, but internal sources tell me
that the Oracle lawyers won't treat it with the priority that the
Sun lawyers did (the best of which have either left or have been eaten
by the ORCA lawyers).

Also helped out with an article in The Register - key point is that 
we can't let people think that the dispute is over if we get the 
TCK under an open source license - the dispute is over whether or
not Oracle will allow us to test Apache Harmony with the TCK and 
still distribute under the Apache License with no additional 
terms or conditions, express OR implied.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

No board-level issues noted.

Operations And Community
========================

Apache Project Branding Guidelines are published but unexpected
drains on time this month have delayed rollout to projects.

Note that the "Subversion" registered trademark in the US has been
transferred to the ASF from Subversion Corporation.  Process of
registering the "Apache" mark is still in progress with counsel.

The primary committers of the Apache iBATIS project have forked
the code, and have re-branded their follow-on project as mybatis and
mybatis.net at http://mybatis.org/.  Brian Fox of Apache Maven is
ensuring that the primary Maven POM groupID of org.apache.ibatis
is still controlled by the ASF.

External Requests
=================
Answered various non-infringing related questions; other than some
confusion around iBATIS, it was a reasonably smooth month.

Work is in progress with several organizations and one individual to
correct infringements of our marks in association with websites
and several products.  Other corporations are receptive to our
requests for updating their use of our marks, although in some
cases the process seems to be a lengthy one.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

This report is over the past two months.  This is a sparse report as I
haven't done as much as I would have liked, partly due to the health
emergency but also just due to being busy at work.

SPONSORSHIP

HP renewed as a gold sponsor.

Basis Technology is a new silver sponsor.  I sent an announcement to
announce@a.o on the Basis Tech sponsorship and am looking for any feedback
on how this was received.  I think some internal promotion of our sponsors
will be helpful to sponsors and am working for a formula for how to do this.

AMD is also a new gold sponsor, but they want to make a news splash in late
June or early July.  As part of this gold sponsorship, we will be purchasing
an AMD Dell box in infrastructure.  Originally this was going to be done as
an in-kind donation, but to keep the support contracts simple, AMD will give
us a check for the full sponsorship, and we'll make the purchase on our end.
I have to finish coordinating this with the infrastructure team.

DONATIONS

I've done nothing to engage fundraising@ to think about small donors or a
donation program in general.

COORDINATION

Shane, Sally, and Serge we're hoping to get together in May but that did not
happen.  We're hoping to meet later in the summer and build on the planning
we did in February.

Infrastructure was helpful in spec'ing out a machine for Dell and I need to
follow up with them now that the deal structure changed.  Treasurer and I
have are working well together.  Everything's good.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

STATUS:

- Budget: we have begun to allocate resources from the approved 2010-2011
  budget towards discounted news wire distribution, new "sumo" promo cards
  (to be distributed at OSCON), and the final installment for the 2009-2010
  contract with HALO.

- Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: the past month has been extremely
  quiet, with Serge and Sally both recently having surgery (are back now).
  There's a chance to hold the second face-to-face in July or August. Sally
  will host.

We have been approached by a Sponsor to provide a supporting quote in their press
release to be distributed before the end of the month. Sally is working on
this and will ensure that our quote will be vendor-neutral (currently is too
much of an endorsement of this organization's work, and, therefore,
unacceptable for our attribution)

- Press Releases: we have not issued any press releases over the PR NewsWire
  service since 4 May.

- Informal Announcements: we launched the “Did You Know?” campaign on Twitter
  on 5 May with more than 40 Apache-related factoids posted to date with the
  support of numerous PMCs and users. We're getting lots of positive response
  and re-tweets...still seeking success stories – please forward to Sally at
  press-AT-apache-DOT-org. It would be great if http://twitter.com/TheASF
  could feed to the apache.org homepage <g>

- Media Relations: the past month has been quiet in terms of proactive media
  outreach; Sally has an upcoming face-to-face meeting with the
  editor-in-chief of ComputerWorldUK to discuss their new enterprise-focused
  content and Apache projects that would be of interest to their readers.
  “Did You Know?” has been helpful in this regard, and other outlets, such as
  The H (Heise's English-language outlet), InfoWorld, and the Bitsource have
  been actively spreading the word.

The ASF was once again in the SD Times' Top 100 list ("Influencers" category
- 18 organizations were named) this year.

An article on Harmony appeared in The Register with Justin heavily quoted.
Geir is following up with the reporter to correct/clarify some long-standing
misreportings.

We liaised an interview for the CouchDB PMC with the Free Cloud Alliance, who
intend to provide regular coverage on the project.

- Future Announcements: Sally discussed a press release with the Tomcat PMC
  announcing Tomcat 7; communications have quieted over the past month, but
  has begun to resume with the recent arrival of a new industry testimonial.

- Analyst Relations: Sally has been in touch with Gartner, Burton (now part
  of Gartner), Forrester, and RedMonk about current activities and requesting
  help for the "Did You Know?" campaign, as they have insight on who's
  doing what with whom. Specific focus is high-volume/visibility power users,
  as well as any potential candidates in the ATL area so we can link them in
  with our ApacheCon outreach as well.

- ApacheCon liaison: the CFP for Technical Talks is now closed, and most of
  the submitters have been notified of the status of their proposals.
  Hopefully we'll be able to have the conference program in place by the end
  of the month so we can start promotions. Sally is also seeking media
  partners to help us spread the word.

- (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison (in partnership with
  ConCom):

15-16 June: MEAOSS Forum/Cairo – the first Open Source event in the Middle
East/Africa, Sally will be making three presentations: About the ASF,
Apache in the Cloud, and Making Money with Open Source Software (heavy Apache
slant).

19-23 July: OSCON/Portland, Oregon – the ASF booth is #812; we are seeking
volunteers to help man the booth. Sally will be there, and will be on the
expo floor most of the time. We will be distributing the "sumo" promo cards
as well. Cut-off date for discounted hotel rooms is 19 June; please contact
Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org for details.

30 Sept-1 Oct: Open World Forum/Paris – Sally will coordinate cross-promotion
as our participation is more clearly defined.

- PR Newswire account: we have used 7 of the 10 pre-paid flat-rate press
  releases on PR Newswire. The remaining 3 releases are available until 6
  October 2010. Sally has secured an additional set of 10 at the special
  non-profit rate, available until 30 April 2011, and has forwarded invoices
  to the ASF Treasurer for payment processing.

Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For May 2010: There continues to be a steady stream of reports
of various kinds arriving at security@apache.org.  These continue to
be triaged by the security team.

5      Support question
2      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
7      Vulnerability reports of which:
       3      Vulnerability report [httpd, via security@apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [activemq, via security@apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [wss4j, via security@apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [struts, via security@stuts.apache.org]

(Note that the above counts vulnerability reports in the month they arrive,
and not if they turn into verified issues later fixed later, hence it's just
a useful volume counter and is not appropriate to include CVE names.)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

ApacheCon North America, Atlanta 2010
==============================

Track organizers are still working to inform all speakers of the status of
their proposals. We aim to have all tracks finalized in the next week or so.

Tutorial selection is complete, and Charel is working with Cvent to ensure that
tutorial registration is a better experience than it has previously been. The
new tutorial registration system is not yet ready, but we're hoping it will be
up shortly.

Other news
==========

Sally is currently at MEAOSS Forum (our first venture onto the African
continent, to the best of my knowledge!), representing ConCom and the ASF.
Three cheers for Sally, who is presenting *three* sessions at the conference
("About the ASF", "Apache in the Cloud", and "Making Money with Open Source
Software") - a great show!

The ASF has been recognised as a community partner for TransferSummit UK, to be
held next week in Oxford. This is not an official ASF event, but several
members and committers will be present(ing).

ConCom has agreed to underwrite a proposal for the Apache Asia Roadshow 2010,
to be held in Shanghai, in August. The budget is estimated at approx $12kUSD,
with a target audience of 400. It's gratifying to see how the investment,
particularly of time/energy, in China has blossomed - the organizers of the
current proposal are all local members/committers.

ConCom has received a proposal to host a second Apache Retreat at IBM's
facility in Hursley, UK, in September. At the time of writing, the vote has
just opened. The budget is estimated at approx $8kUSD.

We received two requests to participate in a Spanish-language event in Ecuador,
but volunteers were unavailable at the short notice we received.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Sander Temme has been busy configuring the pair of Apple-
donated Xserves prior to shipment and installation at OSUOSL.

Gavin McDonald did some repair work on our backup systems.

Discussed the future of odin (vmware) while Mark Thomas
replaced a failed disk in it.

Mark Thomas was promoted to root@.

Brought an uri-shortening service online: http://s.apache.org/details
which takes advantage of LDAP + the Thawte-supplied wildcard cert.

No progress was made in bringing up the purchased replacement
host for eos.

The new machine Aegis was brought into service to replace Ceres as
the Buildbot Master, Ceres continues to be a Buildbot Slave.
Work is underway to move Hudson.zones Master to Aegis also.

Sebastian Bazley has taken up the charge to address a few key
crons that require access to private svn urls.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

No real movement since last report.

Applications are still open for assistance to attend ApacheCon NA 2010
until July 7th, plenty of time for folks to still apply.
We have had some applications and more are coming in slowly.
We have our 3 judges in place, we are advertising and will continue
to advertise the applications open.

Things to do, we still need to organise a Travel Agent in the US,
one who will accept a one off wire transfer, rather than the piecemeal
credit card effort from last year.
(We are awaiting a volunteer to take on the role of Travel Agent
Liaison to organise this)

Mailing list activity has been practically zero. There is talk just
beginning of supporting a smaller event coming up soon.

Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Avro Project

http://avro.apache.org

== Issues ==

There are no issues that require the board's
attention at this time.

== Community ==

Mailing list traffic on the developer list has increased
5x since May to about 23 messages/day.  There has been
good discussions regarding our 1.3.3 release, enhancement
proposals, the RPC spec, the C# port in progress, and
custom avro code generation.

The user list has traffic remains relatively low but has
increased since May to about 3 messages a day.

== Releases ==

On June 7th, 2010, we released Apache Avro 1.3.3 which
included 12 improvements, 14 bug fixes from 7 different
authors.  This release was managed by Jeff Hammerbacher.
This was Jeff's first release and demonstrates that the
release process is being shared among team members well.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Axis Project

Axis has been pretty active this quarter, with steady list traffic and good
progress being made in a couple of directions (see below). No new
committers/PMC members, nor anything aside from that covered below requiring
board attention.

* Security Advisory

After discovering a DTD-based vulnerability in Axis2, Andreas Veithen
spearheaded a fix, and released the following message pointing to an
advisory document and a patch. The fix will be built in to our next releases
(see below).

http://s.apache.org/CVE-2010-1632

We also fixed an XSS vulnerability which was discovered externally.

* Upcoming Releases

We are working on both a 1.5.2 maintenance release (so that we have a
complete package containing the security fixes) and a larger-scale 1.6
release with fixes and new features.

* Infra

Axis2 is now happily building in Hudson and using Nexus for SNAPSHOTs. We'll
be doing our first release using Nexus as soon as 1.5.2 is ready to go.

* Lingering Transition Issues (or "The JIRA that Would Not Die")

Yes, we're talking about https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-2441.
We hope to get the last bits of Axis stuff moved over or archived in SVN,
and the website revamped, in the next month or two. Shout out to Gavin for
trying to keep us moving here.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Buildr Project

We've seen continued increase in communication on both user@ and dev@ mailing
list. We hit a record 364 emails across both lists in March. We've also seen
sustained community participation in the form of fixes, minor enhancements to
the codebase and new releases for 3rd-party extensions (e.g. buildr-iidea
plugin).

In March, we elected a new committer: Antoine Toulme. Antoine has been very
active since elected and volunteered to handle the release process for 1.4.0.

Our development activity has been, and still is, focused on getting Buildr 1.4.0
released. We had to invest significant energy to get all tests working on both
JRuby 1.5 and the Windows platform and now it appears we've got all issues
resolved. After a few release candidates, we expect Buildr 1.4.0 to be released
in June.

We have no issues that require board attention at the moment.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Camel Project

Community:
 * No issues that require the board attention.
 * The community continues to grow and be very active.
 * We welcome Christian Schneider as a new committer (already a cxf committer)
 * We welcome Christian Mueller as a new committer (waiting for an account)
 * Other contributors submitted iclas and volunteer to help out with the wiki doc

Development:
 * Development continues at an intense pace on trunk
 * Development on the 1.x release branch slowed down. Although still in use,
   most other projects we know of that use Camel migrated to 2.x. We are
   currently discussing when would be the right time to discontinue development
   for the 1.x version.
 * We are looking at the quality of our releases and found it in extremely
   good shape. The rat plugin revealed a few xml test data files that are
   missing the apache header and we are correcting that (camel has over 4700
   unit tests).

Releases:
 * Camel 2.3.0 released.
 * Camel 1.6.3. maintenance released.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Cayenne Project

Development

* Released Cayenne 3.0 final (May 7).

* Cayenne 3.1 is under development. The feature list hasn't been
finalized yet, but major enhancements include dependency injection to
ease configuration and support for vertical inheritance.

Community

* Activity on the user mailing list has been higher than normal,
perhaps due to the release of 3.0 final.
* Andrew Lindesay sent in a CLA and was granted permission to update
our official documentation through Confluence.

Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Community Development Project

No issues require board attention at this time.

Apologies for not submitting last month.

Website
-------

Documentation about mentoring has been moved from the wiki to the comdev
website

A beta site for finding local mentors and speakers has been set up at
http://community.zones.apache.org/ This is reasonably well populated via
members@ and we expect to start pushing it to the wider community@ soon.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

44 Students accepted, this will generate income of $22,000

For the first time there were no major complaints about the selection
process.

Student work is underway.

Mentoring Programme
-------------------

We had planned to roll out the mentoring programme after the GSoC
selection process. However, this has not yet happened. Documentation is in
place and a pilot is being run with a single student. However, we have not
yet rolled it out across the ASF.

A lack of volunteer time is the real block here, this is expected to be
resolved in coming months (a day job project for one of the ComDev team
relating to this activity commences in July)

The Apache Way
--------------

Prompted by various discussions on members@ we started a community dev
blog (http://blogs.apache.org/comdev/)

This will be used to post useful pointers to existing resources and
expertise.

We are considering which activities discussed in the members@ threads can
and should be implemented by comdev


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project

Below are the important events that happened in the project since February.

Emeritus
--------

* We have had 1 inactive PMC member step down and become Emeritus:
    - Joakim Erdfelt

Releases
--------

* Continuum 1.3.6 (GA) was released April 7, 2010
* Continuum 1.4.0 (Beta) was released May 6, 2010

Development
---------


Community
---------

The Selenium tests for the Continuum web app were fixed to run offline by
Brett to speed up the execution of the tests. This took off more or less 1
minute (~7%) of the time it took to run.

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Excalibur Project

There are no known issues.

Excalibur is stable and used by some projects. Again, this quarter has
been very quiet with zero activity, neither in the mailing lists nor in
subversion (and no releases of course).

      sent to board.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  It is
different from "usual" CI servers in that it expects the individual
project builds to succeed; its purpose is to check the integration of
a project with the latest code rather than a fixed version of the
project's dependencies.  If you want a more traditional nightly build
server, Gump is not for you.  Use Gump if you want to know when a
change in your dependencies breaks your project or when your changes
break other projects.

Gump's intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle
that makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Issues ==

There are no Board level issues.

== Community ==

The Gump project really consists of two parts, the code base for the
project and the ASF installations[1] running this code base to build
many ASF projects as well as some related projects.

The code base mostly does what its current users need so there isn't
much development going on at all.  No new committers have been added.

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.  There are a few people contributing across all
projects and a few additional people maintaining the metadata of the
projects they are interested in the most.

No changes to the PMC.

== Development ==

The last quarter has seen a minor improvement that allows output file
names to be specified with wildcards.  Since Gump cannot influence the
names of jars created by Maven 2.x the paths had to be adjusted with
every release of a project built by it so far.

We've managed to build a few projects that have been failing for a
long time in Gump - among them the ASF projects Portals, ActiveMQ,
Directory Server, Tapestry and parts of Camel.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Infrastructure ==

Access to vmgump has been tightened up, the number of people with sudo
has been reduced and OPIE is now required.

== Statistics ==

As of Sun, 06 Jun 2010 the ASF installations check out a bit less than
200 source trees (114 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
more than 600 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes more than eleven
hours on vmgump and eight and a half on the Solaris zone.

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ and a
    Solaris zone at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/test/


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

Summary
=======

The Apache Harmony community remains healthy, and has recently
released new milestone builds.  The lack of a JCK continues to be an
issue for Harmony, with no end in sight.


Development and Releases
========================

The Harmony community continues to publish regular milestones from the
5.0 SE and 6.0 SE branches.  On June 1st we published Apache Harmony
5.0 Milestone 14 and Apache Harmony 6.0 Milestone 2.  These are
primarily bug fix releases with about 42 JIRAs being fixed between
them.

In addition to code fixing, there are a steady stream of build system
improvements being committed; and some experimentation talking place
on a separate, temporary branch to enable community comment before
merging back to head.  There is also continued work on
"Harmony Select", which is a headless runtime profile derived from the
existing code.

Traffic on the developer mailing list is steady, representing the
increased maturity of the code.  People remain responsive to questions
and comments.


Community
=========

There were no changes to the Harmony PMC or committers during the last
reporting period, and there are now 50 committers of which ~9 were
active this period.

The Harmony community includes Google Summer of Code participants who
are making a good contribution to the code and community.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache HBase Project

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of Hadoop 
Common and HDFS.

Releases:

* There is currently a release candidate 3 out for 0.20.5
* All developer focus is on the next major release driving at making a 
'developer release' in time for the Hadoop Summit at the end of this month.

Move to TLP is now complete.

We added a new committer Todd Lipcon (todd@apache.org).

342 subscribed to the dev@hbase.apache.org list

Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache HttpComponents Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache iBATIS Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Felix Meschberger resigned as a Mentor for Chemistry. Jean Anderson was
removed (emeritus) from the Incubator PMC at her request. The PMC and Chair
thank them both for their service to the Incubator and the ASF.

On that same note, I'd like to thank Sebastian Bazley, Joe Schaefer, and
others for their continued efforts in striving for data and other
consistency within the Incubator and across the ASF.

Nuvem, a cross-cloud API, has been proposed to the Incubator.

BlueSky's "lost" report from last month is included this month. The project
has had essentially no mailing list activity for two months, and no commits
since January. Both Lucene Connector Framework and River failed to report.
They have been active, are aware of, and apologize for, missing the report,
and plan to provide one next month.

Lucene Connector Framework just reported IP Clearance in late May.

-------------------

= Amber =

Amber is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v1.0, v1.0a and v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows
users to authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources
they control while avoiding the need to share their username and password
credentials.

The Incubator PMC / ASF Board should be aware that:

The community is in the first stages of formation and solely consists of the
developers.

The project has begun with the contribution of code from the initial
developers.


= Aries =

Aries will deliver a set of pluggable Java components enabling an enterprise
OSGi application programming model.

Aries entered incubation on September 22, 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention.

The following sub-components are actively being developed:

* Application
* Subsystems
* Blueprint
* JMX
* JPA

Several new sample applications have been developed to demonstrate the Aries
functionality.

There continues to be a vibrant community as shown by the activity on the
mailing list this year.

On May 26th we released Apache Aries 0.1-incubating, our first release.

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve before graduation:

* Build community  [done]
* Create a release [done]
* Address project scope concerns raised during acceptance vote


= BeanValidation =

Apache Bean Validation will deliver an implementation of the JSR303 Bean
Validation 1.0 specification.  BVAL entered incubation on March 1, 2010.

A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation
* First release of artifacts.
* Grow the community and committer base.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of
* None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report
* Committer offer was extended and accepted by Carlos Vara.
* Apache Geronimo has started using our artifacts in their 3.0 builds for
Java EE 6.
* Apache OpenJPA has started creating a image-gallery sample that shows how
JPA2 and our Bean Validation implementation can be used together.

How has the project developed since the last report
* Rsync of Confluence content to our website is now setup.
* Code has been passing the Bean Validation TCK since May 21.
* We completed our first release on June 11, 2010, which was released as
0.1-incubating.


= Bluesky =

Originally posted for May, but somehow lost during Wiki edits.

BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008. It is an e-learning solution
designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education
between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.

We are still waiting for Bill to check the completeness of the release
candidate. Things we've done recently:

Coding to optimize DTU structure, still under going;
Testing IPv6 and satellite module;
One thing left to the first release:

cast release vote in general list.


= Deltacloud =

Deltacloud defines a web service API for interacting with cloud service
providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner.  In addition,
it consists of a number of implementations of this API for the most popular
clouds.

Deltacloud entered the incubator in 2010-05-17.

Currently gathering initial contributors CLAs and working on setting up
project infrastructure.


= ESME =

Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment (ESME) is a secure and highly
scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that allows people to
discover and meet one another and get controlled access to other sources of
information, all in a business process context.

ESME entered the incubator in 2008-12-02.

The following items have been performed since the last reporting period

* Finally got our new UI up and running which is the foundation of next
release
* Users from various enterprises are using ESME in test installations
* Received some patches from a new contributor in the last few weeks.

The following items are planned for the next reporting period:

* Next release based on UI code
* Other types of authentication
* Integrate Stax deployment in daily Hudson builds (more difficult than
expected)

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve prior to graduation

* Increase community involvement in the project
* Multiple Apache releases


= Etch =

Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a
variety of programming languages.

This last reporting period saw little activity (0 commits, 0 releases).
We're finding it hard to regain our momentum after the dissolution of our
team. James and Scott are using etch in their current projects, and Youngjin
would like to pick up the c-binding. What we lack is the organizational
energy to get things moving.

Holger Grandy and Michael Fitzner have submitted a c-binding for us to
examine. Youngjin is going to be looking at it. I've been shaking down the
etch 1.1 release candidate in my current project, and as soon as I can get
my head out I plan to fix the final administrative issues of the 1.1 release
and try to kick it out the door.

We recently voted to accept Holger Grandy and Michael Fitzner as committers
and ppmc members. They have submitted an Etch C Binding.

Release 1.1 is ready but needs some administrative polish before it is
*done*.

Release 1.2 is next in the pipeline.

Our continuous integration build problem will only be solved by one of us
hosting it at our new gigs. James and Scott are looking into this.
[GavinMcDonald adds: I'm looking into adding Etch to CI stuff at ASF]

Outstanding items:

More community.. we have been Cisco-centered with just a few nibbles outside
of Cisco. Things are definitely changing with members employed or so to be
employed in different places. Building a stronger community remains our key
task. We wish we knew how.


= Hama =

Hama was accepted into Incubator on 20 May 2008. Hama is a distributed
scientific package on Hadoop for massive matrix and graph data.

We're trying to implement the M/R alternative, a new computation framework
for matrix/graphs based on BSP. We are doing this because the Hadoop M/R
model isn't suitable for the complex numerical/relational data processing
since it requires heavy communications among computing nodes.

Recently we made a progress in the design of the overall architecture, and
the development of the BSP cluster with programming interfaces. And, HAMA
project has drawn many interests from Hadoopers.

We are now focusing on the very first release of Hama to graduate from
incubator.


= Kato =

Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.

Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation,
and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.

Recent Activity:

* The project has effectively paused until Oracle's involvement has been
clarified. The credibility of the standard relies on there being more than
one major Java VM vendor involved. Originally both Oracle and Sun were
members of the JSR, but since then Oracle has bought Sun and is now owns
both the HotSpot and JRockit Java VMs.

The following is planned for next reporting period:

* To be determined once Oracle's involvement has been established.

Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in
the project and grow the community.


= Lucene Connector Framework =

Description

Lucene Connectors Framework is an incremental crawler framework and set of 
connectors designed to pull documents from various kinds of repositories into
search engine indexes or other targets. The current bevy of connectors includes 
Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink (OpenText), Patriarch (Memex), 
Meridio (Autonomy), SharePoint (Microsoft), RSS feeds, and web content. 
Lucene Connectors Framework also provides components for individual document
security within a target search engine, so that repository security access 
conventions can be enforced in the search results.

Lucene Connectors Framework has been in incubation since January, 2010.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move 
towards graduation

1. Javadoc and nightly builds need to be set up
2. The first official release needs to be planned and executed
3. Unit tests need to be completed

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

1. We'd like to know whether there is any official Apache position on inclusion of 
NTLM implementations in ASF projects, since we've gotten mixed signals on 
this from other developers. This represents a crucial piece of functionality 
needed to support LiveLink, Meridio, SharePoint, RSS, and Web connectors properly.

How has the community developed since the last report?

1. A number of people outside the committers group have been using this project,
 and there are lively discussions in the newsgroups.
2. LCF was presented at Lucene/Solr Eurocon to quite a bit of interest.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Online end-user documentation is coming along and is perhaps 90% complete.  
Integration with Derby has been undertaken to allow for a robust Junit test framework.



= OODT =

OODT is a grid middleware framework for science data processing,
information integration, and retrieval. OODT is used on a number of
successful projects at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California
Institute of Technology, and many other research institutions and
universities.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation
1. Port OODT code and license headers into ASF license headers
2. OODT contributions from at least 2 other organizations besides JPL
3. At least one OODT incubating release, hopefully in the first few
months

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Either Justin Erenkrantz or David Woollard will be giving a talk at the
TransferSummit 2010 in Oxford, UK on Friday, June 25, 2010 - 3:50pm -
4:30pm on NASA and Apache. The talk will cover OODT in detail and the
transition of the first NASA project into the ASF Incubator and the
experience along the way. After some discussion with Justin, Chris added
himself as a mentor for the project on the OODT Proposal on the Incubator
wiki, since he is an ASF member and Incubator PMC member. Much of the other
activity continues to be from the mentors and committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

OODT was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on January 22, 2010.

Development continues to focus on cleaning up the OODT code and config
license headers, with contributions from Andrew Hart and Sean McCleese, and
on one top-level build for OODT, and one trunk, tags and branches) with
contributions from Chris Mattmann. When OODT-15 and OODT-3 are finished, we
should be ready for 1st incubating release along with some documentation
transferring and getting the website up and running, tracked in
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OODT-16, and assigned to Sean Kelly.


= RAT =

No IPMC or Board issues requiring attention.

Both the Ant task (RAT-73) and Maven plugin (RAT-74) have been extended to
optionally create reports in RAT's XML format rather than plain text.  This
will not only allow custom styling of the reports but also easy report
federations like the one currently created by BuildBot.

Discussion for a new release of RAT to make this feature available has
started but hasn't come to a conclusion, yet.


= River =

*** DID NOT REPORT


= SIS =

Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users
can use to build applications containing location context. This project will
look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities,
services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further,
the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level
community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores,
REST-ful interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under
the Apache umbrella.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

Not at this time

Community progress since the last report:

Mailing list activity has been pretty bare, but should pick up since the
SIS'ers need to follow up after the meeting with ESRI last month to
determine if they are interested with participating in the community. Much
of the other activity continues to be from the mentors and committers.

Project progress since last report:
SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.

Development has slowed, but the intentions from last month still stand.
Chris Mattmann still needs to work on refactoring the LocalLucene code into
the SIS codebase and Sean McCleese needs to finish creating the SIS
incubator website.  Patrick O'Leary is investigating map projections and
coordinate systems including transformations to Polar coordinates which
should help on the observational data side.


= Whirr =

Whirr provides code for running a variety of software services on cloud
infrastructure.

Whirr was accepted into the incubator on 11 May 2010. Status information is
available at http://incubator.apache.org/projects/whirr.html.

Progress since entry into the incubator:

All the initial Incubator infrastructure items are now complete. The code
hosted in the Hadoop contrib area has been moved to Whirr's subversion tree.
Associated JIRAs have been moved to Whirr's JIRA.

Plans for the next period:
* Import the Whirr Java source

Top three items to resolve before graduation:
* Increase community involvement in the project
* Make several incubating releases
* Support at least three services on Whirr

Any Issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board need to be aware of?

None at this time.


= Zeta Components =

Zeta Components is a high-quality library of loosely-coupled PHP components.
It has entered incubation on 2010-05-21. Therefore the project is still in
ramp up phase.

3 most important issues to be tackled:

* Create initial incubating infrastructure.
* Move project and community to ASF.
* Get development based in ASF moving again.

Mailing lists have already been created. Available are:

* dev       zeta-dev@incubator.apache.org
* user      zeta-commits@incubator.apache.org
* commits   zeta-users@incubator.apache.org
* private   zeta-private@incubator.apache.org

Website space has been reserved. Jira has been requested. All CLAs have been
sent. Most of them have been processed and therefore most user accounts have
been requested.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  Jackrabbit 2.1 was released in April:

    * Apache Jackrabbit 2.1.0 on April 22nd

  We also made maintenance releases from the 1.6 and 1.4 branches:

    * Apache Jackrabbit 1.6.2 on June 7th
    * jackrabbit-core 1.4.12 on June 7th

o Legal

  The question in LEGAL-50 about redistribution of the standard JCR API
  jar has now been officially resolved. Thanks to the legal team for the
  closure on this! With LEGAL-50 resolved, we have no open legal issues.

  We use RAT for automatic license header checks as a part of our normal
  Hudson CI builds, and the accuracy of our LICENSE and NOTICE files is
  manually reviewed before each release.

o Community / Development

  No new committers were added in this quarter. This is our third consecutive
  quarter with no new committers. It looks like we need to pay more attention
  to helping out and mentoring contributors. We have traditionally maintained
  relatively high entry criteria for new committers.

  Community diversity remains an issue we pay attention to, as the bulk of
  Jackrabbit development is still done by one company. In this quarter we've
  had eight people committing to Jackrabbit trunk, six of whom are employees
  of Day Software. We satisfy the criteria of at least three independent
  active committers and the community is healthy. Thus I don't see diversity
  as an immediate problem for Jackrabbit, but it's a topic we are aware of
  especially in light of the few new committers we've recently attracted.

o Infrastructure

  The Confluence upgrade caused some breakage on our web site and required
  manual fixing. We are not too happy with our current Confluence
  auto-export setup, and are considering other options.

  Some of our Hudson builds have been failing due to generic Hudson problems.
  We're hoping that the new master server will solve these issues. We're
  also looking forward to a chance to set up a Sonar instance for Apache
  projects.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Labs Project

Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF committers.

[SUMMARY]

Activity at Labs has been very low last quarter.

[DETAILS]

== Labs Statistics ==

- new: 1
- status changes (last 3 months): 1
- total number: 32
  - active: 25
  - idle: 1
  - promoted: 3
  - completed: 3
- labs with commits: magma, pulse, noggit, axmake

== New Labs =

axmake (PI: Mladen Turk): "Advanced XML based native make system"

== Re-activated labs ==

None. Noggit saw 2 tiny commits, the first ones since Dec 2008.

== Completed labs ==

Last quarter's report noted the creation of the Amber Lab. Right after 
it's inception it was taken to the Incubator, without any real dev 
activity here, except discussions.
Therefore, I now count this lab under 'promoted'.

== Community ==

The following statement relates to recent debates about how connected 
(or not) projects are to the Foundation:

I think that Labs is well aware of the Apache way and overall can be 
described as connected to the ASF. For example, the PMC consists mostly 
of very experienced ASF members.  However, due to the special nature of 
Lab projects being mostly solitary endeavors, I don't observe a 
particular strong bonding amongst committers and - even more - amongst 
the PMC. 
This leads to the fact that our community (if you want to call it that) 
is not very close with each other.  Looking at the sustainability of 
each lab, it seems like they either move on early (mostly to Incubation) 
or dry out sooner than later. This "sourceforge" effect, where most 
projects stall and only a very small portion prospers, could've been 
(and probably was) expected at Labs inception.
What's missing is two or three people actively overseeing labs (commits, 
lab status, bugging PIs to post updates to the ML, promoting Labs on 
blogs and elsewhere).

== Lab hacking ==

Development activity was low last quarter, mailing list conversations 
practically non-existent.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

=== Lucene Status Report: June, 2010 ===

TLP

Due to the spin off of Nutch, Tika and Mahout, several
PMC members have been removed.  See the board@ archive for
a full list.  Doug Cutting and Mike Klaas are also now
emeritus.


LUCENE JAVA/Solr

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community has been actively
working on merging the Solr and Lucene resources. Both projects now have a
common codebase and modularization is in progress. The community is working
towards a 2.9.3 and 3.0.2 release.

Added Simon Willnauer as a committer

LUCY

Lucy is a loose C port of Lucene targeted at dynamic language bindings.
Development is active, with the highlight of this quarter being the completion

-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache OpenWebBeans Project

OpenWebBeans is an ASL-licensed implementation of the JSR-299: Contexts and
Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform which is defined as JSR-299.

OpenWebBeans has graduated from the Incubator in 16, December 2009.

--Summary--

* OpenWebBeans core project's Java EE library dependencies
have been removed from it. All of the Java EE related capabilities
are provided via plugin model.
* Log4j library dependency has been removed from project, updated
for using standard Java logging.
* All of the specification requirements have been implemented.
* Hard working for passing Web Profile TCK.
* Problems with TCK has been issued to the TCK team.
* Web Profile TCK has been passed.
* Successfully integrated with Apache Tomcat 6.x.
* Successfully integrated with Embeddable OpenEJB in Apache Tomcat 6.x.

--Current Development Status--

* Working on minor bug-fixing.
* Working for releasing a 1.0.0-CR1.

--Future Development Plans--

* Release the 1.0.0-CR1 version.
* Starting to integrate with Geronimo Server.
* Working on JSR-299 TCK Full Profile.
* We have to provide some user guide documentation.

--New Releases--

* No new release.

-- Discussions--

* No discussions.

--Community--

* No new committers.
* Increasing on community support
* More involvement with dev@ mailing list

-- Problems

Integration with the Geronimo needs help from
the Geronimo Server team because integration with the full
Java EE server seems a more complicated than we think. Therefore
passing the full Java EE TCK may not be possible in near feature.

NOTE: In old reports we talked about standalone TCK. Actually
official TCK does provide Web Profile TCK and Full Profile
TCK. In old reports when we said standalone TCK, we removed
the Web Profile and Full Profile Tests from the configuration.
But now, we have passed the Web Profile TCK that also contains
the standalone tests. Therefore we do not mention about the
standalone TCK in this report.

Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Quetzalcoatl Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

A number of bugs were reported by a new user of the C++ library, and were
fixed.

A couple of outstanding C++ bugs include some larger library changes, and it
is planned to do that work before releasing v1.6.

There is no planned release schedule for 1.6 as of now, although a tentative
release date is in the fall.

An additional work item that may be undertaken before 1.6 is the addition of
some support for XML Signature 1.1 constructs, including some API additions
to handle Elliptic Curve keys and algorithms.

A project-level decision which is under discussion is whether to maintain
support for non-OpenSSL crypto (WinCAPI / NSS).

A new release of the Java library, 1.4.4, is planned for late summer or the
fall. The 1.4.3 release was last summer, and a number of bugs have been fixed
since then.

A triage is planned of new reported bugs to fix for 1.4.4. In particular, it
is planned to make 1.4.4 an osgi bundle. This would avoid dependent
projects having to maintain their own bundles. It is also planned to add
support for the XML Digital Signature 1.1 spec.

Two new members have been voted on to the PMC, namely Colm O hEigeartaigh
and Scott Cantor. A vote was taken, and passed, to nominate Colm as the new
PMC chairperson to the Apache board.

Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

- SpamAssassin 3.3.1 was released on March 19, 2010.  This was a minor
  bug-fix release to fix a few small bugs and add some new rules.

- SpamAssassin 3.3.2 is nearing release.  It too will be a minor
  bug-fix release.

- Our community mailing lists have been well behaved as of late.  List
  traffic is steady.  Volume seems to be up over previous years.

- Daniel Lemke is working to improve native Win32 support for
  SpamAssassin.

- We're slowly progressing to anti-virus update-like frequency of
  anti-spam rule updates.  We're currently in need of more contributors
  of hand-sorted ham (good, non-spam) email for rule QA-testing.

Board issues
None identified.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache Tika Project

This is the second report from Apache Tika in its new TLP status approved at
the April 2010 board meeting.

TLP migration
=========================
All complete! Website has been updated, SVN taken care of, ML lists migrated
and UNIX groups and domain taken care of. Thanks to Gavin for handling this.

Releases
=========================
Since our last report, we've committed some important bug fixes including
TIKA-379 [1] which fixed and allowed HTML elements and attributes to be
available in the parsed XHTML provided by Tika, and some mime type detection
fixes in particular TIKA-417 [2]. We still think we are on target to release
0.8 within the next month or so.

License Issue
=========================
During the last board meeting, there was a question brought up regarding the
licensing issue of UCAR/NCAR's NetCDF java library, which was used to
implement TIKA-400 netCDF Tika Parser [3]. The question pertained to the
question of an "advertising" clause in the UCAR/NCAR license, and the board
asked Chris to follow up on it. Chris took the issue over to legal-discuss@
and a resolution to the matter was arrived upon [4] which included adding
some text to NOTICE.txt and LICENSE.txt in Tika, fulfilling the advertising
clause via the Apache NOTICE mechanism. This issue was tracked and fixed in
Tika in TIKA-432 [5], and is now solved in the current 0.8 trunk, removing a
roadblock to the 0.8 release.

Community
=========================
The Tika PMC elected to add Julien Nioche [6] to the Tika PMC and committers
group. Julien is a Nutch committer, and has been providing quality patches
to Tika (incl. the fix for TIKA-379) and good mailing list support.

Jukka Zitting presented on Tika at the Lucene Eurocon [7] and Berlin
Buzzwords [8] conferences.

Tika In Action
==========================
Chris Mattmann and Jukka Zitting are writing a Manning book called "Tika in
Action", and it is progressing steadily. We are preparing for a 1/3 book
review likely in the next week or so, and the book is about to be available
in Manning's Early Access Program or MEAP, electronically, any day now.

Cheers,
Chris

Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

The Tiles PMC voted to extend commit rights to Michael (Mick) Semb Wever this
quarter. This is an exciting development for us as Mick is just the type of
committer we have been hoping to attract. He is a user who started contributing
patches. All of the previous Tiles committers have come from prior work with
other Apache projects. Mick got busy right away by preparing the release of our
master POM. The PMC released version 2 of the POM a few weeks ago.

More recently, we have decided to use the Nexus repository to host our future
releases. To facilitate this change another release of the master POM is pending.
Other development has continued at its normal slow pace. We are probably due for
a software release sometime in the next few months.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

Summary
--------------
The project continues to be active on a number of fronts.
There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.


Releases
-------------
We have released Apache Tomcat 5.5.29 which mainly fix numerous
bugs over the previous 5.5.28 release.
We have also prepared number of Apache Tomcat 7.0 release candidates
which are used to polish the API before creating 7.0.x branch and
switching to RTC policy.


Security
------------
We have been working closely with security issue reports and the Apache
Security committee on quickly replying to issues, resolving them, and
coordinating public disclosures.

CVE-2010-1157: Information disclosure in authentication headers.
The WWW-Authenticate HTTP header for BASIC and DIGEST authentication
includes a realm name. If a <realm-name> element is specified for the
application in web.xml it will be used. However, a <realm-name> is
not specified then Tomcat will generate realm name using the code
snippet request.getServerName() + ":" + request.getServerPort().
In some circumstances this can expose the local host name or IP
address of the machine running Tomcat.


Development
-------------------
Development was concentrated mainly on releasing Tomcat 7.0
and the effort to make it specification compliant. Tomcat 7.0 also
now passes the TCK with security manager enabled, which was not
true for a very long time.
We plan to release Tomcat 6.0.27 this month and are currently
in the review process. Finally we plan to release first Tomcat 7
public release within the next few weeks.


Community
-----------------
We had a strong presence at Apache Retreat (Ireland) and have determined
the sessions for the Tomcat track at Apache Con 2010.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AL: Status report for the Apache Traffic Server Project

The Traffic Server community has released our first two development
releases, TS v2.1.0 and v2.1.1. These releases includes a number of
improvements, and feature additions:

* Major performance improvements in most layers, increasing throughput by up
  to 2x in some benchmarks.
* Increased cache capacity, we now support up to 0.5PB per disk spindle. A
  new RAM cache algorithm is also added.
* Support for most Unix flavors, including FreeBSD, MacOSX and Solaris.
* Completely new, flexible configuration layout, simplifying the build and
  packaging task for binary distributions.
* Improved 64-bit support.

The project is on track for a late summer / early fall release of v2.2.0,
which will probably be the next public release (there is no immediate need
for a v2.0.x release). This schedule will be adjusted as necessary though.

The community is continuing to see an increase in activity, with questions,
bugs and patches from several new (and returning) participants. At least one
new committer is expected to join the team in the next few weeks.

There are no outstanding issues with our transition from Incubator to TLP.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AM: Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases:

none yet (as a TLP), we hope to do one in the next month or 2.

2010-1-26 2.3.0 (Incubator - last release) release of Java SDK, Annotator
                add-on package, UIMA-AS (Async scaleout), and UIMA-CPP
                (C++ enablement)

Development:

Work continues in standardizing our build processes with Maven
conventions. Builds now generally work with the new maven alignment,
and we're starting to attempt releases with this new structure.

We still have a significant number of issues remain in Jira, postponed
from the last release.  More progress should get made on these after
our Maven re-alignment work is finished.

Issues regarding large scale use of UIMA-AS continue to be reported
and fixed; these often have to do with corner cases involving very
large scale-outs and error situations.

The project-wide POM used as a parent pom is the first artifact to be
released; it is currently in the staging area, and a vote is underway.
This represents the first time the project has used the maven "release"
plugin and Nexus repository for releasing.

A new user is proposing some feature enhancements to two of the
annotators, and this is being looked at.

The main committer on the CAS Editor tool is proposing some future
directions for this tooling that aims at providing a more componentized
approach for additional capabilities.

We are planning to gradually move documentation updates to make more
use of maven's "site" capabilities.

Community: No changes

Issues: No Board level issues at this time

Attachment AN: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project

June 2010 Board Report

Status

We really need someone to step up and do some site/build work. It has
been a hindrance for some time.

Community changes

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

Antonio Petrelli (apetrelli) was voted in as a Velocity committer on
June 2nd.

Velocity Engine project

Released versions 1.6.4 (should be last in 1.6 branch) and
1.7-beta1. Actual development is slow/quiet; one active committer and
one active-voted-in-but-no-karma-yet-committer. Getting good bug
reports and active user list. 2.0 development has taken a back seat to
1.6/1.7 but is not forgotten.

Velocity Tools project

Released version 2.0 finally!! Current development of Tools is
slow/quiet; 1.5 active committers and one
active-voted-in-but-no-karma-yet-committer. Getting good bug reports
and light user list activity. Sandbox directory has been requested by
contributor to revamp Maven build; the PMC agreed, but this must be
done by the chair who has not done it.

Velocity Anakia project

There were no changes in the Anakia code base. No Anakia development
happened in the last month. Several users have popped up with problems
and questions recently, but no one in the developer community has been
able/willing to help.

Velocity Texen project

There were no changes in the Texen code base. No Texen development
happened in the last month. Users are out there, but don't show their
faces around here, at least not in a very long time.

Velocity DVSL project

There were no changes in the DVSL code base. No DVSL development
happened in the last month. No bug reports or list activity in a very,
very long time.

Velocity Docbook project

There were no changes in the Docbook code base. No Docbook development
happened in the last month. No bug reports or list activity in a long
time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AO: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Released Apache Wicket 1.4.8 and 1.4.9

- Release of 1.4.9 sparked a heated discussion regarding the use of
  InheritableThreadLocal. The discussion was conducted civil and ultimately
  came to the conclusion (using a vote) that the use of
  InheritableThreadLocal would be reverted.

- Two issues were reported to the security@ alias, and both issues were
  solved in 1.4.8 and 1.4.9.

- Getting enough binding votes for a release was a problem for 1.4.8. With
  Martijn's company finally adopting Wicket 1.4 for a couple of major
  projects instead of 1.3, things look promising with increased development
  involvement.

- We plucked the fluff from our collective navel in response to Jim's email
  message to the community in the aftermath of iBatis departure.

- Work is ongoing moving from Confluence autoexport based CMS to svnpubsub
  and jekyll. We are also looking for a new website design. This is in the
  early stages of figuring out where to go (both the CMS and design).

- We're looking into moving our Wicket Stuff contributions project
  (http://wicketstuff.org) away from sf.net and self hosted JIRA/Confluence.

Alignment with ASF Values and Policies

During the bi-annual e-mail barrage happening on member@, I asked our PMC
(Wicket follows the policy where committer == PMC member) whether we were
still happy being at Apache. Our navelgazing turned up no specific issues
regarding our alignment with ASF values. Consensus was that we already were
pretty much in alignment with ASF policies and are fine with how things are
going currently.

The biggest issues we identified was with the available infrastructure.

 * being able to use git as our SCM

 * decent cms for managing the site

 * timely updates for confluence and jira

Work is ongoing to switch from Confluence to svnpubsub using Jekyll as a
static HTML generating CMS. The remaining issues are the stale version of
Jira and the GIT support at Apache. Even though most prefer using git over
svn, it is not enough reason to start looking at other pastures. We are
looking forward to a wider adoption of Git at Apache.

As for alignment with Process and Policy, we are running and evaluating RAT
reports for each release. We make our group decisions on dev@, though often
we first poll the PMC to see if there's any support for the suggestions.

Additions/Removals

No changes in the PMC or committer lineup. Our prospected newest addition is
still trying to finish thesis right now and will let us know when he is
ready.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AP: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

XMLBeans is a technology for accessing XML by binding it to Java types. 
XMLBeans also provides APIs to handle XMLSchema metadata, to access XML 
as a DOM or as a low lever cursor based model.

As usual the traffic is steady on the mailing lists, new bugs, 
questions, comments and most important answers were present both 
from committers and non-committers.

There were no new releases, no new committers or pmc changes 
for this period.

There are no issues requiring board’s attention.
