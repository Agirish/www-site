 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       The most notable action of the foundation since our last
       meeting was to leave the JCP EC.  Jim and Geir discuss this
       more below.

       We plan to hold a Members meeting January 18-20.  The primary
       purpose of the meeting will be to elect new members.

    B. President [Jim]

       The last month has been quite a busy one for the foundation. The
       biggest news, of course, has been our resignation from the JCP EC
       and the effort required both pre and post announcement. Kudos to
       all involved; as noted in an email to board@, I am also quite pleased
       that the board is getting less and less "hesitant" about making
       direct and quick decisive action.

       Sally and I attended SC10 in New Orleans and represented the ASF
       at a table which was shared with the Linux Fund. Sally will be,
       as noted in her report, submitting a full report to Concom, but in
       the meantime I'll state that the show was extremely well attended
       and the ASF table received quite a bit of walk-by traffic, mostly
       "We love Apache" and "So glad you guys are here." 

       I've been asked to keynote at POSSCON 2011 and Open Repositories
       2011; I have accepted both invitations.

       I'd like to welcome Melissa Warnkin onboard as our new ASF Executive
       Assistant. In the coming week I will be working with Melissa to
       introduce her to the various committees and VPs who will be using
       her time and talents and coordinating the work process.

       Larry, Shane and I had a concall with Sonatype on December 9th.

       There was some delay and issue regarding obtaining the VSphere
       license from VMware but this was quickly resolved. I received via
       Email the Order, Licensing and Subscription information and
       forwarded it to infra. Thanks again to Bruce Snyder and VMware.
       
       I've pinged the various committees with budget line-items and
       will be working with them for a mid-year budget review.
       
    C. Treasurer [Geir]

    D. Secretary [Craig]

    November saw 48 ICLAs, 3 CCLAs, 7 NDAs, and 3 SGAs received.

    Spammers have discovered the secretary@apache email address. It's 
    not a huge problem (yet) so no action is being taken at the moment.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

    My keynote about our the Apache Way and community development was received
    with interest at OSDC - it was a refreshing reminder amidst some of the
    chaos we see internally that externally, we're still seen as a model to be
    emulated!  I also joined several panel-style discussions at the Sydney
    BarCamp, and the audience seemed to appreciate hearing more about the
    background to us leaving the JCP EC - again, a reminder that although we
    all know the whys and wherefores, it's worth repeating them for those who
    haven't heard yet :-) 

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       While not actually part of my Vice Chairman duties: I met with
       two of our platinum sponsors (Yahoo! and Microsoft) while
       traveling to the San Francisco Bay Area on a personal
       vacation. Our primary contact at Google (our third platinum
       sponsor) was abroad, so a meetup was not possible. A writeup
       and summary will be submitted to the Fundraising group within
       the week.

    Executive officer reports were approved by general consent.

       See Attachment M

       Some concerns about BlueSky and RAT. These projects have
       been incubating for a long time and it's not clear what the

       See Attachment P

       Labs has asked the board to comment on whether it is permitted for
       code from a Lab project to be released with no endorsement by the ASF?

       The consensus is that it's ok as long as the license and branding
       requirements are met. What we don't want is for the ASF to lose rights
       to names of lab projects if the code is distributed and then comes into
       the incubator.

       AI: Shane prepare guidelines for release of Labs projects.

ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

The ASF formally resigned from the Executive Committee of the JCP 
on Thursday, December 9th.  We also stated we are withdrawing
from the activies of the JCP - namely formal participation by 
representatives of the ASF on the expert groups of JSRs.  The 
message was clearly delivered, and I'm still working on some of
the administrative mechanics.

I believe this was the right move for the foundation to make, 
although it should be clear that this is a disappointment to
all that have worked hard of the last 8-10 years to make the
JCP an open and transparent organization for creating Java 
standards.

I'm very proud of how the ASF handled this, both as an organization
as well as individuals, and there continue to be great conversations
going on about this in the community.

Going forward, I'd like to remain as the VP, JCP in the near term
to continue handling our remaining JCP connection - JSR implementation
- as well as deal with further conversations with the community
and Oracle, as I expect both will continue for some time.

This was a major event in the history of Java, and I'm fairly
convinced that the story isn't yet complete.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

One board-level issue: Sonatype's behavior around the Maven mark (below).

No changes in Brand budget are currently expected.

Operations And Community
========================

Projects continue to report status on implementing Branding Requirements and 
have brought good questions back to trademarks@ both about guidelines and about 
various third party uses.

A bug was spotted in the Branding Requirements by the DB PMC: trademarks should 
be used as adjectives, and not nouns; this will be updated shortly and once 
a set of Trademark Policing guidelines is ready, will be pushed to pmcs@.

Drafted and published a number of Trademark FAQ's to more easily cover 
specific types of third party uses of our marks.

External Requests
=================

Contacted a number of third parties about uses of Apache marks; all are either 
cc:'d or bcc:'d to relevant PMC private@ lists.

Contacted a number of third parties using our Hadoop mark, both on general 
branding issues and in particular for Cloudera and Yahoo! about their use 
of Hadoop in software product names.  Third parties in this case should look 
to our Powered By... guidelines:
  
  http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/faq/#poweredby
 
Contacting several third parties about their use of our Subversion mark is 
on hold pending feedback and clarification over trademark policies with 
the Subversion PMC. 

Several third party non-product-related uses of Apache marks were brought up 
on trademarks@ this month.  This both speaks to our popularity, and the fact 
that we have a central place for dealing with these issues.  It also brings up 
some policy questions in terms of how actively we wish to pursue third parties, 
especially when they are not directly software product related. 

External Meetings
=================

Jim, Larry and I had a call with the CEO and legal counsel of Sonatype  
to discuss both Sonatype's use of our Maven mark, as well as to clarify 
past statements by Sonatype's marketing officer.  We came away with much more 
understanding of the positions of our two organizations relating to the use 
of our Maven mark, however not all issues were resolved. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

Cloudera is officially a silver sponsor.  They were invoiced and were 
placed on our thanks page.

FuseSource is officially a bronze sponsor.  They were invoiced and were
placed on our thanks page.

IBM requested a change to the image used for their logo to a simple text
version that does not use their trademarked logo.  That change will be
made this week.

Greg Stein is making a trip to San Francisco and plans to have
face-to-face meetings with both Google and Yahoo sponsorship contacts.

AMD's server donation was setup by ApacheCon as planned.

DONATIONS
The time for 2010 donations is almost over, and plans are set to send out
the thank you letters early in the New Year.

OTHER ACTIVITIES
There's still a lot I want to get back into subversion as mentioned in the
previous report, but this month became very busy with sponsorship relations
and responding to invoice requests, which was great to see.  Hoping to get
more written down over the holidays.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

STATUS:

I. Budget: we shipped ASF stickers and "Ask Me!" badges to BarCamp 
Apache Sydney using the ASF's FedEx account. We've reimbursed Sally 
Khudairi's expenses for the SC10 conference, and paid the balance of 
the HALO Worldwide contract for 2010. Sally will be meeting with Jim 
Jagielski the week of 13 December for the mid-year budget review 
as well.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally continues to work 
with Serge Knystautas and Greg Stein on Sponsorship-related matters, 
as well as with Shane Curcuru on Branding initiatives, including use 
of the ASF logo for BarCamp Apache, as well as use of the ASF logo 
and name for non-Foundation events, 

III. Press Releases: we issued the following press release over the 
PR NewsWire service: 

- 6 December 2010 The Apache Software Foundation and The University 
of Sydney bring "The Apache Way" of Open Source Technology Development 
to the Southern Hemisphere

The above announcement was distributed to a list of technology 
publications and targets in Australia only, and is separate from our 
pre-paid release package (limited to US distribution only).

IV. Informal Announcements: the following announcements were distributed 
to our dedicated press/analyst list (only; not PR Newswire), as well 
as posted on the ASF blog and Twitter feed:

- 9 December - The ASF Resigns From the JCP Executive Committee
- 6 December - The University of Sydney, Alfresco, Atlassian, IBM & 
MaestroDev help bring "The Apache Way" to Australia 

- 17 November - Did you know that communities using Apache Shiro 
include Grails, Spring, Stripes, and Tynamo?

- 16 November - We are happy to announce BarCamp Apache Sydney, our 
first event in the Southern Hemisphere!

- 15 November - Statement by the ASF Board: Honor the Agreement
- 9 November - Statement by the ASF Board on our participation in the 
Java Community Process 

- 5 November - Apache News Roundup from the ApacheCon Show Floor
- 4 November - Did you know that Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, Mahout, 
and Pig form the anti-spam analytic platform for Yahoo!Mail?

- 3 November - The ASF asks: Have you met Apache Mahout?
- 3 November - We are pleased to welcome IBM to The Apache Software 
Foundation as Gold Sponsors

We received hundreds of retweets and comments of support from the 
community as well as the press in response to many of these 
announcements.

We are still seeking success stories to highlight innovative uses 
of Apache products in the "Did You Know?" Twitter campaign. Please 
forward to Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org.

V. Media Relations: it's been an intense month press-wise, with 
dozens of interviews taking place post-ApacheCon, as well as 
numerous project announcements and the ASF's resignation from the 
JCP. Members of the ASF Marketing & Publicity team have been 
particularly helpful in responding to reporter queries and following 
through with corrections to articles and providing background details 
when Sally has been traveling. We will also be locking in the new 
schedule for the "Apache Asserts" blog on ComputerWorld UK within 
the next few weeks.

VI. Future Announcements: we are preparing the following press 
releases:

- Apache-Extras
- Apache OODT as a TLP
- Apache Pivot 3.0

VII. Analyst Relations: we have heard back from RedMonk, Gartner, 
and Forrester regarding the ASF's relationship with the JCP. 
We also responded to a query regarding Tomcat. Geir has been our 
primary spokesperson, with Jim providing additional support on 
process-related issues and general ASF activity.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally will be meeting with Charel Morris 
the week of 13 December to discuss ways to improve marketing efforts 
for the 2011/Vancouver conference and creating a master calendar.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison:

- 13-19 November: Supercomputing (SC10)/New Orleans we shared a booth 
with the Linux Fund, and tweeted our presence there, in advance of 
and during the event. Sally and Jim staffed the ASF table; we have
 been asked to participate in 2011 in partnership with the Linux Fund. 
A full report will be sent to ConCom.

- 11 December: BarCampApache Sydney we issued a blog entry, a joint 
press release with the University of Sydney, as well as a couple of 
tweets to promote the event.

X. PR Newswire account: we have 7 remaining pre-paid, flat-rate press 
releases available through 30 April 2011.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

The ASF joined the WebID Incubator Group at the W3C.  WebID is related to the
Apache Clerezza incubator project: http://incubator.apache.org/clerezza/

The HTML5 licensing issues remain unresolved.  Progress is being made to taking
the spec to last call, with a target of May 22nd.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Extremely quiet month.  No board level issues.

Most of the effort this month went into support for the Branding and JCP VP's.

We have three unrelated efforts where the owners of projects have expressed
an interest in allowing projects here at the ASF based on their work, but
aren't quite in a position where they can sign a CCLA.  We need to work
through the details.

One routine Crypto Notice question was fielded by Larry.

Karen supported Jim with the preparation of the EA contract.

As expected, we haven't spent any of the legal budget so far this year; my
position remains that it makes sense to carry this line item forward as an
authorization to spend without requiring board review.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For November 2010: There continues to be a steady stream of reports
of various kinds arriving at security@apache.org.  These continue to
be dealt with by the security team.

2       Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
1       Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
1       User was hacked, but it wasn't ASF software at fault
5       Vulnerability reports of which:
        1       Vulnerability report [tomcat, via security@apache.org] 
        2       Vulnerability report [tomcat, via security@tomcat] (one was CVE-2010-4172)
        1       Vulnerability report [struts, via security@struts]
        1       Vulnerability report [httpd, via security@apache]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Barcamp Apache Sydney went well. In the end, we had around 60 people sign up,
and about 45 attend on the day. However, it did seem to be the right 45, as
almost everyone spoke at least once, and we had some excellent sessions and
discussions!

Cost wise, we did better than expected on sponsorship, and the slightly lower
than planned numbers also helped. This means the concom expense is likely
to only be $1500, well down from the original approved amount of $2400. (The
exact cost will depend on the exchange rate when we do the balancing payment
between the ASF and ish, who kindly helped out with processing the AUD
donations and expenses)

Plans for another Apache Retreat in Ireland are underway, although no formal
proposal has been received yet. 

Basis Technology are planning to run a "Solr and Text Analytics" conference soon,
and have been in contact with ConCom about use of marks.

There has been no further progress on an event in Brazil - previous plans in
this area have fallen down on lack of local involvement/support, so we have not
chased these opportunities.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Ordered a pair of Dell r510's for $24.2K, slated to be used
for jails and database hosting.

Discussed JVM settings on the ofbiz vmware instance with the
ofbiz PMC.

Discussed previously offered HP donation of a pair of servers:
one for www.eu and one for jails hosting.  Agreed to accept
the donation but will not seek to accept hardware donations
in the future.

Had Y! replace a pair of failed disks in minerva (builds). As it's
a RAID 5 array we had to reinstall the OS.

Patched our JIRA installation in response to the recent security
advisory from Atlassian.

Gavin McDonald did an analysis of our backups to date, pointing
out specific backups that are not going thru cleanly.

Bruce Snyder successfully arranged for a VSphere license from VMware.

Discussed fact that Justin Erenkrantz has moved away from the UCI
campus where our backup server is hosted.  The issue needs further
attention going forward as we need someone local who can change out
the tapes and put the used ones into a a safe deposit box.

Paul Davis made significant progress in our pursuit of read-write
git hosting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

The only news in this months report is about ApacheCon NA 2010.

TAC organised and met up with our attendees on the Monday for a welcome 
breakfast. This has proven successful in the past for getting the group 
together to meet each other and the TAC folks that would be helping 
them during the week. This time was no different and proved yet again 
to be a worthwhile thing to do.
TAC attendees were given an idea of what they would be expected to help 
with during the week.

Great efforts to note were Nick, Ross and Tony, who - are old hands at 
this by now - made a demanding job for the week look so easy.

The 13 attendees all seemed to fit in well, they did the roles expected 
of them well - and this helped them to find their way around and meet 
folks as well as get to know how things worked at ApacheCon. Thanks to 
Shane, Greg and others that also spent time with our TAC attendees. Of
note, Mohammad impressed almost everyone he met and certainly the TAC 
committee present only had good things to say about him. Kanchana was 
also excellent in her lightning talk.

Another TAC attendee, Oscar - also a GSoC student, created a blog post 
about his experiences at ApacheCon.

http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/11/life-after-google-summer-of-code.html

Says it all.

We (TAC members present) had a meeting after the event to discuss how 
it went, what worked and what did not etc. We also talked a bit about 
the future of TAC and its involvement in smaller events - how many can 
we do , how do we choose which ones, what sort of budget do we need, 
etc.. All questions we have not yet answered.

I have some notes from the meeting that I need to expand into proper 
minutes and will publish them to the TAC svn soon and TAC list will 
then start discussing them and initially we will talk about what our 
next event involvement should be.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache APR Project

Releases
--------

APR 0.9.19 and APR-Util 0.9.19
- Released October 17, 2010; four security issues were among the bug
  fixes.  Two of the security fixes had been available for some time
  as patches.
- These are legacy releases primarily for Apache httpd 2.0.x.

APR-Util 1.3.10
- Released October 4, 2010; two security fixes were among numerous bug
  fixes.  A lot of time was spent with current Bugzilla reports,
  particularly those with patches from the community, prior to this
  release.
- This is the current stable branch.

There are tentative plans for a release of the current APR stable
branch in late December 2010.

Community
---------

New PMC members: Eric Covener
                 Rainer Jung

New committer:  Sander Temme

Approximately 45 feature requests and 75 bug reports are open at this
time.  (Last quarter, about five more bug reports were open)

Mailing list activity increased dramatically in October due to
discussions of pending releases.  Otherwise, activity has been lower
than corresponding months in the previous year.

Development
-----------

APR and APR-Util are in maintenance mode.  The last feature change to
APR/APR-Util trunk was in April.

Issues
------

There are no board-level issues at this time.

An ongoing project-level concern is to ensure that adequate attention
is paid to members of the broader community reporting bugs and/or
providing patches.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Archiva Project

Archiva Board Report for December 2010
-----------------------------------

vulnerability issue reported by Anatolia Security Research Group. The 
vulnerability is that Archiva doesn't check which form sends credentials.
An attacker can create a specially crafted page and force Archiva 
administrators to view it and change their credentials. To fix this, a
referrer check was added to the security interceptor for all secured
actions. A prompt for the administrator's password when changing a user
account was also set in place. 

Community
---------

* No new committers and/or PMC members were accepted during the quarter. 

Development
-----------

* Archiva 1.3.3 is scheduled to be released next. This will include
significant performance improvements with regard to scanning and indexing
Archiva repositories. This will be the final release for the 1.3 series.

* Code for the GSOC project for staging repositories support and artifact 
promotion in Archiva, which was initially in a branch, has already been
merged to trunk. Plans to do a 1.4 release from trunk is in place, once 
1.3.3 is finalized.

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Axis Project

Tiny report this quarter.

* Axis2 1.5.3 was released on November 12th.  Thanks to Andreas for Release
Managing.

* Community participation continues to be light but steady.  JIRAs are being
raised, responded to, and resolved, though our backlog is still quite large.

* Website has been moved over to axis.apache.org, with new cleaner look.

No other board-level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Camel Project

Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration framework 
based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns.

Community:
 * No issues that require the board attention.
 * The project community is growing and becoming more diverse.
 * Community contributions increasing at a steady pace.
 * Mailing lists continue to be very active.
 * 5 committers joined the PMC: krasserm, slewis, akarpe, cschneider, cmueller
 * 1 new committer joined the project: joed

Development:
 * Development continues with new features and fixes on trunk
 * Planning started for a new Camel 3.0
 * The PMC ran a survey during the month of Oct on how camel is used
 * The last maintenance release of camel 1.x under voting,
   there will be no new development for camel 1.x
 * A Camel 2.6.0 release is planned for this month as well.

Releases:
 * Camel 2.5.0 released.
 * Camel 1.6.4 is being released (under vote)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Cayenne Project

Development

* Released the first milestone of Cayenne 3.1 (3.1M1) on December 2. 3.1 is a 
  brand new release that features built-in DI container, singleton free 
  runtime and a number of other cool things.

* Work on 3.0.2 (STABLE) and 3.1M2 (UNSTABLE) releases is in progress.

Web site

In line with the requirements to meet 
http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs
the PMC has determined that Apache Cayenne complies in the following manner:

* Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org
(COMPLIES)

* Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe product, etc.
(COMPLIES)

* Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org 
included (Needs work. Consider how to rearrange navigation to avoid confusion 
between links which leave the Cayenne site and those which don't.)

* Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in footers, etc.
(COMPLIES)

* Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site
(OK, other than 'tm' symbols)

* Project Metadata: DOAP file checkedin and up to date
(COMPLIES)

Community

* Xenia Khailenka was voted as a new Cayenne committer.
* September, October and November were rather active months on the user list following
  slower summer months (not sure if this is can be attributed to the earlier PR 
  activity associated with 3.0 final. There's certainly a number of completely new 
  people on the user list). Dev list had traffic at its normal level.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

General
=======
 Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
 responsiveness on both dev and user lists.

 General discussion on Commons-wide policies on component
 versioning, packaging and maven artifact management has been
 at times contentious, but the community has been able to resolve
 issues related to individual components so that development and
 releases can proceed.

 A recurring issue on commons-dev is what level of standardization
 should we enforce across components.  Traditionally, we have given
 individual component subcommunities and release managers broad
 discretion in decision-making regarding build technology, packaging,
 versioning and release contents, insisting only that ASF guidelines be
 followed and that we are open to the input of all community members
 in making component-level decisions.  The price that we pay for the
 flexibility that we individually enjoy as RMs is that it can be frustrating
 and time-consuming to gain consensus on decisions that sometimes
 appear to be - and in fact are - rehashing issues that standardization
 would preemptively resolve.  A good example is the recent (as yet failed)
 attempt to gain Commons-wide acceptance of an updated component
 packaging / versioning policy [1]. While we do not see this as an issue
 regarding Board attention specifically, we welcome input on our ongoing
 discussions related to component versioning and packaging, as other ASF
 projects that use our components may be impacted by our decisions.

 Comments on the tone of messages and the argumentative nature of some
 discussion threads have been acknowledged by the PMC.  We are committed
 to making sure that Commons remains a friendly and collaborative community.

 There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Releases
========
 Commons IO 2.0
 Commons Daemon 1.0.4
 Commons Net 2.2
 Commons Exec 1.1
 Commons Digester 2.1
 Commons Compress 1.1

Community
=========
 * Mikkel Meyer Andersen (mikl) joined us as a new ASF and Commons Committer.
 * James Carman asked to be moved to Emeritus [2] status on the Commons PMC.

[1] http://s.apache.org/UnG
[2] We currently do not have an Emeritus designation on the PMC.  Discussion on
whether or not to add such a designation and a facility for tracking it is ongoing.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Excalibur Project

Most likely this is the last report for Excalibur - the PMC decided to
move the project to the Attic (see Special Orders C ).

Nothing else to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Felix Project

Community

    * User Nick Wilson offered to contribute an implementation of the
      Monitor Admin service specification to Felix. The community voted
      to accept this contribution. At this point, we are awaiting
      paperwork to proceed to IP clearance.
    * Carsten, Felix and Marcel were amongst the speakers in the
      Felix/OSGi track at ApacheCon, where there were a lot of OSGi
      related talks, even outside of this track.

Software

    * Felix Framework 3.0 plus Framework Security Provider 1.4 have been
      certified R4.2 compliant and are now listed at the OSGi Alliance
      web site.
    * Recent subproject releases:
          o Event Admin (1.2.6, 1.2.8)
          o File Install (3.1.0)
          o Framework (3.0.3, 3.0.4, 3.0.5, 3.0.6) - Several minor bug
            fix and performance improvement maintenance releases.
          o Gogo Command, Runtime, and Shell (0.6.1) - Maintenance
            releases for OSGi-based shell.
          o iPOJO Arch for Gogo (1.0.1)
          o iPOJO Core (1.6.6, 1.6.8)
          o Main (3.0.3, 3.0.4, 3.0.5, 3.0.6) - Several framework
            launcher releases to track Framework releases.
          o Maven SCR Plugin (1.6.0)
          o Remote Shell (1.1.2) - Maintenance release to provide
            remote access to Gogo or legacy Felix shell.
          o SCR Annotations (1.4.0)
          o SCR Ant Task (1.0.0)
          o SCR Generator (1.0.0)
          o Utils (1.1.0)
          o Web Console (3.1.6)

Licensing and other issues

    * Regarding the issue raised in last board report of how to handle
      provisional OSGi API in Felix bundles, we have decided for now
      that the best approach is to avoid it and use our own parallel API
      structure or subclassing where appropriate. Our provisional OSGi
      API policy is documented at
      http://felix.apache.org/site/provisional-osgi-api-policy.html in
      our developer documentation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  It is
different from "usual" CI servers in that it expects the individual
project builds to succeed; its purpose is to check the integration of
a project with the latest code rather than a fixed version of the
project's dependencies.  If you want a more traditional nightly build
server, Gump is not for you.  Use Gump if you want to know when a
change in your dependencies breaks your project or when your changes
break other projects.

Gump's intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle
that makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

A new Gump instance running on Mac OS X, Some development that lead to
support for Maven 3.x, work on project branding requirements, no
issues.

== Issues ==

There are no Board level issues.

== Community ==

The Gump project really consists of two parts, the code base for the
project and the ASF installations[1] running this code base to build
many ASF projects as well as some related projects.

The code base mostly does what its current users need so there isn't
much development going on at all.  No new committers have been added.

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.  There are a few people contributing across all
projects and a few additional people maintaining the metadata of the
projects they are interested in the most.

No changes to the PMC.

In November we've been told that somebody was running Gump on top of
OpenJDK7 and encountered some compatibility issues[2] - which is no
surprise, we've always seen problems when we upgraded Java versions.
One of the issues identified led to changes inside Ant's trunk to work
around backwards incompatible changes in javac.  Unfortunately the
results of said Gump installation do not seem to be available to the
public.
 
== Development ==

Gump now supports Maven 3.x as a builder.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Infrastructure ==

Sander Temme installed Gump on an XServe running Mac OS X Server.
This installation is currently only running the small subset of
projects we use for testing.

We've asked the infra team for a new VM to run Gump on top of Apache
Harmony.  Mark Hindess of the Harmony community volunteered to help
with the Harmony side of things.

== Project Branding Requirements ==

=== Project Website Basics ===

The Gump website matched the requiremens ever since Gump became a TLP.

=== Project Naming And Descriptions ===

Many pages only referred to "Gump" - this has been fixed.  The home
page starts with a description and there is no download page.

=== Website Navigation Links ===

We had to add a link to www.apache.org and the security link.  Our
license link points to the 2.0 license directly.

=== Trademark Attributions ===

The requirements are met now.

=== Logos and Graphics ===

Logos still need a "TM" symbol, waiting for somebody with the skills
required to make the change.

It would be good if there was any (at least one) logo to take
inspiration (or steal the typography of "TM") from, but even the
feather at www.apache.org lacks the required "TM" as of this writing.

=== Project Metadata ===

Has been in place already.

== Statistics ==

As of Wed, 8 Dec 2010 the ASF installations check out a bit less than
190 source trees (119 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
more than 700 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes more than sixteen
hours on vmgump and seven and a half on the FreeBSD jail.

The time taken on vmgump has almost doubled when compared to last
quarter while it remains more or less constant on the FreeBSD jail.
Given that we don't have significantly more failures on FreeBSD the
difference is likely related to other things that happen in parallel
on the machines hosting the VM/jail.

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ , a
    FreeBSD jail at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/public/ and a
    Mac OS X Server at http://adam.apache.org/gump/

Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Hadoop Project

    Hadoop status report for December 2010

        Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and
        managing distributed applications running on clusters of commodity
        computers.

        There was one contentious issue raised (HADOOP-6685), which ongoing 
        discussion has continued about which technical direction is better 
        moving forward. There is currently a veto on the patch. This patch is
        not critical to the health of the project.

        6 new PMC members have been added, and votes for several new committers 
        have started. 
        We would like to welcome the follow people to the Hadoop PMC:
          * Eli Collins
          * Jakob Homan
          * Amareshwari Ramadasu
          * Suresh Srinivas
          * Sharad Agarwal
          * Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli

        We have invited a new committer, but so far he has not responded

        We are working with the brand management team about Yahoo!'s and 
        Cloudera's use of Hadoop's name.

        The 0.22 release scheduled for November is still in progress.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

Since the last report the Harmony community have published two new
milestones, 5.0 Milestone 15 and 6.0 Milestone 3, and are currently in
code freeze in preparation for new milestones of both branches.  These
milestones are bug fixes to existing functionality as there is no
significant new functionality being worked on in the project at the
moment.

The ongoing issues around Apache Harmony's TCK license have had a
negative impact on the project's development progress, since it is
deemed most unlikely now that the project will be able to achieve our
original goal.  The majority of developers were working on Harmony code
with a view to achieving a fully compliant and compatible implementation
of the Java specifications.  Some developers have asked to be removed
from the project, and some have gone inactive.

Although we have received support from the Foundation for making a
release of the current code, the Harmony PMC and discussion on the dev
list has focused on the potential for adoption of such a runtime release;
summarized best in the quote from Harmony's dev list "[releasing a
non-compliant runtime] misses the important point that no matter how
safe we, the ASF, think we are there is no point making releases that no
one (with more to lose?) would risk using."  This is reinforced by the
Oracle vs. Google case which serves as a notable indication of the
potential risk to other consumers.

While other diverse points of view certainly exist, it would appear at
present that nobody is stepping forward to develop and release a
non-certified implementation of the specifications.  Until somebody
comes forward with a specific proposal to take the code in a new
direction no options will be ruled out. 

On a more positive note, a number of new developers have posted to the
dev list and a community member posted details of his success running
Apache Hadoop on Apache Harmony!

We believe that Apache Harmony has implemented all the requirements of
the Foundation branding guidelines.

Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Hive Project

Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Hadoop.  It provides SQL to
query and manage data stored in Hadoop in table and partitions and
provides a metastore to metadata information about the data stored in
hadoop.

Releases:
 No new releases after 0.6.0

New committers:
 No new committers since Nov.'2010

Community:
* 244 contributors (commented, filed bugs or contributed to Hive).
  This was 232 at the last report time (Nov.' 2010)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

New PMC Member: Mohammad Nour El-Din accepted, having accepted the election
that took place earlier in November.

Ex-PMC Member: Justin Erenkrantz left the PMC.

We discussed mothballing Droids, but Thorsten Scherler is asking for more time,
and there do seem to people wanting to work with him, so we'll see what happens
between now and the next Board report.  Similarly, Gianugo has joined with
the Stonehenge community to help it decide what to do.

We've decided to broadly, rather than as an experiment, permit podlings to
vote on Committers, as permitted by the Board some months ago.  As long as
at least one Mentor votes for the committer, and proper notification is sent
to the private@, the vote will be deemed valid.

There was some discussion about projects using real-time communication, but
I believe that we've made it clear that all project decisions must be made
via the mailing list, and that all back-channel discussion should be
summarized on list.

OpenNLP, a toolkit for natural language processing; Jena, a semantic web
framework in Java that implements the key W3C recommendations for the core
semantic web technologies of RDF and SPARQL; and Wave, "a hosted, live,
concurrent data structure for rich communication", were voted into the
Incubator.

ESME and Aries were to request TLP status from the Board.  River is in the
process of preparing, and will likely request TLP status in January.

Bean Validation did not report.

-------------------------------------------------------------

= ALOIS =

ALOIS stands for "Advanced Log Data Insight System" and is meant to be a
fully implemented open source SIEM security information and event management
system.

ALOIS is incubating since 22nd October 2010.

How has the project developed since the last report:
 * The ALOIS Debian packages are now available at
http://debian.logintas.ch/all/ (for demonstration and development only, no
official release yet)
 * Demo-Server is available in the amazon cloud (not published yet)
 * Local usage of ALOIS prepared (usage without installing files on the
system)

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
 * Create a public website with information on ALOIS
 * Review Code
 * Write a "Getting started" guide

How has the community developed since the last report:
 * There is no community yet.


= Aries =

Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an enterprise
OSGi application programming model.

Aries entered incubation on September 22, 2009.

The Aries community and Incubator PMC have voted for Aries to graduate as a
TLP. This is an agenda item in the Dec 15th 2010 Board meeting.

There is discussion about making a release, which Karaf and Geronimo would
consume, as soon as we have a decision from the board.

There continues to be a vibrant community as shown by the activity on the
mailing list in the last quarter. The Aries sub-components continue to be
actively developed. Since the last board report we have 3 new committers
(Bartosz Kowalewski, Chris Wilkinson and Emily Jiang) and one new PPMC
member (Holly Cummins).

We are close to moving our site from Confluence over to CMS. All that
remains is for the site to be switched over. The CMS based site will allow
us to update the site immediately after a change is made and more easily
blend in non-wiki content such as that generated by the OSGi Enterprise
Compliance Tests.

There are no further issues to resolve before graduation - the Aries and
Incubator communities have voted to graduate Aries to a TLP.


= BeanValidation =

Did not report.


= Bluesky =

BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008. It is an e-learning solution
designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education
between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.
Current status of developing the next version of RealClass:
  *Complete testing of capture camera pictures with Opencv libaray;
  *Complete Message Parser API encapsulation  and fundamental test;
  *Complete API encapsulation of Server and fundamental test;
  *Complete API encapsulation of en/decode/Audio & Video and Screen data
transmission module;
  *Complete basic testing of communication between Server and Student/DTU;
  *Complete the first version of Teacher interface;
  *Finish testing all the third party library and they all work well  with
QT both under Windows/Linux platform.
  Next step:
  * Testing API of en/decode with testcase of record/playback function;
  * Evolve a final version Teacher interface;
  * Complete the first version of Student interface;
  * Discussion the broadcast algorithm in Server and DTU with certain
developers and try to fufill it as quickly as possible;

= Celix =

Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.

As we are just accepted into the Incubator, startup is in progress. The
donated code has been committed to SVN, and the project site is being
created.
Most important issues are:
- Get everything (Jira, SVN, Website etc) up and running
- Cleanup code
- Generate awareness and grow a community.


= ESME =

Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment (ESME) is a secure and highly
scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that allows people to
discover and meet one another and get controlled access to other sources of
information, all in a business process context.

ESME entered the incubator in 2008-12-02.

The following items have been performed since the last reporting period

 * Successful graduation votes on esme-dev and general@incubator
 * "Proposed Resolution to Establish TLP" email sent to Apache Board
 * Planning for Release 1.2

The following items are planned for the next reporting period:

 * Enjoy life as a TLP (Hopefully :->)

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve prior to graduation

 * Increase community involvement in the project


= Etch =

Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a
variety of programming languages.

For the last 3 months the main effort has been by Holger Grandy and Michael
Fitzner, who contributed integration of the C-binding and pumped out release
1.1. We also heard from Kay Weckemann, starting work on a udp transport and
on security related topics. The BMW team also contributed an alpha version
of a Google Go binding, and is working on a documentation framework.

The three top issues from the last board report have been adressed: We
published release 1.1, we updated the web site and documentation (although
more needs to be done there) and we have set up a continous integration
build.

Although progress is now visible, we still need to get more user and
development activity on our lists.

Top issues currently are:
- plan features and dates for release 1.2 / 1.1.1
- work on further language bindings
- documentation


= Gora =

Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache
Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Port Gora code and license headers into ASF license headers
  2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with
infection into existing ASF projects like Nutch and Hadoop
  3. At least one Gora incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Mailing lists activity is mainly from Gora committers and mentors at
present. The Gora devs did answer a question from a user regarding how to
build Gora over the past month and a few user requests (for Maven Central
publishing and a bugfix) were filed as well.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.

Enis Soztutar and Hentry Saputra contributed a tutorial on Gora and added it
to the website in GORA-16 and GORA-17. Eugen Paraschiv posted an issue in
GORA-19 requesting that the Gora artifacts be published to Maven Central. A
bugfix issue was contributed in GORA-18 by Ioannis Canellos that addressed
configuration issues in the trunk.

Chris Mattmann posted a note to the dev list suggesting a 0.1-incubating
release and volunteering to be the RM. Henry Saputra stepped up and
suggested he would be willing to do it, so it looks like we have the RM
situation taken care of. Chris suggested checking out the OODT release
process doc on the OODT wiki for some pointers on how to get started.


= Hama =

Description:

Hama was accepted into Incubator on 20 May 2008. Hama is a distributed
computing framework based on BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing
techniques for massive scientific computations.

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve prior to graduation:

 * Complete first release
 * Invite new active committers
 * Recruit more mentors

Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

None.

Community development:

 * Mailing list shows increased usage from previous report
 * Filipe Manana has contributed a great part in the development of BSP
computing engine
 * A number of new individuals have expressed an interest in contributing in
various areas
 * Hama workshop accepted at IEEE CloudCom 2010

Project development:

 * Our plan is now much more detailed
 * Work on creating the initial release
 * Maven building support added


= Isis =

Description

Isis is an ASL 2.0 licensed implementation of the Naked Objects pattern. It
is based on contributions of the original Naked Objects Framework along with
a number of sister projects that were developed for the book "Domain Driven
Design using Naked Objects".

Isis was accepted into the Incubator in 2010, September 7th.

Project development (month 3 of incubation):

 * setting up the build process has been finished.
 * Isis has now a Hudson build
 * Discussing the scope of the first Apache Isis release
 * Apache Isis website is up and running (see
http://incubator.apache.org/isis/)

Community Development (month 3 of incubation):

 * A few new names on isis-dev@incubator.apache.org
 * new contributions from Mike Burton (wiki, reported issues and helped with
build) and Sabine Winkler (site, TimePeriod)
 * Holding a public Skype conference led to highly controversial reaction
from the ASF community and probably caused some irritation within the Isis
community.
 * Wiki starting to get some useful content.
 * Lightning talk at LJC OpenConference, Nov 2010 .

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation:

 * Putting good documentation site out as start-off to building larger
community.
 * Getting first release out to demonstrate credibility.
 * Ensuring existing committers all happy with transition to Apache and
support existing users who like to move from NO to ISIS

Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

 None of these issues requires Board attention.

New Releases:

 There is currently no incubator release yet.


= Jena =

Description:

Jena was accepted into the Apache Incubator November 2010
(http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/201011.mbox/%3C4
CEC31E4.9080401@apache.org%3E). It is an existing project migrating to ASF.
It has a large codebase that provides a semantic web framework in Java that
implements
the key W3C recommendations for the core semantic web technologies of
RDF and SPARQL.

Three most important issues to address for graduation:

* Create a code base in Apache with legal clearance.
* Establish the Apache-based community for developers, contributors and
users
* Create and communicate open project processes aligned to Apache

Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

None.

Community development:

We have let our existing communities know that the project is moving
from being an independent project to one based in ASF.

Project development:

The first step for the project is get the incubator infrastructure up
and running, including ICLAs and user accounts.

The project plans to make one last, non-Apache release to give it some
space to setup in Apache with minimal disturbance to users.


= Kitty =

Kitty was accepted into the Incubator on 10 October 2010.

The Kitty Project is a lightweight, production focused, Java-based
application server performance diagnostic and management utility.

The project has imported existing code, lists have been set up and committer
karma assigned.

Presentations were made at ApacheConNA 2010 and LAJUG to promote the
existence of the project to the Java user community.

The current challenges facing the project are:
1. Ensure the code satisfies ASF policies
2. To make the project is buildable
3. Generate interest and grow a community


= Kato =

Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.

Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation,
and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.

Recent Activity:

* While Oracle has expressed a continued interest in the JSR-326, there has
been no change in the podling's status since the last report in June.
* As in June, the project is effectively paused until Oracle's involvement
in the Kato podling has been clarified. The credibility of the standard
relies on there being more than one major Java VM vendor involved.

The following is planned for next reporting period:

* To be determined once Oracle's involvement has been established.

Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in
the project and grow the community.


= ManifoldCF (nee Lucene Connector Framework) =

Description:

Lucene Connector Framework is now called ManifoldCF, by vote of the
ManifoldCF community, and based on feedback from the Incubator PMC.

ManifoldCF is an incremental crawler framework and set of connectors
designed to pull documents from various kinds of repositories into search
engine indexes or other targets. The current bevy of connectors includes
Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink (OpenText), Meridio (Autonomy),
SharePoint (Microsoft), RSS feeds, and web content. ManifoldCF also provides
components for individual document security within a target search engine,
so that repository security access conventions can be enforced in the search
results.

ManifoldCF has been in incubation since January, 2010. It was originally a
planned subproject of Lucene but is now a likely top-level project.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:

1. A 0.1 release needs to be finalized; a release candidate is currently
available for the developer community to evaluate
2. We'd welcome additional active committers
3. We'd welcome long-term contributions to project testing, especially for
newer versions of repository software

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?:

All legal issues have be addressed to our satisfaction at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?:

A book is being written, and we've had a number of extremely helpful
contributions from the field.  The active committer list is still pretty
short, however.

How has the project developed since the last report?:

A release candidate is being evaluated.  Online documentation is now much
more detailed, and includes all javadoc as well.  Contributions assessing
project performance have been made.  Contributions evaluating use of the
FileNet connector for FileNet 4.5 have also been made.


= OpenNLP =

OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural
language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization,
sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction,
chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually
required to build more advanced text processing services.

OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.  Progress since then:

 * SVN and Jira set up complete
 * All committers now have ICLAs on file
 * Accounts have been created
 * Status page created
 * Initial web site created base on ASF CRM

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:

 * Do the code import
 * Resolve potential IP issues
 * Do a release


= RAT =

RAT is a Java library that scans files for known licenses and reports files
that lack any of them.  Three frontends to said library exist in form of a
command line client, an Ant task and a Maven plugin.

RAT entered the Incubator in January 2008.

There a has been zero activity in RAT during the last quarter.


= River =

Apache River is a distributed computing architecture, based on the JSK
Starter Kit Source code donated by Sun Microsystems, for the Jini
Specification. While generally referred to as a Service Architecture, it
might be more easily explained to those familiar with Dependency Injection
as a Protocol Independent, Distributed Dependency Injection Architecture,
suited to both hardware and software. Instead of depending on Protocols
directly for communication, everything is abstracted behind a Java
interface, allowing protocols and implementations to be swapped freely,
programming languages other than Java can also participate.

River has been incubating since December 2006.

The activity on the River project continues to grow and is seeing renewed
interest from people who had previously fallen silent.  The current
development team feels that we are ready to start the Graduation process to
a TLP

The next release 2.2.0 is scheduled for January, this is likely to be a
bug-fix release and will hopefully be our last release before graduation.

New functionality and enhancements has currently been suspended in favour of
bug-fixes and the work towards graduation.  The following rough road map has
been provisionally agreed

 * Graduation as top level project river.apache.org
 * Rename com.sun namespace to org.apache.river
 * Modular build & JDK policy

After this has been completed then the previous work on new functionality
and enhancements will be picked up again.  These will include;

 * Dynamic Grants at Runtime, based on CodeSource, Code Signer Certificate
chains , ProtectionDomain or ClassLoader
 * Dynamic Revoke of Grant's at Runtime
 * Securing proxy downloads and unmarshalling

Additionally work is continuing on the build and test environments.  The
project has recently been able to run all the categories of the QA tests
which is a significant accomplishment, but it does make for a rather long
test sequence.  They have highlighted several bugs which have been fixed.
More of the JTREG tests are also passing after fixes to the environment and
the tests themselves

The website has been moved to the new Apache CMS environment and has seen
further increases in the level of documentation available, particular
articles which are useful to people starting to use and develop River

3 most important issues:
* List future River PMC members and select the initial PMC chair
* Prepare the TLP graduation resolution
* Vote on graduation


= Stanbol =

Stanbol is a modular software stack and reusable set of components for
semantic content management.

Stanbol just entered incubation, on 2010-11-15.

Mailing lists, SVN and JIRA are ready, most user accounts created,
pre-existing code from the IKS project has been imported under a code grant.

The Stanbol community has been invited to participate in a free workshop
organized by the IKS project (*). It is a good opportunity to establish best
practices for collaboration and communication between IKS (an EU-funded
research project in which most current Stanbol committers are involved,
http://iks-project.eu/) and the Stanbol podling.

Branding requirements checked, see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STANBOL-14

Next steps:
* Cleanup dependencies and code as per ASF requirements
* Make an initial release
* Start establishing and growing the community

Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  The biggest news this quarter is the release of Jackrabbit 2.2:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.0 on December 14th

  We also made a number of smaller patch releases:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.1.3 on December 7th
  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.1.2 on October 31st
  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.0.3 on October 31st
  * Apache Jackrabbit 1.6.4 on October 12th

o Legal / Branding

  We have updated our project branding to match the new branding guidelines
  except for a few details that still need to be discussed on trademarks@.

o Community / Development

  No new committers were added in this quarter, but a few old committers
  have become active again and we're seeing good levels of activity from
  other contributors.

  Day Software, the employer of many Jackrabbit committers, was recently
  acquired by Adobe. We expect this acquisition to have little impact on
  their contributions to Jackrabbit.

o Infrastructure

  We are currently using a Confluence wiki for managing our project web
  site, but would like to migrate to an alternative system. The most
  promising alternatives are the new CMS or an svnpubsub-based site built
  with Maven.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Karaf Project

Apache Karaf provides higher level features and services 
specifically designed for creating OSGi-based servers.

Community
=========
We've voted in 3 new committers:
 * Adrian Trenaman
 * Achim Nierbeck
 * Łukasz Dywicki
One committer has been invited to the PMC:
 * Ioannis Cannellos

Development
===========
Two releases have been voted on:
 * Apache Karaf 2.1.1 on November 14th, 2010
 * Apache Karaf 2.1.2 on November 25th, 2010

We're working towards the 2.2.0 release, currently
targetted  for January. It has been delayed because
we're waiting for Aries to release a new version.

We've voted a new logo and are discussing a possible 
web site design change.  We're also planning to move
out of confluence for the website, possibly using
Scalate.

Branding
========
 * project website basics: home page is ok
 * website nav links: we're missing nearly all the links 
   but the one to the main ASF web site
 * trademarks: not really compliant here
 * logo: not really compliant yet
 * metadata: we have a registered doap file

Issues for board consideration
==============================
None so far.  The community is growing and healthy.
We have currently two active contributors that aren't yet
committers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Labs Project

Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF committers.

[SUMMARY]

There has been moderate activity at Labs the last quarter.
What's especially significant is the lack of activity on the mailing list.
We re-iterate one issue to the board, please see below the last section of the report.

[DETAILS]

== Labs Statistics ==

- new: 1
- status changes (last 3 months): 0
- total number: 35
  - active: 14
  - idle: 15
  - promoted: 3
  - completed: 3
- labs with commits: axmake, magma, jaxmas, oak, pulse, monsoon, agora

== New Labs =

monsoon (PI: Florian Moga): Monsoon offers implementations of the Websocket protocol 
according to the latest IETF drafts. 
P.S. oak (PI: Jukka Zitting): oak was new last quarter. I'd like to mention that this 
lab acts as a test for using git as a repository. Jukka is also active within infra, 
and I trust him to involve them as needed.

== (No) Releases ==

In the last report we had one question, but nobody came back to us after the
meeting.  So, probably the question was not properly posed. Let me try again:
Are we ok with PIs taking their lab's code and release it without endorsement
from the ASF?  Say, I have a lab called 'floodgate' and want to release it as
"Floodgate Project 1.0" on my own website open-floodgate.org.  Would that be
ok?

Thanks for any feedback.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

=== Lucene Status Report: Dec 2010 ===

TLP

Simon Willnauer and Koji Sekiguchi were added to the PMC. 
This brings our total to 17 PMC members from 12 different 
companies, spanning the globe. The flagship Lucene/Solr
has 26 total committers from 20 different companies, again
spanning the globe.


Trademarks:
    * Project Naming And Descriptions : 
      We believe this is complete, but are still reviewing.
    * Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
      included.  Likely complete, but under review.
    * Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
      footers, etc.  The main TLP site is converted, subproject sites have
      not.  
    * Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your site
      In progress.  Some have been converted to have TM, some not.  We don't 
      seem to have ready volunteers on the graphical front, so it is slower
      than we'd like
    * Project Metadata : DOAP file checkedin and up to date
      Done

Also, we are beginning the migration to the new ASF CMS, so may push
some of this work to that process.


Issues:
The Lucene.NET subproject community has
been stagnating for some time now and the PMC has stepped in and 
asked the community to respond to growing concerns about the 
viability of the community.  See http://s.apache.org/lucenenet
for the first thread in a very long discussion.  At some point,
we expect Lucene.NET will either apply to be a TLP (after going
back through the Incubator, possibly) or apply for
the Attic (it is clear that the current PMC is not the appropriate place
for it despite the common name since most of us are not .NET users)
and fork off somewhere else under a different name.

We do not believe there is any Board action required at this point, but there
likely will be in the not too distant future once the community has decided
on their future direction.  We do not hold out much hope for this community
since the committers did not even respond to repeated requests to file it's
portion of this report.


LUCENE JAVA/Solr

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community is very active.
The community has just released Lucene 2.9.4 and 3.0.3 and is 
actively working on future releases.

Steven Rowe and Adriano Crestani were added as committers this quarter.

LUCENE.NET

Lucene.NET is a .NET based port of Lucene Java.

Open Relevance Project

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either as it is a niche
area.  Having said that, we have discussed if it might be better
served as simply being a part of Lucene/Solr.  

PyLucene

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
almost entirely an automated port, so this project will never
require a lot of developers.  The user community is active.
The PyLucene 2.9.4 and 3.0.3 releases that reflect the just-occurred Lucene
java releases are ready.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache OFBiz Project

Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

*Project Branding Checklist*
Project Website Basics: complete - homepage is ofbiz.apache.org; the ownership
  of the domain "ofbiz.org" (the OFBiz pre-ASF domain) have been successfully
  transferred to the ASF (INFRA-2625)
Project Naming And Descriptions: complete - use of proper Apache forms, etc.
Website Navigation Links: complete - navbar links included
Trademark Attributions: complete - attribution for all ASF marks in footers, etc.
Logos and Graphics: in progress - include TM, use of consistent product logo; we
  have a logo with a small feather (different from the Apache feather) and without TM
Project Metadata: complete - DOAP file checkedin and up to date

The main pages (index, download) should be now compliant with the project
branding guidelines; however there are several Confluence based pages
(linked from the home page) that still need to be reviewed.

*Releases*
- The process of bug fixing the latest release branch (10.04, created in
  April 30, 2010) is going on (by backporting bug fixes from the trunk);
  we still don't have scheduled a date for the creation of the release
  from this branch (10.04RC1) but it will be voted soon 

*Community and Project*

- No new committers or PMC members
- Community interaction remains strong, user and dev mailing lists traffic
  is high
- Significant new development continues, for highlights see:
  http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Main+New+Features

*Infrastructure/Legal*
- we are currently interacting with the Infra in order to fine tune our
  demo instances (in the effort to minimize the resource consumed while
  maintaining an acceptable quality of service)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache OODT Project

Apache OODT was made a TLP at the November 17, 2010 board meeting. 
This is the first of three initial monthly reports before moving to 
Quarterly in March 2011.

Infrastructure
-------------------

The OODT TLP infrastructure migration went great. Chris Mattmann 
created a set of issues and then linked them together (see here [1]), 
and Gav quickly got everything up and running. Thanks to infra@ for 
rocking it and getting our TLP set up!


Releases
-------------

Shortly before the TLP process, OODT made its *first Apache release*, 
version 0.1-incubating, detailed here [2]. David Woollard did a great 
job as the RM, congrats on his pushing through his first Apache release. 
We are currently actively working on version 0.2.

Press
---------

Chris and Sally are working together to make a joint NASA/JPL/Caltech and 
ASF press release on OODT@theASF. Sally said she expected the OODT PR to 
go out on the wire on the 14th. The NASA/JPL/Caltech release is in its 
2nd draft, and Brian Knosp from JPL is in touch with Sally and will send 
her a copy of the announcement. OODT is the *first NASA* project to be 
hosted at the ASF. Yay!

Community
----------------

We've had a number of contributions fly in from a variety of new people 
on the OODT@Apache scene. Rishi Verma has been going back and forth with 
some productive user-facing mailing list questions and discussions regarding 
using OODT product servers. Tom Bennett, all the way down in South Africa, 
has been using the software in the context of the Square Kilometer Array 
(SKA) project, and has even contributed a patch to fix a timezone issue 
in the File Manager (OODT-62 [3]). Victor Hwang has also been helping out 
(contributing in part to OODT-9 [4]). Faranak Davoodi contributed a small 
patch in OODT-83 [5] to fix a typo in the pushpull pom.xml.

Development
-------------------

Work progresses towards the 0.2 release. Paul Ramirez has volunteered to RM 
the next release [6]. Brian Foster has been discussing and contributing a 
number of patches and issues (see [7, 8] for some samples). Cameron Goodale 
volunteered to help with some bugs/issues we're seeing with Maven ${oodt.version} 
numbers in pom.xml files (e.g., see OODT-63 [9]). Chris Mattmann, Sean McCleese, 
and Victor Hwang contributed a configurable OPeNDAP-based profile server in 
OODT-9 [4]. In all, development is progressing!

Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Shiro Project

Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security framework
that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise session
management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:
- No releases since our first 1 Nov 1.1.0 release as a TLP

Community & Project:
- No new committers or PMC members

- Continued user participation on the mailing lists.  This last month
  probably represents the highest user activity with regards to
  opening Jira issues and providing patches, a healthy sign that our
  project continues to grow as a new TLP.

- The development team is discussing as to when our next release might
  be, whether it will be before or after the holidays.  It is not
  currently decided if it will be a 1.1.1 point release or a
  1.2 minor release.

- There has been a lot of discussion in the last month by both users and
  developers as to the best way to support Shiro integration with
  3rd-party (ASF compatible) frameworks and libraries - either include
  the code as 'support modules' within Shiro's codebase, or to have the code
  reside somewhere else, like a 'shiro-extras' project, similar in concept
  to Apache Wicket's 'Wicket Stuff' project.

  The difficulty in deciding is based on 1) the likelihood of the dev
  team supporting an increasing number of integration modules directly at
  the level of quality we wish to maintain and 2) whether or not a
  security framework like Shiro should support frameworks (like
  Wicket and Struts2) that sit 'higher' in the application stack.
  Ideally we'd like the respective web communities to support Shiro since
  we believe it is in their scope to do so, rather than Shiro (a
  security framework) writing integration for multiple
  web frameworks.  This is an ongoing discussion and we've yet to come
  to a decision.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Sling Project

Sling is an OSGI-based scriptable web framework that uses a Java Content
Repository, such as Apache Jackrabbit, to store and manage content.

Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

- we've been releasing nightly sa-update updates pretty consistently since
  our last report to the board; these incorporate new rules and automatically
  generated scores based on nightly statistical results generated from
  current spam email.

- there is interest in releasing a new minor release in the near future,
  talks about this are underway.

- we continue to solicit new mass-check contributors; the more ham
  and spam emails that we can test rules against the better the
  accuracy of SpamAssassin's published rulesest.

- development activity has been focused on preparing Apache SpamAssassin for
  all aspects of an IPv6 world... from email (and spam!) originating on IPv6
  hosts, traversing IPv6 hosts, and ultimately being received by IPv6 hosts.
  support was already decent in version 3.3.0 (and somewhat before then),
  we're now focused on integrating things like IPv6 DNS blocklists and
  whitelists.  the ASRG (Anti-Spam Research Group) is also currently
  discussing best practices with the aim of releasing an RFC to specify a
  standard for everyone to implement in completely incompatible ways.  as
  always SpamAssassin will remain flexible to whatever varying number of
  methods become popular.

- users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

== Branding ==

While we've been careful to ensure "proper" branding of Apache SpamAssassin
since joining the ASF nearly a decade ago, we have not started on meeting
the specific requirements of the current branding requirements.  You'd be
hard pressed not to know we were "Apache SpamAssassin" when visiting our
non-wiki web pages.  Some areas of our wiki need updating to reflect the
Apache brand.

The following is a cursory review of our current branding:

Project Website Basics: mostly compliant

  All but sa-update mirrors are hosted on ASF infrastruture under the
  apache.org domain.

  Currently no link to www.apache.org on the project home page.

Project Naming And Descriptions: somewhat compliant

  The project home page uses "Apache SpamAssassin" prominently.  The download
  page isn't as good at using "Apache" in front of "SpamAssassin, but I think
  it'd be pretty difficult to miss the big bold "The Apache SpamAssassin
  Project" at the top of every page on our website (excluding the wiki).

  We do not have a one sentence project description on our home and
  download pages, although I note that the example provided at
  http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#naming is actually three
  sentences in length, so I don't feel to bad about our 5 feature bullet
  points decribing the project on our home page.

Website Navigation Links: not compliant

  We fail on all points.

Trademark Attributions: not compliant

  While we're generally good about using the term "Apache SpamAssassin" we're
  short on "TM"s.

Logos and Graphics: half way there

  We're consistent with logo use but lacking the "TM"s.

Project Metadata: in progress

  A DOAP file exists.  It's accurate, except for an incorrect link to our bug
  tracker.

Other Trademark Guidelines:

  spamassassin.org has been assigned to and managed by the ASF for the better
  part of a decade.

Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Synapse Project

Community

The Synapse community keeps going well. Mailing list traffic is solid
and continuous, with new users on a regular basis. We voted in a new
committer: Charith Wickramarachchi

Releases
The release vote on Synapse 2.0 is currently underway.

Board issues
None identified.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Thrift Project

Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

Community
We have not added any new committers this month. There has been a relatively
steady flow of issues and patches, though.

Releases
We've informally voted to roll an 0.6 release soon. This should be completed
by the next board meeting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

It's been another slow quarter for Apache Tiles with no changes in the PMC and
no new releases. I have not looked at the trademark/branding requirements yet
to make sure we are in compliance, but we will do so by our next report.

We had a very good discussion on the dev@ list about the future of Tiles. My
initial thought going into this discussion was that Tiles has "stabilized" and
would soon be getting ready for the attic. However, it came out in this 
discussion that there are still some revolutionary ideas about the project. Some
of these ideas are already being fleshed out in the sandbox and we are expecting
to see further progress in the next six months or so. We will reevaluate at that
time whether the project still has momentum or if we should be looking at the
attic.

One of the things we discussed is the lack of new committers. Tiles sees plenty
of activity on the user@ list, but those users very rarely turn into project
committers. Several possible solutions were raised. Some of them included 
forking the project to Google Code or even to see if the Spring people would be
interested. We do seem to have a high user base within the Spring community.
However, it is unclear to me how the project would gain more momentum
elsewhere than it has with Apache. I'm not sure what the barriers are at Apache
that would automatically be lifted by moving the project elsewhere. Perhaps we 
should instead be trying to do more to bring some of the users on board as 
committers. At any rate, the direction for now is to wait and see what happens
with the new development and see if the project sees new life.

Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

Summary
--------------
The project continues to be active on a number of fronts.
There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.


Releases
-------------
Apache Tomcat 7.0.5  - released
Apache Tomcat 7.0.4  - released

Apache Tomcat 5.5.31 - released

Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.31 - released


Security
------------
We've been working closely with security issue reports and the Apache
Security committee on quickly replying to issues, resolving them, and
coordinating public disclosures.

CVE-2010-4172 The Manager application used the user provided parameters
sort and orderBy directly without filtering thereby permitting
cross-site scripting.



Development
-------------------
Development was concentrated mainly on fixing bugs for the current
releases and pushing those releases out.

Thanks to the infrastructure team (specifically Gavin in this case) we
now have CI builds of the Tomcat 6 & 7 docs that will update with every
commit.

The new front page for Tomcat 7 has been developed and we are
working on the new Tomcat site with the same look and feel.

A work has begun on Parallel deployment, a feature that
essentially allows having two (or more) versions of the same
application deployed side-by-side..

We have also made sure to make our project compliant with the
newest ASF trademark guidelines.


Community
-----------------
We are pleased to have two new members in our team.
Christopher Schultz and Sylvain Laurent were voted as new committers.
We have also launched the official Apache Tomcat project Twitter feed.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases:

2010-Dec-10 Apache UIMA Java SDK version 2.3.1 released (just now!). 
  This is the first release of the base UIMA infrastructure,
  done as a top level project.  Some loose ends remain in getting
  our website updated and in sync with this release, and the
  announcement will be sent when that is complete.

  We will be working on releasing the other 3 major components
  (UIMA-AS, UIMA-CPP, and the Add-ons package).
 
2010-1-26 2.3.0 (Incubator - last release) release of Java SDK, Annotator
                add-on package, UIMA-AS (Async scaleout), and UIMA-CPP
                (C++ enablement)

Development:

One-time setups needed to build UIMA have been simplified considerably,
as we continue to move closer toward the conventional Maven way
of doing things.

Jira issues continue to come in and get worked on at a moderate rate,
including several in the UIMA-AS (Asynchronous Scaleout) area related
to various error recovery scenarios.

The CAS Editor had many user-requested improvements,
which made it into this release.

Community:
 
No changes, however, several new projects that incorporate
UIMA have entered the incubator, including OpenNLP and Stanbol.

A patch to enrich documents indexed in Solr with UIMA pipelines has been
provided (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2129),
and a new component to consume UIMA annotations inside a
Solr instance has been proposed for inclusion in the sandbox.

Stanbol is planning to use UIMA inside two of its modules: FISE for semantic
content enrichment (http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/FISE)
and Rick an infrastructure to handle content and
knowledge (http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/RICK)

Issues: No Board level issues at this time

Trademarks/Branding: We've entered a Jira issue for this
but haven't yet done any work on this.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Voted in one new committer and made him a PMC member: Pedro Santos.

- Released Apache Wicket 1.4.12, 1.4.13, 1.4.14, and 1.5-m2 and 1.5-m3

- Discussions started about finalizing 1.5

- Internal discussion on apache-extras for our wicket-stuff side project

- Almost in compliance with the trademark/branding requirements

Finalizing 1.5

Our newest release is feature complete, and we're going to finalize Wicket
1.5 soon. One point of delay may be support for HTML 5 markup.

Internal discussion on apache-extras for our wicket-stuff side project

A discussion within the PMC concerning the future of Wicket Stuff
(http://wicketstuff.org, currently hosted at sf.net) when given the choice
between github and apache-extras showed PMC members preferring github.
Assorted PMC member reasons to go with github instead of googlecode:
simplified user management, better patch support, huge project repository and
git.

The reason why this discussion was held privately was because the impending
announcement of apache-extras. The delays announcing apache-extras have been
a hindrance for our project. We are looking for a new host since August and
can't publicly discuss options until the official announcement has been made.
Once public, we'll take our future of wicket-stuff to our dev list and let
the grander community decide where to take wicket-stuff.

Compliance with branding/trademark guidelines

Only our logo on the webpage does not comply in missing a TM. We're still
working on a new web design and will incorporate the TM in that design. All
other items on the checklist are fulfilled.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

As usual there are a steady number of messages on the mailing lists, the
code commits are mostly bug fixes as the technology becomes more stable.
There is almost one year from the latest release, this should make us think
about planning for triggering another release.
 
For this last quarter, there were no new releases, no new committers or PMC
changes. At this time there are no issues requiring the board's attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache ZooKeeper Project

ZooKeeper status report for December 2010.

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed
applications.

As of November 17, 2010 ZooKeeper became a TLP. Prior to this move ZK
was a subproject of Hadoop. The work of moving us to TLP has been
underway for the past couple weeks, an umbrella JIRA is available for
tracking progress:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-940

HUGE thanks to the Infrastructure team for setting up the TLP
infrastructure so quickly/efficiently:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-3228

The community has been actively working toward the 3.3.2 release for
the past several months, released on November 11th. Mailing list
activity (questions and answers) has been steadily increasing, both on
the dev and user lists.

Releases:
* 3.3.2 fix release on November 11th.

Two releases are in progress, near term (Q1) a 3.3.3 fix release, and
longer term 3.4.0 feature release.

New committers:
None. However this issue has been under active discussion for the past
several months. Once the initial TLP related work is completed we will
be officially considering a number of new committers (contributors we've
been actively mentoring).

Community:

* 6 active committers
* 5 PMC members representing 2 unique organizations
* 182 subscribers on dev
* 375 subscribers on user
