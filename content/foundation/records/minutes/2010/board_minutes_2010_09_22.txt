 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       Thanks again to Sally for helping to arrange our annual
       face-to-face meeting earlier this month!  This tradition pays
       throughout the year.  With the opportunity to better know other
       directors, we reduce our chances of wasteful flamewars and
       increase the likelihood of teamwork.  Also, dedicating a full
       day meant we could take the time required to discuss some
       difficult issues in depth.

       Last weekend, the Board's mailing list saw another airing of a
       project's desire to switch from Subversion to Git for source
       code management (SCM).  The Board declined to address this
       beyond remarking that SCM for ASF projects should continue to
       run on hosts that the ASF controls and that further details
       should be worked out directly with the infrastructure team.  In
       particular it seems that infrastructure volunteers are needed
       to resolve various issues before read/write Git can be fully
       supported.

    B. President [Jim]

       Since the appointment, Justin and I have been coordinating the
       transition. At this stage, it is mostly moving stuff (contacts,
       emails, queries) from Justin's plate onto mine; since Justin knew
       he would be stepping down, he wisely chose to hold off on some
       issues until his replacement was on board. Signatory and credit
       card transitions are being handled by Craig, Sam and Geir.

       The issue of ASF support for git (actually more than just "support"
       for git, which we do now in some fashion anyway) was brought up
       again. One result of the thread however is that Nick Burch,
       Tony Stevenson, Philip Gollucci are planning a small get-together 
       at Atlanta to more fully discuss git, focusing on what it would take,
       infra-wise, to more fully support git (if possible).

       I've been in contact with Ebon Worland, our Account Manager at
       Corporation Service Company (CSC) regarding the officer transition.

       Sam and I had a concall meeting with Karen Sandler from SFLC,
       mostly to start the transition process from Justin. Both Sam and
       I agreed that SFLC had done more work for us than we had been
       previously aware of, and that we will work to ensure that better
       "transparency" of SFLC's efforts will be recorded and reported.

       While at the f2f, I renewed HALO's 6-month extension. The invoice/
       bill has been recorded and approved.

       The RFP for the ASF's Exec. Assistant was released on Sept. 8th.
       So far we have received some very good candidates. I have followed
       up with each submitter and hope to have a final candidate by the
       next board meeting.

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

      Books are up to date - $20 discrepancy remains (haven't spent time).
      Current balances are total cash of $461,436.34 at Wells Fargo and
      $27,649.12 at Paypal.  
      
      There have been no lockbox deposits since last report.
       
      Tasks Done:
       - paid D&O insurance

      In Progress:
       - bills to be paid 
       - preparation for FY2010 US Tax filing.  Still working on QB but 
         CPA and I are active on this 
       - find the $20 discrepancy in checking

 8. Discussion Items

    The board went into executive session for 10 minutes.

    Regarding the Microsoft petition for certiorari that has been 
    circulating on the internet:

    As Vice President, Legal Affairs, Sam has the authority to speak for
    the foundation. It is likely that he will represent the ASF to agree to
    support Microsoft in the petition. 

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Roy:    Update /dev with rule that invitation only dev meetings are OK,
              provided that such meetings are discussed on the dev list, and
              that all committers are included.
              Status: not done

    * Geir:   Invoice Google for GSOC
              Status: Noirin will take this AI

    * Sam:    Investigate Xalan licensing dispute.
              Status: Instructed the PMC that they are free to proceed -
                      either by applying the patch, rejecting the patch,
                      requiring an ICLA, or even adopting enhanced pedigree
                      requirements such as those that Harmony uses.

                      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XALANJ-2438

    * Sam:    Resolve the NTLM action item for the Incubator.
              Status: Pursuing via JIRA (suggest the board action be dropped).
                      Do NOT feel that the various Microsofts non-assert
                      covenants help us, but absent a known patent, this is
                      little different than not having a covenant.   Notably
                      Microsoft did not list a patent that applies to this
                      standard when the enumerated patents that apply to
                      other standards.  Larry is pursing with Microsoft in
                      parallel.

                      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-80

    * Doug/Philip: Initiate a discussion as to what items the board should
              periodically request be included in reports (example: diversity)
              to the mailing list. (Original context: JackRabbit)
              Infrastructure section
              Status: In Progress

    * Doug:   Communicate the need to address the question of xml-security vs
              Santuario for all the resources, and the fact that board reports
              are public.
              Status: In Progress

    * Jim:    Start the process of hiring an EA based on the job
              description that Sander produced.
              Status: RFP released. Already rec'ing good, qualified
              candidates. Jim should have a proposed candidate and budget
              for next month's board meeting.

late - will give verbal if allowed.  Nothing to report - no real 
news from JavaOne.  Expect real news from the October 2 face to face.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

No board-level issues noted.

Operations And Community
========================

Submitted a [DRAFT] Event Branding Guidelines to concom@ to provide 
some much more specific rules for third parties running events using 
our marks; this is becoming a very popular question with many third 
parties wanting to run Apache project-branded or related events; some 
of the branding of these events is starting to cause concern.

Apache Project Branding Guidelines still awaiting sufficient 
personal time to kickoff (kindergarten started last week!).

External Requests
=================

Answered several non-infringing questions from third parties.

Received a new report of a third party in Indonesia mis-using our 
branding; will work with legal-internal@ as needed to review how 
best to file any appropriate complaints.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

Yahoo is due to be invoiced.  I need to coordinate with Greg to confirm
where the invoice needs to be sent.

My biggest concern right now is sponsor maintenance.  I feel like I'm
handling most other fundraising duties well that are mostly unglorious paper
pushing, such as thank you letters, book deals, processing new sponsors,
etc...

However when I first became the fundraising VP in late 2009, the overriding
concern I heard from sponsors and other involved ASF'ers was that sponsors
needed more attention.  That remains the case as I'm not communicating to
them enough.

In Boston, I spoke with Sally about how she could help, and how we can
coordinate to reach sponsors ahead of the game.  I'm going to be sending
them notes about ApacheCon to hopefully meet some, as well as letting them
know about PR opportunities that Sally has as part of her tasks.  We'll work
to stay ahead of upcoming events.

Greg, Sally, and I have been moving towards looking for more smaller
sponsors.  We think there would be small-medium corporations that would find
the bronze and maybe even silver sponsorship attractive.  This would lessen
dependence on individual large sponsors, and we think this could scale,
though we have yet to determine how to best market that sponsorship.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

STATUS:

- Budget: no expenses during this time frame. Jim signed the HALO 6-month
contract extension, to begin on 1 October.

- Fundraising liaison: the second face-to-face meeting took place with Serge
and Sally during the ASF Board Meeting.

- Press Releases: no press releases were issued over PRNewsWire during this
time.

- Informal Announcements: the following announcements were posted on the ASF
blog and Twitter feed:

-- 30 August: Registration Opens for ApacheCon North America 2010 

-- 9 September: The ASF is seeking a part-time Executive Assistant 

-- 11 September: Announcing The New ASF Executive Officers 

Special thanks to the Infra team for automating the news headlines from blog
post to apache.org home and news pages!

The "Did You Know?" Twitter campaign is ongoing. We're still seeking success
stories -- please forward to Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org.

- Media Relations: the ASF blog on ComputerWorldUK launched with the first
article published by Bertrand Delacretaz. The ComputerWorld team are fixing
their blogging application, so it may take a few more weeks before our next
articles are live.

- Future Announcements: upcoming announcements include next release of
Subversion, next release of Maven, and ApacheCon keynotes + sponsors.

- ApacheCon liaison: Sally is working with our new PR team on day-to-day
outreach, including securing media coverage, signing on media partners, and
placing bylined articles from speakers + planners.

- (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison (in partnership with
ConCom):

-- 30 September-1 October: Open World Forum/Paris -- things seem rather quiet
from the organizer's end; we haven't heard from them since early Summer.

-- 7-8 October: Lucene Revolution/Boston -- we've been offered free booth
space which will be staffed by Glen, Shane, and Sally.

-- 13-19 November: Supercomputing (SC10)/New Orleans -- we've been offered
the chance to share a booth with the Linux Fund. Sally will likely be there
and is following up on this; we'll need at least one other ASF-er there as
well. Volunteers welcome!

- PR Newswire account: we have used 8 of the 10 pre-paid flat-rate press
releases on PR Newswire. The remaining 2 releases are available until 6
October 2010. Our additional set of 10 are available until 30 April 2011.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

No board level issues.

The W3C is still contemplating the next steps on the proposed new 
W3C license.

The HTML WG has proposed a schedule for getting to an (initial) last call:

Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Progress is being made on addressing the two board level action items:

  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-80
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XALANJ-2438

Microsoft recently filed a petition for certiorari in the US Supreme Court in
the Microsoft v. I4I case.  Larry is pursuing additional information.  The
likely outcome is that we should express our support for Microsoft's petition.

Mozilla has release a draft alpha of MPL 2, which is intended to be Apache
License, Version 2.0 compatible.

Pursuant to our discussion in the F2F board meeting, Larry has put out a call
for additional attorney volunteers.  None of the people identified so far have
participated in legal-discuss to date, which is a bit of a concern, but nobody
has been ruled out.

Absent a General Counsel, we still have the potential problem of "lawyer
shopping".  I'm looking to identity concrete cases of problems when it occurs.
None have been identified since the F2F :-)

Meanwhile, we should be able to mitigate this somewhat by limiting access to
multiple lawyers to the Officers that routinely would have need to access such
resources.  I believe that would be President; VP, Brand Management; and VP,
Legal Affairs.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For August 2010: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@apache.org.  These continue to be
dealt with by the security team.

1      Support question
3      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
4      Vulnerability reports of which
       2      Vulnerability report [hadoop via security@hadoop.apache.org]
       1      Vulnerability report [jackrabbit, via security@apache.org] (Was normal bug)
       1      Vulnerability report [Traffic Master, via security@apache.org]

Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Gavin McDonald is in the final phase of migrating all necessary Solaris
zones from helios to FreeBSD jails.

Hudson master has moved to a new machine (aegis) and begun using LDAP,
thanks to Tony Stevenson and Niklas Gustavsson.  Jukka Zitting notes
it may be time to start experimenting with running Hudson slaves on EC2.

Sander Temme is preparing eve (Xserve) for hudson and buildbot usage.

Daniel Shahaf patched the downloads script to deal with a potential
XSS vulnerability.  Unfortunately some stray code wound up in production
due to anakia deployment issues, which took the downloads script down
for several hours.

Sander Striker signed a Dell "letter of liability" for Dutch equipment
purchases for SARA.

Stefan Bodewig was given full infra karma due to his vmgump contributions.

Ulrich Staerk was given full infra karma based on his work on s.apache.org,
jira, and confluence.

We received 2 disks from Silicon Mechanics and replaced a failed disk in
eos(www).  The replaced disk will be shipped back to Silicon Mechanics
under RMA.

We ordered a disk array from Silicon Mechanics to be drop-shipped to Bart
van der Schans in the Netherlands for eventual deployment at SARA.  Cost
was ~$5700.

Started up a project for creating a custom CMS for Apache.  Initially it
will target www.apache.org, with something for people to review around
Apachecon in November.

Gavin McDonald proposed some new equipment purchases to build our our
VM infrastructure.

Upayavira completed the domain transfer for ofbiz.org.

Ari Maniatis is pursuing hosting an svn mirror in Australia.

Don Brown is pursuing the idea of getting support
for the Confluence auto-export plugin.  Go Don!

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

Travel Assistance Report September 2010
=======================================

Atlanta
-------

We have confirmation from the organizer that Hotel rooms are booked and it 
seems most people have signed up for the Conference.

Tony, one of our Judges and TAC man on the ground has confirmed he is able 
to attend.

As mentioned previously, we have re-opened applications for a brief one 
week period, for any committers whose circumstances have changed since the 
initial opening period. We reserved a little bit of budget for this purpose 
and have added extra questions as to why they did not apply initially and 
what has changed since then etc.

With just over 5 weeks to go, there is not much more to do apart from any 
final applicants and then work with planners as to what we can get out TAC 
applicants to help with.

Hursley
-------

Hursley has ended, Nick/Upayavira whom attended will hopefully provide a 
summary for us next month as to how it went, was it worth our participation 
etc. 

We had one applicant pull out mid-week before the event at the last minute 
due to a personal injury. We have asked about insurance so we can claim back 
any costs if possible, the applicant stated he had no insurance. We will 
amend our question set and requirements in light of this, and will no longer 
be accepting any applicants unless they can provide proof of their travel 
insurance.

The remaining applicants that did attend were a delight apparently.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache APR Project

Releases
--------

There have been no new releases from the APR project in this period.  There
are a handful of fixes ready to release in the current stable branches of
both APR and APR-Util.

Community
---------

New committers: Dan Poirier
                Philip M. Gollucci
                Stefan Fritsch
                Rainer Jung
                Paul J. Reder
                Neil Conway

Of these six, Neil is new to the ASF as a committer, while the others have
been committers on other ASF projects.

Additionally, commit access was offered to another member of the community
-- Kevac Marko -- but no response was received.

This relatively high influx of committers represents a thorough search of
candidates for committership and subsequent discussion among PMC members.

Approxmiately 45 feature requests and 80 bug reports are open at this time.

Mailing list activity has been relatively low for the past four to five
months. (One cause may be that there have been no proposed releases being
discussed or voted on.)

Development
-----------

APR and APR-Util are mostly in maintenance mode.  The bulk of the commits in
this quarter have been for compatibility with more build tool versions or
for general cleanup.

Issues
------

There are no board-level issues at this time.

An ongoing project-level concern is to ensure that adequate attention is
paid to members of the broader community reporting bugs and/or providing
patches.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Archiva Project

Archiva Board Report for September 2010
-----------------------------------

Below are the important events that happened in the project since the last
board report.

Releases
--------

* Archiva 1.3.1 released on June 18, 2010

Community
---------

* GSOC project for staging repositories support and artifact promotion in
Archiva by Eshan Sudharaka has been completed. Student was able to meet the
requirements that were identified during the proposal period and was given
a passing grade. Next step is to review the code which is currently sitting
on a branch and merge it to trunk.

* No new committers and/or PMC members were accepted during the quarter.

Development
-----------

* Development on trunk has slowed down. There was a discussion last month to
do a milestone release of trunk once the code contribution from the GSOC
project is merged.

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Axis Project

We voted to release Axis2/Java 1.5.2, which is currently in progress with
Andreas Veithen as RM.  As mentioned in June, Axis2 core is now fully Nexus
enabled, and this will be our first official release using the new system.
HUGE props to Andreas for shouldering the brunt of the work cleaning and
polishing our POMs in order to get that going.  We need to do the same to our
other subprojects.

Two new committers (Lori Van Gulick and Lahiru Gunathilake) were voted in,
and they are both also automatically PMC members based on our current policy.

Community participation is light but steady.  We could be responding to user
concerns a tad faster, but things are going fine, JIRAs being fixed, etc.

Yes, we still need to finish moving our website over to axis.apache.org from
ws.apache.org so that poor Gavin can get rid of that lingering open JIRA.

No other board-level issues to raise.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project

This is a delayed report (by 1 month).

Notable changes since previous report (May 2010):

  Very little project activity since the last report. No significant
  issues were reported, some some discussion took place on the dev
  list. An external contributor has submitted a patch of moderate
  size for review.

  No new committers or PMC members have been added.

  Sun C++ has started shipping last stable release of stdcxx, 4.2.1.

Future plans:

  Release the stdcxx 4.2.2 bugfix update. Attempt to increase project
  activity and find and set up an alternate build and test infrastructure.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Camel Project

Community:
 * No issues that require the board attention.
 * The project community continue to grow at the same fast pace.
 * No new committers or changes in the PMC

Development:
 * Development continues with new features and fixes on trunk
 * The community started a discussion about moving to a new major release Camel 3.0
 * On the 1.x branch we discussed and agree to have one final release in Q4
   and then discontinue development of that branch.
 * We corrected the few issues we had with xml files missing the AL2 license.
   There are only a few text test files that miss the license now, which I am
   working on fixing.
 * We are planning a new camel 2.5.0 release this week.

Releases:
 * Camel 2.4.0 released.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Cayenne Project

Development

* Released Cayenne 3.0.1 (September 7), which is a bug-fix release (no new
  API changes).
* Extensive discussion regarding release procedures led to better release
  artifacts. More specifically, we now have a full buildable source distro,
  instead of a handicapped one we had before. Binary assemblies are made out
  of that signed source distro in the spirit of the approach described by Roy
  Fielding here: [1]. Our revised
  process is documented here: http://cayenne.apache.org/release-guide.html
* Cayenne 3.1 is under development. Most recent activities included
  refactoring of the core services to take advantage of the new built-in
  Dependency Injection container.

Community

* Activity on the user mailing list has been normal.
* Hats off to Sally Khudairi for getting the unprecedented press coverage of
  Cayenne in July. Even though we were late with the press release (Cayenne
  3.0 final was out in May) due to the PMC inexperience with these matters, it
  was still rather successful. A few more articles may still be coming.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

General
=======
 Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
 responsiveness on both dev and user lists.

 Two GSOC projects completed successfully, both related to Commons
 SCXML.

 A user filed a security report related to Commons Fileupload. [1]
 The PMC investigated and concluded that the reported issue
 was not in fact a security exposure in Commons Fileupload
 itself, but rather a feature request. A patch release
 including the requested feature was subsequently published.

 No issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Releases
========
 Commons Parent pom.xml 16 and 17
 Commons Pool 1.5.5
 Commons Lang 3.0 Beta
 Commons Fileupload 1.2.2
 Commons Daemon 1.0.3
 Commons Compress 1.1

Community
=========
 * Simone Tripodi (simonetripodi) joined us as a new Commons
   committer.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Excalibur Project

There are no known issues and nothing else happened.

Excalibur is stable and used by some projects. Again, this quarter has
been absolutely quiet with zero activity, neither in the mailing lists
nor in subversion (and no releases of course).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Felix Project

Community

    * Added Sanjeeb Sahoo as a committer.

Software

    * Recent subproject releases:
        o Bundle Repository (1.6.4)
        o Configuration Admin (1.2.8)
        o Event Admin (1.2.4)
        o File Install (3.0.2) - Maintenance release for auto-bundle deployer.
        o Framework (3.0.1, 3.0.2) - Core OSGi framework maintenance releases.
        o Framework Security (1.4.0) - Framework security provider
          implementation maintenance release.
        o iPOJO Arch for Gogo (1.0.0) - Initial release of Gogo shell command
          for inspecting iPOJO components.
        o iPOJO Core, Annotations and Manipulator (1.6.4) - Maintenance
          release for OSGi-based component framework.
        o Main (3.0.1, 3.0.2) - Framework launcher maintenance releases.
        o Remote Shell (1.1.0) - Minor feature improvement release to simple
          telnet service.
        o SCR (Declarative Services) (1.6.0)
        o Web Console (3.1.0, 3.1.2)
        o Web Console Memory Usage Plugin (1.0.2)

Licensing and other issues

    * Karaf subproject promoted to TLP.
    * Need to have discussion on how to handle provisional OSGi APIs in our
      releases. It is not clear if we should include provisional OSGi API
      since it is not officially released by the OSGi Alliance and is
      therefore subject to change and/or not always officially sanctioned
      (i.e., made publicly available by the OSGi Alliance). At a minimum, we
      need to define an approach to informing users if provisional API is
      included that it is not [yet] official OSGi API.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  It is
different from "usual" CI servers in that it expects the individual
project builds to succeed; its purpose is to check the integration of
a project with the latest code rather than a fixed version of the
project's dependencies.  If you want a more traditional nightly build
server, Gump is not for you.  Use Gump if you want to know when a
change in your dependencies breaks your project or when your changes
break other projects.

Gump's intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle
that makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

Big infrastructure changes, light development, no issues.

== Issues ==

There are no Board level issues.

== Community ==

The Gump project really consists of two parts, the code base for the
project and the ASF installations[1] running this code base to build
many ASF projects as well as some related projects.

The code base mostly does what its current users need so there isn't
much development going on at all.  No new committers have been added.

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.  There are a few people contributing across all
projects and a few additional people maintaining the metadata of the
projects they are interested in the most.

No changes to the PMC.

== Development ==

While migrating to the new servers a few issues with Gump's database
access have been identified and fixed.  A new "builder" has been added
that removes the boilerplate code previously required when installing
a file to the local Maven repository.

We've managed to build a few projects that have been failing for a
long time in Gump - among them the ASF projects Forrest, Lucene,
Cactus and big parts of Cocoon.  We've also added builds for Solr,
Tika and PDFBox.

Some projects that have been failing for a long time and will likely
never become buildable again have been removed.  Also we've disabled a
few builds (mostly running some sort of tests) that caused Gump to
hang for an hour (Gump's timeout for build processes).

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Infrastructure ==

Our main machine vmgump has been replaced by a brand new virtual
Ubuntu machine.  The old database has been migrated to keep history.
Since the new machine now runs OpenJDK6 rather than an "official" Java
environment a few dependencies on Sun VMs have shown up in some
project's builds.

We used to have a Solaris zone which has now been replaced by a
FreeBSD jail.  The installation is working very well and we see almost
the same build failures and successes on FreeBSD as on Linux.

Many thanks to the infrastructure team for the support during the
migration - and for all the other stuff you do.

== Statistics ==

As of Sun, 12 Sep 2010 the ASF installations check out a bit less than
200 source trees (113 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
less than 600 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes more than nine
hours on vmgump and eight on the FreeBSD jail.

Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

Summary
=======

The Apache Harmony community remains healthy, and has recently
created new milestone builds.  The lack of a JCK continues to be an
issue for Harmony, with still no end in sight.


Development and Releases
========================

The Harmony community continues to publish regular milestones from the
5.0 SE and 6.0 SE branches.  We have just finished a vote on the
Apache Harmony 5.0 Milestone 15 and Apache Harmony 6.0 Milestone 3
source and are in the process of pushing them out to the mirrors.
These new milestones are primarily bug fix releases with about 70 JIRAs
having been fixed between them.

In addition to code defect fixing, there is work on a new JSSE
implementation based upon OpenSSL.  There is also continued work on
"Harmony Select", which is a headless runtime profile derived from the
existing code, with regular builds now taking place on the Apache
Hudson servers.

We have had new developers in the project, producing a jdb debug client,
and improving our imageio functionality.

Traffic on the developer mailing list is steady, representing the
increased maturity of the code.  People remain responsive to questions
and comments.


Community
=========

There were no changes to the Harmony PMC or committers during the last
reporting period, and there are now 50 committers of which ~7 were
active this period.

The Harmony community includes Google Summer of Code participants who
are making a good contribution to the code and community, and a number
of new contributors from face-to-face community events.


Other
=====

As the Board is aware, a recent lawsuit concerning Oracle vs. Google
has resulted in various commentators speculating about Google's use
of Apache Harmony code.  The Apache Harmony PMC have not been
notified of any involvement.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

Development
===========
2.3.6-alpha was released in June, followed by 2.3.8-alpha in August, which
represent trunk activity.  2.2.16 was released in July, corresponding to
the current stable branch.

Community
=========
Stefan Fritsch was added to the PMC.  No other changes to commit access or
PMC roster in this period.  The dev, users and docs lists remain active, while
apreq dev is largely quiet at this time.  modules-dev continues to provide
an active resource for non-ASF httpd module developers.

Security
========
The project continues to address issues raised, both 2.2.16 and 2.3.8-alpha
addressed security concerns under specific configurations and patches to 2.0
were published.  Known bugs and faux-vulnerability reports continue to be
referred to the dev@ list for open discussion, with one notable exception;

One open issue was deflected to the user agent developers, as the httpd security
team determined that the origin of the flaw was not in the server's behavior,
and the project awaits disclosure by the appropriate authors before discussing
additional resolutions publicly.

There are no board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

In the past month, there have been 12 PMC Additions: Benson Margulies, Scott
Deboy, Dennis Lundberg, Maria Ching, Mark Struberg, Bryan Duxbury, Chris
Douglas, Tim Williams, Richard Hirsch, James Carman, Andrzej Bialecki,
Stefan Seelmann.

The Lucene Connector Framework project is seeking to go TLP soon, and wants
to change its name.  The proposed name of Apache Connector Framework is
considered controversial because it takes a generic domain, but does not
cover existing HTTPd connectors, Tomcat connectors, Java Connector
Architecture, etc.  The Board is already aware of the issue, having been
asked to weigh in on whether or not the Board would approve Apache Connector
Framework as the TLP.  The comments so far from the Board mirror those of
the Incubator PMC, which is fairly split on whether or not the name is a
good choice, or if it is too generic/broad.

The PMC voted to incubate Isis, which will "bring together a collection of
open source projects that collectively support the rapid development of
domain-driven applications."  Isis is based on the existing Naked Objects
Framework open source project.

The PMC is voting to accept:

 - Gora, which will be "an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache
   HBase and Apache Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop."

 - Alois, a Ruby-based "log collection and correlation software with reporting
   and alarming functionalities.  There has been some controversy over issue
   of real-time communication (e.g., chats), but that should be a matter for
   the Mentors to correct.  I would expect the Board and the PMC to reject any
   attempt of the project to graduate if it fails to move development and
   decision making to the mailing lists.

 - Kitty, which will "provide a lightweight utility for managing Tomcat and
   Geronimo application servers with powerful performance diagnostics and
   troubleshooting abilities.

Based on the Board's input that such is permitted, the Incubator is
experimenting with allowing Committers to be voted in by the podlings,
directly, without PMC intervention.

The PMC voted to graduate Shiro as a TLP.

---------------------------------------------------------------

= Aries =

Aries will deliver a set of pluggable Java components enabling an enterprise
OSGi application programming model.

Aries entered incubation on September 22, 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention.

The following sub-components are actively being developed:

* Application
* Subsystems
* Blueprint
* JPA
* JNDI
* Transaction
* Quiesce
* Samples


There continues to be a vibrant community as shown by the activity on the
mailing list this year.

We have recently completed our 0.2-incubating release. This is our second
release since entering incubation. This release is in support of Geronimo
3.0 which uses Apache Aries.

The OSGi Enterprise Compliance Tests have been run against Blueprint, JMX,
JNDI and transactions modules and the results have been published to the
aries-dev mailing list and are available from the Aries web site

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve before graduation:

* Build community  [done]
* Create a release [done]
* Address project scope concerns raised during acceptance vote


= BeanValidation =

Apache Bean Validation will deliver an implementation of the JSR303 Bean
Validation 1.0 specification. BVAL entered incubation on March 1, 2010.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation.
* First release of artifacts - Done
* Grow the community and committer base - ongoing
* Decide on graduation target of TLP or subproject - TBD

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of?
* None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?
* New committer Matt Benson has started working on a branch to upgrade to
commons-lang v3.

How has the project developed since the last report?
* 0.2-incubating was released on August 20th.


= Bluesky =

BlueSky  has been incubating since 01-12-2008. It is an e-learning solution
designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education
between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.

The Summer vacation ranges from July-September, a brand new semester has
begun, meanwhile some developers graduated and some fresh developers come.
We used to develop RealClass with Anjuta which generates many useless files
both hard to maintain and probably violate ASL. I've convey my opinion in
dev list and tried to transplant Tserver to QT, and it works and cost me
little time. Some of the developers are also interesting in it, we will
discuss the next step in dev mailing list.

   *transplant Tserver's interface from GTK to QT;
   *Test QT version Tserver and found out it works well;

next step:

   * Discuss starting a branch of transplanting RealClass on dev mailing
     list.
   * Gradually transplant and commit source code.


= Chukwa =

Chukwa is a distributed log collection and processing system built on top of
Hadoop.  It is a former Hadoop subproject. Bill Graham has officially granted
committer access.  Jiaqi Tan has accepted invitation of becoming Chukwa
commiter, and pending infrastructure to setup committer access.  Chukwa
mailing lists have been moved into incubator.apache.org.

Chukwa 0.5 is in the process of migrating data storage layer to HBase for
faster read/write random access.  Chukwa Agent has been improved with new
REST API for controlling Chukwa Agent operations.


= ESME =

Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment (ESME) is a secure and highly
scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that allows people to
discover and meet one another and get controlled access to other sources of
information, all in a business process context.

ESME entered the incubator in 2008-12-02.

The following items have been performed since the last reporting period

* A new committer - Imtiaz Ahmed H E - has joined the team
* Final preparations for Release 1.1 with 77 completed JIRA issues!
* Planning for Release 1.2

The following items are planned for the next reporting period:

* Completion of Release 1.1
* Development work on Release 1.2

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve prior to graduation

* Increase community involvement in the project
* Another Apache release


= Etch =

Preliminary board report for Etch due to being late:

Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety
of programming languages.

The activity in the Etch project was very low in the last months. This led to
a discussion regarding how to continue with the project. Etch has definitely
suffered from the fact that Etch's initial committer team at Cisco was
dismantled.  This summer the project got its first non-ex-Cisco committers.
The mentioned discussion showed the will of some of the committers to drive
the project more actively. We want to publish release 1.1 during the next
report period. Technically the release package should be ready. A discussion
on whether to include the new C binding in this release or the next one has
been started.

This project definitely needs more drive and more action from the committers
to become a viable Apache incubator project. We are willing to do more to make
it an active project again.

Top issues currently are:
* publish release 1.1
* update the web site and documentation
* setup a build server on apache's hudson
* task planning for release 1.2

Note from Martijn Dashorst (Niclas Hedhman concurs):

The mentors proposed to stop the incubation of Etch due of lack of community
momentum. The actions put forward by the new committers give some hope that
Etch might have a future, so we are going see if the community gains some
momentum. As a technology Etch is viable, as evidenced by its use in BMW and
other production sites. Our concerns are mostly that the developer community
has been dead for over a year with just one (large) commit. Last week did
show increased activity, we're going to see if this continues to increase
and a viable community arises.


= Hama =

Hama was accepted into Incubator on 20 May 2008. Hama is a distributed
scientific package on Hadoop for massive matrix and graph data.

Recent Activity:

* We designed the User-Interface primarily for BSP programming.
* We made a Job Client, Job Manage System for BSP computing framework.
  Currently, it works on local system, but we're working hard for distributed
  system.
* We made an BSP examples, e.g., Pi Estimator, Serialize Printing

The following is planned for next reporting period:

* We'll freeze the features and release a beta when all issues for 0.2
  version are fixed.

Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in
the project and grow the community.


= Kato =

Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.

Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation,
and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.

Recent Activity:
* While Oracle has expressed a continued interest in the JSR-326, there has
been no change in the podling's status since the last report in June.
* As in June, the project is effectively paused until Oracle's involvement
in the Kato podling has been clarified. The credibility of the standard
relies on there being more than one major Java VM vendor involved.

The following is planned for next reporting period:

* To be determined once Oracle's involvement has been established.

Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in
the project and grow the community.


= Lucene Connector Framework =

Apache Connectors Framework is an incremental crawler framework and set of
connectors designed to pull documents from various kinds of repositories
into search engine indexes or other targets. The current bevy of connectors
includes Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink (OpenText), Patriarch
(Memex), Meridio (Autonomy), SharePoint (Microsoft), RSS feeds, and web
content. Apache Connectors Framework also provides components for individual
document security within a target search engine, so that repository security
access conventions can be enforced in the search results.

Apache Connectors Framework has been in incubation since January, 2010. It
has recently been moved from a planned subproject of Lucene to a planned
top-level project.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:
1. A final top-level-appropriate name choice for the project needs to be
confirmed
2. Nightly builds and javadoc need to be set up, and a release process needs
to be defined
3. The first official release needs to be executed

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?
1. We'd like to know whether there is any official Apache position on
inclusion of NTLM implementations in ASF projects, since we've gotten mixed
signals on this from other developers. This represents a crucial piece of
functionality needed to support LiveLink, Meridio, SharePoint, RSS, and Web
connectors properly.

How has the community developed since the last report?
We have had quite a lot of use of the software from most areas of the world,
and offers of contribution of connectors as well.  ACF now has several
regular contributors, in addition to its dedicated user base.  The name
changes we are undergoing will likely inconvenience many of these users,
which is why this is a critical issue to resolve promptly.  A book is also
planned and will be written over the next nine months.

How has the project developed since the last report?
Plans for a first release have been executed almost completely.  Better
tests have been added, although not for proprietary connectors.  An API has
been added to aid integration support.  Tree reorganization has taken place
to assist with Maven integration.  Online end-user documentation is
complete.  A quick-start example, based on Jetty and Derby, has been written
and should assist novice users in getting set up quickly.


= Lucy =

Lucy will be a loose port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C
and targeted at dynamic language users.

Lucy was voted into the Incubator on July 22, 2010.

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

* There are some potential licensing issues that are currently being
clarified with legal-internal. The results will have an impact on the
starting code base for Lucy and ultimately a significant impact on the
podling's momentum. These issues should be closely watched.

Progress since the last report:

* Mailing lists created
* Initial Website created: http://incubator.apache.org/lucy/
* Audit of existing KinoSearch code base for Software Grant has begun.
* Legal issues regarding usage of Perl C API header files provisionally
  resolved (LEGAL-79).


= NPanday =

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven. NPanday allows .NET projects to be converted into Maven projects thus
allowing them to fully utilize the other technologies driven by Maven.
NPanday has been incubating since August, 2010.

The development of NPanday has not yet started in Apache since we are still
waiting for the Infrastructure to be fully setup.

We still need to finish our importing of the source code from codeplex as
well as the information from the issue tracker.

There has been a continuous discussion for the plans of NPanday 2.0, some of
the major tasks consist of support for .NET 4.0 and VS2010.

NPanday Infrastructure Established:
* Established mailing lists
NPanday questions; npanday-users@incubator.apache.org (subscribe by posting
to npanday-users-subscribe@incubator.apache.org)
NPanday development; npanday-dev@incubator.apache.org (subscribe by posting
to npanday-dev-subscribe@incubator.apache.org)
NPanday commits; npanday-commits@incubator.apache.org (subscribe by posting
to npanday-commits-subscribe@incubator.apache.org)
* Established the committer accounts for the committers from codeplex

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.


= Nuvem =

Apache Nuvem will define an open application programming interface for
common cloud application services, allowing applications to be easily ported
across the most popular cloud platforms.

Nuvem was accepted for Incubation on June, 2010.

The Nuvem Project is slowly getting started.

The project will be featured at a JavaOne 2010 Session (all demos will be
from Apache Nuvem)
  S314011 - Developing composite applications for the Cloud using Apache
Tuscany

Mark Little wrote an article about the Nuvem project and how it might relate
with libCloud and Deltacloud.
  http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/08/apache-nuvem


= OODT =

OODT is a grid middleware framework for science data processing, information
integration, and retrieval. OODT is used on a number of successful projects
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology, and
many other research institutions and universities.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation
1. Port OODT code and license headers into ASF license headers
2. OODT contributions from at least 2 other organizations besides JPL
3. At least one OODT incubating release, hopefully in the first few months

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be  aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

The OODT community voted in a new committer, Cameron Goodale on July 15,
2010. There have been several contributions from individuals from other
organizations, notably the contribution of OODT@Apache logos in OODT-17 by
Paul Vee from CHLA, the work on OODT XMLPS from David Kale of CHLA in
OODT-29, as well as use cases contributed by Dr. Bruce Barkstrom (in
OODT-28). We've also had some more JPL'ers join the mailing lists (Paul
Zimdars), as well as another NASA contributor, Mark Foshee from Marshall
Space Flight Center.

Dan Crichton has been invited to give a keynote at ApacheCon NA.

How has the project developed since the last report?

OODT was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on January 22, 2010.

Development has progressed at a rapid pace. Chris has input 2 releases into
JIRA (0.1-incubating and 0.2-incubating), and currently 18 of the 23 issues
scheduled for 0.1-incubating have been completed. Of the remaining 5, 2 of
the issues (OODT-3 and OODT-15) are basically finished. OODT-29 (reported by
David Kale from CHLA) proposes to contribute a configurable XML
product/profile server add on to web-grid (which was imported in OODT-27 by
Chris Mattmann) based on Chris Mattmann's existing handler being deployed at
CHLA, originally developed on the EDRN project. The remaining 2 issues both
involve cleaning up license dependencies (one for the pushpull component in
OODT-22 and another for clearing the profile/product server dependency on
jacorb in OODT-25). We are *this close* to wrapping up the 0.1-incubating
release. We even have a release manager: David Woollard has volunteered to
push out the release, with guidance from Chris Mattmann.

Probably the most visible development to report is that OODT@Apache now has
an official website! http://incubator.apache.org/oodt/. Sean Kelly led the
way, with contributions from Chris Mattmann and Andrew Hart and Paul Vee in
OODT-16/OODT-17.


= RAT =

RAT is a Java library that scans files for known licenses and reports files
that lack any of them.  Three front-ends to said library exist in form of a
command line client, an Ant task and a Maven plugin.

RAT entered the Incubator in January 2008.

RAT 0.7 incubating has been released at June 30th.

After the release of RAT 0.7 a discussion of what a matching graduation
target for RAT could be started.  It seems that most users of RAT think a
TLP would be the best fit.

Development activity on RAT is very low, a total of six people have committed
59 changes in 2010 - only two people performed more than five commits.  At
least twenty of the total commits were due to the release process of 0.7.

Hyrum Wright is working on a Python based reimplementation of RAT's ideas
under the name Mouse inside a lab
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/labs/mouse/


= River  =

Apache River is a distributed computing architecture, based on the JSK
Starter Kit Source code donated by Sun Microsystems, for the Jini
Specification. While generally referred to as a Service Architecture, it
might be more easily explained to those familiar with Dependency Injection
as a Protocol Independent, Distributed Dependency Injection Architecture,
suited to both hardware and software. Instead of depending on Protocols
directly for communication, everything is abstracted behind a Java
interface, allowing protocols and implementations to be swapped freely,
programming languages other than Java can also participate.

River has been appointed an additional mentor and has seen much increased
activity on the mailing list in recent weeks and months.

The next release 2.2.0 is scheduled for December, although some discussion
on whether this is a major release or not continues.

The Incubator PMC and Apache River PPMC have approved one new committer for
the project, the votes passed in August.

Current development efforts are still focused on a java.security.Policy
Provider with the following features:
* Dynamic Grants at Runtime, based on CodeSource, Code Signer Certificate
chains , ProtectionDomain or ClassLoader.
* Dynamic Revoke of Grant's at Runtime

Reviewing newly donated code updates and patches, including:
* New CodebaseAccessClassLoader and associated changes
* New StreamServiceRegistrar Interface and other additions
* New ConcurrentDyamicPolicyProvider

Additionally:
* Work is being performed on TaskManager by our newest committer
* Increasing the test coverage, build process and Ant vs Maven work is
ongoing
* Entry-level documentation is starting to appear

We are experiencing increasing interest on our developer mailing list.

3 most important issues:
1. Code review and acceptance of newly submitted patches.
1. Streamline the build and test process.
1. Get our new committer svn accounts set up and grow our developer pool.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  We released one Jackrabbit 2.1 patch release in August:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.1.1 on August 11th

o Legal

  We are aware of the new branding guidelines, but have yet to review
  our web site and other documentation for compliance.

o Community / Development

  No new committers were added in this quarter. There's been some interest
  on the user list about people getting more involved in maintaining some
  less active parts of our codebase. We're trying to encourage and mentor
  such efforts.

  As usual, we saw a temporary dip in mailing list and development activity
  during the summer, but we're already back to normal. The Jackrabbit trunk
  has seen quite a few improvements especially in access control,
  thread-safety and performance, and we plan to ship these improvements
  in a Jackrabbit 2.2 release in near future.

  We received a vulnerability report through security@apache.org, but
  the problem turned out to be a normal bug with no security implications.

o Infrastructure

  The new Hudson master seems to be working better than the previous one.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Karaf Project

Community
=========
We added the following committers:
 *  Hiram Chirino
 *  James Strachan
 *  Ioannis Canellos
James and Hiram were committers before we moved to TLP and asked
to get their committership back, so they've been voted in back.
Ioannis is a new Apache committer.
We also have other active contributors, so we expect some new
committers in the coming months.

Development
===========
No releases this month so far, but development continues towards
our next point release of Karaf, with attention coming from users
testing new features and suggesting improvements. We expect to
release this new version before the end of the month.

Issues for board consideration
==============================
None so far.  The community is growing and healthy.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Labs Project

Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF committers.

[SUMMARY]

There has been moderate activity at Labs in the last quarter.
The PMC took care of stati for labs which saw no activity for a long time.
We present one issue to the board, please see below.

[DETAILS]

== Labs Statistics ==

- new: 2
- status changes (last 3 months): 14 (see 'Housekeeping')
- total number: 34
  - active: 12
  - idle: 15
  - promoted: 3
  - completed: 3
- labs with commits: magma, penihip, jaxMas, mouse

== New Labs =

oak (PI: Jukka Zitting): No, not a re-implementation of ancient Java, but
"HTTP-based hierarchical resource store", written in JS and Clojure.
Mouse (PI: Hyrum Wright): A light-weight license checker and release audit
tool (similar to RAT).

== Re-activated labs ==

None.

== Housekeeping, Status changes ==

During the last quarter, we identified all labs with no activity for at least
one year. We notified their PIs and - after a vote - changed all their stati
to idle, if the PI hadn't himself already taking care of this. This is why we
see a lot of labs going to 'idle' this quarter.
Here's the list:
errbase, dworker, mboxer, dislocate, speedyfeed, apiary, agora, nucleus,
discordia, boardcast,  webarch,  badca, clouds, pinpoint

We fixed some DOAP files, too.

== Status overview page ==

Tim Williams coded a script to generate a nice labs status overview[2].

== Community ==

We welcome Tim Williams to the PMC.

== (No) Releases ==

A lab can't do a release, and we all accept and understand this. More precisely,
according to the project's bylaws, the PMC can't vote on a release.
On the other hand, committers working on a lab might want to cut releases,
either for use outside of the ASF, or simply to signal a certain level of
maturity to attract others to the project. For me this makes perfectly sense.
I don't think it makes sense to work on a lab without ever wanting to make other
people aware of it and make them use it in one way or the other.
So it was discussed on our dev ML[1] if private releases are a way to do this,
meaning the PI or any other person takes the code, tars it up and calls it a
release, without having a Lab PMC vote, and without tagging it "Apache".
Now, we'd like to hear the board's general position on this topic, especially
any corner cases and gotchas we have to take into account.
Thanks for any feedback.

== Lab hacking ==

Same as last quarter: Development activity was low last quarter, mailing list
conversations on coding-related topics practically non-existent.

Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

=== Lucene Status Report: Sept, 2010 ===

TLP

The Lucy project has been moved to Incubator where it intends to become a
TLP.


LUCENE JAVA/Solr

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community is very active.
The community is working towards 2.9.4, 3.0.3, 3.1 and 4.0 releases.

LUCENE.NET

Lucene.NET is a .NET based port of Lucene Java. Development appears
to have stagnated and the PMC is beginning to look into issues here.

Open Relevance Project

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either.  The community
has started some discussion around what goals the project should
have.

PyLucene

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
active. PyLucene 3.0.2-1 and 2.9.3-1 were released on July 3rd, 2010.
As a development milestone, experimental Python 3.1.2 ports of PyLucene
and JCC were completed July 12th, 2010.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache OFBiz Project

The Apache Open For Business Project (Apache OFBiz) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

*Releases*
- The process of bug fixing the latest release branch (10.04, created in
  April 30, 2010) is going on (by backporting bug fixes from the trunk);
  we don't have scheduled a date for the creation of the release from
  this branch (will be named 10.04RC1) but it should be voted soon

*Community and Project*

- No new committers or PMC members
- Community interaction remains strong, user and dev mailing lists traffic
  is high
- Significant new development continues, for highlights see:
  http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Main+New+Features

*Infrastructure/Legal*
- we are in the process (INFRA-2625) of transferring the ownership of the
  domain "ofbiz.org" (the OFBiz pre-ASF domain) to the ASF; this should be
  intended as a first step in the attempt to get a better control of the
  domains and resources that deal with OFBiz (this has been discussed in
  the trademark list)

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

- Dan McDonald became our latest mass-check corpus volunteer;
  we now have enough ham email in our contributed corpus, again, to
  be able to generate and publish nightly rule updates

- we continue to solicit new mass-check contributors; the more ham
  and spam emails that we can test rules against the better the
  accuracy of SpamAssassin's published rulesest

- development activity is quiet, but no major issues are outstanding

- users' list is active; questions get asked and answered


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Synapse Project

Community

The Synapse community keeps going well. Mailing list traffic is solid
and continuous, with new users on a regular basis.

Releases
There is a lot of work going on towards a 2.0 release.

Board issues
None identified.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

Summary

It has been another slow quarter for Apache Tiles with one release and a bit
of discussion about future development.

Releases

Tiles 2.2.2 was released early in the quarter and has been declared GA quality
by the Tiles PMC.

Development

Discussions have started about moving the sandbox development tree to the trunk
as a basis for Tiles 3. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

Summary:

The project continues to be active on a number of fronts.
There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.


Releases:

Apache Tomcat 7.0.2  - released
Apache Tomcat 7.0.1  - not released

Apache Tomcat 6.0.29 - released
Apache Tomcat 6.0.28 - released
Apache Tomcat 6.0.27 - not released

Apache Tomcat 5.5.31 - voted (announcement pending)
Apache Tomcat 5.5.30 - released

Security:

We've been working closely with security issue reports and the Apache
Security committee on quickly replying to issues, resolving them, and
coordinating public disclosures.

CVE-2010-2227: Remote Denial Of Service and Information Disclosure
               Vulnerability
  Several flaws in the handling of the 'Transfer-Encoding' header
  were found that prevented the recycling of a buffer. A remote
  attacker could trigger this flaw which would cause subsequent
  requests to fail and/or information to leak between requests.
  This flaw is mitigated if Tomcat is behind a reverse proxy
  (such as Apache httpd 2.2) as the proxy should reject the invalid
  transfer encoding header.

CVE-2010-1157: Information disclosure in authentication headers
  The WWW-Authenticate HTTP header for BASIC and DIGEST authentication
  includes a realm name. If a <realm-name> element is specified for the
  application in web.xml it will be used. However, a <realm-name> is not
  specified then Tomcat will generate realm name using the code snippet
  request.getServerName() + ":" + request.getServerPort().
  In some circumstances this can expose the local host name or IP address
  of the machine running Tomcat.

Development:

Development was concentrated mainly on fixing bugs for the current
releases and pushing those releases out.

The GSOC work completed. It was touch and go whether or not it was going
to be successful for a while but we ended up with some cool enhancements
and additions fixes to Tomcat 7's JMX support which allow a user to
configure a working Tomcat instance over JMX from an absolute bare
minimum starting point. The student appears to be continuing with their
involvement with the project.

Tomcat 7 has reached about 10% of total Tomcat downloads
(not counting mirrors) which is pretty good considering it is still beta.


Community:

There was lot of activity on Users list recently and we are
planning to offer a commit privileges to couple of most active users
that are also willing to be involved into development by
providing code patches.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases:

Maven Build tooling artifacts (e.g., parent POMs, maven helper plugins
and resources) that we will be using for our actual releases have
been released.  This was our first use of the Apache Nexus repository
and staging mechanism.  We expect a release of UIMA itself, shortly,
using this new tooling.

2010-1-26 2.3.0 (Incubator - last release) release of Java SDK, Annotator
                add-on package, UIMA-AS (Async scaleout), and UIMA-CPP
                (C++ enablement)

Development:

Some users complained about the difficulty in getting through the
one-time-setups needed to build.  Some of this is because we're a bit on
the bleeding edge for maven build tooling; some of the difficulties are
going away as bugs are fixed in the underlying build tooling.

A small annoyance in how UIMA's "ResultSpecification" worked led to
a careful examination of a multitude of "corner cases", and eventually,
to a complete redo of this part of the code.

Jira issues continue to come in and get worked on at a moderate rate,
including several in the UIMA-AS (Asynchronous Scaleout) area related
to various error recovery scenarios, mostly.

A Maven-Central-upload event on Sept. 7 that placed many partial entries
for Eclipse 3.6 artifacts (missing POMs and JARs) ended up breaking
our builds; this was reported to the maven-dev list, and it is being
looked into.  We worked around this issue by adding dependencies to
our already version-locked-down Eclipse artifacts, to lock down the
transitively depended-on Eclipse artifacts.

Community: No changes

Issues: No Board level issues at this time


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project

This has been a quiet period for the Apache Velocity project since the
last board report.

Anthony Petrelli has reorganized the Velocity Engine code base and
build system to be based on Maven.

Traffic on the user lists seems slower than typical, with a new
inquiry every couple of days. Responses remain fairly quick, with 3 or
4 committers actively monitoring the lists and responding to
questions.

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

There are no issues requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Voted in two new committers and made them PMC members: Martin Grigorov and
  Peter Ertl.

- Released Apache Wicket 1.4.10, 1.4.11 and 1.5-m1

- Started release vote for 1.5-m2 but it was canceled due to a critical bug
  in submitting forms using Ajax and firefox 3.6. This sparked a new
  release for 1.5-m2 and 1.4.12, which are both being voted on right now.

- Confluence autoexport based CMS was replaced with Jekyll based templating
  system using svnpubsub to sync with wicket.apache.org

- New committers are hard at work fixing bugs, enthusiastically implementing
  new features, and seem to enjoy getting their hands dirty.

- We still have our eye on possible new committers but want to ensure our
  newest members are in good shape.

No issues require the attention of the board.
