 3. Minutes from the meeting of 27 Feb 2002

    The minutes contained in board_minutes_2002_02_27.txt were approved by
    unanimous consent of the board.

 4. Officer Reports

    A. President [Brian]
       Brian reported that the ASF infrastructure was operating in a "steady"
       fashion. Spam is a never-end problem and that a lot of work is
       being done to reduce its level.

    B. Treasurer [Randy]
       Randy provided PDF account reports, available under
       cvs.apache.org:/home/cvs foundation/Funds/
       
       It was noted that the ApacheCon events are significant to the ASF's
       revenue stream.

    C. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]
       Jim had no items to report.

 5. Committee Reports

    A. Conference Planning [Ken]
       Ken reported that the baseline dates for the next ApacheCon have been
       moved to November 16-22, 2002 (possibly just through November 20). The
       reasons for the change was the final feedback of the survey. The
       general feeling was that (1) an event in August 2002 would not
       provide sufficient time to coordinate the event and (2) the weather
       in Las Vegas in August would be too uncomfortable for a good conference.
       
       The Conference Committee is looking into adding Tutorials to the
       ApacheCon event.
    
 6. Special Orders

    A. Java Community Process

    The following resolution (R1) was proposed:

          WHEREAS, the mission of The Apache Software Foundation is to
          protect the public's interest in the Internet infrastructure
          by fostering collaborative development and distribution of
          open-source software; and

          WHEREAS, a specification of an interface standard is often
          necessary to enable interoperable implementations to be developed
          by independent software projects, including those fostered by
          the Foundation; and

          WHEREAS, the content of a specification that includes implementation
          details, such as class specifications and method prototypes, may
          be restricted by U.S. copyright law and subject to terms and
          conditions of use that are not consistent with free distribution
          of open-source software; and

          WHEREAS, some vendors have used their copyright on such
          specifications to arbitrarily and capriciously exclude, to the
          detriment of the public, other participants in the specification
          process from implementing the very same interface standards that
          they helped develop.

          NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that The Apache Software
          Foundation will no longer participate in the development of
          implementations or interface standards that cannot be completely
          implemented and distributed as open source software, without
          royalties or fees of any kind, by nonprofit and educational
          organizations; and be it further

          RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors hereby instructs all
          Project Management Committees of the Foundation to review any
          and all specifications for which the Foundation's software acts
          as a publicly distributed open-source implementation and ensure
          that one of the following is true:

            a) the Foundation has right and title to all technology necessary
               to implement the specification and we have provided a license
               to others to implement it under the same or similar terms
               as the Apache software license; or

            b) the copyright holders have granted an irrevocable, no-charge,
               royalty-free license to any nonprofit or educational
               organization to implement the specification for the purpose
               of distribution to the public, where such license is
               sufficiently complete to describe all terms and conditions
               applicable to the specification at the time a copy of the
               specification is obtained;

          and be it further
         
          RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors hereby instructs all
          Project Management Committees of the Foundation to correct any
          software for which the above conditions do not hold true within
          90 days by correcting the specification license, by modifying the
          software such that it no longer implements the specification, or
          by ceasing distribution of the implementation.

       Resolution R1 was proposed and seconded. The Resolution R1 was approved
       by unanimous vote of all directors present

       There was also much discussion regarding the role of the ASF in the
       Java community. It was generally agreed that the current situation
       was becoming more intolerable, and that the ASF was having doubts
       on whether an agreeable arrangement would be possible. In anti-
       cipation of possible events, the board authorized an amount not
       to exceed $2,500 (US) for the drafting and release of a Press
       Release or Press Releases detailing the ASF's position.

    B. Request from SAP for License Amendment Permission 
    
    Due to the details of European Law, the ASF cannot legally deny warranty
    (AS IS) on the code. We can, however, allow someone to take it over. SAP
    is requesting such approval from us to allow them to distribute Apache
    in their product line. The proposed agreement is Attachment A.

    The following resolution (R2) was proposed:

          RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors approves the amendment to
          the Apache Software License, version 1.1, attached hereto as
          Attachment A, for use by SAP in redistributing software owned
          by the Foundation.

       Resolution R2 was proposed and seconded. The Resolution R2 was approved
       by unanimous vote of all directors present

 7. Unfinished Business

    A. Chuck Murcko proposes that the bylaws be changed to make the board
       membership a rotating three-year term (1/3 of the board would be
       elected each year). He proposes to implement this by electing the
       next board and then having the new board members draw straws to see
       who serves 1, 2, or 3 year initial terms.  From then on, newly
       elected board members would serve 3 year terms. We would still
       have a board election (again, for 1/3 of the board members) each year.
       This was further discussed, and a formal Bylaw ammendment is being
       formulated by Chuck.

 8. New Business
    None.

 9. Announcements
    Ken reported that he was in the process of changing the scriptbase for
    the ApacheCon site to PHP 4.

10. Adjournment

    Scheduled to adjourn by 11:00am PST -0800. The meeting was actually
    adjourned at 11:27am PST -0800.

Attachment A


      AMENDMENT to the APACHE SOFTWARE LICENSE, VERSION 1.1
      between SAP and THE APACHE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION

      This document ("Amendment") shall serve to amend the Apache Software
      License, Version  1.1 (the "License") between SAP and the Apache
      Software Foundation. 

      Recitals

	WHEREAS, SAP desires to amend and clarify the License;

	NOW, THEREFORE, solely for SAP's business purposes, SAP and the Apache 
        Software Foundation agree to amend the License as follows:     

        1. Add the following language to the end of the License:

        "SAP and/or its distributors may offer, and charge a fee for,
        warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
        more recipients of the software. However, SAP and/or its distributors
        may do so only on its/their own behalf, and not on behalf of the
        Apache Software Foundation or its contributors."

        Other than the foregoing, the terms and conditions of the License
        remain unchanged and in full force and effect.

        The Effective Date of this Amendment is March ____, 2002.
