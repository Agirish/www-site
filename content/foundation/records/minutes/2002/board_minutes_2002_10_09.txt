 3. Special Orders

    A) The Board was required to appoint a Director to fill the position
       vacated by Randy.  Bill Stoddard accepted Greg Stein's nomination for
       this role.  By unanimous vote, Bill Stoddard was appointed to the
       Board Of Directors.

    B) Appoint an Assistant Treasurer

       Ken Coar accepted Greg Stein's nomination for this role.

       Chuck Murcko accepted Jim Jagielski's nomination for this role.

       A vote was held for the appointment of Assistant Treasurer with the
       following results:

          Chuck:   5
          Ken:     3
          Abstain: 0

       Therefore, Chuck was appointed Assistant Treasurer.  All
       directors thanked Randy for his hard work as treasurer over
       the last few years.

    C) Vote on ApacheCon hardship cases

       Further discussion was held on whether the Concom should have
       the means and authority to provide supplemental funds to ASF
       members for the purpose of attending ApacheCon 2002 if they
       were unable to afford the expense.  By a vote of 6-Yea, 2-Nay,
       0-Abstain, the Concom was allocated a budget of $5000 (US) to
       distribute as needed (and as determined by the Concom) to
       handle these "hardship cases."

    D) Establish the Apache Security Team.
       The following resolution was proposed:
    
         WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it to be in the best
         interests of the Foundation and consistent with the
         Foundation's purpose to establish an ASF Board Committee
         charged with maintaining the security of software produced by
         the various projects established under the ASF's umbrella,
         but not for the security of the servers and other
         infrastructure used by the ASF.

         NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that an ASF Board Committee,
         to be known as the "Apache Security Team", be and hereby is
         established pursuant to Bylaws of the Foundation; and be it
         further

         RESOLVED, that the Apache Security Team be and hereby is
         responsible for organization and oversight of efforts to
         maintain the security of ASF projects and shall act as a
         single point of contact between the ASF and any entity
         wishing to report or fix any security related issue in any
         project.

         RESOLVED, that each project shall appoint at least one
         non-voting liaison to the committee, who shall have commit
         privilege for the project's repository, and the technical
         ability to release new versions, advisories or security
         patches on behalf of the project.

         RESOLVED, that the committee shall have the power to act on
         behalf of any project in matters of security.

         RESOLVED, that the persons listed immediately below be and
         hereby are appointed to serve as the initial members of the
         Apache Security Committee:

             Ben Laurie (chair)
             Mark Cox

       By unanimous vote, the above resolution passed.

    E) With Randy leaving, the board needed to appoint a replacement
       chair for Fund Raising Committee.  It was agreed that it still
       made sense for the Treasurer to also chair this committee.
       Randy offered to contact Chuck and see if he was willing and
       able to chair this.

 4. Adjournment

    Scheduled to adjourn by 10:30am PDT -0700.  Adjourned at 10:44am.
