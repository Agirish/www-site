 4. Officer Reports

    A. President  [Brian]
       Brian had no news to report.

    B. Treasurer [Randy]
       Absent, hence no report.

    C. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]
       Jim reported that he was collecting the 2nd round of data from
       ASF committers and members, with the intent of populating a
       MySQL database with the info for our internal and public use.
       The data is required so that the ASF can have a complete and
       comprehensive list of all those working on the various projects.

 5. Committee Reports

    A. Conference Planning [Ken]
       Ken reported that there has been very little discussion with
       Security Travel over the last few months regarding the ApacheCon
       events. It has only been in the last weeks that discussion has
       re-started, with the items for discussion being posted on the ConCom
       list. A summer event in Las Vegas is still baselined for this year.

 6. Special Orders

    A) Conference supplies

       Ken requested a budget for the ConCom for purchasing wireless
       network equipment for use at ASF meetings and ApacheCon. The general
       consensus was that at least 4 units would be needed. Rasmus Lerdorf
       had indicated offline that he had obtained at least 2 units that he
       could "hold" for the ASF. By unanimous vote, the board authorized a
       budget of $1,000 (US) to the ConCom to purchase wireless equipment for
       the above specified purposes.

    B) Trademarks

       Ken requested formal approval for reimbursement on potential
       expenses related to registering the Apache name and feather
       as trademarks. By unanimous vote, Ken was tasked to obtain
       the required trademarks, as previously discussed as being
       the 2 trademarks in 4 classes, on behalf of the ASF, and, as
       such, reimbursement was authorized.

    C) Java Community Process

       Sun has not made visible progress towards making the JCP specs
       acceptable to open source implementations. There was much discussion
       among the board and guests on whether it would be best to discountinue
       association with an organization that generates closed standards, or
       if it would be possible to create a plan to convince them to open
       the JCP specs. In addition to the ASF's mission of open standards,
       there is also the restriction the ASF faces that our efforts in the
       Java specification environment can be perceived as benefiting a
       sole organization. The general consensus was that the team should
       work on a Position Paper, creating a statement on what is wrong with
       the current specifications/JSR. In addition, by unanimous vote, the
       board authorized a budget of $6,000 (US) to Jason Hunter in order to
       obtain legal advice, information and feedback on the current JSPA and
       other ASF-related interests in this matter.

 7. Unfinished Business

    A. ASF License 2.0
    Roy has made some changes to his suggested License, and received
    some additional feedback from Drew. Further discussion will be held
    at the next meeting.

 8. New Business
    Sam Ruby reported that the Jakarta PMC Chair election is due soon. Sam
    also reported that the Jakarta PMC will also hold a renewal of all
    members in the PMC.

    Roy reported his intent to have each ASF project submit status
    updates to the board at the monthly board meetings, on an ongoing
    rotating basis.

 9. Announcements
    None

10. Adjournment

    The meeting was scheduled to adjourn by 11:00am PST -0800,
    and was actually adjourned at 11:19am PST -0800.
