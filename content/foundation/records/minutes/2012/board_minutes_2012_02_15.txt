 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       I remind folks that our annual members meeting will be held on
       IRC Tuesday 22 May from 10-noon Pacific, and resume on Thursday
       24 May from 10-noon Pacific.  Please start thinking about board
       and member nominations now.

    B. President [Jim]

       Quite an "verbose" month on Incubator mailing list, as evidenced in
       Incubator report. There was some "leakage" of the discussion to
       the members list, but the main discussion was held within the
       Incubator, where it belonged. It was refreshing to see that.

       The Annual report was filed; Thanks to Craig for submitting it
       and Melissa for the follow-up. Speaking of Melissa, the calendar
       system seems to be working quite well and I believe all who
       require access to it, have it.

       The budget call went out. Will continue to follow and push. I have
       asked Noirin to help with this.

       I grow increasingly concerned about our lack of an active and
       available treasurer and suggested switching the current
       treasurer and ass't treasurer parties. I've been unable to
       get ahold of Geir to discuss this, but have chatted with
       Sam.

       Other than the treasurer issue, the foundation is running well.

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

       AI: Sam to pursue a report for Treasurer

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       January was business as usual at secretary@, with 85 ICLAs,
       four CCLAs, one grant, and one updated CCLA schedule A received
       and filed. 27 new account requests were filed based on ICLAs
       with completed account and project information.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

       My apologies for last month--but I'm delighted to see our 
       meetings in the calendar, and thanks to Melissa for her help 
       with that!
       
       I look forward to helping Jim with the budget process, but have
       nothing else to report at present.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       Nothing to report for the period.

Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Active month on JIRA and the mailing lists.  No issues for the board.  An
example of the longest thread: Are license headers really mandatory in every
source file?

We have received an offer from DLA Piper's to represent the ASF for
intellectual property and international tax matters.  Their engagement
letter is under final review, and should be signed shortly.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For January 2012: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.  

5      Support question
2      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
3      Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
6      Vulnerability reports, of which:
       2  [httpd, via security@apache.org]
       1  [ws, via security@apache.org]
       1  [apr, via security@apache.org]
       1  [oo, via oo-security@incubator.apache.org]
       1  [struts, via security@struts.apache.org]

Reminder: vulnerability handling process explained at

Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Small Events
------------
There will be a two day BarCamp in Colombo, Sri Lanka on the 26th and 27th
Feb. Nick and Ross are offering mentoring, and will be speaking.

TrafficServer and HTTPD are interested in a hackathon/meetup, we've answered
their initial questions on how it works and what support is available, we
expect to hear more from them soon.

Tim Williams is continuing with the planning for a BarCamp in DC

We've done some work on the wiki pages which describe the support available
and steps needed for small events, based on the feedback from the above two
events, but we know more work is needed on them.

Third Party Events
------------------
We've OK'd an HBase event for May, a Cassandra Europe one for late March,
and Hadoop Summit for June. A request was received for a Camel event, but
we've asked for some clarifications / tweaks to better fit the current
policy, and solve some PMC raised issues. In future though, for this sort of
thing, we'll aim for ConCom to raise the problems, rather than the PMC.

The Camel conference has highlighted a couple of areas of the policy that
might want tweaking, we'll aim to review+vote on those this coming month.

The CFP for OSCON closed, but due to mailing list moderation problems the
reminder email from Sally was delayed until after the deadline. We'll reach
out to PMCs about events on the Monday and Tuesday, and in the evenings
nearer the time. Noirin is looking into possible crash+hack space for us,
with a view to providing somewhere cheap to stay for Apache committers
without company funding who wish to attend.

ApacheCon
---------
The ApacheCon NA RFP opened on the 23rd of January, and runs for 45 days,
until the 8th of March. So far, a few of the producers who had expressed
interest have declined, but we believe the remainder are still interested
and are working on their bids.

Discussions on the Europe event continue, and we hope to be able to announce
something shortly. The aim is to announce the date, and invite those
interested in helping to sign up to the planners list, just as soon as the
venue booking is confirmed.

Committee
---------
No new committee members this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Still attempting to pursue a github FI instance for ASF use.

Intervision LOC app has still not been filled out and sent off.

Purchased an HP switch for SARA for 456 EU.

Renewed warranties on Dell and Sun gear for 1Y with Intervision
and Technologent, respectively.


Prepped aurora and the HP switch for installation in SARA.

Renewed apache.org DNS for another 9 years.

Silicon Mechanics reminded us of our outstanding $2037 credit
with them.

We've sent out a notice to all PMCs about the plan to migrate all sites
to svnpubsub or the CMS by the end of this year.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

No posts on the mailing list since December.

EA has a Jira to help pull together what we spent of our budget 
at ApacheCon in November, that report will be ready for next month.

No future events planned as yet.
No changes to the Committee membership

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Abdera Project

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

After being very quiet for months there has been a lot more activity
this quarter on a major update for a new version of the code. This has
a lot of cool new features and restructuring improvements, and has
made a lot of progress and is almost ready for the first v2.0 release.
It is though still largely the work of a single person but does look
like its attracting interest of the existing Abdera community which
we're trying to engage with and encourage to help so we can add more
committers.

Other than the talk and prep for the v2.0 release there have been no
other releases, and no new committers or PMC member changes.

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache ACE Project

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to
centrally manage and distribute modular software components,
configuration data and other artifacts to OSGi based and related target
systems.

Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Ant Project

Ant Status Report - February 2012.

Ant is a Java based build tool (see http://ant.apache.org)

o Release Status

There have been no new releases of the core projects in this report
period.

A vote is currently in progress for a 1.8.3 release so I expect
a 1.8.3 release to be available shortly.

We have agreed that this will be the last release to support Java 1.4. The
release, which should be 1.9, will require Java 5.

There have been some preliminary discussion on releasing a beta for
IvyDE 2.2 but no concrete plan is in place as yet.

The current releases are:

Core
---------
Ant 1.8.2 was released on Dec 27th, 2010.

Ivy
-------
Ivy 2.2.0 was released on October 7, 2010
Ivy-DE 2.1.0 was released on Aug 20, 2010

o Committers and PMC

A PMC member, Gilles Scokart, recently elected to go emeritus.
I'd like to express the PMC's thanks for his contribution over
the years.

o Community

The project bug backlog remains an issue.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Buildr Project

Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and tools.

Our latest release happened in June -- we were hoping for a release in
November but efforts stalled after discovering platform installation
issues in a release candidate. The release will likely happen in
February. The changelog currently shows about 50
fixes/changes/enhancements since our last release. Subversion log show
about 100 commits since June with commits from 3 different committers
and patches accepted from 3 external contributors.

Mailing lists have quiet in the past 3 months.

We have no issues that require board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project

Notable changes since previous report (October 2011):

A vote to move stdcxx to the Attic failed. The majority of stdcxx
contributors voted in favor of continuing to maintain the project.
Several inactive committers stepped up to help with the project.

A new build and test infrastructure has been set up to verify
the correctness and portability of code changes:

* gcc/Ubuntu Linux:
  https://builds.apache.org/job/stdcxx-4.2.2-12d-ubuntu/

* Sun C++/Solaris:
  https://builds.apache.org/job/stdcxx-4.2.2-15s-solaris/

A stdcxx contributor submitted a large number of issues and patches
addressing a number of known and new defects.

The stdcxx PMC voted to grant three contributors commit permissions
to the stdcxx code repository and add them to the PMC.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Cassandra Project

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Click Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it
is based around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is
very similar to Cocoon 2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and
designed to be easily used with Java code (= no frameworks required!).
On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal of becoming the best available
platform for RESTful webservices and web applications.

Community

Traffic on users lists continues be light, people continue
be interested on both C2 and newer C3.
New Committers have been voted and accepted in the PMC,
Cédric Damioli (cdamioli) and Robby Pelssers (robbypelssers).
The Chair has been interviewed on FeatherCast.org, the interview
has not been published yet.

Releases/Development

After Apache Cocoon 3.0.0-alpha-3 release
(reported on Aug 11), development of Cocoon 3.0 continues towards
3.0.0-beta-1 release, with an experimental branch to finalize APIs.
The PMC voted the JDK6 as minimum requirement to run C3
There has been healthy activity on older (2.x) branches.
Traffic on dev continues on discussing about future of Cocoon, and
how to restore the old Daisy Cocoon Documentation.

Branding checklist:
Project Website Basics - done on C3 site
Website Navigation Links - done on C3 site
Trademark Attributions - done on C3 site
Logos and Graphics - done on C3 site
Project Metadata - done on C3
Read PMC Branding Responsibilities - done


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Community Development Project

The Commmunity Development PMC is responsible for helping people become 
involved with Apache projects

Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

GSoC
----

GSoC 2012 was announced at FOSDEM on 4th February. ComDev has commenced 
our organisation. We've already had two experienced admins step forwards, 
with a further two newcomers expressing interest. This is very encouraging.

Outstanding: 
  * Publish the GSoC Admin guidelines
  * Verify that new mentor selection process is documented for GSoC
  * Verify infra is OK with temporary accounts for GSoC

New Tasks:
  * Submit ASF to GSoC
  * Work with projects to identify suitable GSoC tasks

Events and Speakers
-------------------

Ross (ComDev chair) met face to face with Nick Burch (ConCom chair) to discuss
a stronger relationship between ConCom and ComDev. As a result Nick has done
a little work on the speakers application. The intention is to make a number 
of web widgets (via the Wookie podling) available for hosting via the CMS that
can be embedded in project and foundation pages. Work is ongoing.

Nick and Ross also discussed the potential relationship relating to events.
Nick has shelved this work in preference to working on the RFP for producers.

Outstanding:
  * Agree scope of ConCom and ComDev collaboration on event support
  * Raise awareness of Speaker and Event support materials
  * Integrate speaker app with Lanyrd (hosts all ApacheCon NA11 slidedecks)

Website
-------

There was considerable discussion about the use of org.apache package names on 
apache-extras. This has now been clarified in the FAQ and Guidelines.

In the last few days before this report there has been a great deal of 
discussion on general@incubator.a.o It seems that reform is in the air and
many people are suggesting that some of the key functions move to ComDev.
However, there is no consensus in the IPMC about what the future should look
like and thus no clarity around what ComDev is expected to pick up.

Some members of ComDev are involved with the discussion, but until there is
more clarity in the IPMC there seems little point in taking the discussion to
ComDev lists.

New Tasks:
  * Work with the IPMC to clarify any future role for ComDev in the incubation 
    process


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache CouchDB Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Empire-db Project

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that
allows developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application
development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow
highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of
compile-time-safety and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

Apache Empire-db became a TLP in January 2012. We are still busy
migrating the project to TLP infrastructure, mostly because of lack of
time of our project chair but this should be solved by our next report.

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

Releases

No releases as TLP yet


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2011-01-10
  There are no diversity issues regarding the PMC.

Security issues reported:
  None.

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  Development has been very quiet for the quarter.
  Only two PMC members have been active [*] a little during this quarter.
  (* In past reports i used the word "present". Sorry i meant "active"
  meaning that i can see commits or mail. People could be reading, only
  speaking up when necessary.)

  Some little activity on dev mail list and issue tracker.
  Some little activity on user mail list was answered by more than one.

  Those are similar statements to last quarter. Actually a bit more quiet,
  yet still operating.

Progress of the project:
  Again, the only commits were a few documentation edits.

Attend to project branding:
  During the last quarter I re-read the revised branding docs, and reckon
  that Forrest does meet the requirements, as reported previously.
  The following is the comment from last quarter (no further action):
  Many plugin sites need to be re-deployed. As this gradually happens, the
  changes will be reflected.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Gora Project

Apache Gora

Apache Gora is an open source framework providing an in memory data model
and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores,
key value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The last official project release was made on 24/09/2011 which was the
0.1.1-incubating release (2nd whilst in the Incubator). Discussion has
surfaced on the project development strategy for spinning a 0.2 RC within
the next month or so.
In addition to the numerous improvements made between 0.1.1-incubating and
0.2 we plan to implement two additional data store modules, namely gora-solr
and gora-accumulo. The addition of these modules not only drives the project
towards its extended project description and aspirations, but will also ensure that
Apache Gora is extended to two diverse and active communities with the ASF.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Since reporting we have identified several improvements to be made to the
codebase. These issues are actively being worked on, however the task of
migrating all Gora infrastructure to TLP status is currently taking precedence.
In terms of project activity, over the last month, our mailing lists have
witnessed sustainable levels of activity with noticeably higher volumes of
traffic. Daniel Shahaf has done an excellent job of migrating the overwhelming
majority of the incubator infrastructure over to TLP configuration.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Having just been accepted into the ASF as a TLP, the Gora PMC is pleased
to announce that having VOTE'd we have successfully attracted one new
committer and PMC member, Keith Turner. In addition we've become aware
of some other more discrete members of the community chipping in.
This is promising, as members from communities as far afield as Apache
James are actively monitoring the Gora development lists.
Additionally we have connected with members of the JOOQ community
regarding a possible re-write of the gora-sql module as well as members
of the Hector Developers community, a formal announcement was made on
15/01/2012 (cross posted to the Hector user lists) which states
continued and committed support for the Hector client API within
the gora-cassandra module. This was followed by members of the Hector
development team formally stating on the Gora dev lists that they are
happy to work collaboratively to make both Hector and Gora better projects.

Changes to PMC & Committers

The Gora PMC is pleased to announce that Keith Turner was VOTE'd in
as PMC member and Committer. Hopefully by the time this report is
presented to the Board, Keith will be on board and able to actively
maintain and improve the gora-accumulo module, also opening Gora up
to the Accumulo community.

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of projects including,
Nutch, Tika, OODT, Camel, Solr to name a few. Once Keith's credentials are
processed we can add Accumulo to this list. This list is not exhaustive.

Project Branding or Naming issues

As we migrate the website to the TLP infrastructure we have created an
issue on the Gora Jira to ensure that all ASF branding and naming guidelines
are implemented fully and that Apache Gora is in compliance.


Legal issues

We currently have an issue with one particular library being used within the
gora-sql store. It is the communities intention to remove this LGPL licensed library
from the codebase replacing it with implementations from JOOQ an ASL 2.0 licensed library.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

Status report for the Apache HTTP Server project - February 2012

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems.

No major issues requiring the Board's attention.

== Project Status ==

The project continues to make progress towards a GA release of httpd
2.4.x, including 2.3.16 (beta) and an ultimately unreleased 2.4.0 which 
lead to additional scrutiny, testing, and fixes.

The project released 2.2.22, containing a roll-up of a number of 
relatively low severity vulnerabilities.  A similar, likely final, 
release of 2.0.x is also in the works. 

Our bugzilla backlog is slowly climbing, approximately 850 non-enhancement 
issues.

== Community ==

Kaspar Brand and Stephen Henson were added to the PMC roster in this 
period. No new committers.

Mailing list, bugzilla, and IRC traffic is steady, with a bubble
around 2.4 discussions and work.  


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache HttpComponents Project

Status report for the Apache HttpComponents project - February 2012

The Apache HttpComponents project is responsible for creating and 
maintaining a toolset of low level Java components focused on HTTP 
and associated protocols.

Status

Overall the project remains active.

Releases

- HttpCore 4.1.4 was released on the 22nd of December 2011

- HttpCore 4.2-beta1 was released on the 28th of January 2012. The 4.2 
branch of HttpCore includes a number of enhancements including a more 
flexible asynchronous HTTP protocol handler API (client and server side) 
and is expected to become stable within three to four months.

- HttpClient 4.1.3 was released on the 6th of February 2012. This bugfix 
release included hardening of the httpclient-cache module, particularly 
the memcached storage backend, as well as addressing some corner cases 
that led to infinite loops or deadlocks.

- A release vote for HttpClient 4.2-beta1 is in progress

Community

The community remains small but active. There is good user interaction on
the mailing lists.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Over the past month, there has been a lot of discussion within the
Incubator.  We have voted in a new PMC Chair, Jukka Zitting, who will be
rotating out of the PMC Chair position of Jackrabbit.

There has been a lot of discussion over the future of the Incubator.  Under
one proposal, the Board would establish new TLPs whose PMC chair is an ASF
Member and initial PMC has at least 3 ASF Members.  Such a TLP would be
under "incubation", but not under an "Incubator".  Under such a plan, ComDev
would be given responsibility for much of the Incubator's Policy & Procedure
documentation, and similar Community Development related content.  Other
proposals are less radical, and focus on doing something to ensure more
active and involved Mentors.

More immediately, some of Jukka's thoughts on the Board's hot topic of
pushing projects out of the Incubator are presented in the following
exchange:

On a related topic, the Incubator PMC voted to retire the HISE podling.  BVal
has voted to seek TLP status.  Syncope, intended to be a reference
implementation for Open Source Identity Management, was voted to begin
Incubation.

The podling reports are below.  Sam suggested including podling reports as a
link to a frozen wiki page.  The Incubator PMC requests feedback from the
Board as a whole as to whether an in-line summary and URL to is satisfactory
for future reports.


-------------------- Summary of podling reports --------------------

We reviewed all podlings reporting in this quarter and categorized them
according to their progress through the Incubator and the most pressing
issues that are currently blocking progress.

Still getting started at the Incubator (7 podlings)

 Any23, Bloodhound, Cordova, DeltaSpike, DeviceMap, Flex, Openmeetings

 These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
 towards graduation is yet expected.

Not yet ready to graduate (13 podlings)

 IP clearance: Amber
 Release trouble: Clerezza, Stanbol
 Low activity: Ambari, Nuvem, PhotArk, SIS, Wink, Zeta Components
 Low diversity: Airavata, Droids, VCL, Wookie

 We expect the next quarterly report of projects in this category to
 include a summary of their actions and progress in solving these issues.

Ready to graduate (4 podlings)

 Jena, Lucene.NET, NPanday, OpenNLP

 We expect these projects to graduate within the next quarter.

-------------------- Detailed Reports --------------------

Airavata

Airavata is a software toolkit which provides features to compose, manage,
execute, and monitor large scale applications and workflows on computational
resources ranging from local clusters to national grids and computing
clouds.
Airavata is incubating since May 2011.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

 1. The barrier of entry in contributing to Airavata seems to be high.
    The code, documentation and JIRA issues have to be efficiently
    organized and managed to appeal to wider developer community.

 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well
    aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here:
    http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment

 3. Create a regular and predictable release process and schedule

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 Whilst our community is reasonably large and active we do not, at present,
 have significant diversity, but are working on it. Right now most of the
 contributors that are active are from Indiana University. Chris from JPL
 is involved very closely from a mentoring perspective and will try and get
 involved code wise. The 0.2 release candidate is currently VOTE'ing and
 DISCUSS'ing.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 No new committers or PPMC members elected in the last quarter. Decent
 discussion on the dev and user lists, with the sporadic user coming by
 and expressing interest.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 - 0.1-incubating release was cancelled, and are now VOTE'ing on
   0.2-incubating release candidate (skipped 0.1-incubating numbering).

 - Process surrounding the release is under discussion on the DISCUSS
   thread. Following the Rave process which seems to have worked for them.

Any23

Any23 is defined as a Java library, a Web service and a set of command line
tools to extract and validate structured data in RDF format from a variety
of Web documents and markup formats. Any23 is what it is informally named
an RDF Distiller.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

 1. Port Any23 code to ASF infrastructure and update license headers

 2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with
    strong connections to other relevant ASF communities.

 3. At least one Any23 incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC), Tika PMC, or ASF Board wish/need
to be aware of?

 Good news -- Michele Mostarda and Simone Tripodi and Lewis John McGibbney
 and others stepped it up and got the code migrated from Google Code over
 here to Apache. Thanks guys!

How has the community developed since the last report?

 Since the code move from Google Code here to Apache, development traffic
 has picked up. No new committers yet though, so we'll need to watch this
 going forward.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011.

 We still need to discuss Paolo Castagna's points regarding the integration
 of more of the 'semantic web' projects which exist at Apache. Also, a
 number of uses of the project are being realized as Lewis John McGibbney is
 trying to figure out a Nutch plugin. Simone Tripodi did a great job of getting
 our website up and running. So now we have an Incubator website! And the rest
 of the team is starting to discuss on list more. *very* happy about that!
 All in all, everything is going well.

--------------------
Amber

Amber has been incubating since July 2010. Amber is a project to develop
a Java library which provides an API specification for, and an
unconditionally compliant implementation of the OAuth v1.0, v1.0a and v2.0 
specifications.  OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to authenticate and 
authorise access by another party to resources they control while avoiding the 
need to share their username and password credentials.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

 - Clarify status of code grant
 - Attract users and developers
 - Generate a release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 - We need copyright signoff from University of Newcastle

How has the community developed since the last report?

 - Antonion Sanso joined in as a new committer and PPMC member
 - Raymond Feng has expressed his availability to join as a mentor
 - Simone Tripodi, Amber 'father' joined back (he'd gone emeritus before)

How has the project developed since the last report?

 - Fixed a bunch of issues for aligning with latest OAuth specification
 - Updated and improved Amber website also to face T requirements

Signed off by mentor:

--------------------
Ambari

Ambari is monitoring, administration and lifecycle management project
for Apache Hadoop clusters.

 - Incubating since 30 August 2011.
 - 146 jiras fixed (up from 129 in December)
 - Development has stalled for the last month. The project needs to have
   some roadmap discussions about how to move forward.

Issues that must be addressed before graduation are:

 - Have roadmap discussions on the dev lists
 - Making a release
 - Attracting users and developers
 - Increase diversity of developers outside of Hortonworks

Signed off by mentor: omalley

--------------------
Bloodhound

Bloodhound is an issue tracker derivative of Trac, with the goal of making
deployment easy, and usage intuitive.

Bloodhound has been incubating since December 2011.

The current three most important issues toward graduation are:

 1. Improving community diversity
 2. Lowering the barrier to entry and development
 3. Creating shippable releases and getting user feedback

We missed the report last month, largely due to inattention.  There were
a number of discussions about the relationship between Bloodhound and Trac
in early January, but those appear to have been resolved to the satisfaction
of both sets of developers and the Incubator PMC.

Since incubation some effort has gone into setting up some of our ASF
infrastructure, most notably a VM to host an instance of Trac to use for
project and issue planning.  This instance will hopefully be migrated to
Bloodhound soon, as we hope to be self-hosting.  We also have set up:

 - Mailing lists
 - Commit access for all the initial committers
 - Placeholder pages for the main website and Trac/Bloodhound front pages

The community is going through a learning process about how the ASF
functions, and how to be inclusive of the external community.  Although
most of the current developers are colocated, the mailing lists have
started to see increased activity, as the existing community learns to
work in a more open manner.  A couple of additional people have expressed
interest in participating, and are actively posting to the mailing list.
A number of mockup designs have started to flow into the repository.

The primary goals of the community include getting something potential
developers can play with into the repository, and creating a release to
get some widespread exposure to the project.

Clerezza

(incubating since November 27th, 2009)

Clerezza is a framework and set of components designed to make it easy to
build application for the semantic and the social web.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:

 1. Manage to get first release out and establish a process to do this
    faster in the future.

 2. Better documentation and tutorials on how to build apps with Clerezza.

 3. We need to discuss a plan for community development with our mentors
    for the next board report. The next report will contain some clear
    actions.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of:

 Creating a release turned out to be more difficult than expected, mostly
 due to legal/licensing issues. We hope that once this is resolved for
 the first release it will be easier for subsequent releases. While
 progress has been slow, we think the next release candidate will be
 proposed very soon. Nothing is blocking progress but the legal problems
 have been discovered late and were time consuming to repair - also
 because we have no experience with this so far.

How has the community developed since the last report:

 - A new interesting person has shown up on the mailing lists.
 - Patch contributed by non-committer.
 - Domeo Annotation Toolkit is using Clerezza
   (http://annotationframework.org/).

How has the project developed since the last report.

 - Changes to project structure and naming as a result of trying to
   create a release.
 - Work to meet legal requirements / consolidate NOTICE/LICENSE files.
 - Bug-fixes.

Cordova

Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project entered incubation as
Apache Callback in October, 2011, before changing its name to Cordova.

January could be characterized as the month where we hit our stride
on Apache infra. Tonnes of updates to the code. Huge activity on the
mailing list. Two new committers voted in.

Currently, we recognize the majority of commits are currently coming
from Adobe and IBM actively pushing to our repositories on git-wip-us
(6 and 4 active pushers respectively). We aim to add more contributors
in coming releases as per The Apache Way.

 - shipped 1.4 (NOTE: we aim to make 1.5 our first official apache release)
 - continued code migration to Cordova name
 - new Apache Cordova logo!
 - project web site design iteration
 - new automated build system code named 'coho'
 - Yohei Shimomae voted as committer
 - Steve Gill voted as committer
 - made progress on the IP review

Graduation concerns:

 - Complete the IP review (source headers, license metadata, etc.)
 - Continue to foster more community committers
 - Ship an official Apache release

DeltaSpike

(incubating since December 2011)

DeltaSpike will consist of a number of portable CDI extensions that provide
useful features for Java application developers. The goal of DeltaSpike is
to create a de-facto standard of CDI-Extensions that is developed and
maintained by the community.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention.

Since our last report on January 1, 2012, we have accomplished the
following:

 - Temporary documentation started
 - Features for version finished, documented and reviewed
 - Release procedure for deltaspike-0.1-incubating started (VOTE is running)
 - Discussions for features of version 0.2 started
 - IP clearance process of Seam3 started (all already imported sources are IP 
   cleared)
 - Nabble mirror of your dev-mailing list created
 - GIT workflow defined
 - New contributors joined our effort
 - New Committers (voted and added)
   - Dan Allen
   - Lincoln Baxter III
   - Rudy De Busscher
   - Christian Kaltepoth
   - Lukasz Lenart
 - GitHub mirror created (done by the infra team)

Upcoming major goals:

 - Refine test-infrastructure to allow easier tests and add
   further containers
 - Finish the setup for the documentation and the website
 - Finish IP clearance of Seam3

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve before graduation:

 1. Build community
 2. Create at least one release
 3. Create Documentation

DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information,
images and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices,
e.g. smartphones and tablets.

Droids

Droids is an Incubator project arrived from Apache Labs. Droids entered
incubation on October, 2008.

It's an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows one to create
and extend existing web robots.

Richard Frovarp has been added as a mentor to the project.

IP clearance has been taken care of and was done prior to the release that
was performed. That issue should not have been in the last report.

Issues before graduation :

 The biggest obstacle for graduation is obtaining a diverse group of active
 committers. 95% of the commits over the past 6 months were by a single
 committer. The project needs to engage the committers that exist and
 identify new people to bring into the project. The goal for the next
 quarter is to elicit more activity.

Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A highly energetic community waits for Adobe to transition code
and infrastructure.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top four items to resolve before graduation:

 1. Resolve trademark donation or licensing
 2. Complete code and bug database donation
 3. Make at least one release
 4. Add new committers

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

 The ASF legal team will have to work with Adobe on the Trademark
 licensing issue.  Adobe legal is still drafting the proposal before
 presenting to Apache.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the
podling?)

 Besides the trademark issue mentioned previously, the code donation and
 bug database donation are being slowed by infrastructure issues at both
 Adobe and Apache, mainly the lack of ways to easily transfer multi-GB
 files.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

 http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

 - An initial set of Flex source (minus Subversion history) was checked into
   the whiteboard area of the podling's Subversion repository.
 - Other initial committers have donated code to the whiteboard.
 - A logo contest was held.  Over 50 entries were submitted.
 - The mailing lists were established.  Over 200 people joined in the
   first 30 days and the traffic averaged over 100 emails a day.  It has
   quieted down now that the logo contest has concluded.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

 Adobe expects to complete the transfer of the bug database and the initial
 set of code with history.  Adobe also hopes to contribute the compiler and
 test suite as well.  And there is hope for an initial release.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly for
you?

 Incubation has been working well.  Our mentors are great.

Jena

Jena is a semantic web framework in Java that implements the key W3C
recommendations for the core semantic web technologies of RDF and SPARQL.

Jena entered incubation in November 2010.

The project is discussing graduation.

Progress since the last report:

 - The project has voted for a new committer and IPMC member for the project.
   This is the second person since the start of incubation.

 - The project has successfully produced a release. The first incubator
   release included the system core and query engine, which is 80% of the
   codebase but not all the modules. TDB is in active development and is
   only now ready for release.

 - Redirections placed at both old websites to point to the Apache incubator
   website for Apache Jena.

 - About 20 JIRA items have been resolved since the last report.

 - Users email traffic on old, non-Apache lists continues to decline.

Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

 None.

Plan:

 - Graduation preparation (checking, drafting the scope/charter,
   resolution, chair, more checking)
 - There are no technical or infrastructure items blocking graduation.
 - Releases of further subsystems: TDB, Fuseki, LARQ.

Lucene.NET

Lucene.Net was accepted into the Apache Incubator in February 2011.
Originally it was a sub project of the Lucene Project.

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in
C# and targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:

 - Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating
   and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize
   with the Java Lucene release schedule.

 - High-performance C# search engine library.

 - Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that
   end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that
   takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.

Recent Activity:

 - Lucene.Net 2.9.4g passed a vote for release Jan 29th. We are preparing
   to move the files to dist, creating NuGet packages and updating the website

 - Significant Activity for Lucene.Net 3.0.3

Current Activities:

 - Porting Java Lucene 3.0.3
 - Porting Java Lucene 4.0
 - Hashing out style guidelines (FxCop / ReSharper)

Long term goals:

 - Have a nearly fully automated process to convert Java Lucene to C#.
   (This has been a goal, but we are discussing if this is truely the
   best idea of the project)
 - Release Lucene.Net 3.0.3 (port of Java Lucene 3.0.3)
 - Have a new .NET version of Lucene utilizing .NET constructs and idioms

Graduation thought:

 - One of the mentors (Stefan Bodewig) has indicated he wants to start
   pushing for graduation. We will be making plans to do this in the next
   couple of months

--------------------
NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with
Apache Maven. NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.

Discussion has been low over the holiday period, but steady work has been
put into knocking issues marked for the next releases. There are very few
left, and a good number of fixes complete, so a release should come quite
shortly. This would be a good opportunity to focus on a graduation plan,
and to better promote the project among the .NET and Maven communities
and increase the number of users and contributors.

We continue to see small growth in users, and occasional patch submissions,
but haven't added a new committer in a while.

The top priorities towards graduation are:

 - work out a concrete plan towards graduation in the next quarter
 - encourage newer contributors to do so on a continuing basis.

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.

   there are discussions on the mailing list around the future of the project.

Top things to resolve prior to graduation:

 - Increase the number of active committers.

Openmeetings

Openmeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white
board, collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using
API functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.

OpenMeetings entered the incubation on November 12, 2011.

 - A question for PMC: Should we start a demo server on Apache, so people
   can benefit from communication?

Summary:
The project prepares some of the infrastructure, releases of the
OpenMeetings plugins and refactors the sources for a first incubator
release of the OpenMeetings Application.

Details:
The project has a number of Plugins that it releases for integration of
OpenMeetings into other platforms: Moodle Plugin, SugarCRM Plugin, those
Plugins have been refactored to be compatible with Apache License and can
be released now.

OpenMeetings project itself has replaced the Library JOD , which is part of
the conversion with OpenOffice and import of .doc/.ppt/.xls/.odp/... to
whiteboard of OpenMeetings (OPENMEETINGS-32). JOD library is not part of the
OpenMeetings distribution anymore and users will need to configure the path
to JOD library on their installation to enable the importer. This is a
temporary solution, the Developers of JOD library will change their license
to an APL compatible as soon as Apache OpenOffice successfully releases
under APL (Message from JOD Developers:
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jodconverter/2f0bo38H59I/P_Dro3pe64QJ).

The UI interface has been refactored to have the possibility to configure
the UI elements (OPENMEETINGS-21 to OPENMEETINGS-25)

The SIP integration has been refactored and we are talking to the developers
of Red5 (http://code.google.com/p/red5phone/) how we will handle integration
between the two projects in the future.

The Red5 project has changed its license to APL
(http://code.google.com/p/red5/source/detail?r=4309)

Plan:

 - Calendar UI will be refactored to use REST API in the coming weeks
   instead of RTMP protocol, Laszlo Calendar Component (CPL licensed) will
   be removed from the sources. Conversion to REST should improve the
   possibility to switch to pure JavaScript UI on the long run.

 - The integration with Apache's Continuous Build environment is a todo.
   The current ANT script is not compatible with the Hudson/Jenkins build
   environment at ASF and needs to be refactored (OPENMEETINGS-2)

 - There are plans to add a JIRA / confluence plugin

Community:

 - There are still messages to the old project website, but the majority of
   the users have switched  to the new project website.

 - There are a number of 3th party maintained Plugins, especially for
   E-Learning frameworks like Sakai, ILias, StudIP, ATutor, ELGG. We will
   need to convert those docs/references to the ASF website.

OpenNLP

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. Incubating since November, 2011.

It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization, sentence
segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction, chunking,
parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually required to
build more advanced text processing services. OpenNLP also includes maximum
entropy and perceptron based machine learning.

The team was extended by two new committers, Boris Galitsky and Aliaksandr
Autayeu. We worked towards our graduation and had a positive community and
recommendation vote.

Our community became more active and we saw a couple of new faces
on the user and development mailing list.

PhotArk

Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application
including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access
control layer, and upload capabilities.

PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008.

PhotArk has a small community of contributors, mostly student, that need a
lot of attention in order to keep them active, and the lack of attention made
the community stale to almost a zero activity in the last three or four months.

Currently the is a community discussion on the future of the project, and
one of the ideas that has gotten the community attention is to make PhotArk
to move away from a image repository, and become a HTML5/Cordova mobile
application that aggregates images from different photo sources such as:
Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, etc. We have also raised the question with IPMC
if we need to follow any specific process in case the community decide to
change the scope of the project, but we haven't got any answer yet.

Issues before graduation :

 -  PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have
    grown the community to the minimal independent committer size required
    for graduation. We need to make these contributors constantly active
    in order to think about graduation again, or recruit new contributors.

SIS

Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users
can use to build applications containing location context. This project will
look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities,
services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further,
the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level
community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores, REST-ful
interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under the
Apache umbrella.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 The thread here: http://s.apache.org/Q2z reports a "where is the project"
 going status. I think we've come up with a plan of action items to
 develop on. We've elected 2 new PPMC members and committers (Adam Estrada
 and Andrew Hart) and both are on board and have their accounts set up.

 In response to reviving the project, I'd urge folks to give us a chance
 with the new blood we've infused and with our development plan that Chris
 proposed.

Community progress since the last report

 Adam Estrada and Andrew Hart were VOTEd in as PPMC members and committers.

Project progress since last report

 SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.

 Here is the current list of items to work on for 0.2-incubating.

 - SIS-28 Create a Layer Service for Google Earth Integration
 - SIS-13 Change QuadTree Reader/Writer to use URLs instead of String
          file paths
 - SIS-11 Basic CLI for SIS
 - SIS-10 Ability to create SIS data from WKT specs
 - SIS-9  Allow for multiple spatial reference systems
 - SIS-8  Build a common SIS data container for spatial data

 The goal is to make some progress on these issues before the next report
 and have a status update on the 0.2-incubating release.

Stanbol

Apache Stanbol is an open source modular software stack and reusable
set of components for semantic content management. Incubating since
November, 2010.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation.

 - Make a first release (depends on a first release of Apache Clerezza to
   eliminate SNAPSHOT dependencies)

 - Auditing/clarifying multiple maven repositories and corresponding
   dependencies

 - Make the data models downloadable independently from the ASF repositories
   to avoid gray copyright / licensing issues (for instance for the OpenNLP
   models).

How has the community developed since the last report?

 - Reto Bachmann Gmuer and Ali Anil Sinaci has been elected as new committers.
 - Alberto Musetti has contributed to the project by providing patches
 - David Riccitelli provided patch that uses the Stanbol Commons Jobs to
   implement an Asynchronous RESTful API for the Stanbol Enhancer.

How has the project developed since the last report.

 Features:
 - LDPath (http://code.google.com/p/ldpath/) support for Entityhub and
   Contenthub
 - Contenthub now supports multiple semantic indexes and Solr RESTful API
   can be directly used for search
 - Enhancer now support for multiple Enhancement Chains and multi-part
   ContentItems. Work on extended RESTful API will be finished soon.
 - Enhancement Engine for Topic Classification (STANBOL-197)
 - First version of a Apache Stanbol/Apache Camel integration

 Improved Documentation (both on the Stanbol Homepage and the Web UI of

Wink

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of REST
style web services. The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311)
standard. The project also introduces a client runtime which can leverage
certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink will deliver
component technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of
environments.

Apache Wink has been incubating since 2009-05-27.

Development list traffic and discussions are steadily, but low. The community
has started some discussion on picking up the JAX-RS 2.0 draft specs and
start working/prototyping on this, but activity has not increased yet.

The community has also discussed graduation, and worked on various graduation
process tasks, but the talks had halted as one member has not agreed to
proceed with graduation while the activity on the project is slow.

Planned Activity:

 - Increase activity among existing committers/pmc members
 - Start prototyping on JAX-RS 2.0 draft specs
 - Work towards graduation.

Top issues before graduation:

 - Increase the size/diversity of the active dev community

Wookie

Wookie is a Java server application that allows you to upload and deploy
widgets for your applications. Wookie is based on the W3C Widgets
specification, but widgets can also be included that use extended APIs
such as Google Wave Gadgets and OpenSocial.

Wookie has been incubating since 17th July 2009

Wookie has a small, reasonably active community, however, the majority of
that activity is focussed around one or two individuals. The main issue we
would like to address before graduation is to ensure we  have more diversity
in our community. However, as it stands we could probably graduate as we meet
the minimum criteria (5 committers from 3 organisations). We recognise that
some IPMC members would suggest graduation at this point might help
accelerate community growth. We intend to discuss this within the community
over the next quarter whilst also seeking to expand our community.

One strategy for this is to reach out to projects and teams already using
Wookie and encourage their developers to contribute back to the community.
We know several projects (both in commercial and academic sectors) that have
been conducting R&D activity using Wookie and we want to make sure we can
bring in both contributions from these projects and also welcome their
developers into our community.

However we feel that Wookie will only really become fully sustainable when
there is more uptake of the W3C Widgets/Native Web Applications
specifications into "real" systems and products. On this front we're active
and visible in W3C, along with PhoneGap/Apache Cordova (incubating) who also
support W3C Widgets (the W3C Native Web Apps Community have a co-chair who
is a Wookie committer and another who is a Cordova committer). Another
strategy has been to support integration in Apache Rave (currently preparing
to graduate) as this is a way to build our user base (and is also a great way
to demo Wookie). Another approach we're looking at is how we can use Wookie
to deploy widgets that relate to ASF processes and activities as a way of
raising awareness and interest; we've done some experiments with Widgets
using the Jira API as a starting point for a demonstrator.

In any case, we can certainly do more to promote Wookie and generate
interest.

Since November 2011:

 - 0.9.1 release
 - Received updated patch for oAuth support from community member
 - Received documentation contribution for packaging Wookie as a portable
   app on a USB stick

Next steps:

 - 0.9.2 release using an improved and simplified release process
 - Developer outreach activity (see above)
 - Improve communication about Wookie
 - ASF Widgets demo

Issues before graduation:

 - build community/expand user base

Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Roller Project

Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based weblogging package that works
well on Tomcat and MySQL, and is also known to run on other servers and
databases.

Issues

No board issues at this time.

Releases

The latest release of Apache Roller is v5.0, which was released
on May 8, 2011.

Community

Since our last report, the Roller community has been making small bug
fixes and has received a handful of patches from contributors. We have
also discussed the possibility of a 5.0.1 release to incorporate recent
Struts and Spring security fixes, though we have not confirmed any
vulnerabilities yet.

Apart from that, the Roller community continues to be rather quiet
with low traffic that mostly concerns technical support and installation
issues. No new committers or PMC changes to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

The Apache Santuario project is aimed at providing implementation of security
standards for XML.

A major new release of the Apache XML Security for Java library (1.5.0) was
achieved in the last quarter. This release features support for GCM algorithms,
support for RSA-OAEP key transport algorithms with strong digests, startup
performance improvements, better protection against various attacks when
validating signatures, amongst many other issues.

There were no new committers or changes to the PMC in the last quarter.

Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Subversion Project

** Board Issues

The Subversion project has no Board-level issues at this time.

** Community

The user community continues its regular handling of about 400
messages per month. The development list is a bit higher, near an
average of 500 per month. There have been no obvious problems over the
past reporting period.

In January, Andreas Stieger was added as a committer on the project.

** Releases

The project released version 1.7.3 on Monday, February 13.

We are planning a 1.6.18 release "soon" to deal with some high-profile
issues. The 1.6.x series continues to be maintained under a "security
and important fixes only" profile. These releases are made from
tigris.org (rather than the ASF) due to its pre-ASF historical
licensing. The community is looking forward to deprecating the 1.6.x
series upon the release of the 1.8.x series.

Currently, there are no dates for the 1.8.x series. The community does
not want the overly-long release cycle that occurred with 1.7.0, so
the next version should happen this year.

** Other

elego has set the date for their Subversion hackathon in Berlin: it
will be held June 11 to June 15, at their offices. The hackathon is
open to all Subversion committers and selected invitees.

Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Tuscany Project

Apache Tuscany is an SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA.

The past months in Tuscany have been quiet compared to previous years
with significantly less commits and dev list discussion. There have
been no releases and its approaching a year since the last release. We
have just started talking about doing another release and some work on
that has now started. Also, one new committer has just been voted in.
There have been no PMC changes this quarter, there was a PMC addition
in the previous quarter. Traffic on the user list remains consistent
though and the subscribers to the user list (346) is up slightly
compared to the previous quarter.

The PMC is discussing a change of chair but there are no alternative
candidates yet.

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

work.

4. Work has been started to revive Xalan-J.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J

Development of the XML Schema 1.1 validator reached an important
milestone this quarter. Xerces-J now passes all of the relevant XML
Schema 1.1 W3C test cases and that has helped advance the XML Schema
1.1 specification to a W3C Proposed Recommendation. This means we're
finally in the home stretch and should be able to make XML Schema
1.1 support a full fledged feature of Xerces-J in the not too
distant future.

We're already getting some early interest for GSoC 2012. So far two
students have joined the development mailing list and are asking
about potential project ideas. 

Several new bug reports and patches were created/provided by members
of the community. These still need to be reviewed.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; about 50+ posts on the j-dev
and j-users lists since the beginning of December.

No new releases this quarter.

Xerces-C

Moderate development activity during the reporting period: 3 bugs
have been filed, 8 have been resolved.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; about 60+ posts on the c-dev
and c-users lists since the beginning of December.

No new releases this quarter.

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

A suggestion to fix a URL conversion issue in the XML Commons
Resolver was made by one user who also questioned whether it's still
worth supporting Java 1.3 in 2012. Otherwise it's been a quiet
period with no other mailing list traffic to report.

Moving the website and SVN location under the Xerces domain is still
a TODO.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

There's still some work left to do on the TLP website, including
adding TM to the project logo. No progress this quarter.

Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

General
=======
There are no issues that require board attention.

XML Graphics Commons
====================
No code changes were made to the commons library in this quarter.

Batik
=====
Developer activity has been low with only 1 commit this quarter. A few
questions were raised and answered on the user mailing list.

FOP
===
1 new committer was voted in during this quarter: Mehdi Houshmand.
Several patches have been processed and several bugs fixed. Lots of
questions and bugs are being reported on fop-user with questions being
answered by committers and contributors.

A release is now long overdue due to time constraints. We need to find
a way to streamline the release process so regular releases won't be
such a strain on time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AL: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.


Status

As usual we had a low levels of traffic in our users mailing lists,
but usually we are able to give an answer on fast time, and by more
than one.
Little activity on dev mail list and issue tracker, but sometimes we
receive some patches from our users via JIRA.
I tried many times to get more committers, but nothing new at the moment.

On the progress of the project, we are actively working on bug fixing
(at least for some months from now), so after this we'll start to
develop the next release, but not before due to time constraints. One
of our major next features (due to market requiring this) will be to
handle a multi-platform GUI backend, but this is a big task so
probably we'll try to do it during next n releases.


Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.


Releases
After 1 year, many bugs fixed, and a team restructuring, in January
we released the 2.0.1 version.
It took to us so much time even because many tasks related to release,
build, and documentation wasn't documented nor explained to other PMC
members, and was done by another PMC Member, so we have to learn how
to do all (now I have documented some steps and I have to finish to
write some additional info). Long time was needed even because we are
a small team, none of us is working full time on Pivot, and I'm sorry
to say that some in the team aren't active in development nor in other
areas, for many reasons.
I expect the next maintenance release (2.0.2) to be available shortly.


Branding/naming issues:
During the last quarter I re-read the revised branding docs, identify
all things that has to be done, and fix some of them.
Remaining issues are:
* main site navigation needs some additional links
* create a DOAP file


Legal issues:
None.


Infrastructure issues/needs:
None.


Community changes
No new committers were voted in since the last board report.
A PMC Member, Niclas Hedhman (niclas) resigned from the project, due
to time constraints.
The last PMC Member added is Roger Whitcomb (rwhitcomb) from Actian
Corporation, voting closed 2011-10-25 .
There are no diversity issues regarding the PMC.


Note:
The Report for Pivot was expected in December 2011, but due to the
resignation of the previous PMC Chair and my election in January, this is
my first Report.

To try to get more interest from people, during last months I opened
some Pivot-related projects under Apache-Extras, and some
contributions has been given there, but of course nothing has been
moved in the main code base, and no Committers from there into Pivot,
I hope someone could join us in the future.
Some experimental code has been put in some project under
Apache-Extras, to let users play with incompatible changes for future
releases, to start discuss/share some idea.
