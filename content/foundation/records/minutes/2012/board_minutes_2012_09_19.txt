 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       We held our annual face-to-face board meeting last month, this
       year in the Washington DC area.  We rapidly reached consensus
       in several areas that might have taken considerably longer to
       discuss over email, demonstrating the effectiveness of this
       annual tradition.

       Many thanks to Adobe for hosting the meeting.

       My summary of that meeting follows.

       ---------------

       We appointed the following new officers:
         Executive Vice President - Ross Gardler
         Treasurer - Chris Mattmann
         Assistant Treasurer - Sam Ruby

       Many thanks to exiting EVP Noirin Plunkett.

       We currently engage six paid contractors.  Over time this
       number will likely increase, and long-term we may need to hire
       an Executive Director.  In anticipation of this we decided to
       slightly re-organize the Foundation to better permit such a
       role.  We now place all operational components of the
       Foundation under the President, rather than having some report
       directly to the Board.

       The groups that report through the President now include:

         Branding
         ConCom
         Fundraising
         Infrastructure
         Press
         Travel Assistance

       In particular, these groups will now submit their monthly
       reports to the President who will compile them into a single
       report to the Board.  The President is now responsible for
       answering questions to the these groups from the Board.

    B. President [Jim]

       Thanks again to the board with entrusting me with the duties
       of President. We are starting to make the transitions from
       many of the committees reporting directly to the board to
       instead reporting to the President. The 'operations@' mailing
       list discussed at the f2f has been setup but not yet formally
       announced.

       Our EA is working almost exclusively on ACEU duties and has
       been invaluable in the ongoing progress associated with Concom.
       
    C. Treasurer [Chris]

      Chris's transition as ASF Treasurer is going along smoothly,
      thanks to Sam and others.

      The biggest issue is filing 2011 Taxes. Chris filed an 
      extension using IRS form 8868 [1] and file taxes using form
      990. Since our 2011 Taxes were originally due on Sep 15, 2012,
      they are now due on Dec 15, 2012.

      Chris has been curating a Quicken database [2] based off of Sam's
      Treasurer whimsy.apache.org scripts and it is up to date through
      August 2012 (CYTD). Chris is working on a 2011 Quicken DB for
      the tax situation since we believe Quicken has some bells and
      whistles to make this process less difficult.

      Sam is working to get Chris account access and an RSA hard/soft
      token to the Wells Fargo account. Also Sam has given 
      Chris access to our Paypal account and Chris confirmed he can log 
      in.

      Chris brought up the need to ensure HALO was paid on time
      (request from Sally), and Sam ensured that he would cover bill
      paying for August 2012 until Chris has the ability to pay bills
      from Wells Fargo.

      Sally and Melissa and Upayavira and Greg have been working with
      Google and secured $7500 in subsidies for student registration
      and select speaker expenses for ApacheCon EU 2012. Chris and
      Sam worked with Sally to create an invoice for Google so that we
      can get the money headed our way.

      Hadrian Zbarcea is leading an effort working with the ASF Board
      to get an audit process going for the ASF's finances. Talks
      appear to be ongoing and no specific action is required from the
      Treasurer at this time.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

      August, a traditionally slow vacation month, saw substantial activity 
      at secretary@. 82 ICLAs, five grants, and six CCLAs were received and 
      recorded. As part of the filing process 14 new account requests were 
      made.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

      Budget to support ApacheConEU has been agreed with ConCom,
      waiting for any final objections before setting up discount
      codes. Steve of OpenBastion has still not submitted a contract for
      consideration. I've chased him a number of times. It looks like he
      has been putting his energy into making sure speaker
      acceptances/rejections went out.

      ConCom volunteers seems to be progressing more now that the
      pressure to produce a large event has subsided. The event has been
      rebranded as ApacheConEU (Community Edition).

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================

Responded to a usual array of requests, including several book 
publishers who seem to be appreciating our FAQ entry for them.

Approved the Airavata name for TLP; kudos to the PPMC there for 
doing very thorough research around the name!

External Requests
=================

Commented on a fundraising@ request that included an agreement 
that could have granted far too broad rights to our marks in a 
sponsorship agreement.

Trademark Registrations
=======================

Worked with DLAPiper to ensure past registration tracking from 
Sun/Oracle legal firms for OpenOffice.org registrations is 
fully transferred to us.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising

Most fundraising activity during the last month has been around the 
Calxeda donation of ARM based servers to ASF infrastructure. While 
we have watched this, it has not needed much of our input, as Sally 
has been handling their PR wishes.

Other than this, August was a quiet month for fundraising, with a 
few enquiries that have not led to anything.

We now have a reasonable understanding of the payment patterns for 
our platinum and gold sponsors. We still have a number of bronze 
sponsors that still need to be approached.

I believe it is now time to start setting fundraising targets, to 
ensure we continue to meet our financial expectations. These 
targets will be set so as to maintain our current income levels, 
and won't account for growth.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

I. Budget: no payments are due at this time; special thanks to ASF
Treasurer Chris Mattmann and Sam Ruby for seeing payments through

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned.
Sally Khudairi has been working with Upayavira with select ASF
Platinum and Gold Sponsors, as well as with several companies
donating products & services, and others seeking to make contributions
to the Apache Incubator to ensure their publicity activities comply
with our guidelines. In addition, Sally continues to work on ApacheCon
sponsorship with Melissa Warnkin.

No new posts were made on "TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: we remain on standby for input from the
Tuscany PMC regarding the press release for Tuscany v2.0. The
press-analyst briefing for a feature on CouchDB has yet to take
place due to media-analyst scheduling conflicts, coupled with summer
holidays. Those PMCs wishing to announce major project news --as
well as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator-- please
contact Sally at press@apache.org for more information. Kindly
provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: in addition to select pre-announcement briefings,
9 media requests were responded to (including New York Times, Popular
Science, and Network World), and 5 interviews coordinated for various
projects. The ASF received 546 press clips over this time period,
vs. last month's clip count of 691.

VII. Analyst Relations: we are trying to re-book RedMonk for their
briefing on CouchDB. Apache was mentioned in 12 reports by 451
Research, 25 writeups/reports by Gartner (including Magic Quadrant,
Hype Cycle, Who's Who, and Emerging Trends reports), and 4 reports
by Forrester.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally continues to act as a point of contact
regarding sponsorship of ApacheCon Europe, and is working with
Melissa on invoicing as well as the ASF Treasury with select ASF
Sponsor accounts receivable. She also continues to participate in
a number of strategic discussions to help ensure the planning team
is tactically synchronized.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: we arranged
Lars Eilebrecht to participate on an Open Source security panel in
London, and are working with Santiago Gala in processing a request
for participation in a pan-Iberian/Portuguese conference on Open
Source. Sally has also been actively coordinating the attendance
of one of our PMCs at an award ceremony during a major industry
conference in recognition of their efforts.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 5 pre-paid press releases remaining
on the PRNewswire account and 17 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of the Fiscal Year.

Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

-----------------
ApacheCons
----------
The website for ApacheCon NA 2013 is set to go live early this week, and
the Call For Papers will launch shortly after that. This is slightly later
than planned, but it was felt best to delay things until after the ACEU
notifications and schedules were done.

ACEU continues to trial various processes, website features, ideas etc for
ACNA, with varying levels of pain/success. While this has caused some
notable delays to ACEU things this month, it has led to a lot of bugs
getting fixed / processes getting refined, which should hopefully make
life much slicker and easier for ACNA (expected to be a much larger event)

Notifications to Speakers, Backup Speakers and rejections have been sent
out, and almost all responses received. A few speakers have declined, and
will shortly be replaced by the designated backup speakers, with remaining
backup speakers likely to be called upon nearer the time.

The allocations of sessions to tracks were worked out a few weeks ago, and
used as the basis for track chairs to select the talks they wanted to
include. Now that speaker responses are in, the Schedule for ACEU is set
to be announced early this week.

Following last month's board feedback, we have opted to make the ACEU
event more focused on the community, and trimmed back a few aspects to
reduce the amount of volunteer energies required. As part of this, we
intend to dramatically lower the committers ticket price, to try to draw
more committers along. Details on this are expected to be announced this
week. We've also gained sponsorship to offer heavily discounted student
tickets, and a volunteer has kindly put together a flyer advertising this.
Speakers will be offered a free ticket if they need it. A few speakers are
helping revise the draft speaker information, and we expect to send this
out a few days after the schedule.

Melissa is doing a great job in maintaining the task schedule and todo
list, which is helping reduce (but sadly not eliminate...) the number of
dropped balls and late task completions.

Small Events
------------
No new small events are currently scheduled, or in the planning stages.
There is limited volunteer cycles available to help mentor if volunteers
interested in organising an event were to surface. There's not currently
the cycles available to seek out and encourage new people, but there is
hope that ACEU may cause some to show up.

Committee
---------
No new committee members were added this month, though 3 were added last
month. ACEU has a number of volunteers who hadn't been widely involved in
ConCom before, several of whom may be good candidates for committee
membership in the near future.

There have been some discussions on the number of lists that ConCom
manages. A few people have suggested reducing it to simply two lists, but
some potential snags with this approach have been identified and not yet
resolved. This discussion is expected to continue, and we hope that the
recent list of requirements and background on where the more recent lists
have come from, may allow someone to come up with a new plan which solves
most of the problems.

Progress with the long term TODO list has been virtually non-existent,
with admin/website/etc energies currently focused on ApacheCon instead.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Daniel Gruno added to the Infrastructure Team.

Bought a pair of 1TB SATA drives, one of which was
used to replace a bad disk in hermes (mail).

Calxeda donated access to a 24-node ARM-based hosting
service to be deployed as part of our build farm offerings.

Removed the custom jira patch licensing plugin largely
because no one wanted to continue to maintain it.

Migrated jira service to its own hardware (a spare r410)
for stability reasons.

Picked up a 7 more SATA drives for inventory and replacement.

VP Infra pointed out various rumblings rising to the board
level about contractor communications, and had various ideas
about how to address that.

Started work on a Circonus-based service to replace our aging
nagios installation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
-----------

TAC is moving from a Board Committee to a Presidents Committee, as such we
will now report directly to the president for our monthly reporting, and
for adding/removing committee members etc. Budget approvals in the future
will also go through the president.

No changes to the committee this month, however we do have 2 new (ASF)
members in Mohammad Nour and Kanchana offering to help us with organising
our recipients at the ApacheCon EU event. As they are intending to go
anyway this is a good thing for us.

ApacheCon EU 2012 November
----------------------------------------

Things are continuing to tick along nicely, hotels have been block booked
(but not yet paid.) We paid our first installment for the flights to secure
prices before they jump up. Nick, Melissa and others in association with
concom have been driving things along in this regard, combined with the 3
judges all seems to be in good shape.

ApacheCon NA 2013
---------------------------

Some dates are being discussed, we need to align ourselves more with concom
in order to open at the right time for this event. It is likely
to be once the ApacheCon EU event has finished.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment D: Status report for the Apache BVal Project

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No releases since the last report.

### Activity ###
Little development activity of late; most of the BVal team are spread across
various ASF projects, so we've not yet been able to make good on our intentions
to continue improving the codebase towards a 1.0 release.

Traffic on the user mailing list remains low/nonexistent.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.

### Branding ###
The project has adopted (though not yet re-branded with) a new logo contributed
by Adonis Raduca. The PMC thanks him for his contribution, as well as his
employer, IRIAN Solutions, for his time.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.

Attachment E: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project

DESCRIPTION

Apache STDCXX is a collection of algorithms, containers, iterators,
and other fundamental components of every piece of software, implemented
as C++ classes, templates, and functions essential for writing C++ programs.

RELEASES

* There has not been a release of stdcxx since 2008. Renewed work is
 being done on the 4.2.x and 4.3.x branches.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* After a "gentle" nudge by the current chair, we've seen renewed activity
 on the mailing list. In particular, a specific BUGZ entry (STDCXX-1056)
 has seen a lot of discussion.

* There was some licensing FUD discussed on the list, mostly to promote
 a "rationale" for moving the project elsewhere and/or releasing
 stdcxx under a different license. This has (hopefully) been clarified.

* Branching and development policies are being discussed on the
 mailing list.

* Moving to git, as a way to draw in more potential developers
 was suggested, but as of yet there is no decision on whether
 to follow through with it.

COMMUNITY

* Stefan Teleman (steleman@apache.org) was added to the PMC in July

ISSUES

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Chemistry Project

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in
Java, Python, PHP, and .NET (and possibly other languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.


== Project status ==

The OpenCMIS (Java) subproject is working on fixes and new features.
One topic is to make OpenCMIS work in different environments and
with different dependencies.
Another topic is to follow the Browser Binding changes in the
CMIS 1.1 specification draft.

The DotCMIS (.NET) subproject follows OpenCMIS and adopts relevant
changes.

There is not much activity around the other two subproject,
cmislib (Python) and phpclient (PHP).


== Community ==

No significant changes. Steady traffic on the mailing list.


== Releases ==

No releases in the last three months.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Click Project

Apache Click is an easy-to-use page and component oriented Java web
framework.

There are no board level issues at this time.

Infrastructure
-------------------
There are no infrastructure issues at this time.

Development
------------------
Progress is being made towards a version 2.4 release due for release in Q3
2012.

Community
----------------
There have been no new committer or PMC members added during this period.

Mailing list traffic has been very light for the period.


The project needs to recruit new committers and community support remain
active and healthy.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

Apache Commons provides a large set of reusable Java components. Commons
components are widely used in many projects, both at Apache and outside.

There are no particular problems that would require board support.

Several components have been released since last report:
        Commons IO            2.4    (2012-07-06)
        Commons DbUtils       1.5    (2012-07-21)
        Commons Configuration 1.9    (2012-08-23)

Commons project is still late for the mandatory svnpubsub migration. We
have relaunched the thread about this and hope we will make the switch
before the deadline.

Commons community experienced a few changes, as two new committers have
been elected: Bruno P. Kinoshita and Elijah Zupancic, one committer
has left: Mikkel Meyer Andersen as well as one PMC member: Henri Biestro.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache DirectMemory Project

Apache DirectMemory is an off-heap cache implementation for the JVM. It
features direct memory management (a-la BigMemory) to enable efficient
handling of a large number of java objects without affecting JVM garbage
collection performance.

DirectMemory graduated August 15th and not much happened since - except for
the payoff that has been considerably shortened. Next steps will be in
gathering community and development team proposals to better identify a
direction for our efforts (which has sometimes been an issue, as pointed
out during the graduation voting process) and, maybe, spread adoption
(which is very limited at the moment regardless of the good number of
integrations developed).

All tasks regarding TLP graduation have been completed (including svnpubsub
for both distribution and site deployment).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

No Board level issues.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Activity ==

Gump on vmgump now runs on Oracle Java7 since more an more projects
depend on it.  As a result other projects - most notably those who
implement JDBC interfaces - have been broken.

The dataset of projects built by Gump is maintained by only a few
people contributing across all projects and a few additional people
maintaining the metadata of the projects they are interested in the
most.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.

== Statistics ==

As of Mon, 10 Sep 2012 the ASF installations check out a bit more than
175 source trees (115 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
more than 850 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes about eight and a
half hours on vmgump and about ten on the FreeBSD jail and eight on
Adam where more projects fail to build. 

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ , a
FreeBSD jail at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/public/ and a Mac OS
X Server at http://adam.apache.org/gump/

-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The Incubator continues to work reasonably well, with no major issues that
would require direct board attention or assistance.

The downward trend in the number of podlings at the Incubator continues thanks
to the efforts to more actively help podlings towards graduation and to retire
old, inactive podlings. The rate of this change has leveled off over summer,
but we still graduate or retire some 2-3 podlings while accepting only 1-2 new
podlings on average per month.

Current podlings can be roughly divided in three equal-sized groups based on
the time they've spent in the Incubator: a) less than a year, b) less than two
years, and c) more than two years. Of the podlings reporting this month only
Etch, Isis and NPanday fall into the last group, and we're happy to see at
least Etch and Isis being close to graduation in near future.

o Community

  Noah Slater joined the Incubator PMC since our last report.

  The following podlings are requesting graduation to an Apache TLP:

  - Apache Airavata
  - Apache SIS
  - Apache Stanbol

  The Incubator PMC recommends the board to accept the respective resolutions.
  The vote to recommend graduation of the Bigtop podling is in progress.

  The following proposal for a new incubating project was accepted:

  - Apache Drill

  A proposal for a new project called MetaModel was brought up for discussion.

  Only one of the podlings reporting in this month is having trouble with
  low levels of community activity; see the NPanday report for details.
  The interesting bit here is that just a bit over a quarter ago NPanday
  looked like it was just about ready to graduate.

o Releases

  The following incubating releases were made since our last report:

  - August 16th, 2012: Apache S4 0.5.0-incubating
  - August 20th, 2012: Apache Wink 1.2.1-incubating
  - August 22nd, 2012: Apache Bigtop 0.4.0-incubating
  - August 23rd, 2012: Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1-incubating
  - August 24th, 2012: Apache DeltaSpike 0.3-incubating
  - September 4th, 2012: Apache OpenMeetings Moodle Plugin 1.4-incubating
  - September 6th, 2012: Apache Syncope 1.0.1-incubating
  - September 14th, 2012: Apache Bloodhound 0.1-incubating

  All the four podlings categorized below as being blocked on graduation
  by the lack of an Apache release have been in that state for quite a while.
  Ambari and Cordova are just on the verge of their first release, and we've
  asked Kalumet and Wave to put more focus on getting a release out.

o Legal / Trademarks

  The question of whether Openmeetings can releasing modules for
  3rd party products with proprietary or copyleft licenses (LEGAL-147)
  is unresolved and currently blocks one of their releases. Clarification
  from the legal team on whether such cases can indeed be treated as
  platform dependencies would be welcome.

  It was noted that the podling status pages do not always have up to
  date information about IP clearance. We've tried to put some focus
  on this issue during podling reviews.

o Infrastructure

  The recent OpenOffice release caused some trouble by contacting
  svn.apache.org as a part of the build.

  Many of the recent new podlings have opted for Git as their version
  control system, which has caused some strain as the relevant infra
  processes are still being developed.

-------------------- Summary of podling reports --------------------

Still getting started at the Incubator (4 podlings)

  Allura, Blur, cTAKES, Drill

  These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
  towards graduation is yet expected.

Not yet ready to graduate (7 podlings)

  No release:    Ambari, Cordova, Kalumet, Wave
  Low activity:  NPanday
  Low diversity: Bloodhound, Flex

  We expect the next quarterly report of projects in this category to
  include a summary of their actions and progress in solving these issues.

Ready to graduate (7 podlings)

  Bigtop, Etch, HCatalog, Isis, OpenMeetings, OpenOffice, S4

  We expect these projects to graduate within the next quarter.

--------------------
Allura

Allura is forge software for the development of software projects, including
source control systems, issue tracking, discussion, wiki, and other software
project management tools.

Allura has been incubating since June 2012.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Move project development to ASF hardware
  2. Grow the community
  3. Verify distribution rights, esp. with regard to dependencies' licenses

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have had several introductions and discussions among developers and users
  on the allura mailing list.  We received and merged two patches from a
  contributor (who isn't a committer).  The Bloodhound podling is in a similar
  domain as Allura, so we have had some cross-list emails.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  All active committers have submitted CLAs and have accounts created. The
  software grant for Allura has been submitted.  On the mailing list, several
  licensing questions have been discussed and resolved how to handle: external
  contributions, handling of a non-essential GPL library, and handling of our
  ForgeHg tool which has a dependency on the GPL'd mercurial library.

Bigtop

Bigtop is a project for the development of native packaging and stack
tests of the Hadoop ecosystem.

Bigtop entered incubation on June 20, 2011.

Primary issues blocking graduation:

  None: the discussion thread on bigtop-dev and bigtop-user produced
  a unanimous +1 vote for starting the graduation process.

Issues which Incubator PMC and/or ASF Board might need/wish to be aware of:

  Bigtop is about to start the graduation vote

Community development since last report:

  Stephen Chu added as a Bigtop committer

  Bigtop has developed a very robust and high profile user community:
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/Powered+By+Bigtop

  Increased number of patches from our new community members

Project development since last report:

  - released Bigtop 0.4.0-incubating
  - Bigtop 0.3.0 branch is now in active maintenance mode courtesy
    of Cos and Bruno
  - Bigtop 0.3.1 expected shortly
  - Giraph is now supported in Bigtop 0.4.0/trunk branches
  - Hue is now supported in Bigtop 0.4.0/trunk branches
  - Hama is now supported in Bigtop 0.3.0 branch
  - used Bigtop to validate Hadoop 1.0.* RC and Hadoop 2.0.1-alpha RC releases
  - used Bigtop to validate HBase 0.92.1 RC
  - increased the # and scope of integration tests

--------------------
Bloodhound

Bloodhound is an issue tracker derivative of Trac, with the goal of making
deployment easy, and usage intuitive.

Bloodhound has been incubating since December 2011.

The top three issues that need to be addressed to move toward graduation are:

  1. Improve community diversity
  2. Lowering the barrier to entry and development
  3. Establish a frequent release cycle

Since our last report Bloodhound has had its first release, version 0.1.0-RC1.
This was promptly followed by one external website hosting resources required
during the installation to go offline. At the time of writing this is
unresolved, although a temporary fix has been identified and suggestions for a
more permanent fix have been made.

Our project issue tracking system has now also been upgraded to this first
release of Bloodhound. Predictably the number of issues raised since has risen
significantly since as it exposed many minor shortcomings not obvious
when not used daily.

Conversations have also started on how to highlight issues that potential new
contributors would find engaging and manageable in complexity. This is mainly
to address point 2 of the issues listed above.

cTAKES

cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) is a natural
language processing (NLP) tool for information extraction from electronic
medical record clinical free-text.

cTAKES was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on Monday, June 11, 2012.

Three most important steps moving towards graduation

  - Attract new contributors
  - Make at least one cTAKES release
  - Get everyone's ICLA on file and start developing code at Apache and using
    the infrastructure

Anything required IPMC attention?

  Developers are waiting on the SVN load to be completed by INFRA
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5079

Community:

  We have had additional committers and PPMC members join and are
  waiting for one corporate CLA before finalizing the addition
  of three more.

  We have open JIRA tickets to replace the Bugs tickets we still
  had had open on SF.net.

Development:

  - We plan to migrate the entire SVN repo from SourceForge to Apache SVN.
    (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5079)  Our goal is to create
    an initial 2.6-incubating release after this is done.

  - We have received ICLA's from  Sunghwan Sohn, Hongfang Liu, Stephen Wu,
    Troy Bleeker.

  - We began using Apache's Infrastructure (SVN, Apache CMS, Jira,
    Mailing Lists)

  - The ctakes-dev@ discussions have been active.

Drill

Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of large-scale datasets,
inspired by Google's Dremel.

We have just started and have mailing lists and svn up.  Git has been delayed
by issues in infra.

Community development is progressing well with several companies offering paid
developers and 90 subscribers to the dev list.

A hackathon in the SF bay area is scheduled.  A lunchtime meetup is
scheduled for Boston.  Additional meetups in New York and London are in
the planning stages.  All such physical meetups will have remote access if
possible (probably not for the lunch) and all will be reported back to the
mailing list to be sure to include those in different places and time zones
can participate.

Graduation is still a distant vision since we haven't got all the basic
mechanics in place yet.  The community side of things is going well and the
development of a realistic release looks like it will be moving shortly.

Etch

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety
of programming languages.

Status:

  The implementation of the binding-cpp was completed initially. After a
  short bug fixing phase we would like to create a new release that include it.

  We filed a proposal for the ApacheCon Europe 2012 to present the Apache Etch
  features to a wider audience.

  The Etch podling voted 6/0/0 to do the graduation to become an Apache TLP.
  Currently we prepare a resolution and work out a time chart. The graduation
  will start while the next days.

Future Tasks:

  - Bug fixing binding-cpp
  - General Bug fixing
  - Graduation
  - Community development

--------------------
Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A large community is waiting to see if committer activity will increase
and starting to think about graduating.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  - Get better at resolving issues the Apache Way
  - Get more initial committers to commit something
  - Make another release with more non-Adobe involvement

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  There was discussion about letting Flex graduate with the requirement that
  one or two mentors remain on the PMC.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  The issue regarding the import of attachments for existing
  JIRA bugs remains open (INFRA-4380).  It is not critical, but it would be
  nice to get this resolved soon.

  The PPMC has voted to move from SVN to Git.  Having Apache approve read/write
  Git repositories would be helpful.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - We released Apache Flex 4.8.0 (incubating).

  - OmPrakash Muppirala and Erik de Bruin were added as a committer and 
    PPMC member due to their work on the installer.  Peter Ent and 
    Gordon Smith from Adobe were also added as committers as they are 
    shepherding large donations from Adobe.

  - Adobe completed the trademark donation.

  - Adobe donated the Text Layout Framework, the rest of the Mustella
    test suite and signed off on the Falcon compiler donation.

  - OmPrakash Muppirala has been leading the development of a tool that
    allows IDEs like Adobe Flash Builder to work better with Apache Flex
    releases.  Justin McLean, Stephen Downs, Roland Zwaga, Tomasz Maciag,
    and Erik de Bruin have also contributed to the tool.

  - We have accepted several patches from the community to address issues
    with our test suite.

  - After much discussion, we voted to move from SVN to Git and employ
    something known as the Git Branching Model.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

  - We hope to finalize the release of the installer.

  - Adobe will submit the Falcon compiler source

  - We will get the test suite stable on Mac desktops and then on Windows
    and mobile configurations.  This should remove the last excuse for
    committers who are afraid to make changes without a validation suite

  - We hope to complete the transition from SVN to Git.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?

  Our mentors continue to be very helpful.

HCatalog

HCatalog is a table and storage management service for data created using
Apache Hadoop. HCatalog entered Apache incubator in March 2011.

What has the project accomplished since the last report?

  - Released version 0.4
  - Voted in one new committer
  - Received patches from 19 people

  In March 2012, HCatalog was identified as having low diversity. With the
  addition of the new committer there are now 9 committers from 3 organizations.
  Additionally, we have received patches from 19 unique people (including
  committers) some of which are outside the committer organizations. We believe
  the low diversity issue has either been addressed, or good progress has been
  made towards addressing the issue.

What are the top 2-3 things to resolve before graduation?

  - Grow the user community. There has been progress in this area with new
    users asking questions on the mailing list, receiving patches from an]
    increasing number of contributors, and work towards publishing pre-built
    artifacts in the Apache repository. We need to continue in this positive
    direction.

  - Resolve a review process issue that affects our ability to develop new
    features. Time between receiving patches and committing has increased to
    problematic levels, often causing code rot and contributors extra work to
    rebase patches against trunk.

  At this time we feel confident in our ability to make progress toward
  resolving these issues.

Isis is an ALv2 licensed implementation of the Naked Objects pattern. It is
based on contributions of the original Naked Objects Framework along with
a number of sister projects that were developed for the book "Domain Driven
Design using Naked Objects " (pragprog 2009).

Isis was accepted into the Incubator in 2010, September 7th.

Project Development

  - Work broadly completed on integrating with JDO/DataNucleus
    (in favour of OpenJPA)
  - Numerous Enhancements to Wicket viewer
  - Internal refactoring to simplify codebase

Community Development

  - Several further new correspondents on the mailing list

  - Have had four individuals that have contributed patches this quarter
    - this is a substantive increase from previous quarters
    - maintaining a clone of the SVN codebase on github seems to have helped

  - Project (which is part-funding JDO/Wicket development) continues
    - expected to run until Dec 2012, with possible extension

  - Publicising RestfulObjects spec (as implemented by Isis' RestfulObjects
    viewer)
    - talk given at 1-day conf (DDD10), in Aug
    - InfoQ article on Restful Objects published

  - Talks on Isis and Restful Objects to be presented at J-Fall conf, in Oct.

  - Talk on Isis to be presented at ApacheCon EU, in Nov.

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

  - None; per previous report we want one new committer voted on prior
    to graduating

  - We currently have three candidates for being new committers.  We just need 
    to do a successful vote for one of these (highly unlikely all three
    votes would fail).

  - We should then be in a position to vote to graduate

We don't believe that any of these issues requires Board attention.

New Releases

  - None in this period
  - intention is to release 0.3.1-incubating prior to next report

      Is there a reason for waiting?
    - The incubator status page needs to be completed. It appears that more
      has happened than the page reflects.

--------------------
Kalumet

Apache Kalumet is a complete platform to administrate data center. It covers
the operating system tasks, middleware provisioning, etc. Kalumet entered
incubation in September 2011.

Community Developement:

  Most of users are waiting for a first release to jump into Kalumet.

  A talk has been submitted to ApacheCon EU. This talk is an introduction to
  Kalumet, a presentation of the current features and present the roadmap.

Project Development:

  We fixed major bugs:
  - KALUMET-42
  - KALUMET-40
  - KALUMET-39
  - KALUMET-38
  - KALUMET-23

  The Kalumet activity is better now, we did 96 commits on Kalumet.

  The Kalumet community is focusing on the documentation, we made good progress
  around the documentation (screenshots, etc).

Before Graduation:

  - The documentation is the highest priority.

  - Once a first documentation is completed, we plan to cut off a couple
    of Kalumet releases.

Post Graduation:

  - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept globally
    to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
    deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

  - Refactoring of the UI. Currently Kalumet Console uses Echo2 framework.
    It's a category B license framework. We plan to refactore the console
    to use a new framework.

Web Site/Communication Development:

  The website will be updated with the documentation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of:

  None so far.

NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache Maven.
NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.

NPanday has had a lull of activity for several months as all the committers
have had other things occupying their time. 

There are still clear goals for what to do next, when someone has cycles to
pursue  them: produce a release of the most recent changes, and to better
promote the project among the .NET and Maven communities.

We continue to see occasional questions from users, and occasional patch
submissions, but haven't added a new committer since 20 April 2011. 

The last release was on 16 May 2011.

Since the last report, Matthias Wessendorf resigned as a mentor.
Nobody has stepped in to replace him.

The top priorities towards graduation are:

  - work out a concrete plan towards graduation in the next quarter
  - encourage newer contributors to do so on a continuing basis.

IPMC comments:
  Matt Franklin (mfranklin)
    I am concerned about the level of engagement of the community.  The vast
    majority of mail traffic has been from automated build failures and even
    a question from a potential user saw no response from the committers/PPMC.
    IMHO, there needs to be a significant increase in engagement over time
    before the project would be ready to graduate.

--------------------
OpenMeetings

OpenMeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white board,
collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using API functions
of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.

OpenMeetings entered the incubation on November 12, 2011.

Project status:

 - 3 New Committers entered the project:
   Stephen Cottham, Alvaro, Bustos Ruiz, George Kirkham

 - 2.0 Release was announced at 26.07.2012

 - Legal concerns regarding plugins have been raised and resolved,
   see [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-147]

 - Moodle Plugin was released at 04.09.2012 others are currently voting

 - GSoC students have successfully completed their projects:

   Student Dmitry Zamula: [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENMEETINGS/Posting+documents+on+the+whiteboard+with+POI]
   Student Ankur Ankan: [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENMEETINGS/Openmeetings+Plugin+for+Zimbra]
   Student German Grekov: [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENMEETINGS/Connection+testing+tool]

   There was one extra student that worked on this project even not accepted
   by Google/ASF or OCAD. He completed a plugin for ATutor LMS:
   [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OPENMEETINGS/ATutor+plug-in+installation+and+usage]

Community status:

  - new committers see above

  - several plugins are available and will follow up soon, some are listed
    here [https://builds.apache.org/view/M-R/view/OpenMeetings/]. Plugins
    should give also Non-Java guys a chance to contribute.

  - Currently discussing the RoadMap for version 2.x and 3.0. Preparing
    a DHTML prototype using Apache Wicket. A pure JavaScript interface might
    attract more potential contributors.

  - after a long period of refactoring having more releases in shorter cycles
    might attract more users and potential contributors

  - several developers will come to the ApacheCon in Europe to meet and discuss

Why not graduate:

  - Not all code released (some plugins missing)

OpenOffice (was OpenOffice.org)

OpenOffice entered incubation 2011-06-13
OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity suite providing
six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF).
OpenOffice is released on multiple platforms. Its localizations support
have supported 110 languages worldwide.

Most Important Items To Address Toward Graduation

  1. We are discussing the makeup of the future PMC. This will be a slow
     process as we digest input from our Mentors. We are separating our
     discussion about who should be a PMC member from what makes an ideal
     PMC member. The first will remain private for now and the second will
     be renewed on ooo-dev.

  2. We have begun discussing the Chair.

  3. Continue our review of distributed articles to ensure compliance
     with ASF policy.

  We are working to fulfill graduation requirements in the next quarter.

Issues for IPMC or ASF Board Awareness

  No new issues at this time.

  In regards to the ooo-private leak reported on our last report. The PPMC
  is satisfied with the result. The Board is aware of the result as well.
  If this issue needs further discussion please ask on ooo-private.

Community Development/Outreach Progress

  There are now 110 committers with 72 of those on the PPMC. Relative to the
  last report, that is an increase of 15 committers and a decrease of
  3 committers on the PPMC (following an audit to reconcile subscribers to
  the ooo-private mailing list).

  We have improved to act more as a self organized project to address and
  solve project related topics (e.g. forum moderation)

  We are putting more effort into addressing trademark and third-party
  distribution requests. Ongoing emphasis as to how to accommodate and
  track these requests is becoming an important concern.

  We are increasing our global reach by recruiting volunteers to help
  update and maintain the large set of native language home pages

  Because our product is client-centric, we have put additional focus on our
  social networking accounts - Google +, Facebook - in collecting feedback
  and ideas from our user base.

Project Development Progress

  We released Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 on August 23, 2012. This was primarily
  a maintenance release and included:

  - Official Source tarballs in English
  - Six different client platform convenience install versions in 19 languages
  - Software development kit packaging for 5 platforms
  - Language packs for 19 languages
  - Fixes for 69 bugs and an important security fix
  - Over 1.4M downloads the first week.

  A summary of downloads for the installs can be found at:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/stats/timeline

  The build artifacts in this last source release do not strictly follow
  guidelines as some fallback downloads of dependencies do access svn.a.o.
  This has been fixed in trunk by eliminating the use of svn in all cases.

  Testing and implementation of old update service for OpenOffice has been
  accomplished. This service is for older OpenOffice clients to identify
  updates and, optionally, install an update if available. Older versions
  of OpenOffice (3.1 and less) are problematic when we turned these on it
  created a DDOS attack on www.apache.org which we regret.

  The IBM Symphony code (mentioned in the June report) was brought into svn
  in mid-May. There was discussion on the ooo-dev list about how best to
  use/integrate this contribution. After some discussion, the community was
  most in favor of integrating Symphony aspects into the current AOO base
  over a period of time, rather than the reverse.

  Community support forums remain popular with users but registration seems
  to have stabilized. The ooo-users list also is quite active. As Apache
  OpenOffice is a client product, we continue to investigate ways to direct
  users to appropriate support venues.

  The developer list, ooo-dev, now has more than 440 subscribers and remains
  very active.

S4

S4 (Simple Scalable Streaming System) is a general-purpose, distributed,
scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows
programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous,
unbounded streams of data.

S4 entered incubation on September 26th 2011.

Primary issues blocking graduation:

  - growing the community
  - verifying the name of the project. See PODLINGNAMESEARCH-10

Community development since last report:

  We received contributions from new contributors, including core,
  communication layer, deployment framework and command set.

Project development since last report:

  We had our first release as part of the incubator, on August 16th 2012:
  S4 0.5.0-incubating

  Apart from being a major refactoring, this release aims at lowering the
  adoption bar by clarifying the API and providing a set of commands for the
  development and deployment lifecycle.

  We also believe this recent release should encourage adoption and
  contributions.

Wave

Incubating since: Dec-2010

Description: Wave is a real-time communication and collaboration tool.
Wave in a Box (WIAB) is a server that hosts and federates waves, supports
extensive APIs, and provides a rich web client. This project also includes
an implementation of the Wave Federation protocol, to enable federated
collaboration systems (such as multiple interoperable Wave In a Box instances).

Most important issues are:

  - Building up community.
  - Extending the features set to match the features of Google Wave.

Community:

  One new committer added. Discussions (somewhat stalled) on additional
  committers. The next major milestone regarding graduation is to make a
  release. The current codebase is not considered mature enough for a
  useful release, however, the community is discussing what is required to
  make one, both to better understand the licensing status of our
  codebase, and as a means to draw in additional developers and thus speed
  up development.

Signed-off-by: upayavira, mfranklin
IPMC comments:
  Matt Franklin (mfranklin):
    Is there anything that could be released, even in alpha/beta form? Code
    completeness or maturity is not a barrier to graduation so long as the
    community can demonstrate an understanding of the Apache release process.
    IMO, it is best to get early, alpha releases out on a regular basis.
    You don't have to advertise them as completely ready for prime time.

Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

The Apache Jackrabbitâ¢ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Javaâ¢ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  We made the following unstable 2.5.x releases from Jackrabbit trunk:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.5.1 on August 6th
  
  The following patch releases were made from earlier maintenance 
  branches:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.4.3 on September 3rd
  
  This quarter also saw the first releases of the OCM code base in a 
  while:

  * Apache Jackrabbit OCM 2.0 on July 10th

  Finally we made two releases from the Jackrabbit Oak sub project:
  
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 0.4 on August 13th
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 0.3 on July 5th
    
o Community / Development

  * Randall Hauch joined the Jackrabbit team as committer and PMC member.

  * Work on Jackrabbit Oak is still going strong: there where again two 
  Hackathons in the last quarter during which great progress was made and
  which lead to the release of Oak 0.3. and 0.4. Another Hackathon will 
  take place in September co-located with the .adaptTo(Berlin) 2012 
  conference (http://adaptto.mixxt.de/networks/events/show_event.65841). 
  Being part of .adaptTo() allows us to further broaden the community and 
  spark more interest in Apache Jackrabbit Oak.

  * Jukka Zitting and Michael DÃ¼rig submitted a talk about Oak for 
  .adaptTo(Berlin) 2012 (http://adaptto.mixxt.de/).

  * Jukka Zitting and Michael DÃ¼rig submitted a talk about Oak for ApacheCon
  Europe 2012.
    
o Infrastructure

  We are still in progress of migrating from Confluence to the new CMS.

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

TLP
---

Trademarks:
We have not made progress on trademarks since the last board report, but
do intend to finish the necessary pieces.

    * Project Naming And Descriptions : 
      We believe this is complete, but are still reviewing.
    * Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
      www.apache.org included.
      Likely complete, but under review.
    * Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in 
      footers, etc.
      The main TLP site is converted, subproject sites have not.  
    * Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your
      site In progress.  Some have been converted to have TM, some not.
      We don't seem to have ready volunteers on the graphical front,
      so it is slower than we'd like
    * Project Metadata : DOAP file checked in and up to date
      Done


LUCENE JAVA/Solr
----------------

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community is very active.

In the last quarter, we have released Lucene and Solr 3.6.1, as well
as two preview releases for 4.0: 4.0-ALPHA and 4.0-BETA.  We hope
to release 4.0-final soon.

We have added one new committer: Greg Bowyer.


Open Relevance Project
----------------------

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either as it is a niche
area.


PyLucene
--------

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
almost entirely an automated port, so this project will never
require a lot of developers.  The user community is active.

PyLucene 3.6.1 was released on August 24th.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache MRUnit Project

DESCRIPTION

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 0.9.0-incubating, released on
  May 12, 2012 while in Incubation.
* No new releases are planned currently for the project.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Board report is due because I missed last month
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report:
  http://s.apache.org/lv
* Development has slowed down due to a pending change from SVN to Git
* 1 JIRAs were resolved in the last month, 13 JIRAs the prior month

COMMUNITY

* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
  the last report.
* Currently there are:
  - Total of 26 subscribers to the developer list.
  - Total of 36 subscribers to the user list.
  - Total of 12 committers/PMC members (+1 voted in but pending an ICLA)

ISSUES

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

will be released as soon as possible as 10.04.03
- next step is to release the first release of the 11.04 series with
name 11.04.01

*Community and Project*

Community interaction remains strong, user and dev mailing lists traffic
is high.
Significant new development continues, mostly focused on bug fixes, code
cleanup, stabilization, improving localizations, performance and
scalability.

*Infra/Legal*

We are working with infra to resolve some minor issues with buildbot
(INFRA-4785).

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache OODT Project

Apache OODT is a software framework, and an architectural style for
the rapid construction of scientific data systems. It provides
components for data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow
management, resource management and data processing.

Releases/Development:

We released Apache OODT 0.4 on June 20, 2012 [1].

We're currently working towards 0.5 with 31 issues currently resolved, and
we'll likely pull together an RC in the next month or so.

We worked with Gavin and infra@ to get an OODT PEAR channel [2] 
up and running at [3]. Thanks Gav!

Community:

The Apache OODT PMC didn't add any new members to its ranks
over the last quarter. 

Chris Mattmann and Paul Ramirez mentored a student jointly between the Apache
OODT PMC and the Apache SIS PPMC in Google Summer of 
Code. The student, Ross Laidlaw, successfully completed his
project, and passed his GSoC final evals. Great job, Ross! [4] Ross
is now an Apache OODT PMC member and a member of the Apache
SIS PPMC.

Chris Mattmann was asked by Ross Gardler to participate in an 
Apache Case Study being conducted by Indiana University as
part of an NSF EAGER grant.

Branding:

No updates beyond last report. Looks good.

Press:

Chris Mattmann has given a few talks on Apache OODT, including
discussing the ASF and OODT at the NASA Open Source "Mini Summit"
at the Summer Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) meeting in 
Madison, WI [5], and recently at the ESIP Information Technology
and Interoperability "Rant and Rave" on Open Source [6] to promote the
new ESIP Open Source Cluster [7] that Mattmann will chair.

Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.


Status

As usual we had a low levels of traffic in our users mailing lists,
but usually we are able to give an answer on fast time.
Little activity on dev mail list and issue tracker.

Our Mailing lists have these numbers:
   commits -   22 subscribers
   dev     -   71 subscribers
   users   -  188 subscribers
   
Commits since last report (approx): 90 , from only 2 PMC members.

On the progress of the project, we are still working on important fixes
for the 2.0.x maintenance branch (some of them already committed), 
and we have started some developments on 2.1 (now on trunk).
Some work has been done even in the Web Site, mainly to update/clarifying 
info and some technical details in tutorials, as requested by users.


Issues
During last months I have seen a little slowdown both in posts on our
mailing lists and worst a slowdown from all developers in development
activity (both as commits and as discussions between us). All my
tentatives (since last report) to expand the community up to now gave no
real effect.

Some time ago I started to integrate our trunk with GIT (but staying on
subversion of course), to see if a better integration with git could help
us to get some interest from developers using it, even for patches.

As written in August to board, the 3 September I sent an email to our
users and dev mailing lists to propose an evolution project for
mid/long-term just created by me on GitHub (and return to Apache when we
reach a minimal community), but without any comment from anyone. Of course
this is not as a replacement for Pivot, but as an evolution (fully
incompatible) of it, targeting only HTML 5 UI. So even this tentative to
expand the community up to now had no effect.


Releases
no new releases.


Branding/naming issues:
Remaining issues are (with tracking on JIRA:  
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIVOT-750 ):
* main site navigation needs some additional links - DONE
  Note that to have the ASF logo looks good with our graphic style I had
  to put online a version of it with a transparent background. If it's not
  so good tell me.


Legal issues:
None.


Infrastructure issues/needs:
I have started to look at the Apache CMS for future evolutions of the
site, but I have to ask to infra some info before enabling CMS for us, and
then start the transition to it.


Community changes

Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Portals Project

Apache Portals is a project for building freely available and
interoperable portal software. With the Pluto project, we provide a
reference implementation for the Java portlet standard. The Jetspeed
project is a full feature enterprise open source portal. The Portals
Applications project is dedicated to providing robust, full-featured,
commercial-quality, and freely available portlet applications.

ISSUES
The board has required an additional report in August 2012. No
additional issues since August.

RELEASES

We have released another 2.1 milestone to address a few bugs with
handling of the container xml escape flag.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache ServiceMix Project

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status:
While we continue to have an active community with good participation from
users on mailing lists, IRC, and issue reporting in JIRA, we also have lost
some of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

Community:
No changes since last report.

Community Objectives:
Our current objective is to work on a ServiceMix 4.5.0 release - with all
dependency project releases done, we can start working on getting this out.

Documentation and website remain important working topics - we are looking
into the mandatory migration to svnpubsub at the moment.

When releasing OSGi bundles, we are repackaging and wrapping existing
artifacts from other projects.  To ensure these changes get donated/
communicated back to the original community, we now require backlinks
to the corresponding issue in the other project.

Branding Status:
- Project Naming And Descriptions : Compliant
- Website Navigation Links : Compliant
- Trademark Attributions : Compliant
- Logos and Graphics : Current logo is not compliant
- Project Metadata : Compliant

Releases:
- ServiceMix Specs 2.0.0 in June
- Apache ServiceMix 3.4.1 release in July
- A set of 31 OSGi bundles in September

Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Shiro Project

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application
security framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization,
enterprise session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- We released a 1.2.1 bugfix release on 28 July 2012.  Current trunk
development is targeted at a 1.3.0 release (time frame not yet
determined).

Community & Project:

- The Shiro community remains helpful, with steady month-after-month
mailing list traffic.  No noticeable changes here.

- The Shiro site and distribution continues to experience good growth,
with the site averaging around 10,000 visitors per month and 7,000
downloads a month from Maven Central, and that number is steadily
increasing each month.

Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent email
filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited bulk email,
more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to email headers and
content to classify email using advanced statistical methods. In addition,
SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows other technologies to be
quickly wielded against spam and is designed for easy integration into
virtually any email system. 

Releases
--------
No releases for this quarter.  We recently revised our ReleaseGoals
(http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/ReleaseGoals) and chair will be doing
best to spearhead the 9/30 release.  In other words, the release of version
3.4.0 is still imminent.  This release will improve IPv6 support greatly.
Many people are running using trunk, however, which has great bugfixes and is
quite stable.

Community & Development
-----------------------
Chair attended F2F as guest.  Was attacked by ninja trashcan but otherwise was
impressed by the runnings of the board meetings.

Need to migrate our zones and zones2 server off of Solaris to yet to be
determined resource.

Need to migrate our website to svnpubsub.

Need to get our jenkins build slave working under FreeBSD instead of Solaris1.
Might need access to the box to figure out what is killing it on the build
slave though.

We are in the process of voting Adam Katz and John Hardin to the PMC.

The project users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

The project dev list has been active with both committers and community
members contributing.

Our RuleQA project is off the ground and we added 14 masscheck accounts in
August:
  bpedersen
  odiserens
  mmiroslaw
  dlemke
  bpoliakoff
  jwallin
  hmundaca
  ewollesen
  bbailey
  vk5ztv
  talbers
  manderson
  acecchi
  maselig

The increased masscheck accounts is greatly helping our automated masscheck
process to publish rules more consistently.

Project Branding Requirements
-----------------------------

As a new chair who took over from a chair who left unexpectedly, I am not
aware of any branding issues but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.  I have the
original PMC project brand email from 5/31/2011 pulled out to review.

Issues
------

UPDATED: 9/15: Received response from Nick Bebout and confirmed he has a CLA.
https://issues.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=6822

The issue below is likely to resolve without board input but it would be nice 
to know if code that is licensed to ASF:

http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/auto-mass-check.git/tree/LICENSE

and written by people with CLAs:

Darxus, Warren Togami and Nick Bebout all listed at
http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html

but hosted externally can simply be brought in without explicit requests.
I chose the explicit request path to keep things more cordial but I don't like
ASF code hosted outside.


Is there a concern with pulling in code stored outside of ASF but licensed to
ASF?  Specifically http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/auto-mass-check.git/tree/

Chair sent the following email on 8/10 with no response to date:

To: nb@fedoraproject.org, wtogami@gmail.com &  Darxus@chaosreigns.com & SA PMC

Good Morning Gentleman,

I wanted to let you know that I've got a fire under masscheck right now and
one of the tasks we are working to solve is the SVN Revision: differences on
the uploaded logs.  This has led to a need to unify and standardize the
masscheck script because we'll be telling all masscheckers to use the same
script.  The new script will need to use a newer rsync channel that is more
secure which will solve Warren's concerns and we'll hopefully have some more
bells and whistles.

I'd like to invite you guys in on this because of your great work at
http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/auto-mass-check.git/log/.  But I also
understand if time doesn't allow so I want to ask explicitly for permission to
pull the code into the project.  I know it's noted at the top of the file that
it's but I wanted to ask anyway.  Plus, I also wanted to make sure I got the
info in CREDITS correct so my understanding is that the upgrades to the script
were by Nick Bebout, Warren Togami and Darxus.

Barring your objections, I'd like to get start on this ASAP but likely Monday
at the latest so if you could respond sooner than later, it would be greatly
appreciated.  I know the masschecks have stood idle too long but I also don't
want to lose the current momentum.

Regards,
KAM

Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the development
of web application user interfaces.

Releases:
This quarter has marked at least one release of all of the Tiles 3
components. The following versions have been released and voted as Beta
quality by the PMC:

 * Apache Tiles 3.0.1
 * Apache Tiles Autotag 1.1.0
 * Apache Tiles Request 1.0.1 and 1.0.2

Community:
The project has not added any new committers or PMC members during this
reporting cycle. However, I am pleased with the level of discussion that
has taken place on the mailing list. The Tiles community has always been a
"niche" community and a slow-moving project. I see that trend continuing.
But, as with past reporting periods, I see movement continuing at a steady
pace and starting to involve more people. Overall I am happy with the
direction of the project.

Attachment AN: Status report for the Apache VCL Project

DESCRIPTION

VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* The community has completed the post-graduation tasks.
* Work continues to migrate content from Confluence to the new CMS website
  and to improve the design.
* Several commits have been made to the VCL 2.3.1 bugfix branch to address
  minor problems with VCL 2.3, which was released in July. VCL 2.3.1 will be
  released this fall.
* Traffic on the lists has been fairly high, mostly due to questions related
  to recently released VCL 2.3.
* Development is still in the beginning stage for the VCL 2.4 features. Most
  development has been devoted to bug fixes.
* One of the committers is working to develop code to provide a VCL block in
  Moodle. Some licensing concerns arose from this due to Moodle's GPL
  license. [1] Guidance was provided by legal-discuss. It was decided for
  this to be a separate non-ASF project independent of the Apache VCL.

Attachment AQ: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Released Wicket 6.0.0
- Experimental development model seems successful
- Kerfuffle about source releases
- No new committers were added

Released Wicket 6.0.0

Being in the works for a while now, we finally released Wicket 6.0.0. It
contains a complete rewrite of our client side API, bolsters default
integration of JQuery and lots of other exciting stuff.

We worked with press@ to craft a press release, and due to Sally's excellent
training we didn't need too much time and drafts to have a press release
ready. The biggest hurdle was for us to agree to delay announcing the
release until the PR could be sent across the wire, adding ~6 days to the
schedule.

A big thanks goes to Sally, for helping us, and staying with us while we
were discussing the merits of a press release.

We were covered a bit in the press, though not as massive as a HTTPD
release, or a single patch in HTTPD. Probably the best coverage was done by
h-online (http://s.apache.org/apachewicketbouncestoa6).

Semantic Versioning in effect

Starting with 6.0.0 we use semantic versioning for our releases. A
discussion was started on how to proceed with future releases where two
models were proposed. One was how we developed previously, and a new one
where we release 6.y releases more often, and only 6.y.z releases for
(critical) bug fixes. It seems that the community favors the latter.

Experimental development model seems successful

In order to have more development happening at Apache we created an
experimental submodule for our project where new functionality is developed.
These modules are released together with our main product releases, but are
numbered separately.

We started with adding websocket/push/atmosphere as an experimental module
and we have added Twitter bootstrap and a new examples project.

Our goal of having more development happening at Apache seems to work: some
modules have been released several times with our betas and most recently
with 6.0 final, and they are gaining some interested users.

Kerfuffle about source releases

At our private list a somewhat heated discussion was started when it was
pointed out that our releases are non-compliant with Apache policy, as
discussed at several threads in the incubator by Roy.

The main point I have heard being made (on-list and off-list) is that
providing a plain source release is seen as bureaucratic, not helped by the
rather scathing tone of Roy's messages and threats delivered on general@
(warranted or not).

It probably would help if the release policy (found at
www.a.o/dev/release.html) would provide a rationale for the requirement of a
plain source distribution, as Roy stated in his provocative teachings. For
future discussions it would be better to have a document that to separates
the form from the content, as the blunt text provokes more discussion than
necessary.

Another item of discussion was whether it is sufficient to vote on a
(signed) tag in our git repository. The reasoning is that with a (signed)
tag, our repository can provide automatically generated tarballs, similarly
to those provided by github.com.

I have stated that this is not so, and that we must vote on the actual
crafted and signed source distribution.

The non-compliant distributions we previously made contain both source and
the compiled artifacts (in a lib/ folder in the archive) as a convenience to
our users. As most folks download Wicket through Maven Central, the only
folks downloading our distributions are the ones not using Maven and that
number is rather low, and they actually want the binaries.

It will be interesting to get some insight into the difference between
convenience binary downloads and the pure source downloads.

We will be providing plain source releases for the most recent releases in
our actively maintained branches. The older versions of those distributions
have been archived, and should not be used in any case due to security
issues in those releases.

Attachment AS: Status report for the Apache ZooKeeper Project

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed
applications.

There was one new release in the last quarter: 3.3.6 which was a bug
fix release and is marked as stable. 3.4.4 release (bugfix release) is
expected to happen within the next week.

Trunk is also under development for an eventual 3.5.0 release. So far
primarily code cleanup and refactoring has been applied to trunk.  3.5.0
release date is a TBD.  Our focus is on scalability, jdk7 and openjdk
support, maven build/rel, testing and audit logging.


Community:

Apache ZooKeeper had its second official meetup:
http://www.meetup.com/zookeeperusergroup/events/67732652/

 Around 40 people attended  and  there was excitement on upcoming
  features/improvements in ZooKeeper.

  Ivan Kelly was added as a PMC member for ZooKeeper.

  Mailing list activity continues to be high.

  * 8 active committers representing 5 unique organizations
  * 8 active PMC members representing 4 unique organizations
  * 342 subscribers on dev (up from 323 last quarter)
  * 692 subscribers on user (up from 653 last quarter)

  BOOKKEEPER

  Bookkeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance logging
  service. The project also includes Hedwig which is a highly scalable
  Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper and Bookkeeper with strong
  durability guarantees.

  Our second release as a sub-project of ZooKeeper, 4.1.0, was released
  on June 13th. It fixes 102 issues of both BookKeeper and Hedwig. New
  features include JMX instrumentation and a CLI interface to Hedwig. We
  are aiming for a new release within a month, and this release will include
  an important new feature: auto-replication.

  Infrastructure issues:
  No issues.

  Community building:
  We have been consistently receiving more contributions from developers
  across different companies, in particular Huawei. They have expressed
  strong interest in the project due to its coupling with HDFS. There has
  been smaller contributions and bug reports from Twitter and Hubspot,
  and contributions from Twitter folks have been increasing lately. In
  general, we have been able to grow the community and increase diversity.

  Community:
  * 47 subscribers to bookkeeper-dev
  * 52 subscribers to bookkeeper-user
  * 389 issues opened to date, 108 opened since Jun 1, 2012
  * 31 reporters of Jira issues, 15 since Jun 1, 2012
