 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

    The annual members meeting will be held next week.  Nominations
    are complete for both new members and for the new board.  This is
    the last meeting of the current board.  Thanks to all of you for
    your service!

    B. President [Jim]

    Happy to report that the budget is ready for approval; all issues and
    questions have been addressed in this latest revision.

    I have been asked to attend a full-day meeting in Rockville, MD at the
    National Cancer Institute (NCI) regarding their Cancer Biomedical
    Informatics GridR (caBIGR) Open Development Initiative (ODI). This
    opportunity was the result of my talks at POSSCON. I've also accepted
    a request to speak at the NASA Open Source Summit.

    I have been re-appointed to a 2year term as director of OuterCurve.
    This coincides with my re-appointment at OSI. I anticipate, as before,
    no conflicts.

    I have provided a number of quotes for ASF PRs, most regarding Apache
    OpenOffice. I've also been in contact with SourceForge, thanking them
    for their help with the AOOo distribution as well as other potential
    areas of cooperation.

    My thanks go to this current board. The foundation is running well.

    C. Treasurer [Sam]

       No report was received. Sam made a verbal report: Last month,
       contractors all were paid, and two bills were paid. Would like
       to make Noirin assistant treasurer with the idea to become
       treasurer. Details to follow.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

    April was a normal month for secretary, with 58 ICLAs, one NDA, four CCLAS,
    and one grant filed. Eight account requests were made during the processing
    of incoming ICLAs.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

       No report was submitted.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       There is nothing particular to report/advise at the moment.
       Over the past month, my Vice Chairman hat has been observed
       with a bit of Fundraising and a bit of conference support for
       Apache BarCamp DC.

        See Attachment AT.

       Special Order 7J, Approve the 2012-2013FY Budget, There is
       nothing in the budget for an audit, but this can be added
       later once the cost is known. The budget was approved
       unanimously.


 8. Discussion Items
    8a. The DC BarCamp has raised some questions around how sponsorship
    for small events is collected and bills paid.   
    
    Discussion: Rather than having sponsors contribute to conferences, some 
    sponsors were asked to contribute to ASF directly and then ASF covered 
    some conference event costs. This appears to be a directed donation 
    that in the past, was disallowed. Is this a valid approach for conferences?
    
    Roy: as long as it's an Apache event, this is appropriate. Prefer to have an 
    "Apache person" specifically tasked with running the event. 
    
    Greg: Tim Williams is running the event. He is an ASF Member. In future, 
    makes sense to have an Apache person in charge.
    
    Roy: The Apache responsible person must be an officer or employee of 
    the Foundation. 
    
    Greg: Nick Burch as VP Concom should be responsible for handling this 
    for future events.
    
    Provisional approval for accepting targeted donations for Concom for 
    small Apache-sponsored events.
    
    Concom to propose a policy for approval by the board.
    
    Jim: will take responsibility to communicate with VP Concom.


 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Daniel: draft an ASF policy for projects which need to re-bundle
      other Apache projects.
            Status: Started discussion on SMX list about it, very little 
            feedback.  Noticed this week that Geronimo was doing the 
            same thing with bval so will also post there for feedback.

    * Doug: follow up with MyFaces PMC to remove inactive folks from PMC.
            Status:

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================

Requests for assistance to review foundation/Brand/foundation-marks-list.csv
have not met much success within the membership, so reviewing projects' 
compliance with branding requirements is taking longer than expected.

Worked with Apache Archiva PMC to respond to a third party's apparent
plans to rebrand from MailArchiva to Archiva.

External Requests
=================

Several requests have come in from OOo/AOO land about permissions to 
use AOO branding on various third party software download or CD-ROM sites.
Working with AOO PMC to set requirements and guidelines to ensure such 
sites distribute proper AOO releases, without improper changes or additions.

Approved branding aspects of Zeta Components podling community's desire to 
continue to use the Zeta name after they are retired from incubation, i.e. 
after IPMC explicitly confirms their podling retirement.

Trademark Registrations
=======================
"Hadoop" is now US registration # 4131061 - yay!
http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=85377777

Have requested DLAPiper register "Lucene", and confirmed description 
with Lucene PMC.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising

This is my first report as VP Fundraising. Since the last board meeting,
I have been familiarising myself with the data that we hold about our
sponsorship programme, and creating records for each of our sponsors
that should allow us to easily track relevant events during the
sponsorship lifecycle (invoice due, payment due, payment received,
logo removal). With all this data in place, we should be able to
establish definitive Sponsorship Renewal dates for all of our
sponsors, and use those as the basis for alerts.

This month I believe we received a payment from Go Daddy (silver). This
is not confirmed, as we have a payment to the lockbox, that matches an
expected payment, but do not have records to confirm its source.

SPI have some money that was collected on behalf of the OpenOffice 
project pre-incubation. As I understand it, the OpenOffice PPMC is
asking that this be donated to the ASF, and that some way be found
that it can be used to benefit the OpenOffice project, in line with
the purpose of the original donations.

Daniel has helped with tracking potential sponsorship renewals in lieu
of the above information. Greg is going to chase those three sponsors.

Google is asking for a year-in-review, and a brief "what you are funding"
executive summary. This is a resource we should have available for
all of our sponsors, and will take some effort over the coming month.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Small Events
------------
The DC BarCamp is this coming weekend, and everything looks on track for
this. We'll be able to give a report next month, along with hopefully some
idea of how (if at all) it could help grow more east coast events.

The DC BarCamp has raised some questions around how sponsorship for small
events is collected and bills paid. Specifically, for an event that have
money contributed rather than having sponsors pay for specific line items
directly, and for when there is either no local company available to take in
sponsorship money or where the sponsors would rather not send it to a very
small company. I believe Greg will be raising this for discussion. In case
it helps, general thoughts on small event sponsorship styles are at:
<http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-small-events-discuss/201202.mb
ox/%3C4F3A3CAB.9050100@apache.org%3E>

There was a local meetup (cross project) in the Netherlands, which seemed to
go well. Hopefully there will be more of these. We wish them luck, and
encourage other areas with a high density of committers to think about it
too.

An announcement to PMCs about getting involved in OSCON has been sent out.
We'll reach out to committers in a little bit (pitching the same thing, but
in a slightly different way). We aim to get projects signed up to use the
space on the Monday and Tuesday, for things like introductory hackathons and
talks, along with perhaps some detailed hackathons before/after. Projects
and Committers intersted should fill out the survey at
<http://s.apache.org/OSCON12> to let us know.

ApacheCon
---------
The vote on the ApacheCon NA 2013 RFP concluded, and the OpenBastion
proposal was accepted. OpenBastion have circulated a list of possible dates
to the apachecon-discuss list for review, and we expect that they'll confirm
the dates (roughly Feb 2013, perhaps give or take a week) soon. They're
currently drawing up a contract, which we'll review (with help from legal)
later this month.

In addition to ApacheCon NA 2013, we'll also be having an ApacheCon Europe
in late 2012. We now have a confirmed venue booking at the SAP supported
venue, the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim. SAP have kindly agreed to sponsor
us for the venue hire (including tech and staff), as well as some money
towards catering. (We'll be looking to other sponsors too though, it's not
an exclusive sponsorship deal). Discussions on the format of the event (how
many one day vs multiday tracks, small vs big tracks etc) are underway on
the apachecon-discuss list. We encourage anyone interested in either event
to join the list and get involved!

We expect to have more details on both events sorted in the coming month,
and possibly also some basic website details. For now, the apachecon
homepage has been updated to offer some simple information, thanks to infra
for making the vhost and dns tweaks for this.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Added Mohammad Nour El-Din to the Infrastructure Team.

Upgraded Jira to version 5- kinks still being ironed out.

Had OSUOSL install our recent purchases from Silicon Mechanics

stats will be published by the AOO PPMC in the near future.

Replaced isis's bad disks and brought up 2 additional build
hosts at our Y! datacenter.

Discussed another F2F meeting during the Surge 2012 conference.
Not a lot of expressed interest so far.

Experiencing uptime issues with our monitoring.apache.org Bytemark
VM ever since they migrated the VM to different hardware.

An Apache Ivy release candidate (2.3.0-RC1) was made available on April 24th, 2012 and a 
beta of IvyDE (2.2.0-beta1) was made available on April 6th. While the current releases 
of both date from late 2010, I expect that we will have new releases in the next 
reporting period.

Apache Compress Antlib 1.2 was released on April 21st. This ant lib provides Ant tasks
which manage a number of archive formats. It uses Apache Commons Compress 1.4 under
the hood.

Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Buildr Project

Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools.

Our latest release happened in June -- we were hoping for a release in November
but follow-up efforts stalled due to time constraints and difficulty in getting
tests working on all supported platforms. Our changelog currently shows about
70+ fixes/changes/enhancements since our last release. Subversion log show about
120 commits since June with commits from 4 different committers and patches
accepted from 5 external contributors.

Mailing lists activity has been relatively low in past 3 months, with a small
surge in past few weeks.

We have no issues that require board attention.

Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it
is based around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is
very similar to Cocoon 2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and
designed to be easily used with Java code (= no frameworks required!).
On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal of becoming the best available
platform for RESTful webservices and web applications.

Community

Traffic on users lists continues be light, people continue
be interested on both C2 and newer C3.

A Cocoon3 article is going to be published in the German magazine 'JavaMagazin'
redacted by the ASF Member Christian Grobmeier (grobmeier), which
contains an interview to the Cocoon chair.

Releases/Development

Registered regular traffic on commits list, most of the effort has been moved
on housekeeping:

 * Cocoon sites are now managed via SvnPubSub;
 * old Cocoon Documentation has been imported from old Daisy to
   sources managed via SvnPubSub;
 * Jail has been restored with demo for Cocoon2.X and Cocoon3,
   available on http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/

Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Community Development Project

The Commmunity Development PMC is responsible for helping people become 
involved with Apache projects

Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

GSoC
----

GSoC is underway with two experienced admins and a newcomer learning the ropes.

Google's insistence on changing the process on the fly without consulting orgs
continues to frustrate admins who have to adapt quickly and communicate this to
our 150+ projects. Our thanks go to this years Admins. 

We have 41 GSoC projects spread across 26 Apache projects (17 TLPs and 9
Podlings).

Participating TLPS are:

Xerces, Pig, OODT, Hive, James, Tapestry, Ofbiz, Gora, Synapse, Derby, Axis,
POI, Whirr, Lucene, Velocity, Libcloud, Xalan

Participating Podlings are:

ODF Toolkit, Airavata, Stanbol, Photark, Wookie, OpenMeetings, Nuvem, Hama,
VXQuery

Completed: 
  * Publish updates to the GSoC Admin guidelines
  * Verify that new mentor selection process is documented for GSoC
  * Verify infra is OK with temporary accounts for GSoC
  * Submit ASF to GSoC
  * Work with projects to identify suitable GSoC tasks

Events and Speakers
-------------------

Very little progress here as ConCom has been busy dealing with the RFP for US
and the proposal for EU. 
A number of ComDev members are helping out in ConCom activities.

Outstanding:
  * Agree scope of ConCom and ComDev collaboration on event support
  * Raise awareness of Speaker and Event support materials
  * Integrate speaker app with Lanyrd (hosts all ApacheCon NA12 slidedecks)

Website
-------

During the IPMC reboot discussions it was suggested that ComDev should take
ownership of some aspects of Incubation. This was rejected as ComDev felt that
moving the problem was not solve it, however, it was agreed in principle that
overlaps existed. Now that Jukka seems to be be settling in nicely at the IPMC
it is time to restart these discussions.

Outstanding:
  * Work with the IPMC to clarify any future role for ComDev in the incubation 
    process


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security,
and integration with popular build tools and source control management 
systems.

Continuum has been suffering from low development activity, with just a handful
of commits each quarter. A discussion was started to move the project to the
Attic, however this encouraged at least one committer and a user to volunteer to
help produce another release. Others have since stepped forward.

There are a large number of fixes that reside on trunk that are worth releasing,
and it has been reported to be very stable. Only one blocker needs to be worked
through before the release.

Though available time is infrequent, there appears to be enough PMC oversight 
still present to do a release, and through that we can assess who is likely to 
remain active, and if the others should be brought into the PMC to continue the 
project.

The current chair has stated that he is not available for the position any
longer and will be standing down. A resolution to appoint a new chair has been
proposed for the meeting.

In other matters, the project branding requirements have not yet been completed.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache CouchDB Project

Apache CouchDB is a database that uses JSON for documents, JavaScript for

Cordova team: http://couchdb.apache.org/

A subset of the developer community met in Boston and Dublin in April. The
results from various discussions are currently being prepared to be put up for
online discussion on dev@.

Successfully started to integrate source contributions via GitHub Pull
Requests.

Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Creadur Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Empire-db Project

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application
development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow
highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of
compile-time-safety and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

Apache Empire-db became a TLP in January 2012 and the migration process
has been fully completed. After we have published our first top-level
release last month we have begun with the development of new features.
As the core component is largely stable and mature our goal is to
provide assistance to use Empire-db in a wider range of application
scenarios - especially in combination with common front-end frameworks.

Changes in committers or PMC members

There have been no changes in committers or PMC members during the last
month.

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
 None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
 None.
 Last modified: 2011-01-10
 There are no diversity issues regarding the PMC.

General status:
 The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

 Six PMC members have been active a little during this quarter.

 Development has been quiet for the quarter.
 Some little activity on dev mail list and issue tracker. An old issue was
 discussed. No follow on, but still a sign of life.
 There was zero activity on the user mail list.

 In late March it came to our attention that our past release votes were
 conducted on packages that contained third-party binaries in addition to
 our project's open-source code. Our chair removed the packages from the
 mirror system. The 0.9 packages were then reconstructed to have separate
 "sources" and "dependencies" packages. The project then voted again for the
  0.9 release using the new "sources" package.

Security issues reported:
 None.

Progress of the project:
 Again, the only commits were a few documentation edits.

Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Gora Project

Apache Gora

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and
persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key
value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The Apache Gora team was happy to announce the release of Gora 0.2 on
24th April 2012 (1st since graduation from the Incubator). During the
process of this release, the team managed to simplify the release process
somewhat so we look forward to the shift towards a more incremental
release policy within the project as a whole. As a side note, an
experimental branch of Nutch is now very close to a community VOTE
further to the recent Gora 0.2 release.

Overall Project Activity since last report

The majority of work directly concerned the 0.2 release as mentioned above.
Since then there have been a few commits, however there has also been
some encouraging conversation with respect to our site migration to
the Apache CMS. We currently have some 50 odd issues to work on within
the 0.3 development drive.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Encouragingly we have had a number of new issues logged on Jira
from new Gora users. On most occasions this has sparked decent conversations
however we are lacking patches from these new Gora users. Some excellent
news was that our Gora Amazon DynamoDB Google Summer of Code project
was succesfully accepted into this years programme. The prospective
student, Renato has been on list and we look forward to kicking things
off later this month.

Changes to PMC & Committers

NONE

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of projects including,
Nutch, Tika, OODT, Camel, Solr, Accumulo & Hadoop (this is not an exhaustive
list). Within the scope of the 0.3 development drive is an extensive upgrade
of the Avro code, so we will be vigilant in attracting new members. We also
look forward to the progression of GSoC. Hopefully our student progresses
to become part of the Gora team in due course.

Project Branding or Naming issues

NONE

Legal issues

NONE


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems.

No major issues requiring the Board's attention.

== Project Status ==

The project released versions 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 during this reporting period
(many thanks to Jim). A new version of mod_fcgid (2.3.7) was also released.

We've had a mercifully slow quarter for CVEs, with no 2.2.x releases
required.

There are ongoing discussions of using the CMS for our site and/or 
documentation that various volunteers are working on. 

== Community ==

We added Daniel Gruno (humbedooh) as a committer this period, with no
changes to the PMC roster.

As we had discussed informally for a long time, our SVN authorization
was flattened out to not differentiate between different kinds
of committers.

We are also enabling comments (via Disqus) on the httpd manual, 
with a pilot ongoing with a single trunk topic. This is hoped to
help with contributions/bug reports on the documentation.

Mailing list, bugzilla, and IRC traffic is steady.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache HttpComponents Project

The Apache HttpComponents project is responsible for creating
and maintaining a toolset of low level Java components focused
on HTTP and associated protocols.

Status

- Overall the project remains active.

Releases

- HttpAsyncClient 4.0-alpha3 was released on the 23rd of February 2012

- HttpCore 4.2 was released on the 5th of May 2012. This is a major GA
  release after multiple beta releases and release candidates

Community

- The community remains small but active. There is good user interaction
  on the mailing lists.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The trend of more podlings graduating than are coming in continues, which
is a good thing given the backlog of stuck projects the Incubator has
accumulated over the past years. This trend is also visible in the podling
categorization we've been doing since February. The number of podlings
in the rough starting/incubating/graduating categories has gone from
7/13/4 in February to 2/9/7 now.

Our recent focus on report review with active feedback to and dialogue with
the podlings has helped drive this progress. Until now this extra effort has
come from just a few individuals, but we're working on ways to make this
more sustainable by sharing the work for example by having IPMC volunteers
as "shepherds" who'll review specific reports in more detail. Initial results
seem promising.

While not designed to replace the existing mentor model, the extra reviews
have helped spot and deal with many cases where podlings have been in need
of extra help or just some gentle pushing ahead. We're looking at ways to
track mentor activity in order to better identify such cases before they
become too troublesome.

o Community

  There were no changes to the Incubator PMC since our last report.
  The IPMC currently has 158 members.

  The following podlings are requesting graduation to Apache TLPs:

  - Apache Hama
  - Apache MRUnit
  - Apache Giraph
  - Apache ManifoldCF

  The Incubator PMC recommends the board to accept the respective resolutions.

  The Zeta Components podling has retired due to low activity.

  The JSPWiki podling started a graduation vote, but it was withdrawn after
  concerns about the low project activity were raised. Based on feedback from
  general@, the community hopes to make another release and some other progress
  before restarting the graduation vote.

  There is an interesting thread on general@ about the sometimes vague
  boundary between redistributing upstream dependencies as standalone
  components or integral parts of an Apache product. The BigTop podling,
  where this issue came up, will hopefully summarize this discussion in more
  detail in their next report.

o Legal / Trademarks

  The retired Zeta Components codebase was migrated to GitHub where it
  retains the project name (without the "Apache" prefix) even though not
  much new activity is expected. The move was handled well, with
  trademarks@ in the loop.

  The Amber project has been stuck for a long time with an IP clearance
  issue that they have been unable to resolve by themselves. It seems like
  this issue could have been resolved one way or another already years ago
  with more mentor help, which unfortunately has been lacking.

o Releases

  The following incubating releases were made since our last report:

  - April 16th, 2012: Apache ManifoldCF 0.5-incubating
  - April 23rd, 2012: Apache Jena LARQ 1.0.0-incubating
  - April 28th, 2012: Apache MRUnit 0.9.0-incubating
  - May 5th, 2012: Apache Airavata 0.2-incubating
  - May 8th, 2012: Apache OpenOffice 3.4.0-incubating
  - May 9th, 2012: Apache Stanbol 0.9.0-incubating

  The Apache Mesos 0.9.0-incubating release is just hitting the mirrors
  after a lenghty release vote that failed to attract enough IPMC votes
  for quite a while.

o Infrastructure

  The Flex project is still blocked with its migration to ASF infrastructure,
  which seems to be a major contributing factor to the downwards trend seen
  in Flex list activity. A solution or at least some workaround is urgently
  needed.

-------------------- Summary of podling reports --------------------

Still getting started at the Incubator (2 podlings)

  CloudStack, Syncope

  These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
  towards graduation is yet expected.

Not yet ready to graduate (9 podlings)

  IP clearance:  Amber
  No release:    Flex
  Low activity:  Ambari, Droids, Nuvem, Photark
  Low diversity: Airavata, DeltaSpike, SIS

  We expect the next quarterly report of projects in this category to
  include a summary of their actions and progress in solving these issues. 

Ready to graduate (7 podlings)

  Clerezza, Lucene.NET, NPanday, Stanbol, VCL, Wink, Wookie

  We expect these projects to graduate within the next quarter.

--------------------
Airavata

Airavata is a software toolkit which provides features to compose, manage,
execute, and monitor large scale applications and workflows on computational
resources ranging from local clusters to national grids and computing clouds.
Airavata is incubating since May 2011.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. The documentation is improving but still not par to ease barrier of entry.
     The code, documentation and JIRA issues have to be efficiently
     organized and managed to appeal to wider developer community.

  2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well
     aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here:
     http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment

  3. Create a regular and predictable release process and schedule

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  The community is very active averaging 150 dev list emails and 75 commits
  per month. Airavata community encourages cross pollination with other
  Apache projects and also reuses significant number of license compatible
  open source libraries. This has helped keep the focus, but delayed the
  releases with impasse on legal requirements. The delay in making a release
  had lost some developer momentum.

  The community is not yet significantly diverse but lately the interest is
  growing. The project is committed and very supportive to external users and
  is putting the effort on increasing diversity. The PMC has discussed few
  potential outreach venues and have proposed and engaged with 8 GSoC student
  proposals.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No new committers or PPMC members elected in the last quarter. Three new
  users from the community are very active in the mailing list. Some have
  started to send patches and have potential interest.

  4 GSoC projects proposed on Airavata have been accepted. The students for
  these projects are Hasitha Aravinda, Yaroslav Porshnev, Milinda Pathirage,
  and Bhathiya Jayasekara.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  0.2-incubating release candidate (skipped 0.1-incubating numbering) was
  significantly improved in regards to license and notice complains. The
  Community Vote was successful with 5 PPMC and 2 mentor votes. The Vote
  in IPMC general list is ongoing.

  With the delay in release, the community has branched a 0.2 release and
  has made significant progress on the trunk. Many features have been added
  and ready for successive couple more releases.

  The community has actively responded to GSoC proposals and student
  questions resulting in few quality proposals.

  Community is voting for a wiki to increase focus on documentation and
  tutorial.

Ambari

Ambari is monitoring, administration and lifecycle management project
for Apache Hadoop clusters.

  - Incubating since 30 August 2011.
  - 162 jiras fixed on trunk (0 added since Feb report) + 8 jiras fixed 
    on dev branch ambari-186
  - After having no commits since January, yesterday a new code base
    was contributed and checked in on dev branch ambari-186. Development
    is happening rapidly on the branch while the project discusses how
    to move forward. The current proposal is to continue development on
    the branch until it is usable and then call a vote to replace trunk
    with the code on the branch.
  - 8 new developers have contributed to the ambari-186 code base

Issues that must be addressed before graduation are:

  - Making a release
  - Attracting users and developers
  - Increase diversity of developers outside of Hortonworks

Amber

Amber has been incubating since July 2010. Amber is a project to develop
a Java library which provides an API specification for, and an unconditionally
compliant implementation of the OAuth v1.0, v1.0a and v2.0 specifications.
OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to authenticate and authorise access
by another party to resources they control while avoiding the need to share
their username and password credentials.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  - Clarify status of code grant
  - Attract users and developers
  - Generate a release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  - We need copyright signoff from University of Newcastle or some guidance
    on how to proceed.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Raymond Feng joined in as a mentor
  - New users / devs show up on the mailing lists both contributing patches
    and asking for guidance/release

How has the project developed since the last report

  - an attempt to clarify the legal issue is on going see LEGAL-134
  - Fixed a bunch of issues for aligning with latest OAuth specification

Clerezza

(incubating since November 27th, 2009)

Clerezza is a framework and set of components designed to make it easy to
build application for the semantic and the social web.

Graduation:

  We believe Clerezza will be ready to graduate soon. Currently discussions
  for a plan for community development are ongoing. Once a plan for community
  development has been defined we can discuss graduation. Documentation and
  tutorials are still in need of improvement and this may be addressed as
  part of the community development plan but we believe lacking documentation
  alone should not stand in the way of graduation.

How has the community developed since the last report:

  The cooperation with the Apache Stanbol project has been improved with
  two Stanbol committers becoming Clerezza committers.

How has the project developed since the last report.

  - We successfully released Clerezza (0.2-incubating).

  - Apache Wink has accepted a patch by a Clerezza developer. This presents
    an opportunity to replace our own JAX-RS implementation with Wink's.

  - Discussions about the release process and its documentation have taken
    place. We have identified possible problems with our version policy and
    release process when releasing only a subset of the modules Clerezza
    consists of. It is our intention to be able to make such releases. No
    conclusion has been reached yet.

  - A drop of activity in the second half of this quarter (after the release).
    This can be partially explained with the fact that many developers use
    Clerezza in other projects and the release caused a temporary shift in
    focus on those projects.

--------------------
CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration
platform. CloudStack has been in incubation since 2012-04-16

Overview:

  Cloudstack just entered the incubator a couple of weeks ago. Since then,
  the mailing list has been setup  and discussions have started to migrate
  from the existing list to the ASF-hosted list, with several 'new names'
  participating including one of those 'new names' submitting a patch.
  Currently, the code repository and bulk of existing infrastructure is still
  hosted by Citrix, but the community is looking forward to getting that
  moved to Apache as soon as possible.

A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. The base level of infrastructure migration has begun but still has far
     to be finished. At present the mailing lists exist, but wiki, project
     website, source repository, bug tracker, etc still need to be brought
     up and migrated. In many ways we are blocked on further progress by
     lack of account creation for initial committers.

  2. Diversity of the contributor base still needs to be expanded - this was
     identified as an issue in the proposal, and remains one, though we are
     encouraged by a seeming uptick (we've been in incubation for less than
     a week, so trends are indeed difficult to identify at this point) in
     interest on the mailing lists from previously uninvolved individuals.

  3. The project needs a working process definition.  What is the review
     process for contributions, recommendations for engaging before writing
     large amounts of code, etc.

  4. The project is using source and binaries with a number of
     non-ASF-approved licenses.  This needs remediation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues that we are aware of at this point.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There has been no previous report - so nothing to report here.

DeltaSpike

(incubating since December 2011)

DeltaSpike will consist of a number of portable CDI extensions that provide
useful features for Java application developers. The goal of DeltaSpike is
to create a de-facto standard of CDI-Extensions that is developed and
maintained by the community.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention.

Since our last report in February 2012, we have accomplished the following:

  - Finished the initial build structure
  - Finished the initial test-infrastructure
  - Finished migrating first core feature contributions from Seam3 and CODI
  - Started discussions about tools for our documentation and website
  - Started with the status page (based on
    http://incubator.apache.org/guides/website.html)
  - We received the Code grant from JBoss Inc for JBoss employee written
    parts of Seam3
  - We shipped the deltaspike-0.1-incubating and deltaspike-0.2-incubating
    release

Upcoming major goals:

  - Finish test-infrastructure to allow in-container tests
  - Finish the setup for the documentation and the website
  - Work on the next features: deltaspike-security, deltaspike-jpa,
    deltaspike-i18n


Top 2 or 3 things to resolve before graduation:

  1. Build community
  2. Create Documentation

Droids

Droids is an Incubator project arrived from Apache Labs. Droids entered
incubation on October, 2008.

It's an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows one to create
and extend existing web robots.

Tobias Rübner has been voted in and added as a committer and PPMC member.

Issues before graduation :

  Diversity is still an issue for the podling. The addition of Tobias
  is a step towards remedying that.

Flex (extra report)

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A large community is losing momentum as it waits for Adobe to
complete the source code transition and infrastructure.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  - Resolve trademark donation or licensing
  - Complete code and bug database donation
  - Make at least one release

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  The ASF legal team will have to agree to a custom Trademark licensing.
  Adobe is still finalizing its proposal for the agreement.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  Besides the trademark issue mentioned previously, the import of existing
  JIRA bugs is blocked by an issue with Apache JIRA's import utility. It has
  failed to import the data file supplied by Adobe. Infra has opened a support
  ticket with Atlassian, but the problem remains unresolved two months later.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - The Flex compiler source code, including history, was imported into
    the SVN repository.
  - Additional localization resources have been donated.
  - Carol Frampton is working to create a release candidate.  We expect
    the initial RC's to be rejected as we finalize licensing and other
    policy issues.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

  Adobe expects to complete the transfer of the mustella test suite.
  We hope to get an initial release approved by IPMC.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?

  Our mentors continue to be very helpful.

  We really need to get JIRA up and running.  I still would like the incubator
  to consider separate servers for projects.  Having to set up external
  servers as an interim is a lot of work and adds confusion when you want
  to move to a final server or url later and you could have migration
  issues if you didn't set up the server in a compatible way.

Lucene.NET

Lucene.Net was accepted into the Apache Incubator in February 2011.
Originally it was a sub project of the Lucene Project.

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and
targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:

  - Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating
    and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize
    with the Java Lucene release schedule.

  - High-performance C# search engine library.

  - Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that
    end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that
    takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.

Recent Activity:

  - Released 2.9.4g (generics version of 2.9.4) at the end of january

Current Activities:

  - Lucene 3.0.3 porting is nearly complete. We have some bugs to work out,
    and need to clean up our contrib projects a bit, but we hope to release
    that within a month or two.

Long term goals:

  - Have a nearly fully automated process to convert Java Lucene to C#.
    (This has been a goal, but we are discussing if this is truely the best
    idea of the project). UPDATE: We have done some more investigative work
    on this, but not much progress was made.

  - Parity with Java Lucene (4.0)

  - Have a new .NET version of Lucene utilizing .NET constructs and idioms

Graduation thought:

  One of the mentors (Stefan Bodewig) has indicated he wants to start
  pushing for graduation. UPDATE: Unfortunately, we have not made any
  progress on this - hopefully we can have a more conclusive update next
  check in. Our development/committers group is small, and work sometimes
  happens in bursts and then stalls - something we need to work on a bit.
  The team has started to be more vocal about the project, for example a
  blog has been added, and hopes to attract more contributors.

--------------------
NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache Maven.
NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.

NPanday had a lull of activity over the last few months as all the committers
had other things occupying their time. This has picked up again over the last
couple of weeks, with the renewed push for another release. There is still a
need to focus on a graduation plan, and to better promote the project among
the .NET and Maven communities as a result.

As reported last time, we continue to see small growth in users, and
occasional patch submissions, but haven't added a new committer in a while.

The top priorities towards graduation are:

  - work out a concrete plan towards graduation in the next quarter
  - encourage newer contributors to do so on a continuing basis.

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.

Nuvem

Apache Nuvem will define an open application programming interface for
common cloud application services, allowing applications to be easily
ported across the most popular cloud platforms.

Nuvem was accepted for Incubation on June, 2010.

The Nuvem project is slowly seeing increase of committer activity and
mailing list discussions from external users or people interested in the
project.

The project also had a GSoC project accepted and will have Dulini Atapattu
working on a Message Queue component for different cloud platforms.

Top things to resolve prior to graduation:

  - Increase the number of active committers.

PhotArk

Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application
including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access
control layer, and upload capabilities.

PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008.

PhotArk has a small community of contributors, mostly student, that need a
lot of attention in order to keep them active, and the lack of attention made
the community stale for a bit and we are starting to bootstrap it again
with some committers becoming active again, and other like myself freeing
up to be able to work on the project again.

The community have also decided to move the project direction to become a
hybrid HTML5/Cordova mobile application that aggregates images from
different photo sources such as: Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, etc. And
we will have two students helping on this project as part of GSoC 2012.

Issues before graduation :

  PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have
  grown the community to the minimal independent committer size required
  for graduation. We need to make these contributors constantly active
  in order to think about graduation again, or recruit new contributors.

SIS

Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users
can use to build applications containing location context. This project will
look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities,
services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further,
the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level
community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores, REST-ful
interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under the
Apache umbrella.

SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  The plan proposed here: http://s.apache.org/Q2z seems to be going
  well and we are happy with the direction the project is headed.

Community progress since the last report

  No new PPMC members and committers added this quarter.

Project progress since last report

  Looking at just mailing list activity:
  sis-dev: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-sis-dev/
  went from 9 email messages in January 2012 to 32, 74 and 39 in Feb-April 2012

  We are participating pretty actively in GSoC and hoping to get 1 or 2
  students who are collaborating with the Apache OODT project as well
  for a joint effort.

  In addition, we've seen some good cross pollination between other (at
  the time) incubating projects like Jena and Any23, and TLPs like OODT.
  In Jena and Any23's case, there are active discussions and work going on
  to implement the W3C GeoSPARQL system using Apache SIS. After Andy Seaborne
  poked around on the mailing list, Chris Mattmann volunteered to implement
  it, and a subsequent thread has ensued.

  Chris started rolling an RC for Apache SIS 0.2-incubating, but got blocked
  on some packaging issues that Kevan Miller identified that needs to be fixed.
  Shouldn't be too difficult and we hope to have an IPMC VOTE on it within
  the next week or so.

  We have also started to regularly use the project wiki. You can find it
  here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SIS/Home. Included on
  the wiki are links to all of our Incubator reports, along with 2 tutorials.
  The first one is a quick start guide that Ross Laidlaw improved and copied
  from the SIS README.txt file. The second demonstrates how to get Apache
  OODT and SIS connected to dump spatial information out of geolocated files
  in Apache OODT and to search them in SIS.

  Two newcomers to the community, Peter Karich, and Charith Madusanka have been
  contributing patches, issues, and working issues within SIS. Peter has been
  improving the speed of SIS's Quad Tree implementation, and Charith has been
  helping improve our demo.jsp file, our javadocs, and is now working on a GUI
  for SIS.

  SIS is actively being used and piloted by students of Dr. Ellis Horowitz and
  Chris Mattmann in USC's CSCI 572: Search Engines and Information Retrieval
  class: http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci572.

  If we can add some new committers soon (which we expect), roll
  0.2-incubating, and then potentially get an 0.3 shortly thereafter, we
  think SIS will be well on its way to graduating and its own project.

Stanbol

Apache Stanbol is an open source modular software stack and reusable set of
components for semantic content management. Incubating since November, 2010.

Graduation:

  We believe Stanbol will be ready to graduate in the next few days: the
  issues mentioned in our previous report have been adressed, the release
  is being voted on (after six iterations of release candidates) and should
  be out in the next few days if all goes well. Community activity is steady
  and slowly increasing.

Community:

  No new committers or PPMC members since the last report, but steady activity
  on our lists from both existing and new members of our community.

  Two Stanbol committers have been elected as Clerezza committers, furthering
  ties between both podlings.

  A Stanbol GSoC project has been accepted, with Rupert Westenthaler as
  its mentor.

  Contribution of several EnhancementEngines based on LinguaGrid (NLP
  framework) by Alessio Bosca (STANBOL-583).

  Integration of DBpedia Spotlight (http://dbpedia.org/spotlight) with the
  Stanbol Enhancer, led by a new Stanbol contributor.

  Stanbol was presented in the Developer Track of WWW2012
  (slides: http://s.apache.org/AgK)

Project activity:

  - Reorganization of the codebase for the release, the one binary dependency
    left that's not available in Maven Central has been moved to a separate
    -deps package for the release, as discussed on the incubator general list.
  - Content hub faceted search improvements.
  - New EnhancementEngine based on Apache Tika
  - TopicEngine (STANBOL-197) is now functional

VCL

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines. It provides
comparatively easy and simple base line install with a end-user self
service interface.

New Committers

  The Apache VCL community recently added James O'Dell from California
  State University at Fullerton as a committer. We welcome James and look
  forward to his expertise and knowledge to help advance VCL project and
  community.

New PPMC member

  The Apache VCL PPMC recently added Aaron Coburn as a new PPMC member.
  The current PPMC welcomes Aaron.

Community Involvement

  - The Apache VCL community is a growing community with global interest
    from Education and commercial entities.
  - The community is fast to respond to user questions and discuss design
    ideas in a respectful manner.
  - We have seen cross project interest as through a contribution of a
    VCL driver to the Apache LIBCLOUD project.
  - There are community members that have expressed interest in becoming
    committers. They are working through their initial contributions. We
    look forward to hopefully bring them aboard.

Releases

  - Our next release has been delayed from our previous board report.
  - This 2.3 release is a very large release, including bug-fixes, support
    from kvm, VMWare vcenter, multi-lingualization, and approved
    contributions from the community.
  - We are in testing now and hope to generate a 2.3 release candidate in
    the next few days.

Top Issues Before Graduation

   Graduation work itself - As a community discuss graduation to determine
   if we are ready. If so proceed with starting the process.

Wink

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of REST
style web services. The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311)
standard. The project also introduces a client runtime which can leverage
certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink will deliver
component technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of
environments.

Apache Wink has been incubating since 2009-05-27.

Development list traffic and discussions are steadily, but low. We noticed a
little increase on the traffic with some users starting to provide patches and
request for a new release, which the community have started working on.

We are having a second discussion around project status
(http://s.apache.org/5h1) and one option that was brought up was the
possibility of graduating as a sub-project of a TLP that have dependencies
on Wink (e.g. Geronimo and/or Tuscany). The community thinks that we will
have a better understanding of the direction we want to take by the next
report (in three months).

Activities since last report period :

  - Apache Wink 1.2 release being finalized in the project mailing list.
  - Website being migrated to Apache CMS and taking in consideration
    trademark requirements
  - Raymond Feng being recommended as a new PMC member

Planned Activity:

  - Continue discussion around project future

Top issues before graduation:

  - Increase the size/diversity of the active dev community

Wookie

Wookie is a Java server application that allows you to upload and deploy
widgets for your applications. Wookie is based on the W3C Widgets
specification, but widgets can also be included that use extended APIs
such as Google Wave Gadgets and OpenSocial.

Wookie has been incubating since 17th July 2009.

Progress since February 2012:

  - 0.9.2 release
  - Hoang Minh Tien added as Committer
  - Matt Franklin added as Mentor
  - Improved release documentation
  - GSoC student project

Next steps:

  - implement new release schedule (aligned with Apache Rave)
  - 0.10.0 release using new release process
  - start graduation process after release
  - ASF Widgets demo

Issues before graduation:

  - none

Details:

In our last report we identified our target for this period was to identify
ways to improve the diversity of the Wookie community.

Since our last report we added a new committer (Tien) and we are now diverse
enough to graduate (6 committers from 4 organisations), although we are still
a small community.

We feel that graduation of the project will also help attract new
contributors, and we will seek approval to graduate during the next
quarter, after the 0.10 release which is imminent.

As well as graduation, we have agreed that having more frequent scheduled
releases, coordinated with Apache Rave may also help with community
development.

Matt Franklin has joined Wookie as a mentor and is active in helping with
this process.

We've also created a lot of detailed documentation on the release process
and are encouraging more committers take a turn at being release manager
to both test the documentation and to spread the experience of doing this
more widely.

Our first release under the new schedule will be 15th May.

Another approach we're (still) looking at is how we can use Wookie to deploy
widgets that relate to ASF processes and activities as a way of raising
awareness and interest; we've done some experiments with Widgets using the
Jira API as a starting point for a demonstrator and we may want to explore
this further.

We also have a GSoC student project with Wookie this year.

Zeta Components

The project has decided to retire from the incubator. Code has mostly been

Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Jena Project

Apache Jena is a Java framework for building Semantic Web applications
based on W3C and community standards.

Jena became a TLP April 2012.

Status:

The project is executing the graduation process. The administrative
updates have been done, the infrastructure setup started for the
transfer of resources (lists, website, svn) and the project is now
engaged in the transfer tasks.

The final piece of non-Apache project infrastructure is the demo site
sparql.org.  This is in the process of migrating to an Apache hosted
zone as time permits.

Community:

In April, the user list had 293 message and the dev list 156.  The
project has completely migrated from lists used before Apache; messages
to old lists receive pointers to the Apache lists.  JIRA is active as a
means of reporting issues and requesting features. Some contributions
have been received. One, from SAP, may require a software grant; further
clarification of the size of the contribution has been sought.

Releases:

The project's main incubator release was in December; additional
components were released in February, March and April.

Issues:

There are no board issues.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Logging Project


- Community

Gary Gregory has joined the log4j team as a new committer.

The overall project has become more active in the past weeks. This is most
likely due to the constant activity on log4php, but also of the log4j 2.0
efforts.

Curt Arnold has tendered a resignation of the PMC Chair office pending selection
of a replacement. It has been a pleasure to serve in this role and I have good
intentions to continue to contribute to the project though time constraints are
likely to continue to be severe. It is encouraging to see the recent growth in
the community and project activity. I would expect that the PMC will submit a
resolution for board consideration in time for the next board meeting.


- Project Branding Requirements

With the release of log4j 1.2.17, the log4j 1.x website should conform to the
branding requirements.

Already meeting the requirements:
   - logging.apache.org
   - log4net
   - log4php
   - log4j (pending 1.2.17 release)

Open:
   - log4jcxx
   - chainsaw
   - log4j 2.0

The log4j 2.0 site has not been deployed yet.

- Development

log4j 1.2:

The 1.2.17 release is currently being voted on. Latest with the board meeting a
new version should be available. The project has dropped jdk 1.3 support.
With 1.2.17 the website will reference to the upcoming log4j 2.0 efforts.

log4j 2.0:

Constant activity and regular commits. The project faces an increased level of
interest.  The german JavaMagazin has confirmed to publish an article on log4j
2.0 in one of the summer issues.

log4cxx:

Less activity.

log4net:

This quarter has seen no activity in svn at all.  User questions are
being asked and answered by the community, but there is no real
development.

JIRA issues get discussed and some major pain points have been
identified.  The current set of committers is pretty small and not
very active and we still haven't manage to attract new people who'd
want to contribute consistently.

log4php:

Constant activity, still a small team. Changes are mainly driven from one
committer.

Chainsaw:

A new chainsaw release is blocked by the companions release.

Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Lucy Project

The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for dynamic
programming languages.

ACTIVITY

    our bylaws.
  * Development of the codebase has been active, with a focus on enabling
    compiled extensions.

RELEASES

  * Version 0.3.1 has been created. We are still exercising the new
    mechanics of https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/lucy/ before
    making an official announcement.

COMMUNITY

  * No change to committer/PMC membership ranks during this period.
  * The dev list has been active, the user list has seen some discussion
    of Lucy compatibility with Lucene and Nutch.
  * Commit diversity within the existing community is satisfactory and
    continues to improve.

BRANDING

  * We believe that we are in full compliance with the ASF branding
    guidelines.

ISSUES

  * None requiring board-level attention at this time.

such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging,
named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.
These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing
services.

Development
------------------
Last month the development stayed active and we had commits
almost every day from different committers. Most of the changes
were related to bug fixes and smaller improvements.

A discussion about the first OpenNLP release as a TLP was started
on the dev list, but it will likely take 2 or 3 month until the
release is finished.

ISSUES
There are no issues that require the board's attention.

RELEASES
Apache Rave 0.10.1 and 0.11 have been released since the last
report.

ACTIVITY
The community has been focused on delivering simpler UI extension in
0.11.  Additionally, discussions continue around improving the overall

Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache River Project

Apache River is a distributed computing architecture, based on the JSK
Starter Kit Source code donated by Sun Microsystems, for the Jini
Specification.

Releases:
No new releases since last report, several submissions have been made
for inclusion into our next release and are currently being reviewed
prior to merging them onto the trunk.

Branding:
The River website had one branding issue (missing DOAP file) for which
a Jira was raised (thanks Shane) and has been resolved.

Progress:
There are a trickle of SVN commits being made.  We are a small
community and so this is expected.  There was a discussion on building
a reference implementation to showcase River since there is little
public knowledge of River/Jini installations, similar to the Java Pet
Store.  We hope this will help to get people involved in contributing
to that application, but also make it easier for end users to
understand the offering of this tech.

Community:
One PMC member has resigned citing the difficulty of working with the
code and understanding how best to measure the changes she was trying
to make.  This is a valid point given the lack of hard data and
particular performance issues encountered by end users.

The PMC recently discussed the the health of our community.  Whilst we
all agreed that things were pretty quiet, many of the contributors
reaffirmed their commitment to the project.  Since we are such a small
community we can hardly expect the same levels of noise and activity
as those projects with many more members or who have greater numbers
of end users.  As such, we have no particular concerns that the
project is slipping into dormancy.

Issues:
No board issues at this time

General
 Apologies for the late report.  Things have been puttering along
 in WS-land, with no changes to community of late.  The project's
 (few but tireless) core committers are continuing to get stuff
 done, and issues are being responded to on the mailing lists.

 Glen is stepping down from the chair position and Sagara will be
 taking over.  One hopes this might result in more timely
 reports. :) The project could surely use a bit more cleanup
 (finishing dist/ housekeeping, website work, etc), but things
 are mostly moving at a slow-and-steady pace.

Releases / Code
 * WSS4J 1.6.5 was released on March 4
 * Axiom 1.2.13 was released on April 9
 * Neethi 3.0.2 was released on April 11
 * XmlSchema 2.0.2 was released on April 11

 * Work will be stopping on the WSS4J 1.5 branch

Attachment AP: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

1. A lot of work has been done to update the Xalan-C documentation and
web site.

2. Work has been completed to port Xalan-C to Microsoft Visual Studio
10.

3. Xalan-C was approved for a Google Summer of Code project to finish
up an implementation of the ESXLT library (http://exslt.org/) and the
contributor is up and running!

4. Work is ongoing to clean up Jira issues.

5. Gary Gregory and and Michael Glavassevich have both expressed an
interest in getting out a Xalan-J 2.7.2 bug-fix release to help show
the community that we're still alive and hopefully renew some interest
in the project to attract contributors. They haven't had the time yet
to make that a reality, but the intention is there. Steven Hathaway
volunteered to help with the documentation for a Xalan-J 2.7.2 release
when we get around to it. This was discussed recently on the mailing
list. A lot of commits to Xalan-J (more than 70) were made around the
new year to start getting the rust off.

Attachment AQ: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J

There were several students who expressed an interest in GSoC this
year and we were fortunate again to have a student with a project
proposal that was accepted. For GSoC, Shakya Wijerama will be
working on a solution to allow for validation against multiple XML
schemas with the same namespace.

With XML Schema 1.1 becoming a W3C Recommendation there appears to
be more interest from users in what we've done in Xerces-J. We still
need to figure out what remaining work needs to be done to move the
support from its beta state into the main release stream.

We are aware that the Apache Lucene project had been distributing
its own patched version of Xerces to resolve a problem they were
having. The Xerces JIRA issue reported for the problem continues to
remain open today because we have been waiting for a consumable test
case to be provided. The initial reporter's test was 20 GBs, too
large for many to download and analyze. Apparently Lucene has since
implemented a workaround and stopped distributing their own Xerces
version. We certainly welcome the Lucene developers engagement if
they're still interested in a resolution. With more direct
communication on the mailing lists this issue might have already
been resolved a long time ago.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate (and increasingly lately in
part due to GSoC); about 140+ posts on the j-dev and j-users lists
since the beginning of March.

No new releases this quarter.

Xerces-C

Moderate development activity during the reporting period: 4 bugs
have been filed, 8 have been resolved.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; about 50+ posts on the c-dev
and c-users lists since the beginning of March.

No new releases this quarter.

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

The migration from the XML project is finally complete. Thanks to
Gareth the website and SVN location have now been moved over to the
Xerces domain.

No development activity to report.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The "TM" symbol has been added to the first main occurrences of
"Apache Xerces" on each TLP website page. There's still some work
left to do on the TLP website, including adding "TM" to the project
logo.

Attachment AR: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

General
-------
I've organized some changes to the PMC Membership to remove 2 emeritus members
and invited 2 new more active members. A new source code component has also been
submitted to the XML Graphics umbrella too: pdf-plugin, which was kindly granted
to Apache by Jeremias Maerki. This will make it easier for committers to
maintain.  Previously committers had been sending patches around between
themselves and this was becoming unmanagable.

Brand Compliance
----------------
The contents of the FOP, Commons and TLP sites have been reviewed and adjusted
to meet brand compliance. The Batik site has yet to be reviewed, but I hope we
can get to that soon. The FOP site has been republished, but the Commons and
the TLP site are awaiting re-publishing.

Moving to CMS based websites
----------------------------
We have started the process of figuring out how we can move to markdown and use
a CMS based publishing approach instead of the painful forrest based approach we
are currently using. Clay Leeds has made excellent progress on prototyping the
new approach, but we have a lot of work still to do to get fully switched over
to a CMS based website.

Transitioning from Bugzilla to JIRA
-----------------------------------
A vote has been passed to transition all of XML Graphics' Bugzilla products to
JIRA for bug and issue management. Glenn Adams has volunteered to oversee this
process.

FOP
---
One new very active committer: Glenn Adams. Since becoming a committer Glenn
has processed a lot of patches that have been sitting around for a long time
and cleaned up a lot of the bugs in preparation for doing a 1.1 release. There
have been bug fixes and enhancements committed too, the most significant are:
Complex Scripts Support, e.g., Arabic, Devanagari, Thai, etc., (Glenn Adams) and
Compressed Objects Streams for PDF (Vincent Hennebert, Peter Hancock). There
have also been a few technical discussions on the developer lists and many
questions asked and answered on the user list.

Batik
-----
There doesn't appear to be any active committers on this sub project at the
moment.  No commits were made and there has been no activity on the developer
list.  However, there were a few questions raised by users on the user list.

Commons
-------
A few commits this quarter, which includes some bugs fixed plus the changes
needed by Brand Compliance.

== NOTES ==

Infra:

There is a significant increase in this years budget, over last year.  This is 
due to the sharp increase in staffing costs.  We have effectively added a new 
FT post over above last years budget.  There is a reduced hardware budget, 
as there are fewer hosts requiring replacement. 

Brand Management:

With the growth in commercial popularity of many of our projects - and the 
corresponding growth in third parties who use (and sometimes abuse) our 
project brands, and on the advice of counsel, we plan to register a number 
of trademarks in the coming year, primarily in response to approved project 
requests.

We also plan to register the change of ownership of several trademarks, to 
deal with key project's brand image and to ensure third parties clearly 
understand our ownership of these marks (there have been several questions 
about our legitimacy).

We also plan to work with DLAPiper on trademark issues going forward. They 
have offered detailed docket tracking - a huge help to us - completely pro 
bono, but also note that to ensure the registration process is smooth, higher 
fees may be expected when processing actual registrations or transfers.

All requested budget is for national registry fees or for legal expenses 
directly related to registered trademarks.
