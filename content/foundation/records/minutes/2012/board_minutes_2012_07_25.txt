       From what I was able to see, the ASF booth at OSCON had a great deal
       of traffic and activity. Special thanks goes to Sally and Melissa
       for doing a great job in coordinating the booth and in manning it.
       Also thanks to all ASF members and committers who helped man the
       booth, especially Justin who was there *a lot*.

       Although I still have some concerns about Concom, and especially
       about ApacheCon EU 2012, I am happy to see renewed efforts and
       energy in the cmmt. Even though I have asked to be voted in as
       a Concom developer, I will likely also request weekly reports from
       Concom, as we get closer and closer to the event.
       
       I am working on the D&O renewal. I've been informed that this year's
       rate will likely be more expensive than the previous years (by
       potentially as much as 50%). Our agent is looking into other
       policies but in any case, we will be easily under budget on this
       line item.

            in a manner consistent with the expectations under which
            they were collected.

          * I have yet to transfer the funds from PayPal to Wells Fargo.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

    June was a relatively light month for Secretary. 42 ICLAs, seven CCLAs,
    two grants, and seven membership applications were received and filed.
    During processing of ICLAs, ten requests were made for new accounts.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

       No report was submitted.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       Nothing to report for the month.

       ACEU activities are now progressing apace, but perhaps not
       fast enough to make it a success. The assignment of
       OpenBastion for some ACEU tasks appears to be a surprise for
       many folks. The board needs more insight into the production
       of ACEU. Perhaps weekly reports and request Nick's attendance
       at the next board meeting. Surprisingly, OpenBastion has
       apparently signed a hotel contract but no contract with ASF.
       Need to have more dialog on the concom list instead of private
       discussion.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================
 
I gave a talk "Managing Community Open Source Brands" at OSCON which 
was well received.  I was surprised at how many OSCON attendees 
commented on the importance of this talk: a half-dozen people each 
said "wow, yeah, this is something we really need to do better".
One attendee with legal experience noted that the outline in the 
talk (based on our brand management) was spot on with their 
experience with other trademark management processes.

  http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/24228

External Requests
=================

AOO continues to be the most active project in terms of brand issues,
working on both repackagers for portable software (USB sticks) as 
well as various media (movies, TV shows) requests for licenses.

The previous user of an OpenMeetings domain name has responded favorably 
to requests to provide credit to the Apache OpenMeetings podling.  

Granted permission for use of the feather in a graphic for a small
scale Lucene/Solr event.  This is one of the cases where it makes sense 
to be flexible with logo use for the benefit of our communities.

Trademark Registrations
=======================

Completed agreement assigning "FLEX" registered marks from Adobe to the ASF.

DLAPiper is completing work to fully track all dockets for our various 
registrations.  They have a draft chart showing fees we would be responsible 
for if we choose to either renew or update the ownership of various 
trademark registrations we have inherited around the globe.  While DLAPiper 
is working to cover many of these fees as pro bono, there are still many cases 
where there will be actual expenses in the $500 - $1000 range per jurisdiction.
trademarks@ will soon need to better define our strategy re: where we plan 
to maintain registrations per project, so that we can better request the 
required budget in the future.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising

I have resolved payment dates/cycles for each of our non-platinum sponsors. 
Three platinum sponsors and one gold sponsor have as yet uncertain payment 
dates. I hope to clarify these shortly. We are awaiting payment for two
platinum sponsorships.

RedHat has purchased FuseSource, and has agreed to upgrade their sponsorship,
although we are still awaiting to hear to what level.

Wandisco has agreed to upgrade to silver, they have been invoiced.

We have a new bronze sponsor, Object Engineering GmbH - payment received and
website updated.

There have been various discussions around Packt Publishing, and the 
royalties they pay to the ASF on books covering ASF projects. We are in the
process of clarifying exactly what has been paid for what title, however,
we have recognised that payments have been arriving.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Small Events
------------
A number of projects held events at OSCON last week, which from the 
feedback received so far were well received. We'll hopefully have more 
for next month on this. Thanks to all those who were involved in running 
the various parts of it!

There are currently no known cross-project small events in the planning 
stages, and none on the horizon either. We hope that activity will pick 
up later in the summer. A number of project specific events are in 
progress, but these haven't required much in the way of ConCom support 
(though it has been offered).

There have been a few queries recently about branding / logos / 
giveaways for smaller events that don't have direct ConCom involvement, 
such as small project events and project booths at conferences. It's not 
currently clear where the responsibilities lie between Trademarks and 
ConCom for this sort of thing. We have proposed something to clarify 
this, we're waiting to hear back from Trademarks on it.

A draft policy on direct sponsorship for small events has been drawn up, 
based on the feedback from the board, fundraising and discussions on the 
mailing list. It's expect we'll vote on this fairly soon, and once 
approved will be posted on events.apache.org (hopefully along with some 
of the surrounding advice for event organisers)

ApacheCon North America
-----------------------
OpenBastion signed the contract with the hotel in Portland for the 24th 
February - 2nd March 2013, with the main conference 26th-28th February. 
Steve from OpenBastion has worked with Sally to get an announcement out 
about this.

Nick and Steve have worked to put up basic details on all the likely 
websites, and a holding page with key details is available on the final 
site, http://na.apachecon.com/. A full site is expected over the next 
month, and the CFP is set to open on the 3rd of September.

The proposed contract with OpenBastion has been tweaked following 
feedback from a number of committee members, and the legal committee. 
Assuming no unexpected snags, we expect to sign the final version this 
week. In the mean time, OpenBastion continue to work on the contract, 
and engage with the community.

ApacheCon Europe
----------------
The Call For Papers opened last week, and was announced along with the 
website by Sally and at OSCON. The CFP is currently set to end on the 
3rd of August, but may be extended if we feel there's need, and if we 
feel we can compress the review/selection progress. The aim is currently 
to have the sessions chosen+announced by mid August, and the final 
schedule published shortly after. Details of the reviewing process, both 
for track chairs and for interested volunteers, should be available 
within a week. (We're awaiting confirmation from Eldarion of the exact 
process, but it expected to be very similar to the PyCon one)

A site visit is planned for this Thursday, 27th July. A number of 
questions have been put together which are to be answered during this 
visit. Amongst this will be confirmation of details around the venue 
layout and rooms, which will allow finalising of the tracks, and the 
catering, which is needed to finalise the ticket costs.

The aim is for early bird ticket sales to being on Monday 6th August. 
There are a number of gaps in the budget spreadsheet which need to be 
filled in before the ticket prices can be finalised, but it is expected 
that the missing details for this will be found during/just after the 
site visit. (The prices are needed a few days in advance of this, so 
they can be fed into the website and the ticketing system)

At the moment, the bulk of the discussions and planning remains on the 
public apachecon-discuss list. An attempt is being made to keep things 
public and open for as long as possible, but it's anticipated that a 
private planners list will be needed fairly soon. Each proposed track 
nominated one or two track chairs, who will make up much of the planners 
list, along with ConCom volunteers, OpenBastion and the EA.

Sally has come up with an interesting plan for sponsorship, which 
promises to be simple, easy to organise/arrange, and feed well into 
potential joint ACEU/ACNA sponsorship. This would have the advantage of 
not needing such a large sponsor co-ordinator volunteer, who thus far 
hasn't been found. (ACNA sponsorship responsibility lies with the 
producer, so needs confirming with them before it could be announced)

The plan is for OpenBastion to take on many of the supporting/organising 
roles for the event, supported by volunteers and the EA where 
appropriate / available. This should provide a chance to try out ideas 
before ACNA, for OpenBastion to learn more about the community, as well 
as to minimise dropped balls / problems / etc. A contract for this is 
expected shortly after the ACNA one, but it is intended that they'll be 
looking after the website, registration/ticketing, publicity, on-site, 
and helping with sponsorship and speaker admin.

After the site visit, and with the OpenBastion contract, it is expected 
that all of "Sally's Questions" on the event will be fully answered. 
(Many of the questions are already answered, or partially answered 
pending these details).

Over the next month, the key tasks to be completed (by a mixture of 
volunteers, OpenBastion and Melissa) are:
* Site Visit, get answers to lots of outstanding questions
* Finish budget, finalise ticket prices
* Open ticket sales
* Review submissions, select talks
* Draft schedule
* Finalise sponsorship plan, follow up on existing leads

Committee
---------
Jim Jagielski has expressed an interest in getting more involved in 
ConCom, and a vote is underway. Matt Franklin is a new volunteer this 
month, helping out with OSCON, we hope he enjoyed the experience enough 
to stick around for future events!

Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Updated the mailing list creation process- see
https://infra.apache.org/officers/mlreq

Determined that eve.apache.org, one of our Apple Xserves,
is no longer capable of productive service due to various
hardware faults.

Discussed acquiring additional "cloud" services for our
projects to use, ostensibly thru some unspecified bidding
process.  Nothing much came of it.

Approached by Dell regarding warranty renewal for selene
and phoebe (Geronimo TCK build farm).  We declined.

More discussion, much of it less than constructive, about
providing a digital signature service to Apache project
releases.

Worked out a deal with Calxeda to provide a few ARM-based
build servers for our projects to use (at no cost to us
other than admin time).

Granted Philip Martin of the Subversion project access to
eris (US svn server), mainly for his offer to help with some
svn server debugging.

Working with our main DNS provider no-ip.com to stabilize our
account services to better deal with the dozens of extra domains 
the AOO project needs us to host.  We've been getting gratis
service to this point, but we are willing to pay for better
responsiveness and additional features only available with a
paid support plan.

Discussed plans for an infra meetup to roughly coincide with
ACEU.

Work on the backup system migration from bia (in Los Angeles)
to abi (in Fort Lauderdale) is nearing completion.

Some progress was made on getting the number of outstanding
jira tickets down to normal levels.  We've reclassified tickets
based on whether they are "waiting for user" input or "waiting for
infra", which has helped, but the bulk of the open tickets still
are "waiting for infra".  We expect to continue to make progress
on this over the coming days and weeks, and will continue to report
on it until we are satisfied things have returned to an acceptable
state.

Daniel Gruno put together a nice comments service at comments.apache.org
for project websites to take advantage of.

Except for tasks performed after the first release as a top
level project, handover is now complete.

Issues
------
We have no issues requiring board attention at the moment.

Branding and Trademarks
-----------------------
The site has now been checked and updated against the
branding policy. In particular:
* Project Website Basics
* Website Navigation Links
* Trademark Attributions

Community
---------
Interest seems to be slowly building, which is encouraging.
We hope to focus on continuing to improve the documentation
and creating a first release for Apache Whisker.

Infrastructure
--------------
We are still trying to discover the best way to maintain
a mix of subsites generated by and hand maintained content
in Apache CMS. Thanks to Infrastructure for their help
and advice.

--------
None (yet). The last release happened while the project was
incubating: RAT 0.8 released in November 2011.

We hope to cut the first release of Apache Whisker very
soon.

Community Objectives
--------------------
* Improve quantity of documentation on site
* Release Apache Whisker 0.1

Attachment H: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using front-end programming APIs, like JAX-WS and 
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, 
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports 
such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.

Releases:
2.3.10
2.3.11  (*)
2.4.7
2.4.8
2.5.3
2.5.4
2.6.0
2.6.1

We announced to the community that 2.3.11 will be the last scheduled 
2.3.x release.

Apache CXF DOSGi 1.3.1 was released to correct some issues found with the 
OSGi compatibility tests.

Apache CXF Fediz - 1.0.0 released.  New subproject to implement WS-
Federation Passive Requestor Profile and claims based access control along 
with role based.


Committer/PMC - no new committers or PMC members this quarter.
Last committer added in Jan 2012
Last PMC added in Apr 2012


Community updates:
The community really came together nicely to get all the releases out the 
door.   It was a very busy quarter with many releases, including releases in 
both of CXF's sub-projects.    There has been quite a bit of discussions and 
issues on the mailing lists about the new Fediz release from people testing 
it and getting it to interoperate with other products.

From a community diversity standpoint, RedHat acquired FuseSource last 
month.   This changes the makeup of the PMC slightly as RedHat (the #3 
company by number of PMC members) acquired Fuse (#1 company).   RedHat now 
employs exactly 50% of the PMC (10 out of 20).  


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache DB Project

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:

 o JDO      : focused on building the JDO API and the TCK for
              compatibility testing of JDO implementations.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

== Status ==
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Activities over the last quarter, which has been very quiet for the PMC:
 1) Two students were selected for their GSoC 2012 proposals for Derby.
 2) Derby posted Maven artifacts for the latest release on
    repository.apache.org (people.a.o phased out).
 3) Issue regarding distribution of a file without redistribution rights in
    Derby has been addressed.

Outstanding work:
 a) Wrap up branding requirements compliance check.
 b) Address the svnpubsub migration for the web sites.

== Community ==
No PMC changes since August 2011.
No new committers since August 2010.

Traffic on the user lists is pretty low. User questions are generally being
answered. A few unanswered questions on one (very low-volume) list, will
follow up.

== Releases ==
Derby: feature release 10.9.1.0 (June 25, 2012)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Deltacloud Project

---------
No new committers

Releases/Development
--------------------

Release Deltacloud 1.0.0 on 2012-06-15

updates/improvements to various drivers (OpenStack, OpenNebula)

Major revamp of website to make it more accessible.

Lots of bug fixes and smaller improvements.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Directory Project

The Apache Directory Project provides directory solutions entirely written
in Java. These include a directory server, which has been certified as LDAP
v3 compliant by the Open Group (ApacheDS), Eclipse-based directory tools
(Apache Directory Studio) and a client API that can be used to communicate
with any directory server (Apache LDAP API).

-- Community --
* One new committer
 * Aleksander Adamowski (aadomowski)
* No new PMC members.

-- Development --

* Apache Directory LDAP API:
 * One new release during this quarter.
 * Important bug fixes in low level classes taking care of LDAP decoding and
entries handling.
 
* ApacheDS:
 * One new release during this quarter.
 * Work continued on our MVCC BTree branch and we're trying to merge it to
the current trunk, but the divergence since the branch was created (8 months
ago) makes it a little more complicated.
 * The removal of 2 unnecessary system indices has allowed us to boost the
search performance of ApacheDS by a 2x to 4x factor (depending on the type
of search). We're not back to the level of performance we had on versions
1.5.x but we're getting closer.
 * Bug fixes and small additions to previously released milestones versions.
 
* Apache Directory Studio:
 * No new releases during this quarter.
 * A discussion in a Jira issue raised the problem that Apache Directory
Studio contained sources of some classes released under the Eclipse Public
License (EPL). While it's OK to include a EPL binary (as a library for
example) in a release of an Apache project, it isn't the same for EPL source
files. We cleaned Apache Directory Studio sources and removed/rewrote any of
these files. The situation is now clear.
 * Minor bug fixes.
 
* Website:
- Work has started to migrate our website. Svnpubsub has been activated with
a staging website and we're in the process of migrating pages from
Confluence to SVN.

-- Releases --
* One release for Apache Directory LDAP API:
 * 1.0.0-M12 (May 11th 2012)
* One release for ApacheDS:
 * 2.0.0-M7 (May 21st 2012)
* No releases for Apache Directory Studio


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache ESME Project

Apache ESME's mission: Enterprise Social Messaging Environment (ESME) is a
secure and highly scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that
allows people to discover and meet one another and get controlled access
to other sources of information, all in a business process context.

Releases:
2011-08-29 1.3

Development:

We are continuing work on our 1.4 release.  We hope to focus on Akka
and Apache Camel integration.

The level of development activity has remained stable the last 3 months
We just had a few commits dealing with the 1.4 release. We
are trying to refresh the community with new developers but this is
proving more difficult than expected.

We started a mail thread about future developments of the project
which received a few responses but it looks like the project will
remain on the back-burner for a while. 

Community:
* No new committers
* No new PMC members.

Issues:
No Board level issues at this time

TRADEMARKS / BRANDING

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’s ATTENTION

None.

RELEASES

0.94.0, a major release, on May 2nd.

A release candidate for 0.92.2 was posted and retracted with
another candidate to follow.  0.94.1 and 0.90.7 release
candidates should be going up in the next week or so.

COMMITTERS

We changed our policy where a committer automatically was also
made a member of the PMC.  Now you become a committer first
and then after a period, you are invited by the PMC to become
a member.  The general consensus was that such a policy would
lower the barrier minting new hbase committers [1].

Nicolas Liochon (Scaled Risk) -- nkeywal@apache.org
Jimmy Xiang (Cloudera) -- jxiang@apache.org
Liyin Tang (Facebook) -- liyin@apache.com

Nicolas and Jimmy are committers only.  Liyin was the last to
make it as a committer+PMC member before the policy change.

COMMUNITY

We had our first hbase conference on May 22nd in San Francisco,
hbasecon [2].  It seems to have gone over well (600 attendees).

A Birds-of-a-feather session on the day after the hadoop summit
was less well attended, ~30 [3].

20 committers [4] (Was 17 in last report)

Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

This is the sixth Incubator report since we started putting more effort into
overseeing our podlings and keeping better track of their progress towards
graduation.

Over that time we had 51 podlings reporting twice on normal schedule. Of those
podlings, one was stuck at IP clearance, four continued without a release,
seven had a low level of activity for the whole quarter, and another seven
were in various other stages without significant progress towards graduation.
Many of these cases are already resolved, and the remaining are being looked
at in more detail.

Over the same six-month time period we saw thirteen projects graduate,
three retire, and five enter the Incubator as new podlings. There are
currently 49 podlings in the Incubator.

o Community

  Jörn Kottmann and Rich Bowen joined the Incubator PMC since our last report.

  The Lucene.Net podling is currently preparing for graduation.

  The following proposal for a new incubating project was accepted:

  - Apache Allura

  A proposal for a new project called Blur was brought up for discussion.

  Various inactive podlings are being retired. We decided to retire
  the Kato podling as mentioned in last month's report. This month
  both the AWF and Kitty podlings are being considered for retirement
  due to inactivity. See the relevant cursory reports for details.

  The proposed resolution to establish the Apache Steve project was briefly
  discussed, and the general consensus was that there is no specific need
  for the project to first go through incubation as the codebase and the
  development community around it already exists within the ASF.

  The role of a Sponsor, i.e. an existing TLP that plans to take a podling
  up as a subproject upon graduation, came up in discussion related to
  the EasyAnt podling. Such a role reflects the concept of an umbrella
  project and is thus no longer that relevant. Whether to discontinue or
  redefine the Sponsor role remains to be decided.

o Releases

  The following incubating releases were made since our last report:

  - June 21st, 2012: Apache Airavata 0.3-incubating
  - June 22nd, 2012: Apache Wookie 0.11.0-incubating
  - June 25th, 2012: Apache Syncope 1.0.0-RC2-incubating
  - June 27th, 2012: Apache Kafka 0.7.1-incubating
  - July  9th, 2012: Apache DirectMemory 0.1-incubating
  - July 10th, 2012: Apache Stanbol Entityhub 0.10.0-incubating

  In addition the release of Apache Any23 0.7.0-incubating is imminent,
  as the release vote has just passed.

o Legal / Trademarks

  The instructions on checking project names for suitability as trademarks are
  a bit inconsistent and partially outdated. We're working on fixing that.

o Infrastructure

  Some of the recently graduated podlings have had trouble clearly
  communicating to the infrastructure team everything that's needed
  for migrating project infrastructure to a TLP. We'll need to find a
  way to better instruct podlings on this as they prepare to graduate.

-------------------- Summary of podling reports --------------------

Still getting started at the Incubator (4 podlings)

  Allura, CloudStack, Crunch, cTAKES

  These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
  towards graduation is yet expected.

Not yet ready to graduate (12 podlings)

  No release:    Any23, Celix, JSPWiki, VXQuery
  Low activity:  AWF, DeviceMap, EasyAnt, Kitty, ODF Toolkit
  Low diversity: Chukwa, Mesos, Tashi

  We expect the next quarterly report of projects in this category to
  include a summary of their actions and progress in solving these issues.

Ready to graduate (3 podlings)

  DirectMemory, Kafka, Oozie

  We expect these projects to graduate within the next quarter.

--------------------
Allura

The Allura Project is forge software for the development of software projects,
including source control systems, issue tracking, discussion, wiki, and other
software project management tools. Allura entered incubation on 2012-06-25.

Allura only got its mailing lists a couple of hours ago. There is nothing
more to report yet.

Any23

Anything To Triples (any23) is a library, a web service and a command line
tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web
documents.

Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011.

Three most important steps moving towards graduation

  - Grow the Any23 PPMC and community
  - Ensure at least one Any23 release
  - Identify and liaise with other semantic web/linked data projects within
    the ASF to establish common goals and objectives.

The Any23 PPMC was delighted to extend an invitation to Peter Ansell during
June. The invitation was subsequently accepted and we are happy to say that
Peter is now on board.

During June/July the community has focused on constructing the 0.7.0-incubating
release candidate. We have experienced several problems along the way which
have delayed this significantly, however as of writing the community is now
VOTE'ing on the 0.7.0-incubating (release candidate #2) release thanks to
Simone Tripodi, we anticipate a release shortly. Since last reporting we have
integrated a number of commits to the project from a range of people. The
total number of commits sitting at >1174 since Any23 entered the Apache
Incubator.

The website at http://incubator.apache.org/any23/ is also up and functioning,
and appears to be in line with the Apache branding requirements.

Lewis John McGibbney worked with ASF infrastructure to get a zone VM up and
running to host the Any23 web service.

The community has again been in touch with members from Stanbol, Jena and
Clerezza and we have already discussed a committer meetup and liaison with
the aforementioned sister projects at the forthcoming ApacheCon Europe.

--------------------
Celix

Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.
Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.

Over the last months we have started working on "Native-OSGi" which is an
effort to make a specification for a C and C++ bases OSGi implementation. As
detailed in the graduation plan [1] in the previous report we hope to attract
more community members with this move. Details for Native-OSGi can be found
at [2].

Also the donation of the Device Access code has been finished and committed
to the SVN repository. This has been a good experience from both a technical
and a process point of view.

Furthermore there has been a slight increase on the mailing list, hopefully
this is a trend that will continue in the coming months.

Most important issues to address before we can graduate:

  Make a first release and grow a larger community. It is also needed to
  attract some more committers, there are currently 2.

Any issues the Incubator PMC or ASF board need to be aware of:

  None at this time

How has the community developed since the last report:

  There has been an increase on the mailing list, furthermore with the start
  of the Native-OSGi project we hope this will increase in the coming months.

How has the project developed since the last report:

  From a technical point of view, we are working towards a first release.
  The build files have been updated to support a more modular project
  structure. Since the implementation is moving forward (al be it slowly),
  the community growth is the biggest concern for Celix.

Chukwa

Chukwa is an open source data collection system for monitoring large
distributed systems. Chukwa is built on top of the Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS), HBase and Map/Reduce framework and inherits Hadoop’s
scalability and robustness. Chukwa also includes a flexible and powerful
toolkit for displaying, monitoring and analyzing results to make the best
use of the collected data.

  - Mailing list is picking up some activities.
  - 3 new contributors submitted patches since last report in April.

Most important issues to address:

  Growing the community, especially attracting new developers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report:

  Plan to release version 0.6 to fix some of the major bugs in version 0.5.

How has the project developed since the last report:

  Prior to Hadoop summit, there was a thread discussion of retiring Chukwa
  because there does not seem to be much activity in the community.  All PPMC
  members seem to agree to this idea.  There were some free advertisement for
  Chukwa in Hadoop summit from word of mouth and speakers mentioned Chukwa in
  their talks.  There seems to be some contribution activities happening
  after Hadoop summit.  Discussion continued for retiring Chukwa because
  mentor does not think a community is developing.  We plan to open enrollment
  for Chukwa committers for people who are interested to continue development
  for the next quarter.  If activities generate a active community, then we
  will apply for becoming top level project.  If no activities happen, then
  we will retire Chukwa.

--------------------
CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration
platform. CloudStack has been in incubation since 2012-04-16

The top 3 issues to address to move towards graduation:

  - CloudStack's source still contains works that are prohibited for release
    under ASF guidelines
  - Performing a release
  - Migration of infrastructure (bug tracker, CI, websites, etc)

How has the community developed since the last report:

  As of the time of this report at least one new committer has been added.
  Additionally, a number of previously unknown developers have begun making
  substantial quantities of bug fixes and even working on new functionality.

How has the project developed since the last report:

  The project itself continues to deal with process questions as well as
  learning how to operate in the new environment. A good deal of work has
  been happening on resolving the problems in the code base around licensing,
  though not currently close to finishing.

--------------------
Crunch

Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running pipelines of
MapReduce jobs on Apache Hadoop.

Crunch entered incubation on May 27, 2012.

The most important steps towards graduation:

  - Infrastructure setup (JIRA, Confluence, etc.)
  - CCLA licensing of the existing Crunch code
  - Adding new contributors
  - Creating a release

Nothing that currently requires IPMC attention.

Community:

  The developer mailing list has been very active with bug fixes, new
  features, and discussions of infrastructure setup and project policies,
  both from the existing committers and other developers with an interest in
  the project. The first patch from a non-committer is currently being
  prepared for submission: the code is written, but we were blocking on
  getting JIRA setup so that the copyright on the code could cleanly be
  assigned to the ASF. The JIRA issues were resolved earlier this week.

  All ICLAs are in place. Cloudera has gathered all of the copyright
  assignments for the existing Crunch code from non-Cloudera developers
  and is preparing the CCLA to assign the copyrights on the existing Crunch
  code to the ASF.

Development:

  The 15 commits on the project this month were primarily for documentation
  and bug fixes, although we are evaluating two larger patches that bring
  additional functionality to the library: 1) adding map-side joins and
  2) supporting interactive pipeline creation and execution via the Scala REPL.

cTAKES

cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) is a natural
language processing (NLP) tool for information extraction from electronic
medical record clinical free-text.

cTAKES was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on Monday, June 11, 2012.

Three most important steps moving towards graduation

  - Attract new contributors
  - Make at least one cTAKES release
  - Get everyone's ICLA on file and start developing code at Apache and using
    the infrastructure

Anything required IPMC attention?

  No

Community:

  We are still wrapping up getting a few ICLAs for Guergana Savova and for
  Sean Finan. So far, little mailing list discussion, but the project is
  getting bootstrapped. The next step will be to start developing on list
  and getting the project going.

  Jörn Kottmann who originally volunteered to Champion the project, was
  elected to the IPMC and can now officially be our Champion. Congrats Jörn!

  The light discussion on the mailing list is because there will be another
  release on the old sourceforge site before the migration to the apache svn
  and name space updates.

Development:

  So far, nothing much other than getting mailing lists set up, and other
  infrastructure tasks that can be tracked at:

DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images
and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.
smartphones and tablets.

Entered incubation on January 3rd, 2012.

There are no issues that require the Incubator PMC's or the board's attention.

Little has happened since our last report in April, a prototype of client-side
device probes has been created [1], a few messages have been exchanged about
that but that's all.

At this point the future of the project is unclear, we should re-evaluate the
situation for the next report in October to see if activity has picked up.

DirectMemory

(incubating since October 2011)

Apache DirectMemory is a multi layered cache implementation featuring
off-heap memory management (a-la BigMemory) to enable efficient handling
of a large number of java objects without affecting JVM garbage collection
performance.

There is only one important issue to address in the move towards graduation

  Understanding process/decision making guidelines (new committer process
  is undergoing testing, release process still yet to be worked out)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of

  None

How has the community developed since the last report

  Tasks and proposals contributed by non-committers

How has the project developed since the last report.

  - A first public release 0.1-incubating has been done.

EasyAnt

EasyAnt is a build system based on Apache Ant and Apache Ivy.
Incubating since 2011-01-31.

Towards graduation, we need to:

  - Create a release
  - Build a community

Since the last report:

  There was very low activity on the project. There was actually no commit on
  the project. Some work has been done though a bug was found on a dependency,
  Apache Ant, and a bug was reported, and a patch committed since one of the
  EasyAnt committer happens to have commit rights there.

  After acknowledging this, a mail was sent on the dev mailing to re-motivate
  people to focus on doing a release. A positive response and some commits
  were following.

JSPWiki

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

Still following the objective of making the first Apache release:

  4 JIRA issues were fixed since last period, the project website has been
  revamped, and few other niceties & fixes have got into trunk (for example
  lucene library was upgraded to 3.6.0).

  2 Release candidates have been made, but they didn't succeed because of
  technical issues. Hopefully the third RC will become the first ASF release.

The main issues blocking graduation keep being the same as in the last report:
resolution acceptance, community and IPMC graduation vote.

Kafka

(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011)

Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe
messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence
of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the
message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading
data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  None.

  Previously, there was some concern about the diversity of the project
  that we believe has been addressed:

  - The project now has active committers from four companies
  - and continues to receive patches from other contributors from various
    institutions.

  We are considering whether to pursue graduation immediately or focus
  exclusively on the development of 0.8.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report:

  - The mailing list continues to be very active with bug reports, patch
    submissions, feature requests and use cases.
    [(Apr,May,Jun): kafka-users (151, 261, 251); kafka-dev (142, 195, 380)].

  - Added two new committers.

  - Conducted the first Kafka user group meeting with over 50 attendees
    (archived video link available here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+papers+and+presentations).
    This was a very successful event that gave users and contributors an
    opportunity to meet and discuss Kafka usage at various companies, ongoing
    development efforts, feature requests, etc.

  - Received and reviewed several major patches (including contributions from
    non-committers).

How has the project developed since the last report:

  - Intra-cluster replication (KAFKA-50)
    - Considerable progress has been made on the design and implementation of
      this much-anticipated feature.
    - Regular status updates are being sent out on the kafka-dev mailing list.

  - Another significant project that is under discussion and development is
    the consumer redesign (KAFKA-364) and consumer coordinator implementation
    (KAFKA-264).

  - Released Kafka 0.7.1 in June. This is the second Kafka release since its
    introduction to Apache incubator

Progress since the last report:

  - Released 0.9.0!
  - Added support for Hadoop CDH3u3 and updated the tutorial.
  - Revamped MPI framework support (thanks Harvey Feng!).
  - New JS based web interface (thanks Jon Fuchs!).
  - Initial cgroups abstractions/interfaces for better resource isolation
    on Linux (thanks Jie Yu!).
  - Refactor of allocator for more sophisticated allocations
    (thanks Thomas Marshall!).
  - Numerous bug fixes (FD_CLOEXEC, JSON escaping, killtree.sh issues, etc).

Top priorities prior to graduation:

  - Same as before, finalize addition of new committers to the project!
  - Do another release.

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

  - None at this time.

scanning and manipulation of OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF)
documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation of
heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit is
lightweight and ideal for server use.

ODF Toolkit entered incubation on Aug 1st, 2011.
Our last release was January 14th, 2012.
We voted in our most recent committer on November 16th, 2011.

Most important issues to address:

  Growing the community, especially attracting new developers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report:

  - We are mentoring two GSoC students on ODF- Toolkit related projects

  - One of our leading developers has had a job change and is no longer

  - Automate the formal release process.
  - Diversify the dev and committer base.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  No issues.

How has the community developed since the last report:

  - 103 JIRAs were created since last report.
  - Oozie dev/users are active in the email lists (around 1000 emails in
    oozie-dev and 250+ in oozie-user).
  - Around 6 new developers are contributing to the process and coding.

How has the project developed since the last report.

  - The second Oozie release (3.2.0) from Apache incubator has been
    successfully accomplished.

  - A lot of new features are added. Fixed a lot of bugs too. Nearly 230
    JIRAs were closed/resolved in last three months.

  - Oozie contribution process in now more stream-lined. Further improvement
    is going on.

--------------------
Tashi

Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.

The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud
computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data).
The idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big
Data that are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared,
manipulated, and computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient,
and safe manner.

Tashi originally encompassed just the tools to manage virtual machines
using Xen and QEMU, but has been merged with Zoni, which manages the
physical aspects of a cluster like power control, network settings and
handing out physical machines.

In the period from April to July, the project did not ask to make
another incubating release, but is ready to start the process for a new
release incorporating the development efforts of this period.

Development efforts this period have included making user actions
display assurance messages via the client in case of successful
operations, extending the SQL database backend to support all Instance
and Host fields that are already recorded via the alternative "pickled"
backend.

The primitive scheduler gained additional resilience to refrain from
scheduling load on hosts that are down transiently. The node manager
service now tries to ensure that undelivered messages to the cluster
manager are resubmitted regularly. Virtual machine migration was revised
to ensure stale state wasn't being shadowed by new data, only to
reappear when the migrated VM was shut down.

The code underwent a complete automatic analysis, fixing several issues.
Furthermore, a few other minor additions, fixes and documentation
updates were made.

The project has received code contributions from two non-committers in
this period. MIMOS via Luke Jing Yuan have contributed "convertz" to the
code base, a utility to convert a VM image to an image deployable to a
physical machine provisioned by Zoni. Alexey Tumanov of CMU provided a
communications timeout wrapper to handle the problem of threads hanging
forever, trying to communicate over a broken network connection.

Upcoming software goals are to separate the client into an
administrative and a user interface, to investigate what is needed to
support IPv6, replace RPyC, and to provide the ability to hand out
server slices (operating system level virtualization). Besides CPU and
memory, disk storage should also be a schedulable resource.

The project has a user community, but it is small. Growth mostly has
happened by word of mouth. To show potential users at large the utility
of this project, the author of this report is creating web pages to
demonstrate how to accomplish distributed computing tasks. Base images
of (free) OS installs will be provided to allow new users to get started
quickly. Hopefully this will increase visibility of the project.

Items to be resolved before graduation:

  - Generate more publicity for the project.
  - Develop members of the user community to submit feature extensions.

VXQuery

The VXQuery Project implements a standard compliant XML Query
processor for parallel evaluation.
It has been in incubation since 2009-07-06.

VXQuery changed its focus from being a pure library implementation
of XQuery in Java to being an engine for parallel XQuery evaluation.
For the runtime VXQuery now leverages the Hyracks system which is
an Apache-licensed parallel execution engine developed at UCI.

So far the top issues were

  1) low activity
  2) small community
  3) create a release.

The activities on these issues are:

  ad 1)
  Since this change of focus - and the start of a GSoC project with
  this new focus - development activity has picked up significantly.
  This due to both activity of the GSoC student (Preston Carman) and
  of the existing committers.

  ad 2)
  Preston Carman a) has provided good patches for VXQuery and
  b) interacts very well with the existing community.
  Consequently he is a candidate to be the next committer for VXQuery.
  After the initial vote on vxquery-private failed (all committers
  voted +1, but there was no mentor/IPMC member vote), Jukka Zitting
  voted +1. The next step is to finalize the administrative part to
  make Preston a committer.

  Further, there is a plan to publish a  paper to show the projects
  utility and to increase the visibility of the incubation effort.

  ad 3)
  After the change of focus some things work, but not enough to
  build a release that is easily consumable. VXQuery should be
  released before a paper is published to enable readers or the
  paper to run the software.

Attachment T: Status report for the Apache James Project

The Apache James Project delivers a rich set of open source modules
and libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which build
into an advanced enterprise mail server.

ISSUES

There are no issue requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

We regularly see users coming with questions on our latest mail
Server 3.0-beta4. This gives opportunity to fix the last bits.

Some users also show they develop with our Mailbox framework
their custom implementation integrated in the Server. This is
great as James is chosen as a development Mail server platform.

Some work has been done on Apache James Postage (now uses maven and
upgrade from server 2.3 to server 3) and a new module (mbox-iterator)
has been added to Apache James Mime4J.

Documentation has been further refined but we still need to continue
working on it to keep it updated and give all useful information to
users and developers.

Manolo has deployed a Hupa demo (WebMail) on http://james.zones.apache.org.

Our website is now published via svnpubsub. We made an attempt to
use the Apache CMS but this is still under investigation.

COMMUNITY

PMC Chair has been handed-over from Norman Maurer to Eric Charles.

Ioan Eugen Stan has been voted as new PMC member.

Two GSoC projects are on their way:
- Hupa Evolution (Echo).
- Distributed mailbox indexing over HBase/HDFS (Mihai Soloi).

Ioan has given a presentation on Apache James Mailbox at BerlinBuzzWords 2012.

RELEASES

We did the following releases during this period:

* Apache James Hupa 0.2 (Hupa is a Web mail interface developed in GWT)

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Mahout Project

Apache Mahout provides implementations of machine learning algorithms 
(collaborative filtering, clustering, classification, and more) for 
large-scale data, mostly via Hadoop-based implementations.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Activity has remained high during the past 3 months. We completed our
0.7 release on June 16th that closed 63 JIRA issues.

The user@mahout.a.o mailing list has 1379 current subscribers

Now we are embarked upon a new 0.8 release. A goal of 0.8
is to continue clean up of existing functionality to improve 
consistency and improve user experience. In this release, some
new additions to Mahout functionality are also planned.

Code freeze for 0.8 is targeted for Nov 15.

A 1.0 release is not yet on the horizon.

COMMUNITY

We have no new committers since our April report.

Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache ManifoldCF Project

ManifoldCF PMC Chair: Karl Wright (kwright@apache.org)
Date: July 2012

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum,
to target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer
or ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security
policies.

Milestones
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012, one day
after the latest major release on May 15, 2012.  Since then, there has
been a limited point release as well (on May 22, 2012), and the next major
software release is planned for the first two weeks of July.

Mailing list activity
==============

The mailing lists have been relatively quiet for the latter part of June.
Vacation time has started in Europe and this has reduced MCF's dev and
user list activity, as it always does.

There has been some activity following up on the SharePoint 2010 issues
and the session-based web crawling.  Also, dev list discussion has taken
place about how to store exported configuration information securely, and
invaluable testing contributions made by certain individuals who work for
qBase, Inc., who donated their time to this endeavor to further the
project.

I am unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.

Committer and PMC membership
========================

The last new committer signed on was in February, 2012.  Since then we've
had a number of offers for contribution from outside the community but
insufficient demonstrated commitment to offer committership or PMC
membership to any individual.  We are actively working to have a broader
committer base, as always, and try to maintain an encouraging attitude
towards new contributors.

Branding
======

We are aware of no current violations of the Apache ManifoldCF brand.

Legal
====

The only outstanding legal issue we had pertained to how we interface to
.NET services.  The ticket was LEGAL-137, which has now been resolved.  As
a result, ManifoldCF trunk code has been updated accordingly.

Infrastructure
==========

All infrastructure issues related to graduation have been satisfactorily
resolved.  The build and release process has been successfully updated
(CONNECTORS-474) to take into account Apache requirements for availability
of proprietary software to release engineers.

We are no longer using any Incubator resources.

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop 
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality 
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can 
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is 
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify 
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system. 

RELEASES 
* The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 0.9.0-incubating, released on 
May 12, 2012 while in Incubation. 
* No new releases are planned currently for the project.

Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Nutch Project

DESCRIPTION

Apache Nutch is an open source web-search software project. Stemming from Apache
Lucene, it now builds on Apache Solr adding web-specifics, such as a crawler, a
link-graph database and parsing support handled by Apache Tika for HTML and an
array of other document formats.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

We have been very active lately. Nutch 1.5 has been released since the last 
report and we have just released 1.5.1 which addresses some blocking issues 
in 1.5.  We have also released Nutch 2.0 on the 7th July which is a major 
milestone. We are working on a press announcement with Sally.

The Apache Nutch PMC has voted Sebastian Nagel to become a Nutch committer and 
PMC member in April.

COMMUNITY

The traffic on the user and dev mailing lists has kept a relatively high level
in the last quarter. There have not been any meetings or talks related to 
Nutch since the previous report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache ODE Project

DESCRIPTION

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes 
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services, 
sending and receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error 
recovery as described by your process definition. It supports both long 
and short living process executions to orchestrate all the services that 
are part of your application. 

STATUS

This was again a quiet development period. We still have some 
development items on our agenda, e.g. the OModel refactoring, 
backporting features from our experimental branch. We have started to 
work on both, web site migration to Apache CMS and a cutting maintenance 
release, which will fix a small number of minor bugs but will also bring 
back compatibility to recent ServiceMix versions. 

RELEASE

No release to report in this quarter.

DEVELOPMENT

No significant progress to report. Unfortunately the GSoC had to 
withdraw his application due to personal reasons. 

COMMUNITY

Nothing significant to report.

PROJECT BRANDING BOARD REPORT CHECKLIST

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

Apache OpenEJB is an enterprise application containers and object
distribution services based on, the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and
Java Enterprise Edition Web Profile.

Major event for the quarter was the long awaited release of OpenEJB 4.0.0
final and TomEE 1.0.0 final on April 30th.  Foundation announcement made with
the great might of Sally, as usual.  We had the highest website traffic of
all time for the following two weeks.  Thanks so much to everyone who has
helped with that undertaking.

Primary activity has been on keeping up with the flood of issues reported and
user requests.  Feature development around a console for TomEE, ways to
improve migration and a new multicast server discovery approach have also
been focal points.

Effort to release OpenEJB 4.1.0 and TomEE 1.1.0 has just begun and will
likely be the focus of the next several weeks.  Further effort to "tool" the
release process has been undertaken including a tool to create a jira issue
with several subtasks.  The goal being to better document and spread out
release tasks.  We might have something to share there at some point.

The Infra anonymous edit feature for the CMS has been a boon for the project.
The feature coupled with a nice javascript-powered edit button on nearly
every page has dramatically improved user contribution to the
documentation/website.  We've had at least 4 different users contribute to
the documentation over the last two weeks or so, which is about 4 times as
many as we had with Confluence.  One of them as started contributing code.
We strongly encourage other projects to add this to their quiver of power
tools.

Potential concern was raised on running the JavaEE TCK on Amazon-controlled
hardware (EC2) [1].  The concern was subsided, but we bring it to the board's
attention for maximum transparency as we have done since the start of our EC2
usage.  Were we to not use EC2 for TCK testing we would need dedicated
hardware for the task. It wouldn't be quite as much as Geronimo, but would be
in that ballpark.

Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache PDFBox Project

The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF
documents.


General Comments
----------------

There are no issues that require Board attention.

Community
---------

There is a steady stream of contributions and bug reports from the
community.
Wolfgang Glas offered to contribute some code to improve the unicode support
when creating documents, one of the most asked features.

Releases
--------

PDFBox 1.7.0 was released on 29 May 2012

We didn't officially release preflight and xmpbox, as the refactoring isn't 
finished yet. We didn't remove the source but disabled the maven build for it.

We are planning to cut a 1.7.1 bug fix release in the near future.

Development:
------------

The development on the next release is still in progress. We are currently
working on

- improved font handling
- improved rendering
- refactoring + improved integration of preflight
- bug fixing

We just started a discussion on how to proceed with the next release(s), it
looks like the next release will probably be a major one. 

The new conforming parser works well and will replace the old one at least
in the next major release.

Eric and Guillaume are making progress on the refactoring of preflight and 
xmpbox.

Apache Struts is an action-based Java web application framework.

The Struts team made two releases in the last quarter, both of which
addressed feature enhancements and bug fixes:
* Struts 2.3.2
* Struts 2.3.4

We have been approached with two minor security issues in the last

Attachment AO: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and great performance.

We've had a bug fix release on the 5.3 branch that addressed some broken
functionality and enhanced performance, especially under very heavy load. A
further bug fix release is currently being voted on.

Tapestry switched to Git as its source code repository, and that has greatly
enhanced our ability to backport fixes from the master development branch to
the 5.3 branch. This is a great service for our user community.

In the master branch (which will be 5.4), work is well underway on significant
improvements to Tapestry's JavaScript support on both the client and the
server.

There have been some interesting releases of late from the community:
* Portlet support
* jQuery integration
* Twitter Bootstrap integration
* cometd integration
* Highcharts integration (client-side JavaScript charting)
* ... and several more.

Mailing list traffic seems to be in the summer doldrums, but still running
around 1000 messages per month.

We are considering options for documentation, given that the Confluence Wiki
approach we currently use is being end-of-lifed.

Server developers will be there, and we look forward to meet many of our
users.


Releases
========

Three releases have been made since the last status report:

    3.2.0           - Our latest, greatest stable release
    3.0.5           - Patch release for our 3.0.x stable release
    3.1.4           - The final development release before 3.2.0.

A press announcement was made for the v3.2.0 release, for more details see

  https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/media_alert_the_apache_software2

Many thanks to Sally and the PR team for helping us with this milestone
release. A year in the making, v3.2.0 fixes hundreds of bugs and adds many
significant new features.

Development on the v3.3.0 branch has begun already, and we will use the
OSCON sessions to work on several interesting new projects. Of particular
interest is the new Lua plugin, which will (hopefully) make it into either
v3.3.0 or v3.3.1.

Attachment AV: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

About XMLBeans:
XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a
Java friendly way. The idea is that you can take advantage of the
richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features
mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and
typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces
and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance
data.

XMLBeans missed the reports to the board since March, I'm fully
responsible for this.

For the last six months, the traffic on mailing list went down with the
exception of this month. The traffic in the last month is due to the
proposed new release, release candidate 2 is already out 3 should come
soon. Our last release was more than one year ago.

Even though the traffic is low, there are non-committer people
participating on the mailing list and even submitting patches.

The involvement of many XMLBeans committers is very low or absent for
the last six months. We're looking to attract new committers, I hope
we'll have at least one proposal soon. There were no changes in PMC or
new committers since last report.

There are no other issues requiring board's attention.
