 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       No report was submitted.

    B. President [Jim]

       No report was submitted.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       It's been a busy month for the Treasurer, hence the late report.
       Most of the business has had to do with various odds and ends for
       ApacheCon EU 2012 but the good news is that it's all been really
       positive and it looks like there is a ton of progress. Treasurer
       is servicing bill pay/EFT and so far so good for payments on-time,
       and other such things.

       Chris is set up with WFS and has received his token to get online
       (thanks Sam). PayPal is set up for Chris as well so full required
       access is available for Chris to lead some of the things like EFTs
       and Wires which he was previously unable to complete (thanks again
       to Sam there).  Chris probably does need some training from Sam in
       the EFT/Wire area, and Sam has agreed to spend an hour or two
       providing it to him at some point in the next month.

       We need to transfer the Bill pay access control from Geir to Chris
       at some point soon. Chris has reached out to Geir but hasn't heard
       back on that front yet. Sam and Chris also discussed our current
       system of 1 other person acknowledging an EFT/Wire as something
       that is a current SPOF and that should be addressed at some point
       in the future.

       There was discussion on 10/4 about PayPal pass through insurance
       and on PayPal not being insured by the FDIC [2]. No specific actions
       came from the discussion.

       Chris talked to Hadrian on a telecon announced on treasurer@ to
       discuss audit and to bring Hadrian up to speed on the goings on
       since Chris took over as Treasurer on 10/5. No specific actions or
       outcomes came from the discussion.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       September was another uneventful month for secretary@. 
       56 ICLAs, four grants, and one CCLA were received and filed.
       As part of the process, 11 account requests were filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       ACEU is still requiring close attention. Mostly I'm operating
       as a member of ConCom but I did make a request, copied to
       board@, for more clarity in the budget control processes. I
       finally have a contract from The Open Bastion, yet to be
       signed. Since the event is now closing in on being sold out I'm
       looking into providing additional on-site support for the
       volunteers as the "bare bones" plan of self-organisation will
       not work with the numbers that will be present. There should be
       plenty of budget available to cover this, but first we need
       clarity on the current budget position.

       There was one request (from VP Concom) for travel expenses with
       only a couple of hours notice. In the Presidents absence I
       approved the request as it was a small amount and would clearly
       benefit ACEU. I still have not drafted the policy for travel
       expenses.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       Nothing particular to report, beyond that I will act as the
       meeting Chair for this month.

Operations And Community
========================

Approved several new name searches for podlings readying for graduation;
the new energy in the incubator is certainly helping with podlings being
more organized on the branding front.

External Requests

Responded to a higher number of third party requests this month, nothing
unusual.

Signed an agreement for use of one of our project marks in a major
television series after working with counsel to update the agreement to
something suitable.

OpenOffice.org trademark registrations in Taiwan are recorded as being
transferred to us.  We plan to work with DLAPiper to record transfers in
major markets where the pro bono rates make sense for the relevant projects.

Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
=======

No changes to the committee this month.
The list has been fairly quiet but with some ApacheCon EU/US discussions.

ApacheCon EU 2012 November
==========================

Most flights/hotels/etc have been paid for for those that are coming.
Some final pieces to tie up but looking good.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Accumulo Project

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Releases
There have been no releases since the last report.

Activity
The mailing list activity has been steady and there has been an increase
to 192 subscribers to the user list and 139 subscribers to the dev list.
Development is active and major features are still being added to the
trunk (1.5 branch).

Community
Josh Elser added as a new committer 07/26/2012.
Bill Slacum added as a new committer 07/31/2012.
Christopher Tubbs added as a new committer 09/18/2012.
Dave Marion added as a new committer 09/18/2012.

The PMC voted on 08/07/2012 that all current and future committers should
be invited to be PMC members.

In addition to the new committers, there has been an increase in community
diversity as three committers from the same organization (NSA) have moved
to two different organizations (Sqrrl and Hortonworks).

Issues
It is still uncertain whether the bill affecting Accumulo will be passed
in the Senate (see Section 929 of [1]).  There has been no further
activity or press since the Wired article [2] that came out in July just
after our last board report.  Most articles focus on other controversial
aspects of the 2013 NDAA.

and fast and all associated tasks have been completed within 2 days of the
board resolution.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Aries Project

Apache Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

== Releases ==

Several release vote threads during the last three months saw the release of
88 bundles at version 1.0. These can be found from the downloads link on the
Aries home page. Subsequently, the following micro version update bundles
have been released:

Many thanks to the release managers for their persistence in getting these
important releases out.

== Project Branding Board Report Checklist ==

* Project Website Basics : homepage is aries.apache.org (done)
* Project Naming And Descriptions : use proper Apache forms, describe
  product, etc. (pending)

  (pending)
* Project Metadata : DOAP file checked in and up to date (done)

== Community update ==

Jeremias Maerki has proposed, and posted a patch for, an addition to the
spi-fly module called SPI Catcher. Its objective is along the lines of the
OSGi Connect work in the OSGi Alliance to make it easier to get started with
OSGi dynamic services technology. The SPI Catch approach is complementary by
introducing OSGi APIs much later, if at all, ensuring "runnability totally
outside of OSGi" is preserved.

No new committers since the last report. The user/dev lists and JIRAs have
had some varied discussions across the Aries modules.

There are no board level issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Attic Project

No issues requiring board attention since the last report. Harmony has
now fully migrated to the Attic, XIndice is on its way. We still need
to start working on bringing the XML project as a whole to the Attic.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Avro Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using front-end programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports
such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.

Releases of CXF:
2.4.9
2.4.10  (*)
2.5.5
2.5.6
2.6.2
2.6.3
2.7.0

(*) We announced to the community that 2.4.10 will be the last scheduled
2.4.x release.

Apache CXF Fediz subproject - 1.0.1 released.

Committer/PMC - no new committers or PMC members this quarter.

Community updates:
The community really came together nicely to get all the releases out
the door.  Lots of traffic on the various mailing lists.

Security updates:
During the period, we dealt with 2 security vulnerability reports.   The
first turned out to just be a poorly configured example and not a real
security problem with the CXF code itself.   The second did get a CVE
assigned, CVE-2012-3451, and much work was done to address it.  This
was fixed and announced as well as added to our advisory page:

http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.html


Infrastructure update:
During the period, CXF has completely switched over to using svnpubsub
for both the web site (buildbot build pulling data from confluence) and
for the release distributions.   CXF has been using Nexus for a long
time.  We believe we are now in compliance with all the requirements
Infrastructure has mandated that will go into effect in January.


-----------------------------------------

e) Torque released version 4.0beta1.
f) Derby is working on a 10.8 maintenance release.
g) Derby is working on a 10.9 maintenance release.
h) An informal Derby-lunch was held in San Francisco, allowing those
   interested and being able to to meet up over their lunch-boxes :)

=== Community ===
No PMC changes since August 2011.
No new committers since August 2010.
The above facts caused the board to inquiry about the situation. A reply [1]
was compiled after gathering feedback from the PMC. The PMC is aware of
the situation, but doesn't consider it as a reason for major concern.

This quarter was somewhat more lively for some of the subprojects, with
a moderate increase on the user and/or dev lists.

=== Releases ===
Torque: beta feature release 4.0beta1 (September 24, 2012)

Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Deltacloud Project

Deltacloud defines a web service API for interacting with cloud service
providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In addition, it
consists of a number of implementations of this API for the most popular
clouds. It also provides an implementation of DMTF CIMI, and tools around
that API to help make it more easily consumable.

There are no issues for board consideration.

Community
---------

Voted Tomas Sedovic <tsedovic@redhat.com> as committer (mostly for
maintaining the Python client). Still need to get him fully set up as
committer.

Releases/Development
--------------------

Switched to a model with the goal to make one release every month.

1.0.4 - any day now
1.0.3 - 2012-09-07
1.0.2 - 2012-08-20

Work on DMTF CIMI front-end continues to progress. Updates/improvements
to various drivers (OpenStack, OpenNebula). New driver for aruba.it.
Lots of bug fixes and smaller improvements.

Attachment K: Status report for the Apache DirectMemory Project

Apache DirectMemory is an off-heap cache implementation for the JVM. It
features direct memory management (a-la BigMemory) to enable efficient
handling of a large number of Java objects without affecting JVM garbage
collection performance.

Community interest has increased since TLP graduation, we are receiving
interesting contributions on the mailing list. A proposal to join forces
with another interesting although young project (the lightning serializer)
has been accepted by the author and it is going to be defined as a
subproject.  Synergies with other projects are being explored too (kryo, another
serializer, at the end DirectMemory is all about serializing objects in
off-heap memory and back).

We are probably better defining the technical direction of the project even
though there's still plenty of work to do.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Directory Project

The Apache Directory Project provides directory solutions entirely written

After discussion up on the dev list, we introduced the notion of an
'owner' role. "Owners are volunteers who are (usually, but not necessarily)
expert in a component domain and may have an agenda on how they think
their HBase component should evolve." Owners will try and review patches
that fall within their domain and if an agenda will publish it.  See

Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The biggest news this month is that of the OpenOffice project,
along with Cordova and Isis, becoming ready to graduate from
the Incubator. As noted below, we feel that these projects are
capable of governing themselves as standalone TLPs according
to Apache policies and the Apache Way, and recommend the board
to accept the respective resolutions.

In other news, Jukka Zitting announced his intention to resign
as the IPMC chair due to changes in personal life. Discussion
about and nominations for the next IPMC chair are open, and we
expect to have a related resolution ready in time for the
November board meeting.

o Community

  There were no changes to the Incubator PMC since our last report.
  The IPMC currently has 168 members.

  The following podlings are requesting graduation to Apache TLPs:

  - Apache Cordova
  - Apache Isis
  - Apache OpenOffice

  The Incubator PMC recommends the board to accept the respective resolutions.

  The following proposals for new incubating projects are being voted on:

  - Apache Helix
  - Apache Ripple

  In addition there seems to be some interest in reviving the earlier idea of
  bringing the BeanShell project (http://beanshell.org/) to the ASF through
  the Incubator.

  Meanwhile the AWF podling was retired due to inactivity, and the Kitty
  podling is voting to retire itself for the same reason.

  JSPWiki is our oldest podling with over five years in the Incubator.
  Activity in JSPWiki was very low for a few years and they've yet to
  create their first Apache release. Earlier this year they discussed
  leaving the Incubator and the ASF since they clearly weren't making
  much progress. That discussion led to some revival of activity and
  the decision to continue in the Incubator. Unfortunately the podling
  no longer has enough active mentors, which has led to some trouble
  with premature attempts at cutting releases or graduating. Despite
  these troubles the podling is making progress, and with sufficient
  help from the IPMC they might well become ready to graduate within
  a few quarters.

o Releases

  The following incubating releases were made since our last report:

  - September 20th, 2012: Apache Crunch 0.3.0-incubating
  - September 24th, 2012: Apache Ambari 0.9-incubating
  - October 1st, 2012: Apache Cordova 2.1.0-incubating
  - October 8th, 2012: Apache Syncope 1.0.2-incubating
  - October 12th, 2012: Apache Kafka 0.7.2-incubating

  The Wookie podling has an open crypto export issue that's blocking
  their release. Since it looks like the issue can be resolved in time
  and the podling can demonstrate ability to cut releases, they can
  proceed towards graduation already before the resolution of that issue.

  We discussed key signing and various ways of getting more podling
  release managers into the Apache web of trust. No concrete actions
  have yet come out of that discussion, but there's been plenty of
  good ideas that may end up being implemented after a while.

o Legal / Trademarks

  The DeviceMap podling encountered a tricky issue with unclear
  ownership of a data file they planned to use. The resolution for
  now is to steer clear of trouble by not including that file.
  See the DeviceMap report and the mentioned issue for more details.

  A somewhat related question came up from CloudStack about how to
  handle files that we can't redistribute due to upstream licensing
  or Apache policies. They had a few such files in imported version
  history, and the consensus was that it's fine as long as such files
  are removed from the heads of all active branches (so they won't be
  included in releases) and that there's no need to modify older
  revisions as long as something like that is not explicitly requested.

o Infrastructure

  The infra team started looking at ways to streamline the various
  tasks related to podling setup and graduation. In practice this
  would mean making podling infra resemble more that of a standalone
  TLP (for example with separate podling.incubator.apache.org or even
  podling.apache.org domains), which seems like a reasonable thing
  to do as long as the incubation disclaimers remain prominent.

-------------------- Summary of podling reports --------------------

Still getting started at the Incubator (2 podlings)

  Blur, Drill

  These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
  towards graduation is yet expected.

Not yet ready to graduate (11 podlings)

  No release:    Celix, Cloudstack, JSPWiki, VXQuery
  Low activity:  Chukwa, DeviceMap, Kitty, Tashi
  Low diversity: EasyAnt, Mesos, ODF Toolkit

  We expect the next quarterly report of projects in this category to
  include a summary of their actions and progress in solving these issues.

Ready to graduate (1 podling)

  Kafka

  We expect this project to graduate within the next quarter.

Blur

(incubating since August 2012)

Apache Blur is a search platform capable of searching massive amounts of
data in a cloud computing environment.

Issues needing Board/Incubator PMC Attention:

  - None.

Key Activities:

  - Git repo is just now in place - code cloned from Github and updated
    to latest revision so the code cleanup (package naming, licensing, etc.)
    are in the works.

  - We decided to add a wiki and thanks to infra@ that's now up.

  - Website is created and CMS-ified.

  - Public Blur hack sessions/meetups are being held (Mondays) at
    Near Infinity with summaries posted on dev list.

Community:

  - Issues are being created and worked with discussions of
    new features and modifications on the mail-list.

  - Subscriptions: users@ - 19[+2]; dev@ - 21[+3]

Celix

Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.

Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.

Over the last months we have focused on creating a first release for Celix.
As is mentioned in the graduation plan [1] we hope that a release will create
more community. We have prepared the code base and website for release
and we are very close to making a release.

The previous report [2] mentioned that we are working on a "Native-OSGi",
which could attract more community. This discussion continued in July on
the mailing list, but got quiet after that. There will be a talk about
Native-OSGi for ApacheCon EU and EclipseCon EU and we expect that this
will create attention for Celix.

Most important issues to address before we can graduate:

  Make a first release, growing the community and attracting more committers.

Any issues the Incubator PMC or ASF board need to be aware of:

  None at this time

How has the community developed since the last report:

  There has been a small decrease on activity on the mailing list,
  hopefully this is a temporary decrease due to the holidays. We did
  receive patches from a contributor.

How has the project developed since the last report:

  We are still working towards a first release. The code base has been
  prepared for release and the website got some attention based on the
  shepherd's view from last report.

Chukwa

Chukwa is an open source data collection system for monitoring large
distributed systems. Chukwa is built on top of the Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS), HBase and Map/Reduce framework and inherits Hadoop’s
scalability and robustness. Chukwa also includes a flexible and powerful
toolkit for displaying, monitoring and analyzing results to make the best
use of the collected data.

Incubating since July, 2010.

  - Mailing lists have some activities.
  - 2 new committers since July.
  - 3 new contributors submitted patches since last report in July.

Most important issues to address:

  Growing the community, especially a new release manager

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report:

  Plan to release version 0.6 to fix some of the major bugs in version 0.5.

How has the project developed since the last report:

  More patches are received from new committer and contributors.
  The new patches are better quality to polish Chukwa code base for
  0.6 release.  Chukwa community need to train new release manager to
  release Chukwa 0.6 to ensure the community can continue to flourish.
  The previous concern of inactive development is less concerning than
  during January to July time frame.

CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration
platform. CloudStack has been in incubation since 2012-04-16

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Continuing to build the community and increase diversity
  2. Shipping a release
  3. Transfer trademark, etc. to Apache

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The project has continued to improve its diversity, adding
  Chip Childers, John Kinsella, and Wido den Hollander to the PPMC
  and 3 new committers since the month of August. (Mice Xia, Jason
  Bausewein, and Joe Brockmeier.) We have also taken on a new mentor,
  Noah Slater.

  Contributors and committers have been active in promoting CloudStack
  at events, such as LinuxCon, Ohio LinuxFest, PuppetConf, a get-together
  at Schuberg Philis, and a number of other events.

  The community is participation at LinuxCon EU and ApacheCon EU and
  a number of other events through the remainder of 2012.

  Citrix is acting as primary sponsor of a CloudStack Collaboration
  Conference for November 30 through December 2 in Las Vegas. The
  conference is open to the community, and programming for the event
  will be chosen by a committee that includes members of the CloudStack
  community outside Citrix.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The pending 4.0 release has been branched. The project has made a great
  deal of progress towards the 4.0 release, handling a number of technical
  issues (such as a move to Maven) and resolving almost all known legal
  issues that would pose an obstacle to a release. The sole remaining
  blocker is under discussion and should be resolved shortly.

  The Jira instance for CloudStack was stood up in early September. License
  checks have been automated to ensure that we remain compliant with Apache
  guidelines going forward.

DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images
and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.
smartphones and tablets.

Entered incubation on January 3rd, 2012.

There are no issues that require the Incubator PMC's or the board's attention.

No new committers or PPMC members, and very low activity so far, but the
OpenDDR code that was mentioned in the incubation proposal has just been
donated, which should help motivate people to become more active.

The donation included a data file with had been subject to a DMCA takedown
request while hosted at Github. After some discussion we decided to exclude
that file from the donation, as the ownership of part of that data is hard
to establish. Details at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DMAP-11 which
also links to threads on general@incubator.a.o.

The next steps are preparing that code for a first release, and discussing
how to best integrate the data that OpenDDR has been collecting themselves
and as such can be contributed without problems.

Drill

Drill's goal is to build an open source clone of Dremel with appropriate
extensions to foster greater flexibility.

Drill has been incubating since September of 2012.

Since last month, we have been working on infrastructure. A prototype
web-site is ready and several code contributions are nearly ready to commit.

Graduation is still very far away, but the community activity has been high
and the mailing list has been active.  Numerous public presentations have
been made and several Drill Users' Groups have been formed and meetings held.

Most important issues to address before we can graduate:

  Get the basics in place, build up a working code base, make releases
  (that is, everything)

Any issues the Incubator PMC or ASF board need to be aware of:

  None at this time

How has the community developed since the last report:

  Several active contributors outside the current committer group
  have emerged. We are working to bind these new contributors into the
  community and several appear likely to become committers over time.

How has the project developed since the last report:

  The community has begun to gel nicely and significant code contributions
  have moved forward.

EasyAnt

EasyAnt is a build system based on Apache Ant and Apache Ivy.
Incubating since 2011-01-31.

Since the last report, there were discussion about the graduation process of
EasyAnt. There was confusion about what would be its final place - either a TLP
or a subproject of the Ant TLP - and the implication about the 'graduation'
process.

Things have been cleared with a vote: the EasyAnt project members are willing
to join the Ant TLP. So there is no actual need for a full classical graduation
process.

Then a vote happened in the Ant project about accepting EasyAnt as a subproject.
It failed, there were some concerns about the activity of the project. There
were actually no veto, but an insufficient number of binding +1.

So it has been decided to try again in a few month after showing some nice
activity on the EasyAnt project.

A little bit later, some Ant PMC members wrote that they were 'unplugged' when
the vote happened and were sorry to have missed it. A good sign for a retry of
the vote.

About the activity of the project since the last report: one committer did
some great job making the code base ready to be released. One other committer
was active on the dev mailing list. We have also seen some non committers
asking questions about the use of the project.

The next step for the project:

 - doing a release: it will show that the EasyAnt committers are dedicated to
   maintain it and keep it going
 - shortly after that, ask the Ant PMC again to accept EasyAnt as a subproject
 - if accepted, EasyAnt could then leave the Incubator.

JSPWiki

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

Still following the objective of making the first Apache release:

A few JIRA issues were raised in this period due to incorrect handling of
external dependencies. They have been fixed, so there aren't any other
technical issues blocking a release. A new RC and a release vote has been
cast in jspwiki-dev, with 10 +1 (6 from PPMC members). However, we don't
have any IPMC vote yet, so the release thread was forwarded to general
on Friday 26th.

It's likely that we will have our first Apache release during the first
weeks of October.

The main issues blocking graduation keep being the same as in the last
report: resolution acceptance, community and IPMC graduation vote, the
latter requiring at least one ASF release.

The developer list currently has 91 subscribers; and the user list has
186 subscribers.

Kafka
(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011)

Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe
messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence
of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the
message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading
data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:

  None. We started a graduation discussion on our mailing list. This was
  slightly delayed due to focus on the development of the intra-cluster
  replication feature.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report

  The mailing list continues been very active with bug reports, patch
  submissions, feature requests and use case discussions. [(Jul,Aug,Sep):
  kafka-users (155, 164, 126); kafka-dev (445, 532, 589)].

  Received and reviewed several major patches especially in the 0.8 branch.

How has the project developed since the last report.

  Intra-cluster replication (KAFKA-50): Development has been very steady on
  this feature. (Hence the double volume of emails on kafka-dev since the
  last report.) We set up a development dashboard at
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+replication+development
  that gives an overview of the remaining work for that release.

  The vote for Kafka 0.7.2 is currently underway. This will be the third
  Kafka release after its introduction to Apache incubator.

Mesos

Mesos is a scalable cluster manager that can dynamically share resources
between multiple computing frameworks, including Hadoop, Spark, MPI, and Storm.

Mesos entered incubation on December 23, 2010.

Progress since the last report:

  - Added mesos-0.9.0-incubating.jar to Maven central.
  - Improved build to include warnings and errors.
  - Fixes related to ZooKeeper usage to deal with network partitions.
  - Committed cgroups isolation module and additional updates and fixes.
  - Numerous updates to webui, including preliminary access to files of
    running frameworks.
  - Lots of reviews (https://reviews.apache.org/dashboard/?view=to-group&group=mesos).

Top priorities prior to graduation:

  - Continue to grow community (lots of questions on the mailing list).
  - Add more committers
  - Establish a 6-week release cadence.

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

  Not all committers have access to Jenkins, which makes updating tests
  a slow bottlenecked process.

ODF Toolkit

The ODF Toolkit is a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation,
scanning and manipulation of OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF)
documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation of
heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit is
lightweight and ideal for server use.

ODF Toolkit entered incubation on Aug 1st, 2011.
Our last release was January 14th, 2012.

We voted in our most recent committer on September 27th, 2012.

Most important issues to address:

  Growing the community, especially attracting new developers. Generally
  we'd be pleased to attract 2 or 3 additional active committers, have
  another release, and then we think we'd be well-positioned for graduation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of:

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report:

  We successfully completed two GSoC projects. However neither led to longer
  term engagement with the project.

  We've seen an increase in incoming patches from users, and have a new
  active contributors.  One was just voted in as a Committer/PPMC member.

How has the project developed since the last report:

Tashi

Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.

The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud
computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data).
The idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big
Data that are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared,
manipulated, and computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient,
and safe manner.

Tashi originally encompassed just the tools to manage virtual machines
using Xen and QEMU, but has been merged with Zoni, which manages the
physical aspects of a cluster like power control, network settings and
handing out physical machines.

Activities July-October:

In the period from July to October, the project did not ask to make
another incubating release, but is ready to start the process for a new
release incorporating the development efforts of the last 6 months.

Development efforts this period have included providing a separate
administration client, allowing addition of users and networks, and host
reservations and availability for scheduling.

The project has received code contributions from one non-committer in
this period. Diogo Gomes provided support for deriving the IP addresses
of guests automatically, without having to scan the subnet. Thanks Diogo!

Additional stability and user experience improvements were also
committed.

Upcoming software goals are to investigate what is needed to support
IPv6, replace RPyC, and to provide the ability to hand out server slices
(operating system level virtualization). Besides CPU and memory, disk
storage should also be a schedulable resource.

The project has a user community, but it is small. Growth mostly has
happened by word of mouth. To show potential users at large the utility
of this project, the author of this report is creating web pages to
demonstrate how to accomplish distributed computing tasks. Base images
of (free) OS installs will be provided to allow new users to get started
quickly. Hopefully this will increase visibility of the project.

Items to be resolved before graduation:

  - Generate more publicity for the project.
  - Develop members of the user community to submit feature extensions.

Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Jena Project

Apache Jena is a Java framework for building Semantic Web
applications based on W3C and community standards.

Jena became a TLP April 2012.

Issues:
There are no issues to raise with the board.

Community and activity:

Releases - Jena 2.7.3

Community:

The project also asked for community testing of the SDB component - this
runs over various SQL databases and testing by the committers is
impractical.  The community feedback has been very good and the project has
decided to keep the code alive and release it formally.

users@ and dev@ mailing lists had approximately 180 and 200 messages
respectively and almost all messages on the user list have had some kind of
response, whether from the user community itself or specifically from
committers.

Standards:

Apache Jena passes the full query, update and protocol test suite for the
upcoming SPARQL recommendations now the W3C process has approved final
drafts.

Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache Stanbol Project

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic
content management.

The Apache Stanbol Project was established in September 2012. Since
then, the project has moved its infrastructure to the new location.
Thanks to Infra and the graduation guide the move was really painless.

The project got lots of very positive feedback in response to the
graduation from the Incubator. This was also expressed in the official
ASF announcement. The very active community has lots of hope that
Stanbol will now establish as a reliable platform for semantic
services. The project team tries to keep the momentum up and is
steadily improving Stanbol.

The project plans to publish 1.0 releases of all components over the
next weeks.

Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache Steve Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

Apache Struts is an action-based Java web application framework.

The Struts team made one release in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.4.1 - Fast Track Security Fix Release

Struts 2.3.4.1 fixes two security issues regarding CSRF protection and
DOS attack prevention, see [1] and [2]. The reaction time from issue
reporting to fix release was pretty good.

Two more possible security issues were reported this quarter. The first
one allows for remote code execution in a scenario of not properly
sanitized user input. While user input sanitizing is basically a
developer issue, we have included a complex prevention patch into our
upcoming Struts 2.3.5 feature release which is currently in the process
of quality voting. The second reported issue is about possible XSS
vulnerabilities, but so far we are not exactly sure if we fully
understand the reporter and whether a real issue exists here.

The Struts project will be represented at ApacheCon EU in November,
where PMC members Johannes Geppert and René Gielen will be giving a talk
on Struts 2. Informal Struts community gatherings will be organized on
request.

In the last quarter no new committers or PMC members were added.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and great performance.

We've elected Massimo Lusetti to the Tapestry PMC.

Work continues in the master branch on a significant re-engineering of
Tapestry's client-side JavaScript support.

We've released three bug fixes releases (5.3.4 through 5.3.6); this has been
significantly easier to manage since the move from Subversion to Git.

We've received an security vulnerability report from the MATTA
organization. After a bit of a false start, we've had ongoing discussions with
them. Primarily, there is a need for for HMAC (hash-based message
authentication) when Tapestry stores serialized Java objects on the
client. This has been addressed as part of the 5.3.6 release.

Further security work will continue later, with support for detecting
cross-site scripting attacks.

We've been having some challenges getting Tapestry to build correctly on the
Jenkins continuous integration server.

Mailing list traffic continues in the 900 - 1000 messages per month range.

Attachment AN: Status report for the Apache Tika Project

What is Tika?
=========================
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information
from, a growing a list over 1200 different file types including most
of the major types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images,
Video, Code, and science data) as recognised by IANA and other
standards bodies.

Releases
=========================
We released version 1.2 on the 12th of July 2012[1]. This contained
new features such as the JAX-RS based network server and XMP metadata
handling, along with new file formats and parser improvements.

Work is currently underway on version 1.3 with 22 resolved and 19
open/in progress JIRA tickets, adding support for open graph metadata,
correct rounding of geodata information and improved mime type
detection for JPEG 2000 formats.

Community
=========================
The Tika PMC added Sergey Beryozkin (July 2012), Ingo Renner (July
2012) and Jörg Ehrlich (August 2012) as PMC members and committers.

As sponsor the Tika PMC voted to recommend the graduation of the Any23
incubator project to a TLP. This passed[3] and following the Incubator
PMC vote, the board approved the graduation resolution.

The Tika PMC voted to recommend Dave Meikle as the new chair[4]. This
was accepted by the board in August 2012 and Chris has now handed
duties over to Dave.

Jukka Zitting is scheduled to speak about Tika at ApacheCon Europe.
The session is titled 'Content extraction with Apache Tika'[5] and
shows how Tika can be used with a Lucene or Solr search index.

Mailing list activity on dev@ was at 173, 61 and 7 messages in August,
September and October 2012, respectively. user@ was at 34, 31 and 1
messages, during the same timeframe.

Attachment AO: Status report for the Apache Traffic Server Project

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the boards attention.


Community
=========

Three new committers were added since the last report, bringing us to a
total of 31 active committers. Paul Querna has stepped down from the PMC,
going emeritus for the time being. We would like to thank Paul for all his
contributions to the project, in particularly during incubation and the
early stages joining the Apache Foundation. The mailing lists are seeing
slightly less growth than previous quarters:

    users@   - 324 subscribers (up 8% since last report)
    dev@     - 219 subscribers (up 8% since last report)


The PMC has decided to combine the committer and PMC membership votes into
one. Going forward, new committers that are voted in have a choice to join
either as both committer and PMC member, or just as a committer.

We had a successful Traffic Server Hackathon at OSCON in Portland, and on
10/18 several of our committers are attending the Web Caches Meetup hosted
by Yahoo (http://s.apache.org/c1a).

An introduction to Apache Traffic Server will be presented at ApacheCon-EU
in November.


Releases
========

Development has been somewhat slow over the summer months, but we made one
release:

    3.3.0           - The first development release after v3.2.

This version includes several new experimental plugins, including a Lua
plugin framework (to write plugins in Lua scripts), and a plugin to
handle stale content (RFC 5861).

On further positive notes, a SPDY plugin has been committed to the main
git repository. It's still in somewhat rough shape, but shows promise of
having full SPDY support soon. Parties interested in SPDY are encouraged
to help with the development on this plugin.

Attachment AQ: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

About XMLBeans:
XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a
Java friendly way. The idea is that you can take advantage of the
richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features
mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and
typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces
and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance
data.


Since our last board report, XMLBeans had a new release 2.6.0 in August.
Also, we're in the process to add a new committer, a vote is ongoing for
a long time community member: Jerry Sy to become an XMLBeans committer.

Also one PMC member, Ken Kress, opted to become emeritus
and was marked as such in Apache records.

There are no other issues requiring board's attention.

Attachment AT: Status report for the Apache Lucene.Net Project

== Description ==
Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Releases ==
We just passed a vote (Oct 9th, 2012) to release Apache Lucene.Net 3.0.3 with
the accompanying contrib packages. With version 2.9.4 we lost .Net 3.5
compatibility, with 3.0.3 we have brought that back. In the contrib release we
also have a completely new spatial package.

== Current Activity ==
The next planned release is 3.6 which mirrors the 3.6 code for Java Lucene. No
timeline is currently available.

== Statistics ==
Nuget package downloads:
Lucene.Net RC1 & RC2: 431
Lucene.Net Contrib RC1 & RC2: 125
