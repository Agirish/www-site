 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       At last month's meeting we decided not to hold a mid-year
       members meeting this year.  We didn't hold one last year
       either.  There doesn't seem to be much demand these days to add
       new members more than once a year.

       We intend to hold our next annual Members meeting this May.  My
       preference is for the week of the 20th, unless I hear objections.

    B. President [Jim]

       I was invited to keynote at the CloudStack Collaboration
       Conference in Las Vegas at the turn of the month. The topic was
       "Code, Community and Open Source" (The Apache Way), and the
       slides are available via slideshare (http://s.apache.org/sa).
       The conf itself was noteworthy for a few reasons:
       
        1. The energy and enthusiasm of the CloudStack community was self-
           evident.
        2. It was also obvious that Citrix had and has a great desire to
           be a good FOSS and ASF citizen.
        3. The conf was organized by The Open Bastion, and I was impressed
           with how well it was run (as were Citrix, et.al.).

       Melissa's EA contract was renewed for another 6 months. And speaking
       of renewals, Sam and I discussed salary considerations for our
       sys-admin contractors and have an agreed-upon plan. Sam is in
       the process of updating the sys-admin renewals to comply.

       There was some discussion regarding the status of git; better 
       documentation and a more public plan is being worked.

       We may have an issue with a podling's CLI name; VP of Branding is
       working the (potential) issue. He is also working a trademark
       transfer issue for the same podling. No other board level brand
       issues at this time.

       We have a large number of sponsor renewals coming up. I intend
       to help, and offer the EA's assistance, as needed. If Greg can also
       help, that would be great.

       Marketing and PR are pushing on; on immediate tap is ACNA13 and
       OSCON.

       And speaking of ACNA13, speaker notifications and announcements
       have gone out. TAC is working with Concom. TAC expects to spend
       around $25k for ACNA13, compared to $20k they spent on ACEU12.
       At present, I see no real concerns with either TAC or Concom.

       All in all, 2012 has been a very good year for the ASF.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
       All is well with the Treasurer's office.

       The biggest news to report is that our 2011 taxes are due, Saturday,
       December 15, 2012, and they have been completed, and submitted!

       The ASF's SWIFT bank code was updated on our automated invoice
       generation system (thanks to Daniel Shahaf for reporting it).

       There was a question that I brought up on the last board call
       raised by Nick Burch regarding what exactly needed operations@
       and Prezo/EVP approval in terms of reimbursements. It was
       expressed on that call by Jim that he is happy that the
       Treasurer's office is keeping operations@ and the Prezo/EVP in
       the loop on travel and ApacheCon/conference related expenses,
       and that approvals being sought on those charges is a good
       thing. So, I will continue to seek them.

       The Brazilian firm that registered the SVN trademark still claims
       to not have been paid due to a snafu in the intermediary bank part
       of the transfer. Chris confirmed that WFS lists both wires as having
       gone out on 9/24. The Treasurer's office is requesting board advice
       on what to do here. One option would be to simply re-issue the wires
       with a warning that this is the last time that they will be issued.

       The Treasurer processed an update to banking details for Tony
       Stevenson.

       The EA's check still incorrectly is Bill Paid to her old
       address.  This is a WFS issue. Chris and Sam still have not had
       time to jointly call WFS to get Bill Pay transferred into our
       control.  This is on the list to take care of hopefully in the
       next month. In the meanwhile, the Treasurer's Office will
       continue to issue ad-hoc checks (thanks, Sam) to the EA and the
       EA shreds the old checks when they eventually get rerouted to
       her correct address.

       ApacheCon EU 2012

        * Both OOO-related reimbursements have been made to imacat, and
          to Dwayne Bailey.


       Sponsorship

          mentor summit, and for our participating students have been paid.

          sponsorship dues.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Document filing at Apache continues apace. In November 47
       ICLAs, four CCLAs, and five SGAs were received and
       filed. During processing of incoming ICLAs, five account
       requests were made. A few companies requested changes to the
       standard contract and their requests were declined.

       During my vacation later this month, James Carman, a volunteer
       secretary-assistant-in-training has volunteered to fill in for me.

       Comment: Good job in recruiting another volunteer!

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Very quiet month which meant I was able to get a draft of the
       travel approval policy to the President for feedback. Will
       circulate to board once Jim has had time to feedback.

       VP ConCom approached myself and the President asking us to be
       Conference Chair, which is predominantly a figurehead role as
       defined by our contract with ACNA producer. Jim has been able
       to take on this role as it is currently uncertain whether I
       will be able to attend.

       I had a brief exchange with ACNA producer in response to some
       feedback on the board list about lack of appropriate ConCom
       support. The concern appears to be that ConCom were not pushing
       forwards as expected and, possibly even contracted, and as a
       result the producer is allowing things to get behind
       schedule. However, the producer indicated that whilst getting
       session reviews done has been difficult they have no
       significant issues now that a conference chair has been
       identified. In my opinion this is a symptom of ConCom trying to
       find the right balance between an ASF controlled event and a
       producer led event. Media Relations (Sally) are keeping a
       careful eye on things.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Clarify the board's position on emeritus PMC members: are PMCs
       expected to ask the board to remove them from PMCs, or do they
       formally stay on the PMC and are just considered emeritus by
       their community.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Daniel: draft an ASF policy for projects which need to re-bundle
      other Apache projects.
            Status: 
    
    * Roy: update the guidance for releases and communicate to all
      committers.
            Status: Still not done (no cycles until HTTPbis is done)

    * Jim/Ross: draft travel approval policy
            Status: 1st Draft drafted

    * Jim: send a message to committers@ regarding binaries signed by
      Apache.
            Status: Should Roy and I coordinate these 2 AIs?

    * Sam: review committers@ history and make it publicly archived
            Status: Can somebody remind me what this action item is all about?
            First appeared in September, but I don't see any corresponding
            discussion in either of the August minutes.
            https://mail-search.apache.org/members/private-arch/committers/

    * Brett: follow up with HBase PMC to clarify the "owner" role.
            Status: Not yet done, sorry.

    * Sam: follow up with regard to git post-commit hook support by infra
            Status:  Initial findings...
               * lots of projects use CI with our git service.
               * Cordova would prefer a post-commit hook based approach
               * Infra would prefer that such be modeled after svnpubsub
               * Work began on such: https://github.com/Humbedooh/gitpubsub
               * Instead of completing that, Cordova rolled their own
               * Even such an approach could run on an ASF VM
               * Probe sent to keep the dialog open: http://s.apache.org/wOx

    * Jim: How much did we spend on TAC for ACEU? How much do we
      plan to spend for ACUS?
            Status: Will re-ping for data.

    * Jim: pursue a report for Abdera
            Status: Done. Provided this month.

    * Rich: follow up: Would be nice to put a date next to
       release, for historical reference. (Airavata and Cassandra)
            Status: Replied that they will be sure to do this next time

    * Sam: It would be good to clarify the "difficult for our members to help
      infra" bit.
            Status: Initially pursuing the specifics (git post-commit hook,
                    see above), once that is complete will circle back around
                    to see if there is a larger problem.

    * Greg: last Lenya release was 20 months ago. that is quite long...
      is there a plan for a release RSN?
            Status: the project is simply in a low activity state.
                    (Done)

    * Ross: log4cxx is unmaintained, with a patch in the queue.
      Will the patch be applied, will the contributor be given
      commit access, should the project be retired, or some other
      action?
            Status: Done. Community are considering the best approach. Review 
                    in next board report.

    * Greg: The ODE branding checklist is not useful for the board
      report. Please send this to trademarks@ instead.
            Status: Done.

    * Ross: Any chance someone can blog about POI's success and
      link it from
      http://community.apache.org/mentoring/experiences.html
            Status: Done.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Operations And Community
========================

Ongoing work with the HBase PMC to address potential misuses of 
the HBase and Hadoop brands; progress is slow due to the holidays.

My Managing Open Source Brands talk was accepted at ApacheCon NA, 
as was a similar tutorial focused specifically on helping 
Apache PMCs understand how to manage their brands. 

External Requests
=================

Contacted by a third party claiming a potential conflict with a 
module name within an Apache podling.  Awaiting more details from 
the third party before working with Legal on an official response.

Clarifying Apache policy about transfer of pre-existing trademarks 
during the Incubation process.  Fundamentally, the ASF needs full 
rights to any trademarks before graduation to TLP is approved.  
This needs to be better documented within the Incubator and in our 
public policies to ensure that new podlings with strongly held 
brands know what to expect.

Trademark Registrations
=======================

Working with counsel on ensuring a third-party registration of 
a mark for an incubating project is completed and transferred before 
graduation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

In the last month, we have had two sponsors approach us requesting a
renewal at the $20k level. Invoices have been sent.

Having finally reviewed our complete sponsor list, I am surprised to see
that we have 15 sponsors, which includes four platinums, that need
approaching about renewals with immediate effect.

There is no way I would be able to handle that workload on my own, so I
expect I will look for help in January in approaching these companies.
Suggestions welcome about how we tackle this large scale renewals.

I appear to have lost the ability to see incoming payments. I will work
further with the treasurer to resolve this, as being able to see that
payments have been made is a necessary part of sponsorship tracking.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget:
We remain ahead of plans and under budget. An invoice from HALO Worldwide
will be forthcoming for the contract renewal with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire,
giving the ASF 17 pre-paid press releases with an additional 20% discount
over already-reduced wire distribution rates.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison:
No meetings are planned.

III. Press Releases:
The following formal announcements were issued via the newswire, ASF
Foundation Blog, announce@apache.org, and announce@apachecon.com (where
appropriate) --
- 12 December 2102: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Program
  for 25th ApacheCon
- 12 December 2102: ApacheCon North America Announces "Open Source
  Community Leadership Drives Enterprise-Grade Innovation"

IV. Informal Announcements:
6 items were announced on @TheASF Twitter feed, and 52 on the  @ApacheCon
Twitter feeds. Special thanks to Mark Thomas for posting 7 new video
presentations from ApacheCon Europe to "TheApacheFoundation" account on
YouTube.

V. Future Announcements:
A press release for Apache Cassandra v1.2 is in development.  PMCs wishing
to announce major project news —as well as podlings ready to graduate from
the Incubator—are welcome to contact Sally Khudairi at press@apache.org for
more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations:
An addition to select pre-announcement briefings, 3 media requests were
responded to, and 2 interviews coordinated for various projects. The ASF
received 702 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count
of 2,121.

VII. Analyst Relations:
An informal briefing on Apache CouchDB is currently in progress. Select
members of the analyst community continue to receive regular announcements,
and are provided backgrounders upon request. Apache was mentioned in 1
report by Forrester, 2 reports by Gartner, and 7 write-ups by GigaOM.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison:
Sally is advising The Open Bastion on securing sponsorships for ApacheCon
North America, and has formally handed over tactical PR for the event
(oversight will continue per the ASF's contract with TOB). She will be
liaising with conference publicity where speakers/track chairs are needed,
and will be coordinating with Jim Jagielski, who will be leading the event
as Conference Chair. Sally will also organize and moderate "The Business of
Open Source" panel by request from TOB.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison:
In maintenance mode at present; no new activities are underway. Sally has
reached out to the team at O’Reilly to determine our level of activity with
OSCON 2013, as well as possibly the Strata/Hadoop World conferences.

X. Newswire accounts:
We have 17 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire (contract
extended to December 2013 via the HALO Worldwide master account, giving the
ASF additional 20% discount). We also have 12 pre-paid press releases
remaining on the PRNewswire account through May 2013.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

Lost our public VLAN in our rack1 switch for undetermined reasons,
probably due to a misconfiguration on the OSUOSL side.  Will continue
followup with OSUOSL for eventual resolution.

Enabled core dumps on one of our mail-archives servers to better diagnose
the nature of the ongoing segfaults.

Specced a new VMWare host to offer additional VM's to our projects, then
haggled with each other over the config.  Now appears we're going to 
repurpose chaos (36 disk enclosure) to serve up a Fiber Channel interface 
to the new host.

The tlpreq scripting is now in place and ready for new graduating projects
to use.  We will pass along the details to the Incubator for podlings due
to graduate in December.

Decided we're comfortable with the OpenOffice project keeping at most 2
releases on the Apache mirror system (/dist/) at any one time.  Henk 
Penning has communicated this back to the AOO PMC.

Came across a bizarre privacy information leak with Jenkins and LDAP.  
We've patched our installation to mitigate the issue.

Discussed our near-term plans for git hosting on various lists.  One of 
the exchanges was needlessly heated, and we have tried to rectify the
situation with better documentation and a bit less BOFH tactics.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the Apache Conference Planning Project  [Nick Burch]

Committee
---------
We are *STILL* waiting for confirmation of the process to add new members to
the committee under the new structure. Could someone please confirm what
that is? Only we have several new people we'd like to add, in if only we
knew how....

ApacheCon NA
------------
All speakers have now been notified, only slightly late, announcements have
gone out (thanks Sally!), and a full conference schedule should be published
any minute now.

Committers heavily discounted tickets are still available, until the 31st,
and a reminder will be sent out soon. Speakers have been notified of the
different registration options (company supported for credit, free reg, free
reg + shared hotel), which will hopefully allow all speakers to attend. TAC
kindly delayed the deadline to allow confirmed speakers to apply for help,
so hopefully speakers for whom travel costs were an issue will also be
supported.

We're planning on having a BarCamp on the Sunday before, hackathon on the
Monday, community events in the evenings, and project-specific hackathons
after. Emails about this are being drafted, and wiki pages created, emails
to pmcs about getting involved should be out soon.

ApacheCon Europe
----------------
Our main contact at NewThinking has been unavailable for a few weeks, but
we're expecting the final accounting to be sorted fairly soon once they're
back.

Plans for future events are largely on-hold until after ACNA, as we want to
review how the RFP + producer led event works before deciding on anything.
Everyone is clear though on not doing another one of the same format!

Other Events
------------
There was a meetup in Sydney last week to discuss a future BarCamp there.
Current thinking is that the Apache part of BarCampApacheSydney is
problematic for the local tech community (causes more confusion than the
advantages of the brand), so it's expected to be an Apache-heavy but
non-branded BarCamp. Provisional plan is for the Australian winter.

We haven't heard any more from anyone interested in running any of the other
small events that were discussed at ACEU. We'll probably try a push to get
some people interested in the new year, along with some info when we contact
committers about getting involved in ACNA.

The third Apache Asia Roadshow was held a few days ago, no report has been
received from them yet but we're hoping to include that in the January
report.

The process of approving third party events has been clarified, and the
documentation tweaked. Hopefully now that everyone knows that anyone on the
committee can take on the role of initial review + shepherding, we'll have
fewer problems with dropped balls.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

General
=======

Lewis John McGibbney was added to the Committee.
An outstanding jira ticket to ensure off-site backups of the database has
been completed. The webapp itself is stored in svn.
Currently the webapp is offline due to hardware issues, this may delay our
gathering of applicant information for a few days.
The travel-assistance@ mailing list has 13 people subscribed.

ApacheCon EU 2012 Sinsheim
=======================

Figures are in for what we spent at Sinsheim. (Full table is in svn)

 Total Attendees                       : 15

 Travel Costs - Attendees              : $7084.36
 Hotel Costs - Attendees               : $6843.02 (Euro 5287.00)
 Train Tickets - Attendees (14 x EU58) : $1051.47 (Euro  812.00)
 Entrance Costs - Attendees (15 x $300): $4500.00
 Subsistence - Attendees   (9 x EU80)  : $ 932.95 (Euro  720.00)
 Miscellaneous Fees/Charges            : $   0.00 (unconfirmed)

   Total for Sinsheim                : $20,411.80

Euro to USD conversions are approximate as they were done last week and not
at the time of payments.

ApacheCon NA 2013 Portland
=======================

Applications closed for this event. Judges made use of the concall system
last week for final scoring, 11 out of 16 applications were approved by
judges with a 12th approval coming from the main list.
We have not yet had final pricings for flights or accommodation, but we are
estimating around $25K to $30K for this event. More accurate figures will be
available next month once some flights etc have been booked.
Shepherds are now in communications with accepted applicants now to sort out
visa information, airports, length of stay etc..
This time around, we will try to ensure a decent conduit between shepherds
and our EA so she doesn't have to deal with 15 applicants, but 4 shepherds
instead.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

4 seats on the Technical Architecture Group are up for election; I am 
not intending to express an opinion.

No changes in W3C participation this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Sam Ruby]

Nothing requiring board attention.  Notable events this month:

A PMC was notified of an alleged ADA violation - the PMC in question seems
to be pursuing this appropriately.

Wookie continues to wait for a potential change to the ASF policy
regarding security notifications.  This hasn't happened, and I don't
recommend that they wait for something that may not happen.  See
comment on this month's Wookie report.  Also:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-148

Trying to find a way forward with Mark Thomas and Daniel Kulp
regarding TCKs.  Nothing to report just yet.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

For Nov 2012: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

1      Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
3      Vulnerability reports
       1 [cloudstack, via security@apache.org]
       1 [trafficserver, via security@apache.org]
       1 [commons, via security@apache.org]

Reminder: vulnerability handling process explained at
http://apache.org/security/committers.html

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Activity in Abdera is still low but has picked up since the last
board report with commits from a couple of committers. A new
release is planned to get out those changes and we hope to get
that done before the end of this year.

There have been no committer or PMC member changes.

No board issues.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]

Apache Airavata is a software framework to construct, execute, and manage
long running applications and workflows on distributed computing resources.

== Releases ==

The PMC has not made a release this reporting period, however it is close
in creating release candidates for the next 0.6 release, roughly
anticipated in mid-December.

== Activity ==

The mailing list, jira and commit activity remains very high. The current
activity is on developing simpler interfaces to integrate with Airavata
services and enabling security. The project is progressing well with a
focus on stabilizing API's, documentation, and client integration. These
changes will potentially appeal and attract wider community. If the current
momentum continues, the PMC should be able to march towards its 1.0
production ready release within the next quarter or two.

== Community ==

The are new community contributions in enabling security. Community has also
expressed interest in contributing simpler distributions and integrate with
embedded Tomcat for quick start tutorials. GSoC students have also expressed
interest to integrate their projects into trunk during holidays.  A handful
number of contributors are showing sustained interest towards the project and
are potential PMC members.

== Outreach ==

Members of Airavata PMC, Marlon Pierce, Suresh Marru and Chris Mattmann
have organized a BOF Featuring ASF at Supercomputing 2012 in mid-November -
http://sc12.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail.php?evid=bof212. The
BOF covered open source experiences in Apache, Eclipse and a Academic
Foundation Enzo. Presentations included experience with open source in
eGovernance, academic research and industry contributions in parallel
computing and distributed systems.

Various Airavata PMC members have submitted talks for ApacheCon NA and have
received acceptance notifications but are awaiting the program to be
public. Chris Mattmann, Suresh Marru and Marlon Pierce are also assisting
the review committee to propose a track to promote cross fertilization
between Airavata, OODT, and Tika. 


== Infrastructure ==

There are no infrastructure issues.

== Infrastructure ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Michele Mostarda]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache APR Project  [Jeff Trawick]

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.

Releases
--------
APR-util 1.5.1 was released in October, 2012.  This was a feature-
bearing release since it was the first release from the 1.5.x
branch.  In addition, a number of bugs were fixed.  With this
release, the existing APR-Util 1.4.x branch is unlikely to see
any further activity.

The previous stable APR release was in February of 2012.  The
most recent release of the legacy APR 0.9.x branch was in
September of 2011.  The most recent release of the legacy
APR-Util 0.9.x branch was in October of 2010.

Community
---------
New PMC members or committers: none

About 10 bugs have been opened during the reporting period, with
about 4 bugs resolved.  (Progress was made on a handful of
other bugs.)

Mailing list activity has decreased significantly from the previous
quarter.  (Discussion around the new APR-util 1.5.1 release had
largely completed by the end of the previous quarter.)

Development
-----------
Activity has been minimal.

Issues
------
There are no board-level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Archiva Project  [Maria Odea Ching]

Apache Archiva is an extensible repository management software that helps

Attachment H: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matt Benson]

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
Apache BVal version 0.5 was released on September 21--just after our last
report to the board!  This was a quick turnaround release, addressing a fairly
serious regression (hence the last report's complete omission of any mention
of an impending release).

### Activity ###
Development has begun to pick back up with some feints at solving one of our
outstanding design issues; this has led to some interesting inter-project
discussion, and looks poised to result in the creation of a new utility
among the libraries provided by Apache Commons.

Mailing list traffic continues to be minimal.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.

### Branding ###
Re-styling the website to incorporate our new logo remains an open task.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in
Java, Python, PHP, and .NET (and possibly other languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.


== Project status ==

We got a code contribution for the phpclient subproject.
The new PHP code uses the CMIS Web Services Binding to connect
to a repository. It complements the existing code base the uses
the CMIS AtomPub Binding.

We also got the contribution of a CMIS client library implementation
in Objective-C. We are going to set up a new subproject called
"ObjectiveCMIS". The contribution is the result of a joint effort by
three companies (Alfresco, SAP, and Zia). At the moment we are
waiting for the software grants.

The OpenCMIS (Java) subproject started the implementation of the
CMIS 1.1 specification with steady progress.

There is not much activity around the other two subprojects,
cmislib (Python) and DotCMIS (.NET) at the moment.


== Community ==

Karsten Eberding, the contributor of the PHP code, joined the PMC.
We assume that the six contributors of the ObjectiveCMIS code join
the project once the paperwork is done.


== Releases ==

OpenCMIS 0.8.0 has been released in October.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Luc Maisonobe]

Apache Commons provides a large set of reusable Java components. Commons
components are widely used in many projects, both at Apache and outside.

There are no particular problems that would require board support.

We are still late at moving to svnpubsub, but another attempt at finding
volunteers to do the work have been started, this time with some more
feedback.

Several components have been released since last report:
        Commons Codec         1.7    (2012-09-17)
        Commons Daemon        1.0.11 (2012-11-27)

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

== Summary ==

No Board level issues.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Activity ==

This has been a very quiet month even by Gump's standard.  Very few
tweaks have been made to metadata and not a single commit to the code
base.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.

== Statistics ==

As of Tue, 11 Dec 2012 the ASF installations check out a bit less than
175 source trees (114 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
more than 850 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes about ten hours
on vmgump and about eight on the FreeBSD jail and nine and a half on
Adam where more projects fail to build.

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ , a
FreeBSD jail at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/public/ and a Mac OS
X Server at http://adam.apache.org/gump/

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Benson Margulies]

This is the first report with me (Benson) in the chair. I want to call out
thanks to Jukka and others for helping me get off the ground with my chair
duties, and, of course, to again thank Jukka for his service.

As documented below, the incubator has had some exits and some entrances.
We continue to have vigorous discussions on how to achieve appropriate
supervision and coaching of podlings and how to approach small, slow, or
otherwise doubtful projects.

As with all matters of this volunteer foundation, calling people out for
not doing things is not a viable long-term strategy. From time to time, we
lose mentor involvement, and as a community we have to find more and better
ways of serving podlings that suffer from this problem.

--------------------
Allura

Allura is forge software for the development of software projects, including
source control systems, issue tracking, discussion, wiki, and other software
project management tools.

Allura has been incubating since June 2012.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community
  2. Move project development to ASF hardware
  3. Continue to remove non-AL code from the repo

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have invited three new members to the PPMC - Alvaro del Castillo, Peter
  Hartmann, and Stefano Invernizzi. With their addition, 5 out of 8 of the
  committers are employees of SourceForge.  Additional contributions from yet
  another person, Jon Schewe, have been received also (pending merge).

  Primary development has moved from the SourceForge git repo to the Apache
  git repo.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Work is in progress to remove GPLed code from the distribution, and making
  it an external dependency, moving us closer to having code that we can
  release under the Apache License.

  A report of the project's activity can be see at
  http://bitergia.com/public/previews/allura/2012_12_allura/ which was
  generated using code that is in the process of being moved into the Allura
  git repo from Bitergia, the employer of one of our new PPMC members.

  Name search has been concluded and approved.

  Meanwhile, code commits have been steady and mailing list traffic has been
  moderate.

Shepherd note: (wave)
Allura has recently accomplished their first goal of diversity. I think
that they are on a good trajectory for 2 and 3. Then Release and Graduation!

--------------------
Bloodhound

Bloodhound is an issue tracker derivative of Trac, with the goal of making
deployment easy, and usage intuitive.

Bloodhound has been incubating since December 2011.

The top three issues that need to be addressed to move toward graduation are:

  1. Improve community diversity
  2. Growth of user community
  3. Lowering the barrier to entry and development

Since the last report, Bloodhound has successfully created two more releases.
The problems highlighted in the September report, regarding the use of an
external site for the download of some of the dependencies, have been largely
solved by working with their maintainers to ensure that their packages are
available through a standard location (pypi).

Releases themselves are beginning to become a little more routine although the
time between the initiation of the vote for release of 0.2.0 and the
subsequent announcement of the result was of concern. In contrast the 0.3.0
release was significantly smoother.

Three new committers have been added to the project and they have driven
considerable conversation on the mailing lists in a relatively short time. The
barriers to contributing have been reduced significantly and we plan to
continue to work on this area. In addition to the identification of tickets
that are suitable for newcomers we now have documentation of aspects of ticket
management and the workflow that we use. Proposals for larger enhancements are
also documented on the wiki in such a way that they reflect the decisions made
on the project dev mailing list, reducing the work associated with digging
through the mailing list.

From the infrastructure side the project has two open requests. One of these
requests was opened in July, requesting a means for the Bloodhound source
browser to have effective access to a local copy of the svn repository.
Alternatives have been suggested but there is no obvious resolution to this
issue at this point.

cTAKES

cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) is a natural
language processing (NLP) tool for information extraction from electronic
medical record clinical free-text.

cTAKES was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on Monday, June 11, 2012.

Three most important steps moving towards graduation
  Attract new contributors
  Make at least one cTAKES release
  Get everyone's ICLA on file and start developing code at Apache and using
    the infrastructure

Anything required IPMC attention?
  None

Community:
  We have had additional committers and PPMC members join.
  We have the Software Grants on file from the necessary
   institutions(CTAKES-2).
  We have been using JIRA tickets to replace the Bugs tickets.
  We have been actively using the ASF mailing lists for communication,
   with over 328 mails in ctakes-dev@ in Nov.
  We have initiated a discussion on the road towards graduation
   (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-ctakes-dev/201211.mbox/%3C924DE05C19409B438EB81DE683A942D923C405%40CHEXMBX1A.CHBOSTON.ORG%3E)

Development:
  We successfully migrated the cTAKES codebase from SourceForge to ASF SVN.
  We have been successfully using Maven builds and ASF Nexus for staging our 
    development.
  We have integrated cTAKES with continuous integration using ASF Jenkins.
  We have updated the code base to include ASF copyright headers to source files.
  We have integrated the Apache RAT plug-in for Audit.
  We have updated the README/LICENSE files appropriately.
  We have a release candidate (3.0.0-incubating) pending Review/Vote.
  The ctakes-dev@ discussions have been active.

Apache Drill

Issues:
Discussions on these key areas were __very focused__ and productive toward
this project's graduation goals:
1.) Logical Plan Expressions, syntax, and parser
2.) Schema-less Management
3.) Wire Protocols

User interest has increased (thanks to the media) and as the project's
source commitments increase so will user interaction within the next
quarter.

How has the community developed since the last report:
Discussion counts have gotten smaller from the month of October through
November 2012.
For all intents and purposes initial code was checked in and builds running
during the middle of October 2012 and from that time focused discussion and
development have occurred.

Many new users joined the list as well as asking formally to be part of the
community.

List Summary:
  * http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-drill-dev/
  * Dec 2012, [current], 264 subscribers
  * Nov 2012, 73 (jira, focused discussions)
  * Oct 2012, 214 (svn, discussions, jira)
  * Sep 2012, 413
  * Aug 2012, 85

How has the project developed since the last report:
== Milestones ==
1.) During the month of October, the SVN repository was initiated and
initial source checked in.
2.) ~88% of JIRA tasks were created during the months October through
November, showing growth and healthy discussion.
3.) Post initial commit, many users have come forth asking to engage in
active development, showing healthy growth and interest amongst the
developer community at large regarding the goals of this project.

Etch

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a variety
of programming languages.

Status:

  Development
  The implementation of the binding-cpp has now reached beta status. We are
  currently in the stabilizing  and tests phase and are planning to do the
  release within the next month.

  Graduation status
  The graduation proposal and the composition of the PMC are currently in
  discussion. We are planning to vote for the graduation proposal and the PMC
  Chair in calendar week 50 and then start the discussion on general@incubator
  mailing list afterwards.

Community:
  In order to present Etch to a wider audience we have filed another proposal
  for the ApacheCon NA 2013. Furthermore we are planning to put some more
  effort into the growing of the community next year e.g. by using screencasts
  and writing a tutorial.

Future Tasks:
  - Finish graduation process
  - Release of Etch 1.3.0
  - Community development

Mentor note (Dashorst):
  The processes in this podling are really like trying to pour molasses through
  a funnel in the winter. That said, I do think that the project is viable and
  an Apache community albeit a small, slow moving one. Given the nature of the
  project and its usage in automobile technology I don't think it will ever be
  as fast moving as a web or big data project. And that is not a bad thing for
  this type of software IMO.

Shepherd note (Wave):
  Molasses is apt. I think that they do need to actually vote on graduate.
  I hope that they actually do. I think it should be a greater priority
  than a release.

Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:
   Flex has their graduation resolution on the agenda for the December board 
   meeting.

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?
   Only the graduation resolution.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)
   The Flex community really wants to move from SVN to Git/GitHub.  We are 
   eager to see Infra fully support read/write Git repos.

   Also, we are still waiting for INFRA-4380 (import the old Flex JIRA data) to
   be resolved.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?
   -We approved 6 new committers
   -We released Apache Flex SDK Installer 1.0.9-incubating.
   -Adobe Systems Inc. donated both the Falcon compiler and the FalconJS
    cross-compiler.
   -Christopher Dutz donated Maven support tools for Flex
   -We voted to graduate.
   -We started work on a next-generation of Flex designed to target browsers
    and devices without Flash.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

   -Go through the transition to being a TLP
   -Continue with the next-generation Flex work
   -Release several bug-fixes and new locales in the current Flex code base.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?
   No.  We thank you for your support.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
- Finish on boarding the podling. Including infra work (waiting on a git 
  repository to be created see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5512), 
  completing the podlings.xml and then IP clearance for code and committers.
- Porting and releasing existing codebase to support multiple versions of 
  Hadoop in a single IDE instance. During this time building understanding of 
  the Apache processes around working and releasing.
- Grow the podling community in terms of users and contributors.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?
- As mentioned above, we have been waiting on 
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5512 for over three weeks, not 
  having our git repository is a big barrier to progress.

How has the community developed since the last report?
- The only change in the community was the withdrawal of Chris Douglas as 
  mentor, replaced by Suresh Marru.
- Committers are currently in the process of filing ICLAs

How has the project developed since the last report?
- The project hasn't moved a lot due to not yet completing the podling on 
  boarding.

Kalumet

Apache Kalumet is a complete platform to administrate data center. It covers
the operating system tasks, middleware provisioning, etc. Kalumet entered
incubation in September 2011.

Community Developement:

We submitted Kalumet 0.6.0-incubating release to vote.

A talk has been submitted to ApacheCon NA. This talk is an introduction to
Kalumet, a presentation of the current features and present the roadmap.

Project Development:

We created the Jira corresponding to the changes that we want to include in
Kalumet 0.7.0-incubating release.

We decided to increase the release cycle in order to give more visibility
to the users.

We completed a first documentation. The documentation is part of the
0.6.0-incubating release and is also available directly on the website.

Before Graduation:

    we identified "high" priority features/changes for 0.7.0-incubating
    release. Kscripts and different "ecosystems" (OSGi, JavaEE, etc)
    providers could be included in this release.

Post Graduation:

    Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept globally
    to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
    deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

    Refactoring of the UI. Currently Kalumet Console uses Echo2 framework.
    It's a category B license framework. We plan to refactor the console
    to use a new framework.

Web Site/Communication Development:

The website has been updated with the documentation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of:

None so far.

S4

S4 (Simple Scalable Streaming System) is a general-purpose, distributed,
scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows
programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous,
unbounded streams of data.

S4 entered incubation on September 26th 2011.

Primary issues blocking graduation:

 - growing the community
 - verifying the name of the project. See PODLINGNAMESEARCH-10


Community development since last report:

 We had new users showing interest on the s4-user list, which showed regular 
 activity.
 Several new contributors also participated to technical discussions on the 
 Jira tickets.


Project development since last report:

 The initial release of the completely refactored version of S4, 0.5.0,
 was focused on providing the basic API and features. We are now preparing
 the next release and focusing on integrations, features and performance.

 Regarding integration, for elasticity, we worked on integrating the Apache
 incubator Helix project, and for resource scheduling, interfaced with
 another Apache project: YARN.

 We also worked on improving performance, which is a key factor for
 adoption.

Wave

Wave is rich, web-based, distributed, collaboration platform that allows
users to interact in near real time.  The wave platform includes a
web-based user interface containing an rich-text.  The system is
extendable though widgets, robots, and editor doodads.  The Wave In a Box
implementation is developed in java using a variety of web technologies
such as Web Sockets, Java Script, GWT, and supported by an operational
transform based conflict resolution algorithm.  Wave has been incubating
since December of 2010.


* Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation.

1. Performing an initial release (currently in progress).
We have started the release process, but it has stalled.  We were first dealing
with the large amount of files with incorrect copyright headers.  That has been
largely overcome.  However we are still struggling with the possible need to
obfuscate third party jars with less than compatible licenses.  The technical
and legal implications of this still need to be addressed.


2. Updating the web site and online documentation.
The web site does not have very much useful information on it.  Most
Information is scattered on the old google-code and waveprotocol.org
sites.  Prospective users and developers are constantly asking for
where the documentation is.

3. Increasing developer / community contributions.
While we are making progress in this area, we need more contributors.
We believe that taking care of #1 and #2 will help with this.  Building
an active community is difficult, but very important.


* Issues for the PMC / ASF Board

None at this time.


* How has the community developed since the last report

The community has added two new committers in that last several months (Ali
Lown and Vicente J. Ruiz Jurado).  Additionally, we have seen an increase
in the number of code reviews and mailing list traffic.


* How has the project developed since the last report.

Several Jira issues have been resolved and a few enhancements have been made.
We are making progress towards an initial release.

IPMC comments:
rgardler: the confusing note about "obfuscating binaries" in the Wave
report was picked up by Benson and taken to the project and IPMC lists. It
seems to be cleared up now. It was a matter of weak-copyleft build-time
dependencies. It looks like the term "obfuscate" is incorrectly used in
this context, but the community is now set to move forwards.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

Apache Isis graduated from the incubator in Oct 2012.  This is the second of 
the monthly reports required for three months post-graduation.


Project Description:

Apache Isis is a framework to enable the creation of software using
domain-driven design principles, being an implementation of the naked objects
architectural pattern


Community / Development:

We continue to work with infra to transition to a TLP.  In particular, we
have now moved our codebase over from svn to git [1].  

Compared to last month, our new CMS website is substantially enlarged [2].

We have also had extended discussions on the mailing lists to modularize
our code, with a view to more frequent releases [3].  Work is now well
underway on this restructuring.


Releases:

No releases this month, but we are on track to have a release out before
our final post-graduation report next month.  (We have performed a first
trial release against git and updated our release procedures [4]).


Infrastructure Changes:

* The code copied from svn to git has been put into attic in the SVN repo,
  and made read-only [1]
* git.apache.org and github.com/apache/isis now synchronizing as read-only 
  copies of our git repo [1]


Project Branding:

The branding of Isis on the old incubator site [5] is now inaccurate, since 
the project is no longer incubating.  We expect to retire the incubator 
site before next report.


Issues:

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  We made the following unstable 2.5.x release from Jackrabbit trunk:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.5.2 on September 23rd
    
  We made a release from the Jackrabbit Oak sub project:
  
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 0.5 on September 30th
    
o Community / Development

  * Chetan Mehrotra and Mete Atamel joined the Jackrabbit team as committers 
    and PMC members.

  * Work on Jackrabbit Oak continues strong: At .adaptTo(Berlin) 2012 there 
    was a presentation on Oak and an Oak related hackathon both of which 
    where well attended. A further Hackathon was held at ApacheCon EU.
  
  * There was a discussion on the future of Jackrabbit and Jackrabbit Oak
    on the dev@ list. The emerging consensus seems to be that Oak will be
    kept in Jackrabbit and might eventually become Jackrabbit 3.0
    (See http://markmail.org/message/ga4mn2x2xqsvzwg6).
    
o Infrastructure

  We are still in progress of migrating from Confluence to the new CMS.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed pub/sub system for efficiently collecting and
delivering a large number of messages to both offline and online systems.

Development
===========
Kafka 0.8 (supports intra-cluster replication) is in the final debugging
stage. We gave out a trivial version on Nov 26. We expect to release 0.8 in
Jan. 2013.

Community
===========
Lots of activities in the mailing list. kafka-user has 335 emails in Nov
(up from 236 in Oct). kafka-dev has 448 emails in Nov (down from 758 in
Oct, mostly because of fewer active jiras).

There will be a Kafka presentation (introducing 0.8 features) in ApacheCon
in Feb., 2013.

Infrastructure
===========
This is the first month since Kafka became a top-level project. Apache
infra has helped us migrate the svn repository and the mailing list, and is
in the process of migrating our website.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Report from the Apache Karaf Project  [Jean-Baptiste Onofré]

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Steve Rowe]

TLP
---

Trademarks/branding:

We believe the project is now in compliance with the Apache project
branding requirements.


Lucene Core and Solr
--------------------

Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community is very active.

In the last quarter, we released Lucene Core and Solr 4.0 final.

We have added one new committer in the last quarter: Alan Woodward.

We have added one new PMC member in the last quarter: Sami Siren.


Open Relevance Project
----------------------

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either as it is a niche
area.


PyLucene
--------

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
almost entirely an automated port, so this project will never
require a lot of developers.  The user community is active.

There were no PyLucene releases in the last quarter.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache MRUnit Project  [Brock Noland]

DESCRIPTION

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 0.9.0-incubating, released on
  May 12, 2012 while in Incubation.
* MRUnit is currently working on a 1.0.0 release.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report:
  http://s.apache.org/MNZ

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Chris A. Mattmann]

Apache OODT is a software framework, and an architectural style for
the rapid construction of scientific data systems. It provides
components for data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow
management, resource management and data processing.

Releases/Development:

We are currently discussing rolling a release candidate for Apache
OODT 0.5 [1]. 0.5 has 58 issues resolved, including some major
upgrades to our workflow engine, wrapping up what we started in
0.4. There are also bug fixes to the pge and crawler modules part
of CAS.

Most of the active work now involves efforts towards the curator
(see OODT-506 [2], OODT-508 [3]), and towards improved catalog
support for the filemgr (see OODT-541 [4]).

There were 46, 72, and 38 emails sent to the dev list from December
2012, November 2012, and October 2012, respectively. There were 13,
23, and 24 emails sent to the user list in that same time frame,
respectively.

Community:

The Apache OODT PMC added Mike Joyce to our ranks in the latest
quarter.

Chris Mattmann worked with ApacheCon NA 2013 organizers and reviewers
to create an Apache in Science track primarily dedicated to Apache
OODT, but also to Apache Airavata and Apache Tika and Apache Solr.
Suresh Marru and Marlon Pierce from Apache Airavata will co-chair
the track. Apache in Science will be a sequel to the Apache in
Space! track from ApacheCon NA 2011.

There was a Birds of a Feather meeting [5] at the Super Computing
Conference on Tuesday, November 13, 2012 that discussed Apache
as a model for the development of scientific software, and community.
Suresh Marru, Marlon Pierce, and Chris Mattmann organized the event.
Apache OODT, and Apache Airavata were used as exemplars and discussed
during the meeting.

Branding:

No updates beyond last report. Looks good.

Press:

Chris Mattmann keynoted the ITEX 2012 conference in Auckland, New
Zealand on November 7, 2012 [6] and discussed Apache OODT, and the
Apache Software Foundation.  Several associated articles, e.g., in
ComputerWorld NZ [7] were published around that time.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Joern Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks,
such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging,
named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.
These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing
services.

Development
------------------
We are preparing the trunk now for the upcoming release and fixed almost
all outstanding issues. Additionally the opennlp-similarity component in
the sandbox is prepared for its first release.

We expect to have an increased development activity again after the 1.5.3
release is out.

Community
---------------
The community remains active and there is good traffic on the lists.

No new committers have been voted in.

Releases
------------
No releases since we graduated from the incubator.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

* Issues for Board Awareness

The graduation process, as expected, was non-trivial and involved
migration of multiple resources. Infra was very helpful, but it
took about 7 weeks before the main resources could be considered
to be fully migrated.

* Community Development/Outreach Progress

A major effort is ongoing to recruit new volunteers for the project,
through announcements on the website, blog posts and calls on the
ooo-announce list. We managed to recruit volunteers for translation
(about 20 new languages), Quality Assurance and Marketing. The dedicated
mailing lists are now seeing a strong increase in traffic and diversity
of posters.

We continue to use social networking accounts - Google +, Facebook - to
collect feedback and ideas from our user base. A Google+ community was
recently started. An initiative called "Ask OpenOffice" was launched too,
to collect the top 10 non-support questions from our users: they will be
answered in a blog post, to help users reach a better understanding of
OpenOffice at Apache.

Dozens of project volunteers attended the 3-day OpenOffice track at
ApacheCon EU, often meeting in person for the first time; the ApacheCon
experience allowed volunteers to discuss about the project, to get media
exposure and to learn more about the Apache Foundation and the Apache Way.

We have several volunteers ready to attend FOSDEM (February 2013, Brussels,
Belgium) where the Apache OpenOffice project will have a dedicated track
for developers ("devroom") and, pending final approval by FOSDEM, a stand
for the whole conference. We also submitted talks for the ApacheCon NA in
Portland and we'll have several volunteers attending it too.

* Project Development Progress

The next OpenOffice release will be labelled 4.0. Plans are to release
it in Q1 2013 or shortly after. Volunteers are stepping up to take
responsibility for the major new features, opening wiki pages to document
their progress and inviting other potential developers to join.

The project will also release new languages for OpenOffice 3.4.1 (the
current stable version), with a translation deadline set to end of 2012 and
a release expected in January 2013. The project will release an update to
the 3.4.1 sources (including the new translation resources) and binary
packages for the added languages only.

The project added 3 new committers since the graduation date.

Community support forums remain popular with users.
The mailing lists for user support and localization are quite active, and
those for QA and marketing are fast growing. As Apache OpenOffice is a
client product, we continue to investigate ways to direct users to
appropriate support venues. The developer list, ooo-dev, remains very
active.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Pig Project  [Daniel Dai]

Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a
high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled
with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient
property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to
substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle
very large data sets.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Sandro Martini]

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.


Status

As usual, low levels of traffic in our users mailing lists,
with little longer time in sending answers to our users
Low activity on dev mail list, mainly automated emails from the issue tracker.

Our Mailing lists have these numbers:
   commits -   22 subscribers
   dev     -   71 subscribers
   users   -  188 subscribers

Commits since last report (approx): 85, from the same 2 PMC members reported
above.

During last months and mainly for increased load at work (for me and for
the other active PMC Member) I have seen a little slowdown, but we are
still working on our maintenance branch. Developments on our next major
release 2.1 (on trunk) at the moment are limited to merge fixes from the
maintenance branch (we prefer to wait a little and start this new release
on a solid base), even because we are trying to get more
feedback/interest/participation from users, discussing some important
feature to put in that release in our mailing lists.

Some work has been done in the Web Site, to update/clarifying info and some
technical details in tutorials, as requested by users.

Generally speaking, I think that this project is no more so attractive for
the people, for many reasons (see my previous reports). If someone at Board
has some suggestion, I'll be happy to discuss with all PMC Members.


Issues
We are working on important fixes for the 2.0.x maintenance branch: some of
them already committed, while for others (strange issues) we have problems
reproducing them, so we have some delay here. We are thinking to move some
of them to a next maintenance release, to speedup the current 2.0.3 (maybe
to release it in January).


Releases
no new releases.


Branding/naming issues:
None.

Legal issues:

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Gert Vanthienen]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status

While we continue to have an active community, we also have lost
some of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community

No changes since last report.

Community Objectives

Since our last board report, we have completed the migration to svnpubsub
for our website and are nearly ready for migrating our distribution area. 

Documentation and website remain important working topics.

When releasing OSGi bundles, we are repackaging and wrapping existing
artifacts from other projects.  To ensure these changes get donated/
communicated back to the original community, we now require backlinks
to the corresponding issue in the other project.

Branding Status

- Project Naming And Descriptions : Compliant
- Website Navigation Links : Compliant
- Trademark Attributions : Compliant
- Logos and Graphics : Current logo is not compliant
- Project Metadata : Compliant

Releases

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- We have not released anything since our previous 1.2.1 bugfix release.
  Current trunk development is targeted at a 1.3.0 release (time frame
  not yet determined).

Community & Project:

- Les presented 3 presentations on various Apache Shiro topics at this year's
  Rich Web Experience conference in Fort Lauderdale at the end of November.

- We have yet to convert over to infra@'s CMS system for our public website.
  That work will probably be completed over the holidays in time for infra's
  Jan 1 deadline.

- The Shiro community remains helpful, with steady month-after-month mailing
  list traffic.  No noticeable changes here.

- The Shiro site and distribution continues to experience good growth,
  with the site averaging around 10,000 visitors per month and 8,700
  downloads a month from Maven Central (a 25% increase from the last report).

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Kevin A. McGrail]


SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent email
filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited bulk email,
more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to email headers and
content to classify email using advanced statistical methods. In addition,
SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows other technologies to be
quickly wielded against spam and is designed for easy integration into
virtually any email system. 

Releases
--------
No releases for this quarter.  

Release of version 3.4.0 is still imminent.  A preliminary release candidate 
was created on Oct 15th.

This release will improve IPv6 support greatly.

Many people are running using trunk, however, which has great bugfixes and is
quite stable.

Community & Development
-----------------------
Need to migrate our zones and zones2 server off of Solaris to yet to be
determined resource.

Need to migrate our website to svnpubsub.  Believe this is impending.  
Anything the board can do to extend the 12/31 deadline would be appreciated.

Need to get our Jenkins build slave working under FreeBSD instead of Solaris1.
Need access to the box to figure out what is killing it on the build slave.
What would the process be to approve that?

We are in the process of voting Adam Katz and John Hardin to the PMC. This
was held up by one of the nominees getting married and a copyright concern
on the PMC.

The project users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

The project dev list has been active with both committers and community
members contributing.

Our RuleQA dev list has been active and we have been adding more accounts
to the project to publish rules more consistently.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

The project is active and development is steadily going on. There is
a great interest for new features from new users. They would
like to add additional features in Stanbol and the community is trying
to get them involved by explaining the Apache way and working out how
they can contribute to Stanbol. Additionally, the project received
some contributions in the form of new enhancement engines that are
currently reviewed and integrated.

There were no new committers or PMC members elected.

Several Stanbol committers have signaled that they will contribute to
Clerezza (incubating), especially to the parts needed by Stanbol.
The Stanbol community is looking forward to see Clerezza graduate from
the Incubator.

Several Stanbol committers are involved in the new Apache Marmotta
(incubating) podling. Marmotta provides linked data functionality that
is of great interest for Stanbol.

The project did not manage to publish releases since graduation. Required
refactorings and branch mergings for the new natural language
processing design (STANBOL-733) kept us busy. Since this work is nearly
finished the project is optimistic to create the first releases soon.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]

General:
Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
responsiveness on both dev and user lists.

Issues:
The Tomcat PMC is concerned about the ongoing uncertainty
over the future of the TCK agreement. The Tomcat PMC is
working with the VP Legal Affairs on a way forward for
on-going access to the TCKs. The TCKs are a useful tool and
the Tomcat PMC would like to retain access to them if an
acceptable agreement can be reached with Oracle.

Releases:
 - Apache Tomcat 7.0.34
 - Apache Tomcat 7.0.33
 - Apache Tomcat 7.0.32
 - Apache Tomcat 6.0.36
 - Apache Tomcat 5.5.36
 - Apache Tomcat Maven Plugin 2.0.0

Development:
There was lots of development activity on forthcoming
Apache Tomcat 8 release.

Community:
There were no changes in community since the last report.

Security:
 - CVE-2012-4431 - Important: Bypass of CSRF prevention filter
   The CSRF prevention filter could be bypassed if a request
   was made to a protected resource without a session identifier
   present in the request.
 - CVE-2012-2733 - Important: Denial of service
   The checks that limited the permitted size of request headers
   were implemented too late in the request parsing process for
   the HTTP NIO connector. This enabled a malicious user to
   trigger an OutOfMemoryError by sending a single request with
   very large headers.
 - CVE-2012-3546 - Important: Bypass of security constraints
   This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team on
   13 July 2012 and made public on 4 December 2012.
 * CVE-2012-3439 - Moderate: DIGEST authentication weakness
   Three weaknesses in Tomcat's implementation of DIGEST
   authentication were identified and resolved.

We are working on number of other non critical security issues
which will be disclosed with future releases.

Trademark:
Detailed status can be found at
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/tomcat/trademark-status.txt
There are no pending trademark issues which would require board's
attention at this time.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

DESCRIPTION

VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A
self-service web portal is used to request resources and for
administration. VCL became a TLP on June 20, 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
- Work continues to migrate content from Confluence to the new CMS website and
  to improve the design.
- VCL 2.3.1 will likely be released before the December 2012 board meeting. This
  is a bug fix release. All of the issues targeted for VCL 2.3.1 have been
  resolved and the release process is beginning.
- Most development has been devoted to addressing bugs in VCL 2.3 and preparing
  VCL 2.3.1. Work on new features slated for VCL 2.4 will increase now that VCL
  2.3.1 is complete.
- Alan Cabrera and Kevan Miller have resigned from the VCL PMC. They were
  mentors of the VCL project throughout incubation. The VCL community is
  grateful for all of their help.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic,
component oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Released Wicket 6.1.0, 6.1.1, 6.2.0, 1.5.9, 6.3.0
- Integrated Wicket CDI into project
- Bean Validation as an experimental module
- Kerfuffle about source releases follow up
- Rise of github pull requests
- No new committers were added

Releases

With our adoption of Semantic Versioning we also took it upon
ourselves to release early and often. This proves to be rather
successful: in the last 3 months we were able to ship 3 minor
releases and two patch releases. Another minor release is scheduled
to be released just prior to the board meeting.

One contentious thing was to start trusting our ability to do the
releases on that schedule, and not keep a release in infinite bug fix
limbo. Particularly we discovered two bugs in 6.1.0 and wanted to fix
them in the release, but after some back and forths ultimately
shipped 6.1.0 and issued a patch release two weeks later with the
fixes.

It is of course our intention to always ship bug free software, but
we rather ship sooner and often than have a release wait until
someone is able to fix the issues, re-spin and discover the next
problem.

Wicket CDI in 6.2.0

As of 6.2.0 we integrated CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection)
into our project. This project has been in the works on github.com
for several reasons:

 * development for this module was started way before we introduced
   our experimental modules

 * it relies on some dependencies that were previously not available
   from Maven Central (from JBoss). Maven Central policy dictates
   that one can't push projects with dependencies that are not
   present in Maven Central. We were not willing to take on the
   support of those libraries ourselves and rather decided to wait
   until they became available or replaceable by other libraries.

Kerfuffle about source releases follow up

In the previous board report I noted that we had a kerfuffle
regarding source releases. The heated discussion has subsided, and we
are now building and releasing the proper source distributions.
Additionally we provide binary distributions for convenience,
including (binary and source) jars that are pushed to Maven Central.

I also noted in our previous report that most of the consumers of our
software receive their Wicket through Maven. It appears that only one
person noticed and complained that we only provided a pure source
release tarball. Since that release we also provide a convenience
package with just the binaries (and signatures) for direct
consumption.

Rise of Github pull requests

The last couple of weeks we got several pull requests coming from
various users from github. With some work we were able to craft a
workable workflow for integrating those pull requests into our
code base.

It would be great for git support to become official (no more work in
progress). Our project has found little to no problems with the
service so far.

New committers

No new committer was voted on since June 2012. We are constantly
monitoring developer activity for new candidates.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Mahadev Konar]


ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed
applications.

There was one new release in the last quarter: 3.4.5 which was a bug
fix release and is marked as stable.

Trunk is also under development for an eventual 3.5.0 release. So far
primarily code cleanup and refactoring has been applied to trunk.
3.5.0 release date is still TBD.  Our focus is
on scalability, jdk7 and openjdk support, maven build/rel, testing and
audit logging.

Community:

Apache ZooKeeper had its third official meetup around Hadoop World:
http://www.meetup.com/zookeeperusergroup/events/81954542/

 Around 10 people attended.

 Mailing list activity continues to be high.

 * 8 active committers representing 5 unique organizations
 * 8 active PMC members representing 4 unique organizations
 * 363 subscribers on dev (up from 342 last quarter)
 * 743 subscribers on user (up from 692 last quarter)

 BookKeeper status report for December 19, 2012

 Bookkeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance logging
 service. The project also includes Hedwig which is a highly scalable
 Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper and Bookkeeper with strong
 durability guarantees.

 We are currently preparing for release 4.2.0, our third release as a
 ZooKeeper sub-project. The scope of this release has grown since the
 last report. It will now include Hedwig message filtering and readonly
 bookies along with auto recovery. There have also been a lot of
 scalability improvements to allow us to handle millions of concurrent
 logs. We hope to get release 4.2.0 out before the end of the year or
 very early next year.

 BookKeeper and Hedwig have both gone into production use within Yahoo!
 and we have also had reports of production use of BookKeeper in
 HubSpot. Huawei continue to evaluate HDFS+BK for their internal use.

 Infrastructure issues:
 No issues.

 Community building:

 The community has continued to grow in the last few months. We now
 have very active contributors from Yahoo!, Twitter and Huawei.

 Community:
  * 50 subscribers to bookkeeper-dev
  * 57 subscribers to bookkeeper-user
  * 482 issues opened to date, 89 opened since September 12, 2012
  * 81 issues resolved since September 12, 2012
