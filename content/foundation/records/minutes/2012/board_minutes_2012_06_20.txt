 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       The board's annual face-to-face meeting this will be held on
       August 28th this year in Washington DC, hosted by Adobe.

       We elected a new board last month at our annual members
       meeting.  Rich Bowen and Ross Gardler were added to the board.
       Thanks again to Shane Curcuru and Daniel Kulp for their service
       on the board.

       My report from the annual meeting follows.

       ---

       It has been an outstanding year for the foundation.  Our
       communities continue to release great software.  The incubator
       has hatched a raft of new projects.  Lots more are incubating
       and will soon join the ranks of TLPs.  Our position as the
       leading community-based open source foundation has grown even
       stronger.  We must be doing something right!  We should
       congratulate ourselves for all our success.

       As we grow we require more resources.  We've slowly increased
       the size of our infrastructure.  Various other expenses have
       increased as well.  But income from sponsors has thus far kept
       pace and our path seems sustainable.

       My thanks to everyone involved here.  A special thanks to the
       directors, officers and project chairs for going the extra mile
       to keep our foundation running so well.

    B. President [Jim]

       Logistically the annual ASF members meeting went off w/o a hitch.
       Thanks again for all people who helped make it happen, including the
       Infra team for keeping the web-based voter tool running.

       I am renewing the contract for our EA for another 6 months.

       I will be presenting at the NASA Open Source Summit this month
       (June 19-20) regarding "Community" and the ASF will, of course,
       be especially noted in my talk. I will also be presenting at OSCON
       and will perform "booth duty" as my time and schedule allows.

       I am also cutting/pasting my report from the member meeting:
       --
       The previous year has been an active one for the foundation. There
       has been a large number of significant codebases entering the
       Incubator, the latest being CloudStack. In my mind this once again
       reinforces the fact that the ASF is known as *the* place for open,
       collaborative development, if the goal is to create a neutral yet
       healthy and sustainable community around a project. We should be
       proud of this reputation, and continue to foster and promote it.

       We've also over the previous year have seen a large number of TLP
       graduations, which is a change from last year where it seemed some-
       what sluggish. Overall, all the projects, including the "new" ones
       are operating well, each as their own.

       I continue to be well-pleased by the work done by our EA. She has
       been a significant help to many committees. Her contract has been
       renewed, so if there are issues or tasks that she can help with,
       don't hesitate to ping me.

       Our infrastructure team continues to actively and pro-actively keep
       on top of our resources and services. My thanks go to our SysAdmins,
       all infra volunteers and our VP of Infra. One item in particular to
       note is that increased efforts by Infra regarding in-house use and
       support of git, a request frequently made by members and projects.

       Finally, as before, if your PMC desires specific computing resources
       (ie build farm, test machines, etc.), please get in touch with the
       infrastructure group.  Well-reasoned and detailed proposals are
       always welcomed.  However, we are often limited by human resources,
       so volunteers to help execute these plans are strongly encouraged.

       The board approved our FY2012-2013 budget; We operated as expected
       and on target under our 2011-2012 budget. We continue to be cash-flow
       positive, with funds in the bank for unforeseen expenses.

       We are *finally* pushing thru an action to have an official audit of
       our books. The next board (and President) should ensure this happens.
       It's long overdue.

       Relatedly, with the appointment of a new treasurer, we are back on
       track regarding our books and handling of invoices and payments.
       I am also happy to report that Fundraising has renewed energy and
       we have seen a nice increase in sponsors and their sponsorship levels.

       I wish to thank the board and the membership for their trust and
       support. I also wish to thank all Sponsors of the ASF.

       Finally, I am happy to report that the ASF continues to be an
       extremely noteworthy and respected entity in the FOSS space, and I
       (and others) are frequently asked to speak at conferences,
       user-groups, etc regarding the foundation, the so-called "Apache Way"
       and Open Source in general. In addition, the foundation itself
       is running extremely well, on "greased grooves" one might even say.
       Kudos to all.

       Discussion items:

           1) I proposed a plan to move $100K from PayPal to Wells Fargo.
              I received some mild push back and no support.  This is not
              urgent, so I'm holding on this for the moment.

           2) I would like to have a discussion, either at the board meeting,
              on the board mailing list, or at the F2F as to what level of
              detail we should be publishing this data for external consumption.

       The board approved making Sam the named contact at PayPal. Sam
       will discuss on the board list the level of reporting for
       Treasurer in board reports.

 8. Discussion Items

        A. What terms would we find acceptable for renewing the Stand-Alone
           TCK Licence Agreement with Oracle America, Inc.?
    
           Daniel Kulp is discussing the contract renewal with Lance
           Andersen of Oracle Corp.
    
           One concern is the requirement to re-test on the current
           release of the TCK.
    
           Another concern is the requirement to continue to test on
           the TCK even if the project no longer implements the
           specification.
    
           Apparently, the existing TCKs that we already have can
           continue to be used for "maintenance" purposes. So it may
           not be urgent to sign the contract extension.
    
           Lance notes that many projects have not notified Oracle as
           to self-certification of passing the TCK.
    
           Daniel is willing to continue to be the contact with
           Oracle, and to serve as VP, TCK if necessary.


 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Daniel: draft an ASF policy for projects which need to re-bundle
      other Apache projects.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================

Worked with the AOO PPMC to review proposals for various requests, especially 
repackagers for mobile applications (run off of USB stick, etc.).

External Requests
=================

Several trademarks@ participants as well as members of specific PMCs 
have been providing responses to external questions (either on 
trademarks@ or from their projects) recently which is very helpful; 
often asking for clarifying information or refering to specific 
parts of our documentation that are related to questions.

Trademark Registrations
=======================
Working with DLAPiper on review of proposed assignment of "Flex" mark.

Recieved three invoices from past trademark registration activities 
for the Subversion mark; working with counsel and Subversion PMC 
to verify how we should handle paying them.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising

As of 9 June we have a new Silver sponsor, InMotion Hosting, who 
approached us a couple of weeks ago. As of 13 June, Matt Mullenweg
has upgraded his sponsorship from Silver to Gold. The website has 
been updated to account for both.

We now have a basic system for tracking both sponsorship records and
prospects and the next actions required for them. 

Next on the Fundraising crew's plate is populating the remaining sponsor
records (contact details, sponsorship date, etc), chasing the few folks
who have offered sponsorship but not yet followed through, and following
up on the few sponsors who are due for renewal, or due to make a payment
shortly.

Hopefully the Whimsy based systems we now have will make that tracking
relatively straight-forward.

Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

A healthy amount of discussion, both in terms of volume and demeanor, occurred
this month.  Notable amongst the normal backdrop of discussions concerning
licenses, notices, and trademarks:

* We are asking the board to add Kevan Miller to the Legal Affairs Committee,
  a board resolution to this affect appears later in the agenda.

* Amazon US expressed an interest in entering Apache OpenOffice into their
  store.  The SFLC is reviewing the contract that Amazon provided.

* Our agreement with Oracle for access to TCKs is expiring, and a legal
  review has been requested.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Small Events
------------
The DC BarCamp was held towards the end of May, and was our first small 
event in the region. Attendance was lighter than expected, possibly not
helped by the stunning weather that weekend. However, everyone who came
was very engaged, and the event was very productive with lots of
excellent sessions.

One thing that came out of the DC BarCamp was that those who hadn't 
been to a BarCamp before didn't know enough about how good the event would
be in advance, so struggled to encourage others to attend. All those in the
future events session felt this BarCamp had been excellent, and they wished
they'd known in advance how good it would be so they could have persuaded
more people to come along. It seems we need to provide more general 
information for potential attendees of any Apache BarCamp, including
hopefully some interviews with past attendees. There was a lot of 
enthusiasm for this idea, and several volunteers to help with the content
and interviews, so hopefully we'll see something come out of this in the
coming months.

The 2nd Spanish Apache BarCamp is believed to be progressing with planning.
No other small events are currently known to be in progress. There should
be spare mentor cycles ready for future events, especially into the autumn,
for when people express an interest in starting an event.

We have received the feedback from the board around targeted donations
for small events. There was some concern that the proposed rules might be too 
strict, but not universally. We can hopefully finalise things before the
next meeting, and post some information on the events.apache.org site
about both the targeted donations rules, and sponsorship information for
organisers generally.

General
-------
The Committee TODO List continues to have quite a few items on it. The
high priority things are generally getting done, but at the expense of
lower priority items such as tidying up organisers documentation and moving
it to the new site.

After a somewhat worrying pause, new volunteer energy has been found for
the Apache space at OSCON. Projects who submitted ideas for sessions on
the Monday and Tuesday will hopefully be contacted shortly to confirm
things, and start getting the word out. It looks like we have quite a few
volunteers to help with things on the ground, and thanks to new blood also
hopefully enough organising energies in advance.

ApacheCon Europe
----------------
Discussions, ideas and volunteer energy continues on the public 
apachecon-discuss list. People are gaining experience in what sort of 
calls to action work out best, after the odd false start. Work has begun
by volunteers to put together information on the local area of the venue,
such as where people can look at staying, where to go in the evenings for
food/drinks etc.

After some discussions, it has been decided to finalise the track list
before the CFP opens, to hopefully avoid some issues which have affected past
ApacheCon CFPs. Several track suggestions were received on the public list,
and these are now being formally collated. All PMCs have now been asked
to submit their ideas for tracks, ideally often in conjunction with other
related projects, and IPMC mentors have been asked to include their
podlings as appropriate. Based on this, we can hopefully open the CFP
in early July. Assuming no snags, if we hit the CFP opening in early July
we will be a few weeks behind the ideal schedule, but hopefully not
disastrously late.

Once the CFP is open, we can then concentrate on things like the website,
finalising ticket details etc. We are looking at bringing OpenBastion in
to help with some of the tasks that volunteers tend not to enjoy / tend not
to fit well with variable volunteer energy. This offers the chance for 
OpenBastion to learn how we work, try out ideas for ApacheCon North America
in advance etc. Once the ACNA contract is sorted, we will decide on this
and sort out a contract with an appropriate party. In the mean time,
OpenBastion are kindly helping out already.

ApacheCon North America
-----------------------
A draft contract has been received, and no major objections spotted. The
draft contract is missing a few bits, once we have the a version with these
present we will forward it to legal for review. The producer expects to be
able to announce the final dates shortly, but the last week in Feb is looking
very likely barring unexpected issues. Sally is in the loop on this, and we
can hopefully do an announcement jointly for the ApacheCon NA dates and
the ApacheCon EU CFP + dates reminder.

Volunteers interested in ApacheCon NA are being encouraged to get involved
(often remotely) in ACEU, to try out ideas, see what works (and what doesn't),
help new people come up to speed on the communities etc. This seems to
be largely working, at least so far, and is helping to shape the plans
for ACNA.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

blogs.apache.org has returned to normal service post-upgrade; thanks to Dave
Johnson for the particulars.

Migrated our jira instance to our shiny new phanes/chaos VM cluster and it
seems to be performing rather well now.  Thanks go to Dan Kulp for debugging
the svn plugin for us, as well as culling the jira-administrators group to sane
levels (projects will need to make better use of roles).  Upcoming work to
include flushing the backlog of pending jira imports, which we've now started
with Flex.

Discussed options for "Cloud support" for a certain GSOC project. Conclusion
was that we don't currently have a suitable arrangement worked out with a cloud
provider to offer the ASF the enterprise setup that we'd require.

Did the password rotation dance again- this time there were no malicious
activities surrounding the action.  See http://s.apache.org/zZ for details.
The situation has since returned to normal now that we've reenabled committer
read access to the log archives on people.apache.org.

Discussed java hosting futures with members of the FreeBSD community in
light of the fact that Atlassian does not consider FreeBSD a supported
platform, which at least partially motivated our move of jira from a
FreeBSD jail to an Ubuntu based VM.

imacat added to the Infrastructure Team to help support the ooo wiki and
forums platforms.

Work on new harmonia is currently underway- colocation provided by Freie
Universität Berlin (FUB).  Uli Stärk is our lead on this.

Decided not to pursue a meetup at the Surge conference this year, preferring
to get together at one of the upcoming Apachecon conferences.

Discussed support status for git and documented our plans for bringing
it to a fully supported service over the next 3-6 months, culminating
in the following awkwardly tautologous statement by VP Infra:

    "The infrastructure team has four full time contractors and a variable
    number of volunteers and is committed to supporting both git and
    subversion."

Experienced extended downtime for reviews.apache.org after an OS upgrade
busted our install.  Dan Dumont from Apache Shindig has been assisting
us in recovery- we expect the service to return to active status by
the time of the board meeting.

We've fallen a bit behind in our caretaking of jira issues mainly due
to a number of new graduations from the Incubator.  We'd like to return
the number of outstanding issues to "normal levels" within the next reporting
period, which seems a reasonable goal given the expected (small) number of new
graduations happening this month.

We upgraded people.apache.org (aka minotaur) in light of the recent security
reports from FreeBSD concerning a local root exploit.

Considerable work has gone into scripting various workflows around common
requests like mailing lists, git repos, and CMS sites.  We've subsequently
created infra.apache.org to house these efforts once they've fully gelled
from their development versions at whimsy.apache.org.

Daniel Shahaf is stepping back to part-time for three months starting in July.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
=======

List has started to pick up a little with 3 volunteers coming out to assist
with the run up to AC EU 12. The Tac App should be up in a week or so and so
I expect application for assistance to open around first week of July.

No change to the committee membership.


Other Events
==========

No news about any other events happening at this time.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Abdera Project

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Activity in Abdera has died down. In the last quarter there have been
no releases, no new committers, no PMC membership changes, and no
commits since early March. Its been over a year since the last
release. There was an attempt at another release but it didn't manage
to get three votes. Earlier in the year a lot of work was done on an
Abdera v2 and there has been some discussion about spinning parts of
that off into a separate sub project around Activity Streams. There
are 3 or 4 PMC members intermittently active but its too sporadic and
the lack of activity makes it difficult for anyone contributing.

In the next quarter I expect we'll be discussing if its possible to
continue or if its time to be moved to the attic.

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Accumulo Project

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Releases
None since the last report.

Activity
The mailing lists have been active and there has been an increase to 144
subscribers to the user list and 118 subscribers to the dev list.  The
website is nearing 100,000 page views and has seen more than 12,000
unique visitors.  Development is active and preparations are being made
to release versions 1.3.6 and 1.4.1.  Major development is occurring in 
the trunk (1.5) as Accumulo's custom write-ahead log is being replaced 
with an HDFS write-ahead log, which is showing improved performance
during testing.

Community
One new contributor since the last report.

Issues
None at this time.

The following [article][1] may be of interest to the board. It discusses 
recommendations made by the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding 
the use of Accumulo by the Department of Defense.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache APR Project

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.

Releases
--------

No new versions have been released this quarter and none are in
progress.  The previous stable APR release was in February of 2012 
and the previous stable APR-util release was in December of 2011.
The most recent release of the legacy APR 0.9.x branch was in
September of 2011.

Community
---------
New PMC members or committers: none

About 4 bugs have been opened during the reporting period, with 
2 bugs resolved.

Mailing list activity has decreased sharply during the quarter, as
is typical when a new release is not being discussed.

Development
-----------
Activity has been minimal, with a handful of fixes committed to the
stable branches of APR and APR-util.

Issues
------
There are no board-level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Archiva Project

Apache Archiva is an extensible repository management software that helps
taking care of your own personal or enterprise-wide build artifact 
repository. It is the perfect companion for build tools such as Maven, 
Continuum, and ANT.

Releases
--------

No releases for this quarter 

Community
---------

* A trademark issue was brought to the attention of the Archiva PMC and
the Trademarks committee regarding MailArchiva's plan to rebrand as 
Archiva. An email was sent to MailArchiva regarding the trademark issue
with a suggestion to consider rebranding to a different name other than
Archiva to avoid confusion between the two software products. A 
representative from MailArchiva replied and requested for the trademark
registration details for "Archiva". They also expressed that they still
intend to use the archiva.com domain. We in turn clarified that 
"Archiva" is an unregistered trademark that has been created and 
maintained through use. We also indicated to them that they need to
Archiva as a trademark of the ASF if they will use the archiva.com 
domain. As of this board report, there have been no updates from 
MailArchiva but visiting their web site shows that they are still using
"MailArchiva" as their name and has not yet proceeded with the rebranding. 

Development
-----------

* As reported in the previous board reports, there were a number of planned 
  refactorings of Archiva trunk. Below are the status of each of them: 

  - moving the UI to another framework (in-progress)

  - removal of all plexus components (completed)

  - replace or overhaul the security system used (UI overhaul of current 
    security system used has been done to integrate with the UI refactorings
    in Archiva)

* Because of the overhaul done in Redback (security system), it was 
discussed and agreed in the Archiva dev list that the sources for Redback
be imported to Archiva's source repository. Reference to the thread
discussion is at:

http://s.apache.org/arch

* For Archiva's UI refactoring, the aim is to make it fast and simple, and
to de-couple it with the core. The UI overhaul is more than half-way through 
the webapp, with mostly the administration pages, repository browse and 
search bits done.

* The OSGi integration with Apache Karaf is still in progress. All the
modules in Archiva have already been converted to OSGi bundles. Next step
is to add the OBR (OSGi Bundle Repository) support.

Project Branding Requirements
-----------------------------

* Project Website Basics - done
* Project Naming and Descriptions - done
* Website Navigation Links - done
* Trademark Attributions - not yet done
* Logos and Graphics - not yet done
* Project Metadata - not yet done
* Read PMC Branding Responsibilities - not yet done

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Attic Project

Apologies for missing the report for two months in a row. 
As the late reports indicate, the Attic is currently operating 
at a reduced pace and could really use more people helping out. 
It's not like there is lots of work to do, but it seems volunteers 
are just not there (nor we are seeing projects heading our way). 
The latest two Attic additions (XIndice and Harmony) are still 
open in Jira, though the bulk of work has been done and from a 
public perspective the projects are archived. I hope I will have 
some cycles in the upcoming weeks to tidy things up, but the 
community issue still stands and we could use some help.

Attachment G: Status report for the Apache BVal Project

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No releases since the last report.

### Activity ###
We've seen just a bit of externally-initiated activity in JIRA this month, a
welcome contribution ensuring our codebase is compatible with some minor
compiler changes in Java 7.  Most of the BVal team are spread across various
ASF projects, so we've not yet been able to make good on our intentions to
continue improving the codebase towards a 1.0 release.

Traffic on the user mailing list remains low/nonexistent.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community ###
Some interest indicated by an ASF member who had not previously contributed to
BVal.

### Branding ###
IRIAN donated some graphic design resource time to BVal and has given us a
starting point for a new logo.  We have yet to finalize the community's
preferences for how, if at all, it should be changed before adoption, but
IRIAN's efforts are greatly appreciated!

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.

Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Chemistry Project

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in
Java, Python, PHP, and .NET (and possibly other languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.


== Project status ==

The OpenCMIS (Java) subproject adopted the Android code base that had
been contributed a few weeks ago.
OpenCMIS also added another new component. The CMIS Bridge is a proxy
server for CMIS requests.

The DotCMIS (.NET) subproject received an external contribution that
adds NTLM support.

There is currently no activity around the other two subproject,
cmislib (Python) and phpclient (PHP).


== Community ==

Jean Marie Pascal joined Apache Chemistry. He contributed the
Android code base.


== Releases ==

OpenCMIS 0.7.0 and DotCMIS 0.4 have been released in April.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

Apache Commons provides a large set of reusable Java components. Commons
components are widely used in many projects, both at Apache and outside.

There are no particular problems that would require board support.

For information, a potential denial of service flaw was identified in
Commons Compress (CVE-2012-2098) and was handled promptly as soon as the
Commons project was notified. The problem was inadvertently mentioned in
one message on the public developers list a few hours before the release
(as part of the voting thread). Only one message was involved, all the
replies carefully removing the offending part and focusing on other
details. The release was done very quickly after that. The Commons PMC
sincerely apologize for this error and hope it will not occur again. The
rules for security issues discussions have been recalled to the PMC members.

Several components have been released since last report:
        Commons Math          3.0    (2012-03-08)
        Commons IO            2.2    (2012-03-30)
        Commons Compress      1.4    (2012-04-11)
        Commons IO            2.3    (2012-04-15)
        Commons Parent        25     (2012-04-30)
        Commons Compress      1.4.1  (2012-05-23)

The Commons CSV component has been promoted from Commons sandbox to
Commons proper. A new sandbox component has been started: Commons
classscan. As this new component was started, we have been pleased to
notice investment of code and committers from other Apache TLP (for
example Geronimo and OWB), which is perceived as a good synergy across
the foundation.

Concerning community aspects, a new committer has been elected: Charles
Honton, welcome to him. We are also glad to see Phil Steitz coming back.
The PMC has also changed with the addition of Damjan Jovanovic and Phil
Steitz.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security,
and integration with popular build tools and source control management
systems.

Since reporting in May, progress towards the next release has remained slow.
One user is testing trunk to provide feedback about what is needed before it
should be released. There has been some early indication that the technical
issue we perceived as a release blocker may not be a problem after all.

Despite the quietness, we have the necessary PMC oversight to produce a
release when someone pushes that forward.

The project branding requirements and lack of DOAP file will be addressed in
the process of updating the site for the release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Creadur Project

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source
software related to the auditing and comprehension of
software distributions. Any language and build system are
welcomed.

Project Status
--------------
Creadur graduated from the Apache Incubator in April, 2012.
The handover has been very slow going, but is very nearly
complete. Thanks to the infrastructure team for their help.

Handover
--------
Complete:
* New Chair tasks (subscriptions, update officers, etc)
* Reporting schedule
* PMC bootstrap tasks
* Transfer source
* Transfer mailing lists
* Update issue tracker
* Infra tasks
* Transfer website
* Update incubator records
Pending Next Release (as per guidelines)
* Distribution mirrors

Community
---------
* Creadur needs to rebuild momentum and to attract new
  contributors. Our first steps will be website
  improvements and the first release of Apache Whisker
  (see below).

Infrastructure
--------------
* Thanks to the infra team for a smooth handover
* Our website uses the CMS, and is ready for svnpubsub. The
  community is still discussing the best approach towards
  maintaining content generated by Maven.

Releases
--------
None (yet). The last release happened while the project was
incubating: RAT 0.8 released in November 2011.

We hope to cut the first release of Apache Whisker very
soon. This tool generates and audits licensing information
from meta-data. Helpful for applications assembled from 100s
of components, such as Apache James Server.

Branding and Trademarks
-----------------------
Currently our website doesn't conform to all requirements.
In particular the product subsites need more work.

Community Objectives
--------------------
* Improve impact and visibility of site, and bring the site fully
  into line with the branding guidelines
* Release Apache Whisker 0.1

Issues
------
* None requiring board attention at this time

Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Giraph Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

No Board level issues.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Infrastructure ==

Spammers have forced us to enable the ContributorsGroup feature on our
Wiki.

== Activity ==

Some development activity on the code base to deal with expanding
artifact names that are specified as wildcards.

The dataset of projects built by Gump is maintained by only a few
people contributing across all projects and a few additional people
maintaining the metadata of the projects they are interested in the
most.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.

== Statistics ==

As of Tue, 12 Jun 2012 the ASF installations check out a bit more than
170 source trees (114 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
more than 850 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes about eleven and
a half hours on vmgump and about eight on the FreeBSD jail and seven
and a half on Adam where more projects fail to build.

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ , a
FreeBSD jail at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/public/ and a Mac OS
X Server at http://adam.apache.org/gump/

Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Hive Project

Apache Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Apache Hadoop.  It
provides SQL to query and manage data (in the form of tables and
partitions stored in HDFS or external systems) and provides a
metastore containing metadata information about the stored data.

Releases:

0.9.0 released on April 30, 2012.

Community:

* No new committers
* Normally we report on the total number of contributors here 
  (commented, filed bugs or contributed to Hive), but the "Contribution Report"
  seems to have disappeared from JIRA.
  This was 467 at the last report time (March 2012).  Activity
  streams in JIRA and mailing lists remain healthy.
* A user meetup is taking place as part of the Hadoop Summit June 12.

Branding Checklist:

We've created HIVE-2432 to track this, with sub-tasks corresponding to
each item.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The Incubator continues to guide podlings towards graduation. The shepherd
model we tried last month is working fairly well, with most of the podling
reports this month reviewed both by mentors and the assigned shepherds.
Meanwhile we're still encountering problems with mentor attrition.

o Community

  Suresh Marru, Jakob Homan, Tomaž Muraus, Andy Seaborne, Arvind Prabhakar
  and Mahadev Konar joined and Ian Holsman resigned from the Incubator PMC
  since our last report.

  The following podling is requesting graduation to an Apache TLP:

  - Apache Flume

  The Incubator PMC recommends the board to accept the respective resolutions.
  The IPMC is currently voting on the graduation of the VCL podling.

  The question of community diversity as a graduation issue was discussed.
  See the Flume report for details.

  The following proposals for new incubating projects were accepted:

  - Apache Crunch
  - Apache cTAKES

  Initial proposals for Apache Parser and Apache Busilet were discussed, but
  they still need some work before acceptance.

  The Crunch proposal led to a discussion about how new podlings can or
  should be constructing the initial list of committers. The outcome of
  the discussion was that ideally, when constructing the proposal, the
  project together with its champion and possible mentors should decide
  whether to open the list to any interested people or to simply use an
  existing pre-Apache list of committers. The selected approach should be
  mentioned on the proposal and applied consistently.

  The Kato podling is inactive and we're considering retiring it. See the Kato
  report for details.

o Releases

  The following incubating releases were made since our last report:

  - May 2012: Apache Mesos 0.9.0-incubating
  - May 16th, 2012: Apache HCatalog 0.4.0-incubating
  - May 21st, 2012: Apache Wink 1.2.0-incubating
  - May 24th, 2012: Apache Wookie 0.10.0-incubating
  - June 1st, 2012: Apache Syncope 1.0.0-RC1-incubating
  - June 9th, 2012: Apache Oozie 3.2.0-incubating

  In addition the Apache ManifoldCF 0.5.1 release was shipped under
  the /dist/incubator space as the project was still in process of
  graduating from the Incubator.

  The previously reported discussion about "distribution" releases
  reached a working consensus. See the Bigtop report for details.

  Cutting their first Apache release remains a big step for many
  podlings as seen in this month's report summary.

o Legal / Trademarks

  The Flex trademark licensing deal is progressing. See the Flex
  report for details.

o Infrastructure

  The many graduating projects are producing quite a bit of
  infrastructure work. This situation can be expected to continue
  for the next few months, as the number of podlings getting ready
  to graduate remains high.

-------------------- Summary of podling reports --------------------

Still getting started at the Incubator (2 podlings)

  CloudStack, Crunch

  These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
  towards graduation is yet expected.

Not yet ready to graduate (9 podlings)

  No release:    Bloodhound, Cordova, Flex, Kalumet, S4, Openmeetings, Wave
  Low activity:  Kato
  Low diversity: Bigtop

  We expect the next quarterly report of projects in this category to
  include a summary of their actions and progress in solving these issues. 

Ready to graduate (5 podlings)

  Etch, Flume, HCatalog, Isis, OpenOffice

  We expect these projects to graduate within the next quarter.

--------------------
Bigtop

Bigtop is a project for the development of native packaging and stack
tests of the Hadoop ecosystem.

Bigtop entered incubation on June 20, 2011.

Primary issues blocking graduation:

  - Need for increased diversity and additional committers.

Issues which Incubator PMC and/or ASF Board might need/wish to be aware of:

  A discussion of whether publishing non-ASF, but AL licensed binary
  convenience artifacts as part of Bigtop release is

    #1 consistent with Apache Software Foundation policies

    #2 desirable by Apache Software Foundation

  resulted in a very productive email exchange:
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.incubator.general/35545/focus=35627

  A consensus was reached that doing so does NOT seem to violate any
  established Apache Software Foundation policies

  Given a difference of opinion on #2 a compromise was reached: starting
  from Bigtop 0.4.0 release, the project will vote exclusively on source
  artifacts and it will NOT use ASF infrastructure for hosting the
  resulting binary convenience artifacts. This decision was explicitly
  approved by one of our mentors -- Alan Gates.

Community development since last report:

  Patrick Taylor Ramsey added as a Bigtop committer

  Our regular Bay Area Bigtop meetup/class is going strong with ~15 members
  http://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents/

  Bigtop meetup hackathon attracted more than 20 people:
  http://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents/events/61455472/

  Started submission process for a talk at ACM Bigdata camp

  Major Hadoop vendors/shops are slowly embracing Bigtop and using it as
  a basis of their infrastructure:
  - Cloudera: http://www.cloudera.com/cdh4/
  - HortonWorks: http://drcos.boudnik.org/2012/05/hortonworks-disribution-secretly.html
  - Some uptake at EBay 
  - Some uptake at TrendMicro

Project development since last report:

  - released Bigtop 0.3.0-incubating
  - 0.4.0-incubating is on schedule to be release end of June 2012
  - started working on supporting Giraph
  - started working on supporting Hue
  - started working on supporting Hama
  - used Bigtop to validate Hadoop 1.0.* RC and Hadoop 2.0.0-alpha RC releases
  - used Bigtop to validate HBase 0.92 RC
  - used Bigtop to validate Oozie 3.2 RC
  - increased the # and scope of integration tests
  - major re-factoring of package tests

--------------------
Bloodhound

Bloodhound is an issue tracker derivative of Trac, with the goal of making
deployment easy, and usage intuitive.

Bloodhound has been incubating since December 2011.

The top three issues that need to be addressed to move toward graduation are
still:

  1. Improving community diversity
  2. Lowering the barrier to entry and development
  3. Creating shippable releases and getting user feedback

Over the last three months there has been significant design and development
effort into the project, taking the codebase from being a basic installer to
adding a new interface. The front-end design is considered to be complete at
this stage but more work is required to implement this design. Despite this,
the project remains installable and it has become possible for new developers
to contribute relatively quickly.

No new committers have been added over the last three months but we have had
very welcome patches from new contributors. Activity on the developer mailing
list seems to have reduced which is disappointing. This may be remedied in
part by encouraging more discussion that currently takes place in the issue
tracker to take place in the mailing list.

The target of creating an initial release is ongoing. With the conversion of
most of the interface to a new basic design, it is only completion of a subset
of the dashboard design that should be seen as a requirement for an initial
release. This remains the immediate primary goal of the community, and should
help community diversity by increasing the exposure of the project.

--------------------
CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud orchestration
platform. CloudStack has been in incubation since 2012-04-16

CloudStack has been in the incubator for approximately 1.5 months. Mailing
lists have migrated, accounts for the initial committers have been set up,
and the initial code drop/git repo has been setup. Many new names are now
participating in conversations on the mailing lists, with several of them
volunteering to help move things along. The number of submitted patches from
'new names' in the month of May is in the double digits, and range from
trivial one line fixes to two major patches with over 1,000 changed lines
each. The community is beginning to exercise some of its decision making
power by deciding about release tempo, future version schemes and numbers,
and a number of other internal plumbing issues. Much remains to be done in
preparation for the initial release, and those tasks are being identified.
We also have a number of external resources (bug tracker, wiki, CI) that
are still awaiting migration. 

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

  - The project is using source and binaries with a number of
    non-ASF-approved licenses. This needs remediation.

  - Diversity of the contributor base still needs to be expanded.

  - While we are making progress, there still remains a number of large
    pieces (bug tracker, wiki, test infra) that still need to be migrated
    to ASF infrastructure.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No issues that we are aware of at this point.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  See the above narration, but generally speaking the community is beginning
  to exercise its decision making powers, largely around internal plumbing
  issues at the moment. We are also seeing a number of new developers
  submitting patches. 

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project continues to have many issues to tackle for its first release
  and is identifying and moving forward on those issues. Work continues on
  solutions to remove the need to massive (or any) amount of additional
  hardware to test/develop with in an effort to lower the barrier to
  participate.

Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A large community is losing momentum as it waits for Adobe to
complete the source code transition and infrastructure.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  - Resolve trademark donation or licensing
  - Complete code and bug database donation
  - Make at least one release

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  The ASF legal team will have to agree to a custom Trademark licensing.
  Adobe submitted an initial proposal for the agreement at the end of May.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  Besides the trademark issue mentioned previously, the import of existing
  JIRA bugs is blocked by an issue with Apache JIRA's import utility (INFRA-4380).
  We just got news that this should now be resolved, the PPMC is testing
  the results of the import before activating it.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - Carol Frampton is the release manager for our first release and has
    prepared some initial release candidates.  We are continuing to refine
    the release candidates to respond to various licensing and policy issues.
  - Christophe Herreman was added as a committer and PPMC member due to his 
    offering patches for issues with the release candidates.
  - OmPrakash Muppirala has been leading the development of a tool that
    allows IDEs like Adobe Flash Builder to work better with Apache Flex
    releases.  Justin McLean, Stephen Downs, Roland Zwaga, and Tomasz Maciag
    have also contributed to the tool.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

  Adobe expects to complete the transfer of the mustella test suite.
  We hope to get an initial release approved by IPMC.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?

  Our mentors continue to be very helpful.

  See May 2012 report for other concerns related to JIRA and svn imports,
  but as mentioned above it looks like the JIRA import problems are fixed 
  now.

HCatalog

HCatalog is a table and storage management service for data created using
Apache Hadoop. HCatalog entered Apache incubator on March 2011.

Since the last report:

 - We completed our second release from incubator releasing HCatalog 0.4
 - PPMC voted in Francis Liu as a new PPMC member.
 - PPMC voted in Travis Crawford, Daniel Dai, Vandana A as new committers.

Currently there are 90 subscribers to the user list and 77 on the dev list.
There were 85 and 77 respectively last report (March 2011).

Blockers for Graduation: None. 
We feel we are ready for graduation and will soon start the discussion on the 
list for it.

Isis

Isis is an ALv2 licensed implementation of the Naked Objects pattern. It is
based on contributions of the original Naked Objects Framework along with
a number of sister projects that were developed for the book "Domain Driven
Design using Naked Objects " (pragprog 2009).

Isis was accepted into the Incubator in 2010, September 7th.

Project Development

  - Removing modules that provide low/no value
  - Internal refactoring to simplify codebase
  - Started work integrating with OpenJPA

Community Development

  - Isis has been selected as the basis for a new project
    - expected to include some funding for Isis' development
    - expected to run Jul~Dec 2012
  - Mailing list remains reasonably active, some new correspondents
  - Restful Objects spec now complete, implemented by Isis and
    by (non-Apache) Naked Objects MVC open source project
    - submitted to OOPSLA
    - InfoQ article lined up for publication
    - presenting RO at 1-day conference

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

  - only really one issue: need to demonstrate can bring in at least one
    new committer.  At that point, we feel that we have done enough to
    warrant graduation (as a small but viable community)
  - hopeful that the new project currently starting will yield a new committer
  - the ongoing simplification of codebase should also make the codebase
    more approachable

We don't believe that any of these issues requires Board attention.

New Releases

  - None in this period
  - intention is to release 0.3.1 prior to next report

Kalumet

Apache Kalumet is a complete platform to administrate data center. It covers
the operating system tasks, middleware provisioning, etc. Kalumet entered
incubation in September 2011.

Community Development:

  We are now working on the user guide, developer guide, etc.

  Blogs are in preparation to explain and introduce Kalumet.

Project Development:

  We fixed console look and feel, issue on the model and agent, ready for
  a first release.

  Jira issues have been created to define the roadmap.

  In order to give visibility to the project, we plan to cut off a first
  0.6-incubator release (as preview) next week.

  After the "preview" release, a QA campaign will start, including review
  on the documentation. It will head to a 1.0.0-incubator release.

Web Site/Communication Development:

  The new website content has been deployed, including new sections.
  The documentation (user guide, etc) will be uploaded to the website.

  It's now available: http://incubator.apache.org/kalumet

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of:

  None so far. 

Top issues before graduation:

  - complete and publish the documentation guides (user guide for both
    agent and console, installation guide, started guide, etc)
  - cut off a couple of incubator release

Kato

(Report by the Shepherd)

Sadly, this podling seems to have expired. There has been no traffic on any
mailing lists since last report, and the last words were to the effect that
no one is left with time to spend. The IPMC will most likely wind this up
and store it into the attic before the next report.

Openmeetings

Openmeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white
board, collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using
API functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.

OpenMeetings entered the incubation on November 12, 2011.

Summary:

  Infrastructure and code clearance is done from the developer team and ready
  to be reviewed. JARs are no more in our SVN and a first NOTICE file for
  dependencies is written and to be discussed when the first official
  Release Candidate is nominated. The Release Candidate is basically ready.

  We are just working on some issues with the Flash Streaming Protocol's
  variant "RTMPT", that is Flash Streaming over HTTP Tunneling. RTMPT is
  just a fallback protocol and not the primary used in OpenMeetings.
  Nevertheless it is important to sort that out, as the Tunneling protocol
  is needed for bypassing Firewalls. The RTMPT issue is basically a Red5
  issue and we are hoping to either contribute or find other ways helping
  Red5 community to sort it out.

  Our 3 official GSoC students are doing good and we have weekly meetings
  where we discuss with them their projects. The results of the weekly
  meetings are published to the developer mailing list.

  We have a 4th volunteering student that does his GSoC project even if not
  accepted officially by Google. He does enhance the ATutor plugin for OCAD:
  http://wiki.atutor.ca/display/atutorwiki/Google+Summer+of+Code+2012#GoogleSummerofCode2012-13.EnhanceIntegrationofATutorwithApacheOpenMeetingsWebConferencing

  OCAD Devs have kindly contributed their existing Code under APL
  (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OPENMEETINGS-280) so that the
  student can work on it and contribute his patches to the Apache
  OpenMeetings.

  Community is growing, although not all people have found their way to
  the new mailing list and website yet. But we think that will change as
  soon as there is an announcement with a new release.

OpenOffice (was OpenOffice.org)

* OpenOffice entered incubation 2011-06-13

OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity suite providing
six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF).
OpenOffice is released on multiple platforms.  Its localizations support
have supported 110 languages worldwide.

Most Important Items To Address Toward Graduation

  1. Review of distributed articles to ensure compliance with ASF policy
  2. Given the size and scope of OpenOffice, continue work on "community
     readiness" especially with regard to organization and communication style.

We have started preliminary discussion concerning graduation as we would
like to propose graduation within the next month.

Issues for IPMC or ASF Board Awareness

  - Leaks from ooo-private to outside agencies

  Possible leaks of information from the ooo-private email list are
  being investigated. Our first objective is to first establish if and
  how leaks occurred. Once full details are available we will be working
  to address the issue directly. No action is currently required from
  the board and an update will be provided, at the latest, in our next
  report.

Community Development/Outreach Progress

  Since our last report we have voted in 13 new Committers/PPMC members.

  Since our last report, 2 committer/PPMC members have resigned

  We have improved to act more as a self organized project to address
  and solve project related topics (e.g. forum moderation)

  We were able to initiate transfer of SPI funds formerly earmarked for
  OpenOffice.org to the ASF. However, due to changes in the ASF Fundraising
  chair, this transfer has been postponed. Followup with ASF Fundraising is
  needed to complete this transaction. These funds, as previously discussed,
  will primarily be used for developer travel when needed.

  We accepted an offer from SourceForge to host our older 3.3 version and
  provide client installs of latest release 3.4. This event was accomplished
  after much discussion among members and consultation with mentors.

  Due to heightened interest, we are putting more resources (services,
  volunteers) into translation efforts

  We are more putting effort into addressing trademark and third-party
  distribution requests. Ongoing emphasis as to how to accommodate and track
  these requests is becoming an important concern.

  We are increasing our global reach by recruiting volunteers to help update
  and maintain the large set of native language home pages 

  Established various social programming accounts for additional outreach:
  Twitter, Google+, Facebook

  Setup two additional native language mailing lists

Project Development Progress

  Pootle services for the project were established and used. Translation
  services will be ongoing as new contributors for this service join.

  We released Apache OpenOffice 3.4 on May 8, 2012. This release included:
  - Six different client platform install versions in 15 languages
  - Source tarballs in English
  - Software development kit packaging for 5 platforms
  - Language packs for 15 languages
  Over 3 million downloads the first month.
  A summary of downloads for the installs can be found at:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/stats/timeline

  We are currently working on an alternate repository for category-B code
  to comply with graduation requirements

  An SGA was received from IBM for IBM Lotus Symphony. We are now preparing
  to import IBM Symphony changes into the OpenOffice repository. This should
  be complete by the time of the June board meeting.

  We are putting renewed effort into the "user experience". Apache OpenOffice
  is an end-user product, the best quality product and best experience for
  end users is one of our primary goals.

  Testing and implementation of old update service for OpenOffice has been
  accomplished. This service is for older OpenOffice clients to identify
  updates and, optionally, install an update if available.

  Community support forums remain popular with users but registration seems
  to have stabilized. The ooo-users list also is quite active. As Apache
  OpenOffice is a client product, we continue to investigate ways to direct
  users to appropriate support venues.

  Spam issues with the support Forums (reported in March) has been completely
  eradicated from community English forum with new counter measures (new
  users moderation and new moderators).

  A new root admin (imacat) has been promoted and is now taking the job to
  insure smooth running and consistency with infra requirements.

  The developer list, ooo-dev, now has 409 subscribers and is very active
  with post averaging about 100 per day

S4

S4 (Simple Scalable Streaming System) is a general-purpose, distributed,
scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows
programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous,
unbounded streams of data.

S4 entered incubation on September 26th 2011.

Infrastructure issues

  No infrastructure issues

Other issues before graduation

  1. Still working towards an initial release on Apache with the current
     code (version 0.4 = version 0.3 + checkpointing + bugfixes)

  2. Complete the current work on the new version (S4-piper, 0.5), which
     is a major refactoring that simplifies concepts, API, and introduce
     new features such as dynamic deployment and reliable channels.

  3. Grow the community. The activity around the project has been low and
     the project simply cannot graduate without substantially increasing
     its activity. We expect to get increased interest once we get a release
     out, in particular of the S4-Piper design. We don't have a release date
     yet, though.

     Additionally, committers have been having internal discussions with
     their companies and outside with their colleagues to attract more
     attention to the project. We have been able to attract some attention,
     but unfortunately that attention has not yet translated into more
     activity around the project.

Project activity:

  - 55 Jira issues created to date
  - 10 issue reporters
  - 5 contributors according to Jira
  - Number of users subscribed to the mailing lists: 75 on dev (55 in the
    previous report), 91 on user (72 in the previous report)

Wave

Incubating since: Dec-2010

Description: Wave is a real-time communication and collaboration tool.
Wave in a Box (WIAB) is a server that hosts and federates waves, supports
extensive APIs, and provides a rich web client. This project also includes
an implementation of the Wave Federation protocol, to enable federated
collaboration systems (such as multiple interoperable Wave In a Box instances).

Most important issues are:

  - Building up community.
  - Extending the features set to match the features of Google Wave:
    Full text search, Archiving/Folders, Tags.

Community:

  The mailing lists activity is stable and judging by questions on the
  mailing list - WIAB is already being used by private organizations and
  persons. There are also several commercial/open applications based on
  WIAB, like co-meeting.com and kune.cc.

  Jira Activity:
  - 18 new issues opened since last report.
  - 11 issues resolved since last report.
  Commits:
  - 30 commits to SVN.

Project development:

  Upgraded the search implementation to use Lucene index instead of
  in-memory map.

  Upgraded "Add Gadget popup" - now it allows to search gadgets by
  name/description and also to filter by categories.

  Added more gadgets to the Gadget Gallery - now it includes about
  75 definitions of gadgets supported by Wave.

  Some more small improvements and bug fixes.

Some more developments not yet finished but in progress:

  - Migration to Maven
  - Full text search

Signed off by mentor: Upayavira

  - What is missing is new committers (none voted in since entering the
    incubator) and a release (none made yet). However the report does not
    address these two items.

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  We made the following unstable 2.5.x releases from Jackrabbit trunk.

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.5.0 on June 2nd
  
  The following patch releases were made from earlier maintenance branches:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.12 on April 23rd    
  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.4.1 on April 3rd
  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.4.2 on June 11th
  
  This quarter also saw the first releases from the Jackrabbit Oak 
  subproject:
  
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 0.2.1 on May 7th
  * Apache Jackrabbit Oak 0.1 on April 3rd
  
  Note, there is no Oak 0.2 release since the release vote failed due to a
  license header issue. The issue was quickly resolved and the release re-cut
  into 0.2.1

o Community / Development

  * Unico Hommes and Christian Stocker joined the Jackrabbit team as 
  committers and PMC members.

  * Work on Jackrabbit Oak is gaining momentum: there where two Hackathons 
  in the last quarter during which great progress was made. This eventually 
  lead to the releases 0.1. and 0.2.1 as initially planned. 
  Currently we are discussing whether, how and what we want to contribute to 
  the .adaptTo(Berlin) 2012 conference in September. .adaptTo(Berlin) is a 
  technical meet up focused on the technical stack of Apache Sling including
  Apache Jackrabbit and Apache Felix and is addressed to all developers using 
  this stack or parts of it. Being part of that event would allow us to 
  broaden the community and further spark interest for Apache Jackrabbit Oak.
  
  * Alex Parvulescu has successfully taken up the role of a release manager.

  * There is renewed interest on the OCM codebase, driven by Ard Schrijvers. 
  We expect to be able to cut a new, long overdue OCM release in near future.

  * ModeShape, a JCR implementation from JBoss, is working with us to improve 
  the JCR test suite. To better facilitate this cooperation we may want to 
  split the test suite away from the main Jackrabbit release schedule.  
  
  * Jukka Zitting resigned as chairman of the Jackrabbit PMC due to his new
  role at the Incubator. Michael Dürig was elected and acknowledged as new
  chairman.

o Infrastructure

  We are still in progress of migrating from Confluence to the new CMS.

The Noggit lab is moving out to another location (likely github) so
that it can do releases.  We are still needing to take care of
formality of actually changing its status.  The numbers part of this
report will reflect this next quarter after the formality is
completed.

We accepted and the board Ack'd Leo Simons resignation from the PMC.

   * Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
     www.apache.org included.
     Likely complete, but under review.
   * Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
     footers, etc.
     The main TLP site is converted, subproject sites have not.
   * Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your
     site In progress.  Some have been converted to have TM, some not.
     We don't seem to have ready volunteers on the graphical front,
     so it is slower than we'd like

LUCENE JAVA/Solr

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community is very active. The community
has recently switched to the Apache CMS including several improvements
that increased the number of package downloads significantly.
We recently released Lucene and Solr 3.6.
The community has created the first Lucene 4.0-ALPHA release candidate
and is working towards stable API for the next major version release.

Additionally, we have added one new committer:

* Adrien Grand

Open Relevance Project

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either as it is a niche
area.

PyLucene

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
almost entirely an automated port, so this project will never
require a lot of developers.  The user community is active.

COMMUNITY

  * No change to committer/PMC membership ranks during this period.
  * The dev list has been active.
  * Commit diversity within the existing community is satisfactory and
    continues to improve.

BRANDING

  * We believe that we are in full compliance with the ASF branding
    guidelines.

ISSUES

  * None requiring board-level attention at this time.

Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache ManifoldCF Project

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target repositories
that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Milestones
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012, one day after
the latest major release on May 15, 2012.  Since then there has been a limited
point release as well (on May 22, 2012).

Mailing list activity
==============

The mailing lists have been ported to their new TLP location for about 10 days.
There has been some activity pertaining to certain specific connectors,
especially the SharePoint connector and the need to develop a SharePoint 2010
version of this, including offers of contribution.  Also within the last month
there have been requests for assistance from those using the web connector for
extremely challenging session authentication situations.  The dev lists have
been occupied with getting the releases out the door and looking at a connector
for a new open-source pipeline release.  I am unaware of any mailing-list
question that has gone unanswered.

Committer and PMC membership
========================

The last new committer signed on was in February, 2012.  Since then we've had a
number of offers for contribution from outside the community but insufficient
demonstrated commitment to offer committership or PMC membership to any
individual.  We are actively working to have a broader committer base, as
always, and try to maintain an encouraging attitude towards new contributors.

Branding
======

We are aware of no current violations of the Apache ManifoldCF brand.

Legal
====

A legal issue we are looking to resolve pertains to how we interface to .NET
services.  The ticket is LEGAL-137.  There has been a fair bit of discussion of
the issue raised here but no definitive conclusion as of yet.  Until such time
as I hear back from either HP or Apache Legal about this, we will continue to
treat generated .NET interface documents as copyrightable materials.

Infrastructure
==========

As per the graduation documents [1], I've filed graduation tickets with INFRA
(see INFRA-4841).  We await movement of our web, dist, and svn resources from
our incubator area to their final TLP locations.  After this move, we intend to
request that a Git svn mirror be created also.

ManifoldCF's unique nature (specifically, its purpose of connecting to
third-party and possibly proprietary systems) has led to a significant amount of
back-and-forth on at least one of the infrastructure subtickets we created.  As
a result, we've already revamped our website (CONNECTORS-473), and we are also
in the process of improving our build and release process (CONNECTORS-474).  It
does not appear that the issues raised are sufficient to prevent migration, and
yet migration has not occurred as of this writing.  We have been unable to
complete the setup of the ManifoldCF project for this reason.

We will continue to use Incubator resources until such time as the migration
actually takes place.

Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache MRUnit Project

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 0.9.0-incubating, released on
  May 12, 2012 while in Incubation.
* No new releases are planned currently for the project.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report:
  http://s.apache.org/tV
* Work continues on MRUNIT-69 which is a new/easier to use API

COMMUNITY

* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
  the last report.
* Currently there are:
  - Total of 13 subscribers to the developer list.
  - Total of 12 subscribers to the user list.
  - Total of 10 committers
  - Total of 10 PMC members

ISSUES

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache OODT Project

Apache OODT is a software framework, and an architectural style for
the rapid construction of scientific data systems. It provides
components for data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow
management, resource management and data processing.

Releases/Development:

We're currently VOTE'ing on RC #1 for Apache OODT 0.4. It already
has 3 +1s so there is a high chance it'll go out the door (finally!)

There are over 160+ issues that have been fixed since 0.3 and about
40-50 more that have been addressed since last Q's report. There are
a few lingering issues that won't make it into 0.4 (wrapping up the 
wengine workflow manager updates [1] -- though most of them are already
done -- and some other updates to cas-pge and crawler that won't make
it in). 

We'll try and rapidly roll an 0.4.1 or a 0.5 to fix this soon enough, not
taking another year to get it out the door. We also are working to get 
an OODT PEAR channel [2] up and running.

Community:

The Apache OODT PMC added Billy Webb, Ross Laidlaw and Michael 
Cayanan to our ranks over the last quarter. Ross is currently doing a 
Google Summer of Code project [3] with Apache OODT and SIS.

Branding:

No updates beyond last report. Looks good.

Press:

Jim Jagielski and Chris Mattmann will be giving talks at the NASA,
State Department and VA hosted Open Source Summit [4] in DC 
June 20-21, 2012. Chris's talk will have a distinct focus on OODT,
and Jim's will be talking about the ASF and community.

Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache Pig Project

Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a
high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled
with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient
property of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to
substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle
very large data sets.

Releases:
* Pig 0.10.0 released on 04/25/12.

Community:
* We have two new committers: Bill Graham and Jonathan Coveney. We have one 
 new PMC member: Julien Le Dem

Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.


Status

As usual we had a low levels of traffic in our users mailing lists,
but usually we are able to give an answer on fast time.
Little activity on dev mail list and issue tracker.

Our Mailing lists have these numbers:
   commits -   22 subscribers
   dev     -   71 subscribers
   users   -  188 subscribers
   
Commits since last report (approx): 124 .

On the progress of the project, we are still working on some important fixes
for the 2.0.x maintenance branch, and we have just started some developments
on 2.1 (now on trunk).
Some work has been done even in the Web Site, to update/fix small things, and
to move some content in the Wiki.


Issues

My concern is that during this year only three PMC members are active in the
project and we have two active committers but up to now they have been doing
very little (so for example this is critical even in voting process), so I'm
doing all that I can to try to keep it alive and to expand the community, but
it's a hard task.
I didn't close the remaining Branding/naming issue due to a lack of time, but
I'll do it asap.
Of course I'm available to suggestions and to give more info.


Releases
In May we voted and the released (21 May) our maintenance release 2.0.2 .


Branding/naming issues:
Remaining issues are:
* main site navigation needs some additional links


Legal issues:
None.


Infrastructure issues/needs:
None.


Community changes
Our new Committer (Piotr Kolaczkowski) is ready.
There are no diversity issues regarding the PMC.

Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache Portals Project

Apache Portals exists to promote the use of open source portal technology. We
intend to build freely available and interoperable portal software in order
to promote the use of this technology. With the Pluto project, we provide a
reference implementation for the Java portlet standard. The Jetspeed project
is a full feature enterprise open source portal. The Portals Applications
project is dedicated to providing robust, full-featured, commercial-quality,
and freely available portlet applications.

Status

Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache ServiceMix Project

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that 
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and 
Karaf to provides a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.


Project Status

While we continue to have an active community with good participation from
users on mailing lists, IRC, and issue reporting in JIRA, we also have lost
some of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

With the community objectives mentioned below, we want to ensure a new and
better focus for the Apache ServiceMix project.


Community

No changes since last report.


Community Objectives

One of the things we set out to do was to improve our release schedule in
order to gain some momentum again.  With the initial 4.4.0 release out in
December last year, we managed to get two fix releases out since then.
Our current objective is to work on a ServiceMix 4.5.0 release and then
start doing fix releases on that version as well to ensure we keep our
steady delivery schedule.

We keep on working on the documentation and website to ensure both new and
existing users are finding their way around the project more easily.  One
of the challenges there was the mix of ServiceMix 3.x and ServiceMix 4.x
related content.

Therefore, we recently had a discussion on the mailing list to put the focus
on ServiceMix 4.x entirely and starting to communicate to our user base that
we are no longer planning lots of new activity on the ServiceMix 3.x
branches.  We came up with a plan to do 2 more 3.4.x fix releases until the
end of 2012, but no new minor releases are being planned at the moment.

Attachment AN: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

6/4/2012

DESCRIPTION
      
SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent email
filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited bulk email,
more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to email headers and
content to classify email using advanced statistical methods. In addition,
SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows other technologies to be
quickly wielded against spam and is designed for easy integration into
virtually any email system.

RELEASES

- The release of version 3.4.0 is still imminent.  This release will improve
  IPv6 support greatly.  Our project will aim for an immediate release.

  SpamAssassin.
- Chair of Project attended BarCampDC, Enjoyed it and Would Recommend/Attend
  again.

COMMUNITY
- Many thanks owed to Doug Cutting, Nick Burch, Greg Stein, Christopher
  Schultz, and Tim Williams (and likely some other people I am forgetting) for
  helping me get my rudder in the right direction as chair.

- The project dev list has been active with both committers and community
  members contributing.
- Alex Broens has been added to the PMC.
- Daniel Lemke has been added as a committer.

ISSUES
- We anticipate spending a lot of time migrating code on our zones over the
  coming months because our zones are being end of life'd.
- Rule updates are being published again for the first time since late
  February.

Attachment AQ: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the
development of web application user interfaces.

Releases:
We released version 3.0.0 of the Tiles Framework as Beta
quality. Along with this release we split out the autotag and request
frameworks from the main Tiles project. We released the first version
of these frameworks as beta quality.

This release is revolutionary in that it no longer envisions Tiles as
a framework for generating templates at runtime within Java web
applications. Tiles is now moving towards the goal of being useful as
an offline templating mechanism as well. We hope this will generate
interest from a new class of users.

Community:
Nicolas LE BAS joined the Tiles PMC this quarter and Antonio Petrelli stepped 
down from the PMC. 

The Tiles community continues to be in a slowly regenerating
state. The addition of Nicolas and the departure of Antonio both
signal progress in that direction.  We are hoping the release of the
3.0 line of work will spark more interest in the project and help with
the rebuilding of the community. The autotag and request frameworks
may eventually be spun off into top-level projects, but for now they
do not have a separate community building around them.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment AS: Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases:
No releases since last report (except for some build tooling).

Activity:

Attachment AU: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Voted in a new committer and PMC member: Carl-Eric Menzel
- Several releases have been completed: 1.5.5-1.5.7 and 6.0.0-beta1 and
  6.0.0-beta2
- Work on Wicket 6 is pretty much done.
- Several pull requests have been submitted through github
- An experimental development model has been adopted

Experimental development model

In order to have more development happening at Apache we created an
experimental submodule for our project where new functionality is
developed. These modules are released together with our main product
releases, but are numbered separately. When an experimental module has
matured enough (e.g. has received enough feedback and is considered
stable API wise) it will move to the proper sections of our release and
receive the same number as the major/minor releases of Wicket.

We started with adding websocket/push/atmosphere as an experimental
module and as of Wicket 6.0.0-beta2 the experimental wicket-atmosphere
module was released as 0.1. Once wicket-atmosphere is considered stable
it will be moved to Wicket proper and be numbered 6.1 or what the
release version of Wicket is at that time.

Future expected experimental modules are: Wicket CDI (awaits Seam
framework uploads to the Maven central repository) and Wicket Bootstrap
(integration of the Bootstrap CSS/JS library with Wicket).

With this model we hope to sidestep the "must be stable to be included"
barrier for new developments and to garner additional incentive for
prospected committers to work on our project.

Compliance with branding/trademark guidelines

Only our logo on the webpage does not comply in missing a TM. We're
still working on a new web design and will incorporate the TM in that
design. All other items on the checklist are fulfilled.

The redesign of the Wicket website is taking a lot time, but I hope to
get it done before Wicket 6 is final.

Attachment AW: Status report for the Apache ZooKeeper Project

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed
applications.

There was one new release in the last quarter: 3.3.5 which was a bug
fix release.

Trunk is under development for an eventual 3.5.0 release. So far primarily
code cleanup and refactoring has been applied to trunk.  We intend to do a
3.5.0 release in the next month or so.  Our focus is on scalability, jdk7 and
openjdk support, maven build/rel, testing and audit logging.


Community:

Apache ZooKeeper will be having its second official meetup:
http://www.meetup.com/zookeeperusergroup/events/67732652/

There seems to be good attendance and excitement on upcoming
features/improvements in ZooKeeper.


Mailing list activity continues to be high and we are seeing more
contributor activity than we've seen in past quarters.

* 8 active committers representing 5 unique organizations
* 7 active PMC members representing 4 unique organizations
* 323 subscribers on dev (up from 298 last quarter)
* 653 subscribers on user (up from 597 last quarter)

BOOKKEEPER


Bookkeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance logging
service. The project also includes Hedwig which is a highly scalable
Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper and Bookkeeper with strong
durability guarantees.

Our second release as a sub-project of ZooKeeper, 4.1.0, was released
on June 13th. It fixes 102 issues of both BookKeeper and Hedwig. New
features include JMX instrumentation and a CLI interface to Hedwig.

Infrastructure issues:
There is a minor issue with Jira. One of applications of BookKeeper is
journaling for the HDFS namenode. There has been cases in which we
needed to move jiras from one project to the other, but the current
jira configuration does not allow contributors to move jira
issues. Interestingly, the hadoop jira configuration does allow such
moves, but our request to change the Jira configuration for BookKeeper
so far has not been accepted.

Community building:
Since the previous release, we have started receiving more
contributions from developers across different companies, in
particular Huawei. They have expressed strong interest in the project
due to its coupling with HDFS. There has been smaller contributions
and bug reports from Twitter and Hubspot. In general, we have been
able to grow the community and increase diversity.

Community:
* 42 subscribers to bookkeeper-dev
* 48 subscribers to bookkeeper-user
* 287 issues opened to date, 140 opened since Jan 1, 2012
* 24 reporters of Jira issues, 14 since Jan 1, 2012
* 10 patch contributors

Attachment AX: Status report for the Apache Subversion Project

** Board Issues

The Subversion project has no Board-level issues at this time.

This is a supplemental report since our scheduled May report was late
and abbreviated.

** Community

The mailing list activity continues normally, with discussion on dev@
a bit higher than on users@.

June 11 to June 15, elego hosted a hackathon for Subversion developers
and invited guests. This coincided with their Subversion Day event on
June 14. In past years, the community has found the hackathon to be a
great way to gather and work through problems. Discussion results are
returned to the list for larger community input.

Since our last full report in January, we have added one PMC Member
(Trent Nelson) and two committers (Ashod Nakashian and Vladimir
Berezniker).

In March, Greg queried the PMC on whether it was time to rotate the VP
role. After a short discussion, the PMC confirmed their confidence
with Greg continuing as VP, and potentially reviewing the situation in
another year or two.

** Releases

The project released Apache Subversion 1.7.4 on March 8, 2012,
followed by 1.7.5 on May 17.

The community also put together the (non-Apache) Subversion 1.6.18
release was made on April 12. These continue to be offered from
Subversion's old project home on tigris.org. The release artifacts are
also copied over to archive.apache.org.

Discussion is ongoing, along with development for the 1.8.0 release.
