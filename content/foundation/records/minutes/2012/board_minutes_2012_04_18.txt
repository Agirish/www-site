 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       I spoke about the ASF at an Open Source Think Tank meeting.
       Several groups there are using the Apache license but have
       created their own foundations, usually some form of
       pay-to-play.  I argued that one of keys to Apache's success is
       a meritocratic, level playing field, and that a pay-to-play
       consortium works against this.

       Folks from Citrix contacted me about bringing their CloudStack
       project to the ASF.  I outlined the incubation process to them.
       They also had some questions around publicity and sponsorship
       so I introduced them to the responsible ASF officers.  The
       Incubator has since accepted their proposal for incubation.

       I announced the May 22 members meeting to the membership and
       sent out the calls for board and member nominations.

    B. President [Jim]

       I spoke regarding open source licenses and communities at POSSCON
       last month, down in SC. The slides are available under my
       people.apache.org/~jim account.

       The proposed 2012-2013 budget has been rec'd, scrubbed and now
       proposed for approval. Thanks goes to all those who made this
       task.

       As mentioned last month, I was re-appointed for another 2 year
       term as director of OSI; I still foresee no conflicts. I also
       accepted a role as Advisor to the MARSEC-XL Foundation council,
       arising from my keynote at IOOS 2011 last year.

       The foundation continues to run smoothly, and I am pleased by the
       number and quality of the projects eager to join our happy home,
       as well as the number and quality of projects which make it, and
       become TLPs.

       Our annual members meeting is scheduled for Tuesday May 22, 2012,
       and I will be helping Doug with the backend voter-tool work.

    C. Treasurer [Sam]

       All approved bills are paid with the exception of one wire to Nick
       Burch.  Conveniently, this serves as an illustration of the exact
       type of support I would like to request.

       But first, I will back up.  When I started this role, my first focus
       was on documenting the processes as best I understood them.  I got
       little or no feedback to that effort.  Then I focused on execution -
       paying outstanding bills and sending out 1099's.  My plan was then to
       turn to record keeping.

       The problem with this approach is that I don't want to be a cargo cult
       Treasurer - doing things merely because that appears to be the way that
       things were done in the past.  Nor do I want to be both the architect
       of checks and balances as well as the person who executes on
       transactions.

       While I do have people in mind for the following roles, and have reason
       to believe that they are willing to do the tasks I'm about to describe,
       this time I will merely state the requirements for what I have in mind,
       and we can discuss how to proceed from there.

       For the short term, I want two people to help me.  In the mid term I
       will want a third.

       Short term person number one would be an assistant treasurer.  That
       person needs to have the availability and context to be able to check
       with SVN and be able to independently make the determination that Sam
       initiating a wire to Nick Burch based on a request approved by Ross
       Gardler is a reasonable thing to approve.  That's the scope of what
       that task will entail for the moment.  Jim will be the fallback should
       that person not be available, but we need somebody dedicated to this
       task.

       Short term I also want somebody to define the process which --
       depending on your perspective -- will reduce the need for an audit or
       improve the chances than an audit will not identify any problems.  That
       person needs to have access to our current books and have the authority
       to pay for professional accounting assistance to complete this task.
       Yes, I could be the interface to that accountant, but for now I would
       prefer to have one level of indirection.  Together they come up with
       the definition of how we track what we are doing, and myself and the
       Assistant Treasurer will follow those procedures.

       Mid term I anticipate that I could do with some clerical help in terms
       of entering transactions into the books.  But that necessarily will
       have to wait until after the procedures are defined.

       Discussion: Sam would like to have a short list of candidates
       for assistant treasurer, solicited privately. An audit
       committee would be useful, only active a short time per
       quarter. Continue the discussion on the board mailing list.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       March was a relatively light month for secretary. 37 ICLAs and one
       grant were received and filed. Six accounts were requested at the time
       of filing the ICLAs.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

       No report was submitted.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       Over the past month, we've had a sudden flurry of new
       sponsors. Twitter at the Bronze level, GoDaddy at the Silver
       level, and Citrix at the Platinum level. I have spent time on
       the phone with Citrix, and worked with on-boarding each of
       these sponsors. I am working with their accounting departments
       and will shortly get them listed on our Thanks page. We expect
       to have some additional tweets/blogs talking about these new
       sponsors, in addition to the work done around Citrix' publicity
       about two weeks ago.
       
       As part of the above work, I've also formally signed, and
       committed to svn, a W-9 that we can provide to sponsors.

       Discussion: We need to be careful to make clear that the
       donation of code by Citrix and their sponsorship are
       unrelated. The incubator may yet reject the proposed code
       donation and proposed incubation of the code.

Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Once again, we have had a more normal level of activity, with the majority of
discussions being anchored by a handful (more precisely: six) JIRA tickets.

One notable discussion: we confirmed that if PMCs determine that a codebase
has a single author and there is an ICLA in place for that work that they can
allow it to be committed.

Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Late, short report, apologies from Nick for this.

Small Events
------------
There have been discussions about the 2nd BarCamp Apache in Spain, targeted
for late September. There was some debate about the idea of charging a small
ticket fee, which was largely resolved as being OK if the local conditions
meant it was needed. We hope that the experiences from this event can better
inform future organisers on the pluses and minuses of a small fee.
Otherwise, we all look forward to a good BarCamp!

Some committers in the Netherlands have decided to start organising small
local evening events on a ~monthly basis, in a somewhat similar way to the
existing Berlin get-togethers. We wish them luck, and encourage other areas
with a high density of committers to think about it too.

The OSCON schedule has been announced, with Apache talks included. We intend
to reach out to projects soon (especially those projects with talks, but not
only) about hackathons and talks on the Monday and Tuesday before, when we
have space. We'll also ask about helping on the booth, and possible Apache
crash space.
Planning for the DC BarCamp in about a month is proceeding well.

General
-------
We've setup a TOOD list, for non-immediate admin/organising tasks at
<http://wiki.apache.org/concom-planning/ConComTODO>. We've been less good
about completing them though...

ApacheCon
---------
For ApacheCon NA, a series of questions and concerns were put to the single
RFP bidder, based on discussions and feedback from the RFP proposal. We've
had the answers back from these, discussed them a bit more, and we think
we're close to being ready to hold a vote. If that passes, we'll still need
to work out a contract, for which we may well reach out to some likely
suspects for advice. Thanks to the information from Sam, we now know how to
get the legal checks we need for it too.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Coordinated the installation of aurora (www.eu) in SARA
with Bart van der Schans.  We are now out of free space
in that datacenter.

Our new backup server abi is in service at Traci.
We've arranged for Sam to have access to the joes-local
safe deposit box in an emergency.

Worked out an informal deal with SourceForge to assist
with the delivery of OpenOffice releases.  Whether or
not this continues to be used beyond the first release
is up to the AOO PPMC.

Henk Penning is putting the final touches of providing
optional Apache-mirror support for OpenOffice releases.

Bought an array from Silicon Mechanics for about $12K.
The host to attach it to will be purchased through
Intervision in the very near future.

Updated the AOO bugzilla logins to reflect the fact that
we host the openoffice.org domain but no longer allow mail
for it.

Considering alternatives to directly importing Flex's jira
data into the main jira instance due to repeated failed attempts.
Atlassian refuses to assist us until we can demonstrate the
identical problem on a supported platform.

Submitted our budget for review and approval.

Harmonia's (svn.eu) disk subsystem finally stopped performing
well enough to continue using it as our European svn slave.
Specced a replacement host with Uli Stark's help.

Fleshed out a deal with Freie Universitat Berlin for colocation
services, targetting new harmonia as the first host to deploy there.

Set a soft limit of a combined 1GB worth of release artifacts
dropped onto the mirror system- anything exceeding that figure needs
to coordinate with infrastructure in advance.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
=======

List is still quiet with not much going on currently. 

No change to the committee membership.

TAC is not involved with any events currently.

Other Events
==========

No news about any other events happening at this time. 
(Other than the list of possible events coming up later in the year)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Accumulo Project

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Releases
Version 1.4.0 was released on 3 April 2012.

Activity
The transition to TLP has been fairly smooth.  Mailing lists, subversion
repository, website, project pages, and DOAP file have all been updated.
The mailing lists have been active with hundreds of messages per month
on the dev and commits lists.  The user list is still below 200 messages
per month, but appears to be increasing.  There are approximately 100
subscribers each for the dev and user lists.  Most emails receive
responses promptly.  We anticipate making a 1.3.6 release soon to
supersede 1.3.5-incubating.  Major features to be implemented in 1.5
have yet to be decided, but there are currently 87 open tickets with Fix
Version 1.5.0.

Community
Jason Trost became a new committer on 20 March 2012.

Branding
"TM" has been added to the Accumulo logo and to the first text reference
to Apache Accumulo on each web page.  "Apache Accumulo, Accumulo,
Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache Accumulo project logo
are trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation" has been added to the
footer of each web page.

Issues
INFRA-4571 pointed out a violation of policy on the Accumulo website.  A
committer had put a thrift jar on the Accumulo site because the jar was
no longer available through any maven repository.  The jar was removed
promptly.  Instructions have been added for building the necessary jar
from the corresponding thrift tag.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache ACE Project

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to
centrally manage and distribute modular software components,

   mark
 * Sub-projects need to be reviewed to make sure they are also compliant
 * Documentation and readme files will also be reviewed for compliance

Releases:

 * Apache Apollo 1.1
 * Apache Apollo 1.0

-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Aries Project

Apache Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

Releases

After the significant number of releases last quarter there were no new
releases this quarter. Work is going on in a branch in preparation for a
1.0 release. Bundles and packages will be brought up from 0.x to 1.0 to
better reflect the stability and level of confidence we have in them. This
will also bring our versioning policy inline with that described in the
OSGi Alliance semantic versioning white paper.

Project Branding Board Report Checklist 

Little progress:

* Project Website Basics : homepage is aries.apache.org (done)
* Project Naming And Descriptions : use proper Apache forms, describe
  product, etc. (pending)

continue to be moderately active.

There are no board level issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Attic Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Avro Project

Apache Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

== Issues ==

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

== Community ==

We voted in two new PMC members, Douglas Creager and James Baldassari. 
Douglas has accepted, we are awaiting a response from James.

The mailing lists have been active, user@ had its busiest month ever
(barely) in February, dev@ activity was above average.

== Releases ==
Two minor releases:

Avro 1.6.2 was released on February 15th, 2012.
Avro 1.6.3 was released on March 19th, 2012.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache BVal Project

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
BVal version 0.3-incubating was released April 28, 2011.  The PMC is
currently voting to release BVal 0.4 RC1, which will be integrated
into OpenEJB's imminent TomEE release.

### Activity ###
Recent activity has focused on the 0.4 release, with an eye to the
project's long-term goals (e.g. minimizing dependencies).  Our next
goals are to continue improving the codebase so that we can make, as
soon as possible, a 1.0 release with the best possible interface with
which to provide reliability to our user base.  Discussions in this
regard have already begun.

Traffic on the user mailing list remains low/nonexistent.  As always, we
consider that to be merely in the nature of providing an implementation of a
wider-known specification:  the reference implementation gets the user traffic.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Certain of the features of specification version 1.1.0 duplicate custom
functionality already implemented in BVal; these must of course be merged.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community  ###
The composition of the team has not changed since graduation, at which time
all committers became members of the inaugural PMC.  The PMC is quite diverse
and we are satisfied that no entity has undue influence in our decision-making
process.

### Branding ###
The task of creating a new project logo remains open, though some positive
discussion has taken place and seems to be heading in the direction of
satisfying interested parties.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
We have some outstanding features we'd like to implement on our project
website (specifically a news or blog feed), and may seek advice and/or support
from infrastructure to accomplish this.

Attachment H: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using front-end programming APIs, like JAX-WS and 
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, 
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports 
such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.


Releases:
2.3.9 released
2.4.6 released
2.5.2 released

cxf-xjc-utils 2.6.0 released - utility plugins for JAXB XJC

DOSGi 1.3.0 was released.  1.3.1 currently being released to address some 
compatibility issues with the DOSGi specification.

2.6.0 is in final preparations.   May be released by the time the board 
meets.  (along with 2.3.10, 2.4.7, and 2.5.3 patch release)


Committer added:
No new committers, but discussions started on 2 individuals.   Will likely 
have votes started soon if discussions go well.

PMC:
Dennis Sosnoski added to the PMC

Infrastructure update:
The CXF WebSite was completely moved over to using svnpubsub for publishing.  
Working with Joe Schaefer, we came up with an external exporter that 
buildbot can run that allows our content to remain in Confluence, but meets 
the svnpubsub requirement for publishing.   This process has been "live" for 
over 2 months now and the committers are definitely happy with it.   It's 
working quite well.  


Community updates:
The community has really come together to get 2.6.0 out the door.   There 
has been a significant amount of testing with the 2.6.0 snapshots to make 
sure everything works well.  Every example in the distributions has been 
hand tested to make sure it works and that the README is accurate.   Many 
"outside of Apache" test cases, examples,  and tutorials have been tested.  
The result is that the 2.6.0 migration guide is very complete and we're also 
quite confident in the quality of the release. 

There are also discussions around "Fediz", a potential CXF subproject around 
federated security  that currently is being worked on in the CXF sandbox.  
Interested people have created a potential roadmap and are working on some 
additional ideas for it.

DOSGi subproject did a release to update to the newer versions of CXF proper 
and also add a bunch of enhancements that users asked for.   However, 
shortly after the release, we discovered a couple issues with it with the 
DOSGi TCK (thanks to RedHat for running the tests) which as prompted a patch 
release to fix those issues.   

A research paper was published by Aspect Security and Sonatype at:
http://s.apache.org/gj
(PDF file)  that, unfortunately, did not put CXF (and several other Apache 
projects) into a great light, specifically highlighting 2 security 
vulnerabilities CXF had last year.   On the positive side, we hope that will 
encourage folks to upgrade to the newer versions of CXF.   :-)

15 committers committed changes during the period.    A total of 1345 
commits were done, with 537 of them on the main trunk.  (the rest were back 
porting fixes to branches as well as some work in the sandbox, DOSGi, and 
cxf-xjc subprojects).   From a diversity standpoint, a very large portion of 
the commits (over ~80%) were done by six employees of one company (not 
unexpected), but 9 others did contribute in significant ways.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache DB Project

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o DdlUtils : a small, easy-to-use component for working with
              Database Definition (DDL) files.
 o Derby    : an open source relational database implemented entirely in Java
 o JDO      : focused on building the JDO API and the TCK for
              compatibility testing of JDO implementations.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

== Status ==
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Activities over the last quarter, which has been a quiet one for the PMC:
 1) Apache DB is still not fully compliant with the branding
    requirements. No progress this quarter (same as last quarter).
 2) Discussed an issue regarding distribution of a file without
    redistribution rights in Derby. Changes are being implemented.
 3) Discussed an incoming new project proposal (proposed once before)
    and answered the inquiry.
 4) Three PMC members have flagged their interest to be mentors in 
    Google Summer of Code.

== Community ==
No PMC changes since August 2011.
No new committers since August 2010.
Traffic on the user lists is pretty low. User questions are being answered.

== Releases ==
No releases this quarter.
Derby is working on the 10.9 feature release.
JDO is working on the 3.1 maintenance release.
Torque is working on the 4.0 feature release


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Deltacloud Project

Deltacloud defines a web service API for interacting with cloud service
providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In
addition, it consists of a number of implementations of this API for the
most popular clouds. 

Their are no issues for board consideration

Community
---------
No new committers

Releases/Development
--------------------

Released Deltacloud 0.5.0 on 2012-02-02

Work on DMTF CIMI front-end continues to progress. Updates/improvements to
various drivers (OpenStack, OpenNebula) Lots of bug fixes and smaller
improvements.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Directory Project

The Apache Directory Project provides directory solutions entirely written in
Java. These include a directory server, which has been certified as LDAP v3
compliant by the Open Group (ApacheDS), Eclipse-based directory tools (Apache
Directory Studio) and a client API that can be used to communicate with any
directory server (Apache LDAP API).

-- Community --
* No new committers.
* No new PMC members.

-- Development --
* Apache Directory LDAP API:
 * Three releases during this quarter.
 * Mainly bug fixes and feature stabilization.
 * The use of the API inside Apache Directory Studio 2.0 has greatly helped
   discovering new bugs and stabilize the features.

* ApacheDS:
 * Three releases during this quarter.
 * These releases contains small bug fixes and were meant for inclusion 
   inside Apache Directory Studio.
 * In the meantime, major works are still underway on these topics:
   * a transaction mechanism on top of our backend implementations
   * a review of the indices system
 * An important vulnerability has been discovered very recently in the ApacheDS
   1.5.x branch which allows authentication with the direct use of the hashed 
   password as credentials. Considering that the ApacheDS 1.5.x branch is 
   almost dead, we are in the process of documenting it on the website and 
   moving our users towards the 2.0 milestone versions (which are not affected 
   by the issue).

* Apache Directory Studio:
 * Three releases during this quarter.
 * A first milestone version, followed by 2 other ones, has finally been 
   released for Apache Directory Studio 2.0. 1 year and 9 months after the 
   latest released version (1.5.3) back in April 2010.
 * These releases have been very well received and users provided us important
   bug reports that helped us stabilize it.
 * Following an incubator email, we've discovered that Apache Directory
   Studio's usage of some external binary libraries (contained in the source 
   release) was not appropriate and we are working to get this fixed during 
   the next quarter for our next releases. 
   
* Website:
 * An update of the ApacheDS website is required ASAP to let our users know 
   about the authentication vulnerability and make it clear that they should
   use 2.0 milestone versions instead.
 * We also need to start thinking about the migration of our entire website to
   use svnpubsub instead of Confluence.

-- Releases --
* Three releases for Apache Directory LDAP API:
 * 1.0.0-M9 (January 18th 2012)
 * 1.0.0-M10 (February 7th 2012)
 * 1.0.0-M11 (February 29th 2012)
* Three releases for ApacheDS:
 * 2.0.0-M4 (January 18th 2012)
 * 2.0.0-M5 (February 7th 2012)
 * 2.0.0-M6 (February 29th 2012)
* Three releases for Apache Directory Studio:
 * 2.0.0-M1 [2.0.0.v20120111] (January 18th 2012)
 * 2.0.0-M2 [2.0.0.v20120127] (February 7th 2012)
 * 2.0.0-M3 [2.0.0.v20120224] (February 29th 2012)

Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Empire-db Project

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that
allows developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application
development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow
highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of
compile-time-safety and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

Apache Empire-db became a TLP in January 2012. The migration from the
incubator has been completed. We just shipped our first Apache Empire-db
top-level release and since this is our third monthly report we can now
switch to a quarterly reporting schedule.

Changes in committers or PMC members

Benson Margulies was added as PMC member. Benson has been with us
for a long time as mentor in the Incubator and we somehow forgot to add
him to our graduation resolution.

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

Releases

Apache-Empire-db 2.3.0 was released on 02 Apr 2012, this is our first
top-level release.

Attachment O: Status report for the Apache ESME Project

Apache ESME's mission: Enterprise Social Messaging Environment (ESME) is a
secure and highly scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that
allows people to discover and meet one another and get controlled access
to other sources of information, all in a business process context.

Releases:
2011-08-29 1.3

Development:

We are continuing work on our 1.4 release.  We hope to focus on Akka
and Apache Camel integration.

The level of development activity has decreased dramatically the last
3 months. We just had a few commits dealing with older issues. We are 
trying to refresh the community with new developers but this is 
proving more difficult than expected.

Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Geronimo Project

Apache Geronimo is an open source server runtime that integrates
the best open source projects to create Java EE / OSGi server 
runtimes that meet the needs of enterprise developers and system
administrators.

The community remains active on the dev and users mailing lists. 
There have been recent discussions regarding release schedules 
for older geronimo releases 2.1.x and 2.2.x.

RELEASES

The community released the following during the last 3
months: Geronimo Tomcat, Geronimo JSP specs, Geronimo samples &
daytrader, and Geronimo Eclipse Plugin.

The community has begun discussions for Geronimo 3.0 server 
and XBean releases.

NEW COMMITTERS

Xiao Yi (John) was voted in as a new committer on the project.

SECURITY

The Geronimo Tomcat release was needed to pick up the Tomcat
security fix in Tomcat 7.0.23.

Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Gora Project

Apache Gora

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and
persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key
value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The last official project release was made on 24/09/2011 which was the
0.1.1-incubating release (2nd whilst in the Incubator). Since last
reporting there have been few commits but the ones we've seen
have been fairly significant. The community is currently in discussion
regarding a 0.2 release candidate and it is hoped that we will see a 
Gora 0.2 release by mid/end April.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Activity shadows last months average, with nothing exceptional taking place.
A blocker issue with our usage of a particular sql library has been dealt with,
additionally Keith Turner was able to commit his gora-accumulo module, as the 
distribution of Accumulo was released and available for us to use. Ferdy 
committed a nice piece of work which now provides users with the ability to 
properly support multiple data store implementations in parallel. We've also
seen keen interest for our proposed GSoC project which is to add a gora-Amazon
DynamoDB module to the project and look forward to picking up traction with 
this in the near future. Finally our Hadoop core and test dependencies have
been upgraded to Hadoop 1.0.1 which also paves the way for the Avro upgrade
post 0.2 release.

How has the community developed since the last report?

We recently received (rather encouragingly) that someone struggled to
join the user@ list. This was because this list did not exist, it has
however now been created. We've had some questions coming into the
project regarding the hbase module, and whether or not we were going
to support certain features within Gora, however unfortunately none of
these issues lead to any commits from outside the existing community.

Changes to PMC & Committers

NONE

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of projects including,
Nutch, Tika, OODT, Camel, Solr, Accumulo & Hadoop (this is not an exhaustive
list). There is work to be done with the Avro implementations, so once we
are 100% ready to work on these issues, we will be looking to interest
members of the Avro community in Gora. It would also be nice to attract 
members of the Hector and Cassandra community so we will work towards this
goal. 

Project Branding or Naming issues

NONE

Legal issues

NONE

Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The biggest Incubator news since our last report is the CloudStack project
seeking to enter the ASF. This and other topics as summarized below have
kept us busy lately. At times the related discussions have gotten a bit
heated, but for the most part the Incubator is functioning acceptably.

The overall trend currently is for more podlings to graduate than are coming
in as newly proposed projects. Given the backlog of stuck projects and the
recent focus on pushing then forward this trend can be expected to continue
at least for the next few months.

o Community

  Chris Hostetter, Leo Simons, Michael McCandless, Ted Leung and William Rowe
  resigned from the Incubator PMC since our last report.

  The following podlings are requesting graduation to Apache TLPs:

  - Apache Creadur
  - Apache Jena

  The Incubator PMC recommends the board to accept the respective resolutions.

  We received a proposal to accept the CloudStack project as a new podling.
  The proposal has received quite a bit of excitement and many volunteer
  mentors. On the other hand there were some concerns about the publicity
  around the proposal (current Incubator policy prohibits publicity-seeking
  in the proposal phase). Another issue of note is the handling of patents
  that was raised as a potential issue for the proposed podling. The vote
  to accept CloudStack for incubation is currently in progress.

o Legal / Trademarks

  The Flex podling continues working on a custom trademark licensing deal
  with Adobe. See the Flex report for mode details.

  A point was raised about including the project branding checklist in
  podling graduation criteria. This seems like a useful change, though the
  details are still to be worked out.

o Releases

  The following incubating releases were made since our last report:

  - March 12th, 2012: Apache Tashi 201203-incubating
  - March 20th, 2012: Apache Rave 0.9-incubating
  - March 23rd, 2012: Apache Jena Fuseki 0.2.1-incubating
  - March 27th, 2012: Apache Flume 1.1.0-incubating
  - April 2nd, 2012: Apache Bigtop 0.3.0-incubating

  Apache OpenOffice used Apache mirrors to distribute binary security
  patches for fixing the CVE-2012-0037 issue in OpenOffice.org 3.3 and
  3.4 beta. Even though the /dist/incubator area was used, this wasn't
  considered an official Apache release and the distribution was not
  formally blessed by the Incubator PMC. See the OpenOffice report
  about the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the patch.

  A notable discussion came up in relation to a release candidate by
  the ManifoldCF podling. Based on more or less standard practice in
  many Ant-based Java projects in and outside the ASF and related
  mentor guidance the podling was including libraries from upstream
  projects as binary dependencies inside the source release package.
  It was pointed out that an Apache release must contain nothing
  that isn't included in source form, and rough consensus from the
  resulting discussion agreed with this view. The ManifoldCF release
  candidate was withdrawn and is being revised for this, but the
  broader issue of many Apache projects shipping binary dependencies
  inside their source releases still remains. Board guidance on
  how projects should deal with this regarding both current and past
  releases would be appreciated.

  Followup discussion and related feedback from podlings suggests
  that our existing release documentation is not up to the task of
  providing clear and consistent guidance to support our projects.
  More work in this area is clearly needed.

o Infrastructure

  The Flex project continues to have trouble with their migration to
  Apache infrastructure as explained in more detail in their report.
  A suggestion was made that, if possible, they could/should use
  external infrastructure to avoid blocking development until the
  migration issues have been resolved. This is in line with other
  podlings that have migrated their infrastructure to Apache gradually
  in smaller steps.

  More generally with complex podlings like OpenOffice, Flex and the
  proposed CloudStack project stressing infra resources and the steady
  flow of various Incubator-related infrastructure issues (especially
  around podlings entering and existing the Incubator) we feel that
  the Incubator is putting quite a bit of load on the infrastructure
  team. It would be great if the foundation could help through increased
  funding or other help to infrastructure.

  One proposal that was discussed for helping the life of both podlings
  and infrastructure was about allowing new podlings to set up their
  infrastructure directly at the expected final TLP locations. The details
  of that proposal are still open.

  Due to spamming the Incubator wiki was configured to require explicit
  authorization of new contributors.

-------------------- Summary of podling reports --------------------

We reviewed all podlings reporting in this quarter and categorized them
according to their progress through the Incubator and the most pressing
issues that are currently blocking progress.

Still getting started at the Incubator (2 podlings)

  DeviceMap, Syncope

  These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
  towards graduation is yet expected.

Not yet ready to graduate (17 podlings)

  IP clearance: -
  No release: Any23, Cordova, DirectMemory, Flex, JSPWiki, Mesos, OpenOffice
  Low activity: AWF, Celix, EasyAnt, Kitty, VXQuery
  Low diversity: Chukwa, Kafka, ODF Toolkit, Oozie, Tashi

  We expect the next quarterly report of projects in this category to
  include a summary of their actions and progress in solving these issues. 

Ready to graduate (1 podlings)

  Giraph

  We expect these projects to graduate within the next quarter.

-------------------- Detailed Reports --------------------
Any23

Anything To Triples (any23) is a library, a web service and a command line
tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web
documents. Currently it supports the following input formats:

  - RDF/XML, Turtle, Notation 3
  - RDFa with RDFa1.1 prefix mechanism
  - Microformats: Adr, Geo, hCalendar, hCard, hListing, hResume, hReview,
    License, XFN and Species
  - HTML5 Microdata: (such as Schema.org)
  - CSV: Comma Separated Values with separator auto-detection.

Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011.

The community has seen steady levels of traffic with the dev list receiving
281 hits in March; an increase from the previous month.

One very interesting thread related to the webdatacommons.org project, which
recently used Apache Any23 to extract embedded structured data from web
pages. The project scales to cover several billion web pages, so we are
very confident that the Any23 community is growing interest, this news
reflects that view.

We were recently contacted by the W3C's Semantic Web Activity Lead
(Ivan Herman), and have been invited to provide an EARL report of Any23's
test results with regards to the RDFa test suite, so that we could include
it into http://rdfa.info/earl-reports/ We have been given until the end of
April to submit.

We are very close to VOTE'ing on the 0.7.0-incubating release (1st during
incubation), and Simone Tripodi has stepped up as release manager. We are
currently discussing when to push for the RC.

Chris Mattmann is investigating the use of Any23 as one potential component
in implementing GeoSPARQL, along with Jena, Tika and Apache SIS.

AWF

AWF is a non-blocking, asynchronous, event driven high performance web
framework running on the JVM. The project entered incubation on 2011-07-08.

The project has been renamed from DEFT to AWF, all the mailing-lists, web
site, JIRA etc have been migrated.

We have had few activity this quarter:

  - Still working on getting our first release out
  - Some bugs have been fixed

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - On one hand Roger does not have any more time to work on the project
  - But on the other hand there is a new potential committer. His
    recommendation is being under discussion 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  - Not at this time.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Still working on getting our first release out

NOTE: It was questioned if this project was viable as the activity remains
low, but the team thinks that it's a temporary situation due to individuals
being swamped into day job and change in family situation, so the decision
to pursue the effort has been agreed on.

--------------------
Celix

Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.

Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.

The last month we received or first large code donation, the code still has
to be added to the project. This code is an implementation of the OSGi Device
Access specification for Celix and has been made by Thales Netherlands.
Together with this donation a new committer (Pepijn Noltes) is accepted.
Pepijn has developed and will maintain the Device Access code.

We have also been working on a graduation plan which is included below.

Most important issues are:

  - Improve robustness (APR, error handling etc), resulting in a first release
  - Update/Implement remote services for interoperability with Java OSGi
    (Apache Felix)
  - Generate awareness and grow a community!

Graduation Plan

  Celix is in incubation since November 2010. During the first one and a half
  year talks where given at several conferences (EclipseCon, ApacheCon, OSGi
  User Group meetings, etc). Even though there seems to be an interest in
  the project, two important questions keep coming up:

  - What is the state of the project?
  - Why no support for C++?

  Trying to answer/solve these two questions might make it able to attract
  more community members. So this plan will focus mostly on these two items.

State of the project

  - Releases

    Celix entered incubation in its early stage. There was only a proof of
    concept, but no complete implementation. This is an important reason for
    people to hold back and not yet use/improve Celix, on the other hand,
    being hesitant also keeps Celix from growing towards a more stable/robust
    solution. To be able to use Celix the implementation has to reach, at
    least, a more stable state. Over the past year lots of effort has been
    put into this. Within the next half year a release has to be made of the
    core component of Celix. Hopefully this will attract more users/testers
    (and potentially committers). Since a formal release takes quite some
    effort, it might also make sense to provide snapshots (with documentation)
    to be able to reach more people.

  - Committers

    During the last months there has been an interest from Thales Netherlands
    to use Celix in its middleware. In a research project they are working on
    an implementation of the Device Access specification. This implementation
    is donated to Celix, and the main developer has expressed the intention
    to maintain the code base. Via this path a new committer has been added
    to Celix [1][2]. But to be able to have a diverse community more
    committers are needed. Having a release makes it easier for people to use
    and improve Celix. This is one step towards more committers.

    [1]: http://markmail.org/thread/hfwuspl3swoisenq
    [2]: http://markmail.org/message/q4n7562jvngd33s5

  - Technical state

    One of the important aspects of Celix is interoperability with Java OSGi
    through remote services. Currently Celix has basic support for Celix to
    Celix remote services, following the Remote Service Admin specification
    of OSGi. This implementation has to be improved and extended to comply
    better to the specification. Also a Java OSGi implementation has to be
    made which can interact with the Celix implementation. Some existing
    open source solutions are available, but are either to large for our
    intended target platforms or rely on to many other libraries (for
    example XML handling etc). To be able to have an implementation which
    fits the environment ((de)serialization and protocol) it makes sense to
    implement a simple solution ourselves. Having functional remote services
    makes it easier to use Celix in a mixed Java/C environment. This solution
    can also be positioned as an alternative to JNI with the benefit that the
    Java and C components are separate processes. If either one crashes the
    other part is kept running, resulting in a more robust solution.
 
C++ Support

  - Technical Scope

    Currently Celix is limited to C only. This was a deliberate choice since
    Celix tries to target  embedded/constrained platforms. But during talks
    people also seem to be interested in C++ support. Extending the technical
    scope of the project might attract more users and committers. Over the
    next half year we will work out a plan how C++ support can be added
    without impacting the current supported platforms. A start with the
    discussions has been made on the mailing list, see [2] for more information.

    [3]: http://markmail.org/thread/a3qltqhsocmrnerd

  - Cooperate with existing C++ OSGi like implementations

    In [3] a list of similar projects is mentioned. Reaching out to these
    projects and trying to find a common ground on requirements/API etc
    could benefit Celix (and those projects as well).  To see if there is
    a common ground we need to contact those projects and plan a meeting.

Chukwa

Chukwa is an open source data collection system for monitoring large
distributed systems. Chukwa is built on top of the Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS), HBase and Map/Reduce framework and inherits Hadoop’s
scalability and robustness. Chukwa also includes a flexible and powerful
toolkit for displaying, monitoring and analyzing results to make the best
use of the collected data.

  - Chukwa 0.5.0 has been released
  - New committer Ahmed Fathalla has been voted in and granted proper karma
  - Mentor William A. Rowe Jr resigned
  - Alan D. Cabrera volunteer to become new mentor
  - For Chukwa 0.5.0 release, the majority of code has been contributed
    from single individual.
  - There are questions raised by mentors that there should be more
    diversity of the contribution from the community.
  - There are increased activities on user mailing list in the past
    month, but momentum and traction is still a concern.
  - More to the point, we had a discussion whether or not to continue
    Incubation for Chukwa. The consensus was that it's worthwhile to wait
    for the project to get traction a little longer.

DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images
and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.
smartphones and tablets.

Entered incubation on January 3rd, 2012.

There are no issues that require the Incubator PMC's or the board's attention.

The project is still slowly ramping up. We have started to flesh out our
website, created some initial prototypes for data collection of mobile
device data and setup a VM at http://devicemap-vm.apache.org/ to experiment
with those prototypes.

DirectMemory

(incubating since October 2011)

Apache DirectMemory is a multi layered cache implementation featuring
off-heap memory management (a-la BigMemory) to enable efficient handling
of a large number of java objects without affecting JVM garbage collection
performance.

There is only one important issue to address in the move towards graduation
- understanding process/decision making guidelines (new committer process
is undergoing testing, release process still yet to be worked out)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of

  - None

How has the community developed since the last report

  - Tasks and proposals contributed by non-committers
  - The team has up-voted a new committer

How has the project developed since the last report.

  - An important contribution (the integration with EHCache, the most used
    caching system) could spread adoption and community attention
  - A talk of DirectMemory should be presented at DevoXX France (thanks to
    Olivier Lamy)

EasyAnt

EasyAnt is a build system based on Apache Ant and Apache Ivy. Incubating
since 2011-01-31.

Towards graduation, we need to:

  - Create a release
  - Build a community

Since the last report:

  In the last report we described that the activity of the podling was quite
  low. Some discussion with developers and mentors raised about this concern.
  Developers acknowledged that the current code refactoring make it's build
  break too much to keep people interested in contributing. Developers are
  still motivated even if most lack of time. The conclusion is that the focus
  should be on doing a release ASAP to keep things going on and bring back
  stability.

  Some discussion started about the last points to tackle before preparing
  a release.

Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A highly energetic community waits for Adobe to complete the
source code transition and infrastructure.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  - Resolve trademark donation or licensing
  - Complete code and bug database donation
  - Make at least one release

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  The ASF legal team may have to agree to a custom Trademark licensing.
  Adobe is currently evaluating the parameters of a custom Trademark license
  proposed by an ASF Board member.  If approved, a custom agreement will be
  drafted and signed by both parties.  Apache is waiting on Adobe to approve
  the latest Apache proposal.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  Besides the trademark issue mentioned previously, the import of existing
  JIRA bugs is blocked by an issue with Apache JIRA's import utility. It has
  failed to import the data file supplied by Adobe. Infra has opened a support
  ticket with Atlassian, but the problem remains unresolved one month later.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - The Flex compiler source code, including history, was donated to Apache.
    It is pending import into the SVN repository
  - Other initial committers have donated code to the whiteboard.
  - Martin Heidegger was accepted as committer to the podling.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

  Adobe expects to complete the transfer the mustella test suite.
  We hope to make progress on an initial release.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?

  Our mentors are great. We are wondering if Apache has considered giving
  large projects like Flex their own SVN and JIRA servers. Recently, we pushed
  really hard to get a software grant signed (An Adobe VP even came in
  to sign it while he was taking time off to move to a new house) in order to
  try to make the weekend deadline for getting code imported into SVN.  We
  are in a hurry because we have seen signs we are losing momentum (mailing
  list traffic is much lower) and a key Flex conference is coming up on
  April 15. Being able to announce that new code was in SVN would be a good
  boost and good timing.

  We submitted a software grant and code on Friday afternoon, but were 
  too late to have the secretary record the software grant and that meant 
  that Infra couldn't import the code since they only do that on weekends, 
  and so we are now waiting for the next weekend.  Having our own separate 
  SVN repository would make weeknight imports possible and maybe not tax 
  a single database as much.  Large projects like Flex have tons of files.

  The same holds true for the bug database as well.  We submitted the
  JIRA import file on Feb 1.  Infra has been unable to get the import to
  succeed (it worked on a test instance on my computer) and has had to file
  a bug with Atlassian (JIRA's maker).  We asked about using the SOAP
  interface to import bugs but Infra is concerned that some problem in
  that process would screw up JIRA for everyone and/or cause performance
  issues.  Having our own JIRA instance would allow us to try alternate 
  means of getting around the JIRA issue.  A SOAP import utility exists and 
  was used to successfully import all 30,000 issues into a test instance
  but there is risk of having some other issue show up when we add that many
  issues to an existing database.

JSPWiki

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

As a result of discussing in the dev-list, the objectives for graduation have
changed: the first Apache release will be based on 2.8 (package-renamed),
which is  battle-tested, being the plan to evolve from there.

4 JIRA issues were fixed since last period, and tests are now part of the
main build.

The main issues blocking graduation now are resolution acceptance, and
community and IPMC graduation vote.

Kafka

(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011)

Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe
messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence
of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the
message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading
data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.

A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards graduation

  - Invite diverse new active committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  - None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Added a new committer.  Continued contribution to source code in fixes
    and features and continued activity on the mailing lists.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Work was begun on 0.8 release which includes our replication feature and
    also requires a breaking change for existing consumers/producer to the
    wiring protocol.

Kitty

The Kitty Project is a lightweight, production focused, Java-based
application server performance diagnostic and management utility. Kitty
is written in Groovy.

The project entered incubation on 2010-10-03.

In order to get graduated, Kitty needs the following features:

  - The ability to save profiles of commonly connected to jmx servers
    including groups of tomcat servers
  - The ability to collect metrics on an aggregate group of JMX servers

There are no issues that require the Incubator PMC's or the board's attention.

The community hasn't grown since the last report.

The project had some contribution as far as code is concerned, but the
mailing list had no new threads started nor old threads had new contributions.
Changes were related to the management of the console output, and some
re-engineering in order to begin working on the missing features.

OpenOffice

Out-of-Band Report

On March 22nd we issued a security bulletin and patch for a vulnerability
reported in OpenOffice.org 3.3, the last released pre-Apache version of
OpenOffice.

Technical details of the issue and patch can be found in this announcement:

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-ooo-announce/201203.mbox/%3CCAP-ksoj7o5%2B2YH-E4XzR044V0e3YZfZvuef7eJuNGhdy%2Bk9kyA%40mail.gmail.com%3E

The IPMC and Board should note that this extraordinary patch was made
available, as a courtesy to the ecosystem, based on the severity of the
reported vulnerability and the ease of exploiting it.  The patch was made
available under ALv2, and distribution was done via the Apache mirrors,
although this did not constitute an official release.

Because of the required secrecy around the preparation of such security
patches, a minimum number of Apache members were involved in vetting this
release, though we did try to touch all bases by involving mentors, Infra
and Legal Affairs.

--------------------
Tashi

Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.

The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud computing 
on massive internet-scale data sets (what we call Big Data). The idea is to 
build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that are stored in 
a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and computed on by 
remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.

Tashi originally encompassed just the tools to manage virtual machines 
using Xen and QEMU, but has been merged with Zoni, which manages the 
physical aspects of a cluster like power control, network settings and 
handing out physical machines.

In the period from January to April, the project had received permission
to publish a release. Shortly thereafter, a further release was
approved, incorporating several bug fixes detected during deployment
of the first release and from Jira reports.

In the process of making our first release, contact to two of our three
mentors was re-established. The third mentor has not been heard from
(also in other parts of Apache) for quite a while. We obtained sufficient
administrative access to Jira to manage our problem reports.

Development efforts this period have mainly been in adding resilience
to Tashi components, as well as returning more helpful messages in case
of errors. Some parts of the code base that were relevant only to Thrift
have been removed.

Upcoming software goals are to investigate what is needed to support IPv6,
considering replacement for RPyC and providing the ability to hand
out server slices (operating system level virtualization).

The project has a user community, but it is small. Growth mostly has
happened by word of mouth. To show potential users at large the
utility of this project, the author of this report will apply some of
the advice posted to general@apache.incubator.org, as well as create
web pages demonstrating the project's utility, provide sample VM images
and disseminate other information relating to the deployments close to him.
He will also urge others to make similar information publicly available.

One of our users has requested the creation of a private branch for his
team to work on. Perhaps this will result in a valuable feature addition
to the project.

Items to be resolved before graduation:

  - Generate more publicity for the project.
  - Develop members of the user community to submit feature extensions.

VXQuery

The VXQuery Project implements a standard compliant XML Query processor.
It has been in incubation since 2009-07-06.

Recent activities:

  - change of the focus of the project (the previous focus was to be
    flexible wrt the representation of the data model, the new focus
    is parallel processing of large amounts of XML data)
  - renewed development activity
  - 2 proposals for GSoC (1 person expressed interest in working on
    VXQuery for GSoC)

Top issues before graduation:

  - Build community

    VXQuery's community is still the initial (very small) community
    The goal of the change of focus to attract more interest in the
    project and to increase the size and diversity of the community

  - Create a release

Attachment V: Status report for the Apache JMeter Project


The Apache JMeter desktop application is a pure Java application
designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

Version 2.6 was released on Feb 1st.
This included many fixes and major improvements to the GUI.

Work continues on fixing bugs and implementing new features and
generally tidying up the code.

We have discussed requiring a minimum Java 1.6 for the next release.
There were no objections from the dev or user lists so we will do so
when it is appropriate.

There have been no changes to the PMC or committers since the last report.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
the committers.

As previously reported, it is believed that all the branding
requirements have been completed.

There are no board level issues at this time.

Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Nutch Project

DESCRIPTION

Apache Nutch is an open source web-search software project. Stemming
from Apache Lucene, it now builds on Apache Solr adding web-specifics,
such as a crawler, a link-graph database and parsing support handled
by Apache Tika for HTML and an array of other document formats.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

No release has been made since the last report. A number of issues has
been filled in JIRA for 1.5 and we are planning to release Nutch 1.5
and the nutchgora branch shortly. Recent patches have upgraded some of
our dependencies on other Apache projects such as Tika 1.1 and Hadoop
1.0. A functionality which was often mentioned on the user lists had
been committed (parse-metatags).  The documentation on the WIKI has
been improved.

COMMUNITY

The traffic on the user and dev mailing lists has kept a relatively high
level in the last quarter. Questions from users are usually answered
promptly by the community. There have not been any meetings or talks related
to Nutch since the previous report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache ODE Project

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It integrates and orchestrates
web services by sending and receiving messages, handling data manipulation
and error recovery as described by the process definition. It supports both
long and short living process executions to orchestrate all the services that
are part of your application.

Status
======

This was again a quiet development period. We still have some
development items on our agenda, e.g. the OModel refactoring,
backporting features from our experimental branch. It is also time for a
new release, which will hopefully take place in the next reporting
period.

Release
=======

No release to report in this quarter.

Development
===========

No significant progress to report. We did some experiments to find an
alternative to the OModel serialization, which will be taken up by our
GSoc student.

Community
=========

One of our critical issues has been taken by a Google Summer of Code
applicant. We worked with him on the proposal and are looking forward to
his acceptance and a successful project.

Project Branding Board Report Checklist
========================================

We are planning to address the requirements with the migration from
confluence to the CMS.

Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

Apache OpenEJB is an enterprise application containers and object distribution
services based on, the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java Enterprise
Edition Web Profile.

OpenEJB 4.0.0-beta-2 and TomEE 1.0.0-beta-2 were released late January as
expected.  The releases were well received and a much needed replacement for
the "beta-1" set of binaries released and widely announced in October.  A
typical influx of new faces and questions kept the community busy in the month
following beta-2.

Primary activity in the last month has been on working towards the long
awaited OpenEJB 4.0.0 final and TomEE 1.0.0 final.  Updates for the TomEE
1.0.0 include: continued "openejb" -> "tomee" renaming, particularly the
console, logging files and config files; more work on the Arquillian Adapters;
heavy performance tuning.  The release branch has been cut and several preview
binaries have been pushed to Nexus in staging.  Voting could happen as early
as this week.  Work on announcements pending (thanks in advance to Sally).

Many thanks to OpenJPA, OpenWebBeans, BeanVal, and Geronimo for the releases
we needed to prepare for the final OpenEJB/TomEE release.  We couldn't have
done it without you!

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache OpenNLP Project

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks,
such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging,
named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.
These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing
services.

Development
------------------
All the graduation tasks are done and the team is now focused on the
development of OpenNLP again, there have been a few commits almost
every day from different committers.

Much work and time went into bug fixing and smaller improvements.

There is now integrated training support for the coreference component
which is very important for others to be able to work on the code.
The training is needed to ensure that code changes don't break anything.

Community
---------------
The community is active and the project received a few smaller patches.
We will likely soon receive a clojure interface layer contribution
and will hopefully be able to integrate the clojure minded OpenNLP
user better into the community at Apache.

No new committers have been voted in.

Releases
------------
No releases since we graduated from the incubator.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache Shindig Project

Apache Shindig is an Opensocial Reference implementation in wide use by
both social networks and enterprise software.  Shindig graduated from the
Incubator in January 2010.

The Shindig PMC has no issues that require board attention.

COMMUNITY

The project continues to enjoy broad contributions with an active
community and mailing list.

As a community we decided to renumber our releases.  We have abandoned 
the 3.0.0 beta series and re-released as 2.5.0 beta series.  This puts the
major version of shindig in alignment with the OpenSocial spec that it
implements (similar to the way Tomcat aligns with servlet specifications)

For 2.5.0-beta1 we also had assistance in cleaning up our NOTICE
and LICENSE files to be in better conformance.

There has been some work on converting http://shindig.apache.org to use
Apache CMS.

RELEASES

* 2.5.0-beta1 released March 2012

Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache Sqoop Project

DESCRIPTION

Apache Sqoop is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data
between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational
databases. It can be used to import data from external structured
datastores into Hadoop Distributed File System or related systems like
Hive and HBase. Conversely, Sqoop can be used to extract data from
Hadoop and export it to external structured datastores such as
relational databases and enterprise data warehouses.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache Sqoop was version 1.4.1-incubating, released on
  February 16, 2012 while in Incubation.
* No new releases are planned currently for the project.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Post-graduation tasks have been completed since Apache Sqoop became a TLP.
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report:
  http://s.apache.org/XGk

COMMUNITY

* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
  graduation. 
* Currently there are:
  - Total of 60 subscribers to the developer list.
  - Total of 104 subscribers to the user list.
  - Total of 14 committers
  - Total of 12 PMC members
* A Sqoop User meetup was held in Palo Alto, California on April 4, 2012
  attended by 22 attendees in all.

ISSUES

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AL: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

Apache Struts is an action-based Java web application framework.

The Struts team made one release in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.1.2 - security fix release

With the latest release we closed an important security issue reported by
Meder Kydyraliev, Google Security Team [1]. Dealing with the issue and the
reporter went very well both in terms of communication and disclosure as
well as time to fix.

The next regular release, Struts 2.3.2, is just around the corner. The
release candidate build is available for community testing and quality
voting.

In March Sally Khudairi approached us with a media query from ZDNet
regarding a Sonatype sponsored study about open source security fix
provisioning and adoption. Since Struts 2 was explicitly referenced as an
example for the relation between security patch provisioning and actual end
user downloads and patch deployments, the PMC decided to craft and forward a
general statement on this topic. Parts of the statement were cited in the
actual article [2].

In the last quarter no new committers or PMC members were added.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Trademarks and Project Branding:
Trademark Attributions: in progress
(all other topics were marked as already fixed in previous reports)

Attachment AM: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

Tapestry is a Java-based component web framework.

This quarter saw the release of Apache Tapestry 5.3.2, which removes some
limitations on Java component classes, and improves integration with the
Spring framework.

A small amount of work has continued on Tapestry 5.4, with most new features
and fixes back-ported to the Tapestry 5.3.3 branch, which is nearing a
release.

Beyond Apache, there have been new releases of useful third party libraries,
including jQuery integration, Twitter Bootstrap integration, Less/CoffeeScript
integration, and more. Several of these third party libraries presage
functionality that is expected to be the default in Tapestry 5.4.

We're continuing to see mailing list traffic of 1000 - 1200 messages per month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AN: Status report for the Apache Tcl Project

Not much new to report.  Progress continues on Rivet, Websh is ably
maintained, and otherwise all is well.

One thing worthy of board attention, that I'd actually like a bit of
guidance/assistance for, is that I want to step down as VP, Apache
Tcl, with the intention of having Massimo Manghi fill that role.  We
discussed this on the Rivet list, and just need to figure out all the
steps to take, from having an official vote on it (other candidates
would of course be welcome and encouraged, but it seems as if Massimo
is the one being pushed down the plank:-), to the other details that
will need taking care of.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AO: Status report for the Apache Thrift Project

Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

Community
The Thrift community has seen nice consistent traffic of contributions and 
tickets.

Releases
We are prepping for an 0.9 release in the coming months.

Website
We completed the release of a new website that addressed the Apache branding
requirements and in general improved the content, appearance, and 
maintainability of the website.

Attachment AP: Status report for the Apache Tika Project

What is Tika?  
========================= 
Apache Tika is a dynamictoolkit for content detection, analysis, and 
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information 
from, a growing a list over 1200 different file types including most 
of the major types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, 
Video, Code, and science data) as recognized by IANA and other 
standards bodies.

Releases
========================= 
We released Tika 1.1 on 3/23/12.

The current work on Tika 1.2 includes 14 of 33 issues already fixed.
These issues include a cool new Tika JAX-RS network server [2] that
really helped foster good will between the Apache Tika and CXF
communities. Sergey Beryozkin from CXF, and Maxim Valyanskiy from
Tika really led the way. Besides the network server, MIME type
support for the scientific data file format FITS, used heavily in
the astronomy community was added [3], and the ability to extract
embedded images from Powerpoint files [4] and the improvements to
the way that Tika load Detectors and Parsers in an OSGI environment
were also added [5] in the current trunk development branch.

There has been discussion of adding GDAL support to TIKA [6], which
would add hundreds spatial formats and the ability to parse and
detect them to Tika.

Community 
========================= 
No new PMC members/committers
were added in the last quarter.

The Tika PMC is still sponsoring the Any23 incubator project [7],
which is progressing along nicely and getting ready to make their
first Incubator release.

Mailing list activity on dev@ remained steady in January, February,
and March 2012 (189, 125, 200 messages) but slowed in April 2012
(48 messages, respectively), while the user activity remained
consistent in January, February and March 2012 (51, 46 and 37
messages). No user questions in April 2012 yet.

Attachment AQ: Status report for the Apache Traffic Server Project

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the boards attention.


Community
=========

Three new committers and PMC members were added since the last report, and
we're very excited with our developer community growth. The mailing lists
are seeing somewhat less growth than normal, the current tallies are:

    users@   - 259 subscribers (up 7% since last report)
    dev@     - 187 subscribers (up 7% since last report)

The community dealt with a security incident, CVE 2012-0256, which led to
the release of v3.0.4 and v3.1.3. Everything went very well, and it showed
that our process for dealing with security incidents is solid.

The Apache Traffic Server community volunteered to participate in the git
trials. As of 1/28 we are fully migrated to the new git infrastructure.
So far, it's been a good experience, with an expected hurdle of the steep
learning curve of git. The infrastructure team have been tremendously
helpful getting everything configured, and minor issues resolved.


Releases
========

Four releases have been made since the last status report:

    3.0.3 and 3.0.4 - New stable releases.
    3.1.2 and 3.1.3 - Development releases.

Primary focus right now includes

    * Stability and bug fixes, without performance regressions
    * Finishing up for a v3.2 release in April - May time frame

Many interesting features have been added since v3.0, including SNI and
NPN support for TLS. NPN is an enabler for developing a SPDY plugin for
example. Full IPv6 support is also completed. Many performance
improvements have been made, including better connection pooling. A number
of stable plugins are now included with the main software distribution,
and will be part of the next stable release.

In total, over 200 bugs, improvements and new features have been fixed
since v3.0.

Attachment AV: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs).  It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.


Status

As usual we had a low levels of traffic in our users mailing lists,
but usually we are able to give an answer on fast time.
Little activity on dev mail list and issue tracker, but sometimes we
receive some patches from our users via JIRA.

Our Mailing lists have these numbers:
   commits -  22 subscribers
   dev     -  71 subscribers
   users   - 188 subscribers

On the progress of the project, we are still working on bug fixing,
and we proceed slowly because all of us can work on it only at spare time.
In last weeks we have some trouble with Mac users because none of us
has a Mac to use for manual GUI tests, but we are trying to solve
problems the same, only more time is needed.

After fixing current bugs we'll start to develop our next release with
many new features, and in the meantime we are discussing many new
features to include in that release.


Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.


Releases
No new Release, but we are still working on a maintenance one: 2.0.2,
to be releases in a few months.


Branding/naming issues:
* create a DOAP file  -- DONE
Remaining issues are:
* main site navigation needs some additional links


Legal issues:
None.


Infrastructure issues/needs:
None.


Community changes
After many time, a new Committer (Piotr Kołaczkowski) were voted in,
but we are still waiting him to sign the ICLA.
There are no diversity issues regarding the PMC.

== NOTES ==

Infra:

There is a significant increase in this years budget, over last year.  This is 
due to the sharp increase in staffing costs.  We have effectively added a new 
FT post over above last years budget.  There is a reduced hardware budget, 
as there are fewer hosts requiring replacement. 

Brand Management:

With the growth in commercial popularity of many of our projects - and the 
corresponding growth in third parties who use (and sometimes abuse) our 
project brands, and on the advice of counsel, we plan to register a number 
of trademarks in the coming year, primarily in response to approved project 
requests.

We also plan to register the change of ownership of several trademarks, to 
deal with key project's brand image and to ensure third parties clearly 
understand our ownership of these marks (there have been several questions 
about our legitimacy).

We also plan to work with DLAPiper on trademark issues going forward. They 
have offered detailed docket tracking - a huge help to us - completely pro 
bono, but also note that to ensure the registration process is smooth, higher 
fees may be expected when processing actual registrations or transfers.

All requested budget is for national registry fees or for legal expenses 
directly related to registered trademarks.
