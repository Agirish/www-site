 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       The board recently accepted the resignation of director Larry
       Rosen.  In resigning Larry cited differences in the appropriate
       strategy and tactics for the foundation with the majority of
       the board.  We thank Larry for his service to the foundation
       serving on the board and wish him well.

    B. President [Jim]

       There are has been quite a bit of active and tense communication on
       many of the public ASF mailing lists. Kudos to those who have
       tried to defuse these threads before they become too damaging.

       I am very pleased to see that we appear to be on an even keel again
       regarding our books and treasury duties. I am also happy to report
       that our EA continues to be utilized and valued.

       I will send a "final" reminder to PMCs and cmmt's today regarding
       the budget calls. All budget updates are due by the end of this
       month in expectation of a submittal to, and approval of, the board
       next month.

       I have somewhat of a concern over the response of the fundraising
       team. Some emails and queries sent to fundraising (both internal
       as well as external) have been ignored or un-seen, and the fact that,
       as of this writing, we still have not rec'd a report does not give me
       a warm and fuzzy feeling.

       On a similar note, I am quite interested in seeing Concom's
       report since I know there has been quite a bit of activity within
       the last few weeks.

       In general, foundation-wise, we are operating well.

    C. Treasurer [Sam]

       All bills are paid.  All contractors are paid.  A 1099 was sent to
       Melissa.  No taxes are due at this time.

       I'm documenting the process as I go.  Once the situation is under
       control I plan to identify an Assistant Treasurer and make use of the
       existing EA.

       My next priority is producing reports.  I have a copy of QuickBooks.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       February was a busy month in secretary land. 60 ICLAs, three CCLAs,
       and three grants were received and recorded. If there is enough
       information regarding a new committer, in either the ICLA form
       itself, or in the email to which the ICLA is attached, then the
       new account request will be created upon filing of the ICLA.
       In February, six accounts were requested to be created as part of
       the ICLA filing process.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

       No report was submitted.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       I've done a bit of fundraising work, but otherwise a quiet month.

       Daniel Kulp was appointed to fill the empty board seat.

    B. Naming Noirin Plunkett as Assistant Treasurer.

       Sam would like to offload some of the workload.
       Tabled.

    C. Audit plans?  Or plan for a plan?

       There is no legal requirement for annual audits based on ASF annual revenues.

       Usually the audit committee is chaired by the Treasurer.

       Audit done by a smaller accounting firm would be $10K; larger firms would charge $20k - $30K.

       Hadrian volunteered to start by looking at the books.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Apologies for a late report.

Operations And Community
========================

Calling for volunteers to work in an organized fashion to review
branding status for all TLPs.  It's clear that a more active approach
with specific PMCs that have not reported completion is needed.

Meeting with counsel from DLAPiper to work on reviewing basic policies,
get cost figures (for next year's budget request which will be higher),
and to organize which tasks that need counsel support versus can
be done by volunteers with training.

Worked with CouchDB PMC to make suggestions for the PMC to deal with
specific Couch-* named product by third party.

The recently detailed Incubator podling name search guidelines have
been very helpful for several new podlings to review the suitability
of their names in a organized fashion; many thanks to the IPMC members
who put that guide together!

External Requests
=================

Signed release for use of Apache OpenOffice as set dressing in a
major US company motion picture.  Thanks to AOO
PPMC for the approval and DLAPiper counsel for legal review.

Trademark Registrations
=======================

Waiting for meeting with DLAPiper, expect more news next month.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising

The fundraising@ group has received a resignation request from Serge,
who has found his available time is insufficient for continuing with
the VP Fundraising role. The mailing list is discussing potential
replacements and hope to provide the Board with a candidate for its
April meeting.

Inquiries from sponsors continue to get handling by the volunteers on
fundraising@, and we have signed up two new (bronze-level) sponsors.
The group is working to establish some better management of our set of
sponsors and their renewal date. We expect the new VP to help plan
and execute on that, with a comprehensive report to the Board in the
May or June timeframe.

Larry Rosen left the HTML5 working group (he still participates in the PSIG).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

DLA Piper LLP's engagement letter has been signed and filed.  It looks like we
are settling quickly to a split where DLA Piper handles Trademarks affairs,
which means that I likely will treat the SFLC as primary for all other legal
matters.  Of course, this is just the 'default', individual circumstances can
influence this on a case by case basis.

Discussions that the board should be aware of:

  Adobe's RTMP specification license (LEGAL-120).  Not clear yet whether it is
  something we need to worry about, whether or not it amounts to a Field of
  Use restriction.  If the latter, it appears that our intended use is not one
  that would be permitted.

  Aggregation of GPL dictionaries with Apache Open Office was approved
  (LEGAL-117)

  The Army initially determined the Apache License, version 2.0 was
  incompatible with the Antideficiency Act.  They later determined that this
  was not something they needed to worry about.

  Multiple separate conversations about contributions that were previously
  made available elsewhere.  Two easy cases: smallish and self contained
  single author code bases need nothing more than an ICLA from that
  contributor; established projects with multiple contributors need either a
  Software Grant or documentation that identifies how the accepting [P]PMC
  came to the conclusion that all of the contributors have been identified and
  that they have given their approval.  Additionally, larger code bases or
  code bases with multiple contributors will also have to be verified as free
  of unacceptable dependencies.  Ultimately, this may lead to a major update
  to the so-called "Short Form" for Intellectual Property Clearance at the
  Incubator.

All in all, this was an active month in that there were quite a number of
other threads.  Overall these were largely without controversy, and no board
action is required at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For February 2012: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

5      Support question
2      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
6      Vulnerability reports, of which:
       1  [xerces, via security@apache.org]
       1  [httpd, via security@apache.org]
       2  [stuts, via security@struts.apache.org]
       1  [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org]
       1  [poi, via security@apache.org]

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Small Events
------------
A "BarCamp" was held over two days in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at the end of
February. There was a lot more interest than expected, with numbers limited to
200 on the first day, 100 on the 2nd. The large numbers meant the format of the
event was changed last minute, to more Roadshow style one. This had a mixed
effect, which was discussed with the organisers by Nick and Ross. Everyone who
attended seemed to find it interesting and useful, and there was a lot of
energy, especially on the 1st day (lots of students / recent graduates). We
hope to see more events, big and small from these organisers in the future.

Work on the DC BarCamp for May is continuing nicely. Lots of good questions are
being asked on the organisers list, some of which have been re-posted in a
general form to the small events discuss list. After the event, it may make
sense to collect up some more of these to share. Signup and the website will go
live shortly.

There was some discussion on a http related hackathon, with two proposals
floated. This has gone back to the relevant PMCs for more discussion.

No other possible small events are known about, but we may well try to tag
another call-to-action for local events on with one of the bigger
announcements, to see if that helps.

Logos for small events are now on the new site (see below), which should
hopefully make it easier for people to find and create their small event logos.
We've also helped with the foundation site logos section.

We need to make a push on the events at OSCON this coming month.

Third Party Events
------------------
We reached out to Lucid about Lucene Revolution, and worked with them to tweak
things to match the TPEBP, and they're now approved.

CamelOne was approved recently under the TPEBP, after lots of hard work by a
number of people, from ConCom and the PMC.

Based on the CamelOne experience, it seems like a few small changes to
the Third Party Event Branding Policy (TPEBP) are warranted, we'll
look at these this month.

ApacheCon
---------
The RFP for ApacheCon NA has closed, and one response was received.
We're in the process of drawing up a list of questions and concerns,
which we'll put to the proposer, and we'll vote once we have their
responses.

If we do accept, we'll need some legal help with the contract. We would
appreciate advice on the correct procedure to go about getting this?

(A decision on the first phase of ACEU12 approval is in progress, we'll aim to
update this before the board report with the outcome)

Budget
------
The committee has discussed the budget requirements for the upcoming
year. We're awaiting feedback on one point before submitting.

Committee
---------
No new committee members this month.

After only 13 years, we have finally decided to have our own website!
http://events.apache.org/ has been setup to provide a single location for our
policies and information, as well as a canonical URL (+site if needed) for
events. Some things have been moved over already, others still need to follow
(and our information is widely spread...). We aim to tackle most of the
migrations in the next week or so.

The ApacheCon and events.apache.org related tasks have used all available admin
energy this month, so no progress was made on committee structure.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

All outstanding bills have been paid.

Spoke with the myfaces PMC about their public-facing
maven repo on their zone. The zone has been taken down.

Discussed replacement purchase for harmonia (svn.eu)
and and additional VMware server for linux vm's.

Upgraded the majority of our FreeBSD servers to 9.0.
Will complete the remaining ones in the near future.
Next time round we will likely enable dtrace throughout.

Discussed infra's authority to pull improperly-signed
releases from the mirrors.  VP Infra concurs we can/should
do this if appropriate justification is available.

Mark Thomas upgraded our Bugzilla installs to 4.0.4.

Dealt with our monitoring host being redeployed to a new
VM server.

Discussed hosting a yum repository for project releases.
No decision was made at this time, pending further input
from volunteers.

Discussed deploying an Australian svn mirror to Gav's
local server.  No decision was made at this point.

Greg Stein has taken svnpubsub over to Subversion's trunk
and has done a lot of work on improving the svnwcsub service.
We look forward to seeing svnpubsub distributed in a subversion
release!

Established the precedent of not resetting accounts for
returning committers that are no longer a part of any active
project.

Experiencing chronic problems with isis, one of our build hosts
in Y!'s datacenter.  Y! has offered us a pair of new servers
to supplant it.

Began discussion of a budget for FY2012-2013.

Posted a few CMS-related blog entries to http://blogs.apache.org/infra
describing recent activity.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
=======

List is still quiet with not much going on currently.

Budget
======

Nick provided a list of _possible_ events that TAC could look forward
to supporting over the next Financial Year.
We have submitted our 2012-2013 budget requirements based on that list
and also taking into account actual spending figures from previous
events to come up with a budget request on time.

With thanks to our EA, the final actuals we spent for Vancouver
(from the TAC budget portion) have been entered into our current
2011-2012 budget file.

No change to the committee membership.

Other Events
==========

No news about any other events happening at this time. (Other than the
list of possible events coming up later in the year)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache ACE Project

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to
centrally manage and distribute modular software components,
configuration data and other artifacts to OSGi based and related target
systems.

This board report is the third one since ACE graduated as a TLP.

Releases:
* December 11th, 2011: ACE 0.8.1-incubator

Activity:
 * We migrated the website and documentation to the Apache CMS.
   Actions are still in progress around this topic.
 * A press release announcing the graduation as TLP has been sent
   on Monday, February 27th.
 * A launch party was organized in Apeldoorn, The Netherlands on
   March, 1st. All people involved in ACE were invited.
 * Jan Willem Janssen donated a multi-process launcher, which we
   are reviewing.
 * We are now working towards the first TLP release.

Changes in committers/PMC members:
 * None so far.

Committer/PMC diversity:
 * No concerns, our PMC of 8 has 6 different unique organizations.

Branding/naming issues:
 * No issues.

Legal issues:
 * None.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache APR Project

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.

Releases
--------

apr-util 1.4.1 was in progress at the time of the previous board
report and was released December 15, 2011.  This was the first
release from this branch and introduced several new features,
the most important of which is access to certain crypto capabilities
in other libraries.  The branch had been in development for several
years without a release.  (Subsequent httpd releases switched
from apr-util 1.3.latest to apr-util 1.4.1 for those httpd release
tarballs.)

apr 1.4.6 was released February 14, 2012.  It included various
bug fixes from committers and users.  Notably, it included a change
to the hashing algorithm to randomize hashes.  This was initially
assigned a CVE id, but it is not considered a security fix in APR.
(The change may or may not help resolve a vulnerability in an
application which uses APR.  We are not aware of any such
vulnerabilities at this time.)

The most recent release of the legacy APR 0.9.x branch was in
September 2011.

Community
---------
New PMC members or committers: none

Only 2 bugs have been closed during the reporting period, with
about 12 new ones opened.

Mailing list activity has increased dramatically during the quarter
but has been concentrated on three topics:

* finalization of the apr-util 1.4.1 release
* the apr 1.4.6 release
* hash collision vectors

Development
-----------
Activity has been minimal aside from the three topics listed
previously.

Issues
------
There are no board-level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Archiva Project

Apache Archiva is an extensible repository management software that helps
taking care of your own personal or enterprise-wide build artifact
repository. It is the perfect companion for build tools such as Maven,
Continuum, and ANT.

Releases
--------

* 1.4-M2 release 2011-12-20

Community
---------

* Jean-Baptiste Onofré was added as a new committer on 2012-01-20.

* The December release vote and the January committer vote had very few
participants from the PMC, which prompted Brett to ask around the Archiva
PMC list if certain members who had little or no activity in the last
year still wish to be active in the project. The following members
noted they were unable to continue their participation and decided to
move to emeritus status:
   - Arnaud Héritier
   - James William Dumay
   - John Tolentino
   - Jesse McConnell
   - Fabrice Bellingard
   - Emmanuel Venisse

  Reference thread for the discussion can be viewed at:

  http://s.apache.org/xZu

Development
-----------

* As reported in the previous board reports, there were a number of planned
  refactorings of Archiva trunk. Below are the status of each of them:

  - moving the UI to another framework (in-progress)

  - removal of all plexus components (completed)

  - replace or overhaul the security system used (UI overhaul of current
    security system used has been done to integrate with the UI refactorings
    in Archiva)

* For Archiva's UI refactoring, the aim is to make it fast and simple, and
to de-couple it with the core. The UI overhaul is almost half-way through
the webapp, with mostly the administration pages done.

* The OSGi integration with Apache Karaf is still in progress. All the
modules in Archiva have already been converted to OSGi bundles. Next step
is to add the OBR (OSGi Bundle Repository) support.

Project Branding Requirements
-----------------------------

* Project Website Basics - done
* Project Naming and Descriptions - done
* Website Navigation Links - done
* Trademark Attributions - not yet done
* Logos and Graphics - not yet done
* Project Metadata - not yet done
* Read PMC Branding Responsibilities - not yet done

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache BVal Project

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
BVal version 0.3-incubating was released April 28, 2011.  The PMC is actively
discussing making its first non-incubating release in the *immediate* future.
We are highly motivated because as members of the Java EE ecosystem @ Apache
we like to cooperate and coordinate with the release schedules of related
projects (e.g. OpenJPA, Geronimo) whenever possible.

### Activity ###
Since graduating to TLP status, activity has focused on post-graduation tasks,
primarily the migration of the BVal website from Confluence to the Apache CMS.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

Finally, we have established a #bval channel on Freenode IRC.  We continue to
make decisions on-list, but we hope that our availability on IRC will help
build a sense of team camaraderie, and allow us to resolve simple questions
in a more synchronous manner.

### Community ###
The composition of the team has not changed since graduation, at which time
all committers became members of the inaugural PMC.  The PMC is quite diverse
and we are satisfied that no entity has undue influence in our decision-making
process.

### Branding ###
Most of the team (and everyone else who has been asked) harbor some level of
dislike for BVal's existing logo, the "check mark made of coffee beans."  One
of our ongoing tasks is the direction/selection/creation of a new project logo.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
We have some outstanding features we'd like to implement on our project
website (specifically a news or blog feed), and may seek advice and/or support
from infrastructure to accomplish this.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project

Last month, stdcxx added three committers/PMC members. One sent in his
CLA and and an account for him was created. The other two are in the
process of getting their CLAs signed by their employers.  Beyond that,
we have nothing to report.  All stdcxx committers are busy with our
day jobs and have only limited time to spend on the project. Requiring
reports on a monthly basis won't help increase the activity of the
project. On the contrary, since it takes away from the little time we
have to contribute it is likely to decrease it.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Camel Project

Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration framework based on known
Enterprise Integration Patterns.

Project Status
--------------
* There are no issues that require the board attention.
* The project is healthy and continues to grow.
* Progress has been made toward using the CXF developed export utility to
  migrate the website from rsync to svnpubsub as per guidelines from the
  Infrastructure team.

Community
---------
* The community grows:
  * 503 subscribers to the users mailing list (+3 %)
  * 183 subscribers to the dev mailing list (+2 %)
* The community is active
  * Avg. 688 mails per month on the users mailing list in Dec 2011 - Feb 2012
  * Avg. 196 mails per month on the dev mailing list in Dec 2011 - Feb 2012
  * Avg. 507 commits per month in Dec 2011 - Feb 2012
* Babak Vahdat (bvahdat) joined the community as a new committer.
* Bilgin Ibryam (bibryam) joined the community as a new committer.
* No new PMC members since the last board report (December 2011)
* We are on track to increasing diversity.
  * Our PMC of 19 is affiliated with 6 different unique organizations (11 of
    them are affiliated with a single company).
  * Our additional 16 committers belongs to 14 different unique organizations
    (3 of them are affiliated with the same single company mentioned above).
* Fusesource planned and announced a CamelOne conference at May 15th - 16th
  (http://fusesource.com/apache-camel-conference-2012/). ConCom approved to use
  the name CamelOne for this event. The Camel PMC, especially Jeff Genender,
  Rob Davies, Claus Ibsen and myself will make sure this event will meet the
  ASF trademark and ConCom guidelines.

Community Objectives
--------------------
 * Our first objective is to continue with the development for Camel 2.10.0.
 * Beside this, we continues development with new features and fixes for the
   camel-2.8.x and 2.9.x maintenance branches.
 * In the next weeks we have to concrete our schedule for Camel 3.0.0 which
   will be a bigger release.

Branding Status
---------------
 * Project Naming And Descriptions : Compliant
 * Website Navigation Links : Compliant
 * Trademark Attributions : Compliant
 * Logos and Graphics : Compliant
 * Project Metadata : Compliant

Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Cayenne Project

Apache Cayenne(TM) is an open source persistence framework licensed under
the Apache License, providing object-relational mapping (ORM) and remoting
services.

Development

* Active work on Cayenne 3.1 release continues.
* We are discussing the first Beta release of Cayenne 3.1.
* DocBook migration of Confluence documentation continues.

Community

* Mailing list activity is average on developer and user lists. The user
list and developer list are both seeing new names appear as more people
seem interested in Cayenne and are exploring it. Also a number of bug
reports and patches have filtered into JIRA from these newcomers.
* We started running an official PMC Twitter at
https://twitter.com/#!/ApacheCayenne
* No new committers or PMC members this quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Chemistry Project

== Status report for Apache Chemistry ==

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in
Java, Python, PHP, and .NET (and possibly other languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.


== Project status ==

OpenCMIS (Java) still is the most active subproject. The next release will
provide the first complete implementation of the CMIS 1.1 browser binding.
We have received a contribution that adapts OpenCMIS for Android devices.
It is currently on a branch and will be merged it into trunk after a
code review.

We have seen a bit more interest in DotCMIS (.NET) lately.
We got questions, bug reports and patches in the past few weeks.


== Community ==

No significant changes. Steady traffic on the mailing list.


== Releases ==

OpenCMIS 0.7.0 will be released soon.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Click Project

Apache Click is an easy-to-use page and component oriented Java web framework.

There are no board level issues at this time.

However the low community participation rate is becoming an issue the project
will need to address, through recruiting new committers and more effort by the
existing project committers.

Infrastructure
-------------------
There are no infrastructure issues at this time.

Development
------------------
Development activity has focused on a 2.4/2.3.1 release scheduled this year..

Community
----------------
There have been no new committer or PMC members added during this period.

Mailing list traffic has picked up quite a bit for the period.  There have been
a number of requests about the project's road and the release schedule, with
little response from the project team.

Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

Apache Commons provides a large set of reusable Java components. Commons
components are widely used in many projects, both at Apache and outside.

There is one particular problem that may be of interest to board.  It
was noted recently that Apache Solr did release on public maven
repository a snapshot version of an Apache Commons sandbox component:
CSV, without changing the top level package name. See
<http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/commons-dev/201203.mbox/%3C4F55647C.6050802%40apache.org%3E>. As mentioned here:
<http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/commons-dev/201203.mbox/%3Cjj4fnc%24k6u%241%40dough.gmane.org%3E>,
the problem is not the fork (which is welcome, be it from an Apache
project or from anyone else), the problem is that the classpath is
spoiled. A Jira issue has been opened
<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3204> and the Commons team
is working together with the Solr team to get the issue solved. It
appears the same problem appears with other components Solr uses (at
least Carrot2 and Jsonic which are not Apache projects, but also
Noggit from Apache Lab and Uima which is a TLP and maybe others).

The Apache Commons PMC would like to ask board whether package names
should remain in the control of the project team or if other project
can publish artifacts using the same packages names freely.

Several components have been released since last report:
        Commons Jexl          2.1    (2011-12-13)
        Commons Digester      3.2    (2011-12-14)
        Commons Pool          1.5.7  (2011-12-21)
        Commons Jexl          2.1.1  (2011-12-24)
        Commons Pool          1.6    (2012-01-12)
        Commons Parent        23     (2012-01-12)
        Commons Validator     1.4    (2012-02-03)
        Commons Configuration 1.8    (2012-02-05)
        Commons Daemon        1.0.9  (2012-02-13)
        Commons Net           3.1    (2012-02-21)
        Commons Daemon        1.0.10 (2012-02-28)

After several years spent with us and providing countless hours of help,
advices and code, Phil Steitz has decided to go emeritus. The Apache
Commons community is very grateful to him.

Three new committers have been elected to commons:
        Thomas Neidhart
        Claudio Squarcella
        Marco Speranza


As a way to prevent misuses by other people, the G+ brand page "Apache
Commons" has been reserved by Christian Grobmeier. Christian exchanged
with Shane (VP Brand Management) who mentioned the key point is the PMC
needs get access to that G+ account when the original owner has
vanished.

Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project

Attachment M: Status report for the Apache CouchDB Project

We added two new Committers to the project: Jason Smith and Dave
Cottlehuber. Both have been contributing to the CouchDB ecosystem and
Apache CouchDB in particular for quite some time.

The PMC chair finally got around to announce Paul Davis as a new member
of the PMC, the vote for which occurred last year.

A new major release 1.2.0 is around the corner. For 1.2.0, for the first
time, we will be voting on official Windows release binaries (courtesy
of Dave Cottlehuber's work).

Noticeable pick-up of activity around pressing issues, including
community members publicly applauding the efforts.

Git integration is going well. Developers are getting into the habit of
regular branching and merging of features and bugfixes. Sharing of
changes for testing and review is becoming easier as well. As cases in
point, a large refactoring of an internal component[1] went very smooth
as did the collaboration on a new security related feature. Regular,
smaller work and bugfixes have been going on at the same time and was in
no way hindered. We started documenting committer and contributor
workflows on the wiki.

PMC member Noah Slater started an inquiry with trademarks@ about a
potential confusion with the Couchbase brand. While the thread is
ongoing, Couchbase have already signalled eagerness to help resolve any
issues. In the past, a similar inquiry about Couchbase's line CouchConf
conferences was resolved to mutual satisfaction as well.

Project founder Damien Katz resigned from the PMC after posting
controversial blog posts challenging the future of the project.

Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Empire-db Project

Apache Empire-db

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that
allows developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application
development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow
highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of
compile-time-safety and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

Apache Empire-db became a TLP in January 2012. The migration from the
incubator has been completed, our website was updated to reflect the
changes.
We are now working towards a first TLP release, this will probably
take a bit longer than usual as we have to update our release process
guide. The release should be out before next board report.

Changes in committers or PMC members

There have been no changes in Committers since our TLP graduation in
February 2012

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Gora Project

Apache Gora

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and
persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key
value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The last official project release was made on 24/09/2011 which was the
0.1.1-incubating release (2nd whilst in the Incubator). Although since last
reporting there have been some commits to three Gora modules, some remaining
issues still need to be addressed before we are ready to roll out a 0.2
release. This is rather frustrating, as the main issue which blocks a 0.2
release is a licensing issue on the gora-sql store. It is widely
acknowledged that although gora-sql is the least used module, it is the one
which requires attention to rectify this licensing issue.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Since graduation all documentation, and infrastructure has been successfully
migrated over to TLP status. We've witnessed development and commits to
three datastores and a number of issues addressed as a result. It is safe to
say that the gora-hbase store seems to be attracting the most development,
however there are also a number of issues which have recently been opened
for the gora-cassandra module. In the last report we stated that there were
two new modules in the process of being integrated into the project (namely
gora-accumulo and gora-solr), however due to ongoing issues with releases
for Solr and Accumulo, we are not able to release the gora modules.

How has the community developed since the last report?

The Gora mailing lists have seen some activity with regards to
gora-accumulo, however generally speaking traffic was quite low for the
month until this report. We do however have some excellent news that we are
submitting an application to Google Summer of Code. The project comprises a
gora-dynamodb (Amazon Dynamo DB) module, again making best efforts to open
up Gora to a wider audience.

Changes to PMC & Committers

Since VOTE'ing Keith Turner on to the team no new members have been accepted
into the Gora development team. Additionally, no new VOTE'ing has taken place.

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of projects including,
Nutch, Tika, OODT, Camel, Solr, Accumulo & Hadoop (this is not an exhaustive
list). There is work to be done with the Avro implementations, so once we
are 100% ready to work on these issues, we will be looking to interest
members of the Avro community in Gora.

Project Branding or Naming issues

We recently sorted out all branding and trademark issues through trademarks@.
As this has been addressed there is no more to add at this stage.

Legal issues

We currently have an issue with one particular library being used within the
gora-sql store. It is the communities intention to remove this LGPL licensed
library from the codebase replacing it with implementations from JOOQ an ASL
2.0 licensed library. A re-write of the gora-sql module building from the
JOOQ library has been delayed until after our 0.2 release, an interim
solution comprises simply replacing the offending code with TODO's. Although
technically this makes the gora-sql module unfit for production use, it does
allow us to progress with releasing Gora 0.2. The community can then move
towards a rewrite of the gora-sql module for a 0.3 release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

No Board level issues.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Infrastructure ==

The site now uses svnpubsub.  If we ever want to create a release,
we'll use svnpubsub right from the start.

We encountered only a few minor hick-ups after the upgrade to FreeBSD
9.0, mostly due to upgrading svn and having to upgrade all working
copies.  Many thanks to the infra team.

== Activity ==

The Gump project really consists of two parts, the code base for the
project and the ASF installations[1] running this code base to build
many ASF projects as well as some related projects.

The code base mostly does what its current users need so there isn't
much development going on at all.  During this quarter we've tweaked
git support to allow pulling from branches other than "master".

There are only a few people contributing across all projects and a few
additional people maintaining the metadata of the projects they are
interested in the most.

We've finally given up waiting for expat to build on libtool2 systems
and now provide a system installed expat, this means we've started to
successfully build APR and projects depending on APR for the first time
since at least a year, probably longer.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.

== Branding and Naming ==

We believe to meet all branding requirements.

== Statistics ==

As of Tue, 13 Mar 2012 the ASF installations check out a bit less than
180 source trees (115 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
more than 850 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes about nine and a
half hours on vmgump and about nine on the FreeBSD jail and ten on
Adam where more projects fail to build.

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ , a
FreeBSD jail at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/public/ and a Mac OS
X Server at http://adam.apache.org/gump/

-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Many thanks to Noel Bergman for his service as the chairman of the
Incubator PMC over the past eight years!

The discussions about the role and structure of the Incubator over
the past few months have receded as we've recently been focusing more
on the status and concrete issues of individual podlings. This has
resulted in a notable improvement in the overall atmosphere in the
Incubator, though some of the deeper issues that were identified
earlier may come back to haunt us unless we revisit them at some point.

Based on the discussion during the last board meeting and related
thoughts on general@incubator.apache.org we have decided to keep
including individual podling reports as a part of the main Incubator
report. The main rationale for this is that we want to teach podlings
the habit of reporting all the way to the ASF board (with help from
and extra review by the IPMC) instead of positioning the Incubator PMC
as a "mini-board" that filters out and just summarizes podling reports.

That said, we did put extra effort in reviewing podling reports and
highlighting issues that might be of special interest to the board.
Comments and feedback on this approach would be welcome.

o Community

  Matt Franklin and Colm O hEigeartaigh joined the Incubator PMC since
  our last report.

  The following podlings are requesting graduation to Apache TLPs:

  - Apache Accumulo
  - Apache Lucy
  - Apache Rave
  - Apache Sqoop

  The Incubator PMC recommends the board to accept the respective resolutions.
  Other podlings like RAT (Creadur) are currently preparing for graduation.

  No new project proposals have been received since our last report.

  The initial response to our recent increased emphasis on report review
  has been positive, and it looks like the effort is starting to bear fruit
  in terms of timely reports and a gradually improving focus on graduation
  plans across the Incubator.

  Community activity and diversity remain the most common graduation blockers
  for incubating projects. We are seeking ways to better track such things
  and help podlings grow their communities. There's been talk about
  cooperation with ComDev on this front, but so far nothing concrete
  has come out of this.

  Of particular note community-wise is the Kato podling that no longer
  considers itself blocked by Oracle's position on JSR 326. See the Kato
  report for more details and thoughts on the project's future.

o Releases

  The following incubating releases were made since our last report:

  - February 17th, 2012: Apache Sqoop 1.4.1-incubating
  - February 21st, 2012: Apache Isis 0.2.0-incubating
  - February 21st, 2012: Apache Wookie 0.9.2-incubating
  - March 1st, 2012: Apache Oozie 3.1.3-incubating
  - March 4th, 2012: Apache Rave 0.8-incubating
  - March 4th, 2012: Apache Tashi 201202-incubating
  - March 6th, 2012: Apache Hama 0.4-incubating
  - March 10th, 2012: Apache Jena TDB 0.9.0-incubating
  - March 11th, 2012: Apache MRUnit 0.8.1-incubating

  The release process continues to be a source of trouble for many
  podlings and also to the Incubator in general. The typical symptoms
  of this trouble are major delays in releases of some podlings.
  We've had discussions about ways to fix this, but so far there
  unfortunately hasn't been much concrete progress.

o Legal / Trademarks

  The issue of using Java package names other than org.apache.*
  came up in relation to the Sqoop project. The resulting discussion
  and the rough consensus that was reached is summarized in the
  Sqoop report.

  The Flex podling is working on a custom trademark licensing deal
  with Adobe. See the Flex report for mode details.

  The PODLINGNAMESEARCH process prepared especially by Robert is
  now being used by many podlings, and the initial results in terms
  of increased confidence in the uniqueness and suitability of
  podling names seem  pretty good.

o Infrastructure

  Thanks especially to Joe and Sebb, the Incubator web site is now
  managed using the Apache CMS.

  Three podlings - Cordova, DeltaSpike and S4 - are using the Git
  repositories provided by the infra team. The early experiences
  seem to have been generally positive with no major issues raised,
  though no detailed review of potential community impacts has yet
  been done.

  The infrastructure migrations of large or complex projects like
  OpenOffice and Flex have been (and continue being) fairly long
  processes that seem to have generated at least some frustration.
  We're hoping to collect experience of key problems so that future
  podlings with similar needs could at least better anticipate and
  plan for such issues.

  The OpenMeetings podling is looking to set up a meeting server
  as a service for other projects and groups (possibly the board)
  within the ASF. Interested groups should contact OpenMeetings
  and/or infra for more details.

  The idea came up of reviving the old INCUBATOR issue tracker for
  tracking Incubator-related tasks. Time will tell how useful this
  will be to us.

-------------------- Summary of podling reports --------------------

We reviewed all podlings reporting in this quarter and categorized them
according to their progress through the Incubator and the most pressing
issues that are currently blocking progress.

Still getting started at the Incubator (3 podlings)

  DeviceMap, Flex, Syncope

  These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
  towards graduation is yet expected.

Not yet ready to graduate (14 podlings)

  IP clearance: Openmeetings
  No release: Bloodhound, Cordova, OpenOffice
  Low activity: Kalumet, Kato
  Low diversity: Bigtop, Etch, Isis, Hama, HCatalog, MRUnit, S4, Wave

  We expect the next quarterly report of projects in this category to
  include a summary of their actions and progress in solving these issues.

Ready to graduate (6 podlings)

  Accumulo, Flume, ManifoldCF, RAT, Rave, Sqoop

  We expect these projects to graduate within the next quarter.

-------------------- Detailed Reports --------------------

Accumulo

--------------------
Bloodhound

Bloodhound is an issue tracker derivative of Trac, with the goal of making
deployment easy, and usage intuitive.

Bloodhound has been incubating since December 2011.

The current three most important issues toward graduation remain unchanged
from last month, and are:

  1. Improving community diversity
  2. Lowering the barrier to entry and development
  3. Creating shippable releases and getting user feedback

The last month saw the addition of one committer, Joachim Dreimann, as well
as increased technical discussion on the mailing lists, particularly around
the areas of user interface, multi-project support and rudimentary
installation capabilities. In addition, the first commits of code that
should form part of the distribution have been achieved, providing the
basis for multi-project support and a very basic installer script.

The primary goals of the community remain getting something potential
developers can play with into the repository, and creating a release to
get some widespread exposure to the project.

--------------------
Cordova

Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project entered incubation as Apache
Callback in October, 2011, before changing its name to Cordova.

Our aim for Feb was to ship an official Apache release, but a few issues
remain. We're confident 1.6 will mark our first release.

  - completed code migration to Cordova name
  - weinre nowing running on nodejs
  - cordova-js migration complete for android, underway for other platforms
  - aim to new code release cutting tool called `coho`
  - launched http://incubator.apache.org/cordova (nice work yohei)
  - excellent update to the wiki on contribution (fil, michael)
  - Denis Kormalev (dkormalev) voted as committer
  - Longwei Su (longwei) voted as committer
  - Jeff Tranter (tranter) voted as committer

Graduation concerns:

  - updated all license headers to asl
  - official apache release

--------------------
DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images
and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.
smartphones and tablets.

Entered incubation on January 3rd, 2012.

There are no issues that require the Incubator PMC's or the board's attention.

The project is starting slowly, initial technical goals are being discussed
and we hope to have our first mobile device data collection prototypes soon.

Analyzing apache.org requests coming from mobile devices might help us
gather the data that we need, we'll get in touch with infrastructure about
this once we have precise requirements.

--------------------
Etch

Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework
for building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes
a network service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries
for a variety of programming languages.

Status:

  - We published our next release Apache Etch 1.2.0-incubating
  - The Apache Etch website was switched to the new Apache CMS system.
    The website is available at http://incubator.apache.org/etch/
  - The binding-cpp implementation makes some progress. I think a fist
    version of the whole stack could be finished while the next weeks
  - We work on our graduation to become an Apache TLP. Nearly all issues
    are solved http://incubator.apache.org/projects/etch.html
    The PODLINGNAMESEARCH is in progress and should be concluded soon.
    The preparations for the graduation steps are under way.
  - We could acquire a new committer Thomas Marsh to our team

Future Tasks:

  - Development binding-cpp
  - Bug fixing
  - Graduation
  - Community development

--------------------
Flex

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

Summary: A highly energetic community waits for Adobe to complete the
source code transition and infrastructure.

Date of entry to the Incubator:  December 31, 2011

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  1. Resolve trademark donation or licensing
  2. Complete code and bug database donation
  3. Make at least one release

Is there anything that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board specifically needs
to address?

  The ASF legal team may have to agree to a custom Trademark licensing.
  Adobe is currently evaluating the parameters of a custom Trademark license
  proposed by an ASF Board member.  If approved, a custom agreement will be
  drafted and signed by both parties.

Are there any legal, infrastructure, cross-project or personal issues that
need to be addressed? (Are there any stumbling blocks that impede the podling?)

  Besides the trademark issue mentioned previously, the import of existing
  JIRA bugs is blocked by an issue with Apache JIRA's import utility. It has
  failed to import the data file supplied by Adobe. Infra is supposed to
  open a support ticket with Atlassian.

Check that the project's Incubation Status file up to date.

  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/flex

What has been done (releases, milestones, etc.) since the last report?

  - An initial set of Flex source (base framework code), including history,
    was checked into the trunk area of the podling’s Subversion repository.
  - Other initial committers have donated code to the whiteboard.
  - Updates to the podling's wiki including a getting started area for
    reference to new project members.
  - Justin Mclean was accepted as committer to the podling.

What are the plans and expectations for the next period?

  Adobe expects to complete the transfer of the bug database. Adobe also
  hopes to contribute the compiler and test suite as well. And there is hope
  for an initial release.

Are there any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly
for you?

  Incubation has been working well.  Our mentors are great.

Flume

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently
collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data to scalable
data storage systems such as Apache Hadoop's HDFS.

Flume entered incubation on June 12th, 2011.

Progress since last report

  - Flume made it's first release from Incubator - version 1.0.0-incubating
    on January 4th, 2012.
  - Flume PPMC voted in three new committers from diverse organizations:
    Jarek Jarcec Cecho, Brock Noland, and Juhani Connolly.
  - Development work is going strong on flume-728 branch with over 50 issues
    fixed since the last submitted report.
  - The flume-dev list is vibrant with discussions around design and policy,
    with active participation from contributors and committers alike.

Issues before graduation

   - Move the active development branch - flume-728 to trunk.
   - Release a version from the trunk.

Hama

Hama was accepted into Incubator on 20 May 2008. Hama is a distributed
computing framework based on BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing
techniques for massive scientific computations.

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve prior to graduation

  - Grow the community size.
  - Making a ready-to-use release.

Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board

  - None.

HCatalog


HCatalog is a table and storage management service for data created using
Apache Hadoop. HCatalog entered Apache incubator on March 2011.

The most important issues in moving the project to graduation are expanding
the community of users and developers. There has been progress on this over
last few months as we are seeing some significant contributions coming from
the community adding in new features. e.g., see HCATALOG-2 We are adding
new features (see 3rd point below) which will help us to reach out to
non-java users which we believe will help us significantly expand our
user base.

Since the last report we:

  - Are preparing for our second release HCatalog 0.4
  - Continued feature development, making Hive and HCatalog
    interoperability better (HCATALOG-237).
  - Work in progress for adding rest apis for HCatalog (HCATALOG-182)
    which could help us in significantly expand our user base.

Currently there are 85 subscribers to the user list and 77 on the dev list.
There were 75 and 70 respectively last report (December 2011).

Isis

Isis is an ALv2 licensed implementation of the Naked Objects pattern. It is
based on contributions of the original Naked Objects Framework along with
a number of sister projects that were developed for the book "Domain Driven
Design using Naked Objects " (pragprog 2009).

Isis was accepted into the Incubator in 2010, September 7th.

Project Development

  - Released 0.2.0-incubating, with improved website and archetype
  - Added demo of jQuery mobile to demonstrate REST API
  - Added support for MongoDB in the nosql object store

Community Development

  - Mailing list remains reasonably active
  - New site gone live which improves the "message" for would-be users
  - Hoping to pick up a new committer; awaiting their contribution for review
  - New JIRA tickets raised/tagged existing tickets for potential newbie
    contributors to pick up and contribute back
  - Continuing to work on restful objects spec, implemented by Isis and
    by (non-Apache) Naked Objects MVC open source project
    - hope is that this will raise some synergies and build community
      across both

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

  - only really one issue: need to demonstrate can bring in at least one
    new committer.  At that point, we feel that we have done enough to
    warrant graduation (as a small but viable community)
  - in mean time, need to continue to remove impediments for building the
    community, by improving the messaging on the website, by making the
    archetypes easy to use, by blogging

We don't believe that any of these issues requires Board attention.

New Releases

  - 0.2.0-incubating was released in Feb 2011
  - intention is to release 0.3.0 in Apr or May (prior to next report)

Kalumet

Apache Kalumet is a complete platform to administrate data center. It covers
the operating system tasks, middleware provisioning, etc. Kalumet entered
incubation in September 2011.

Community Development:

Some new users gave interest to Kalumet. Some contributions should arrive soon.

Lot of users are still "linked" to the old area on sourceforge.
We are going to deprecate the sourceforge area to highly promote Kalumet.

Our effort will be on the project activity.

Project Development:

From a codebase perspective, we added the support of JBoss 6/7 and made some
important enhancements on the VFS file manipulation.

Now, we are working on the documentation, to be able to publish on the website
asap.

Roadmap Before Graduation:

  - The first target is the documentation. We plan to provide an online
    installation guide (for both agent and console), user guide (for the
    console), tutorial/use case. The work started and should be committed soon.
  - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept globally
    to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
    deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.
  - Refactoring of the UI. Currently Kalumet Console uses Echo2 framework.
    It's a category B license framework. We plan to refactor the console
    to use a new framework.

Web Site/Communication Development:

The website has been created: http://incubator.apache.org/kalumet/

It introduces Kalumet and provide first content. The website will be updated
with the documentation soon.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of:

None so far.

Kato

Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.

Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation,
and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.

Recent Activity:

  - Oracle finally stated its position on JSR 326 and the Kato project.
    In short, other technologies are a higher priority, and there is a
    limited audience for the API.

  - There was a lot of discussion on the status of this project and the
    reporting of that status.

  - Robert Burrell Donkin announced his resignation from the IPMC and as
    mentor for this project.

  - There was some discussion about the future of the project, but
    nothing concrete.

The following is planned for next reporting period:

  - Decide in what form the podling should continue, if at all.

Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation
in the project and grow the community.

ManifoldCF

ManifoldCF is an incremental crawler framework and set of connectors designed
to pull documents from various kinds of repositories into search engine
indexes or other targets. The current bevy of repository connectors includes
Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink (OpenText), Meridio (Autonomy),
SharePoint (Microsoft), JDBC, CIFS file systems, CMIS repositories, Alfresco,
RSS feeds, Wiki content, and web content. Output support includes Solr,
MetaCarta GTS, and OpenSearchServer.

ManifoldCF also provides components for individual document security within
a target search engine, so that repository security access conventions can
be enforced in search results.

ManifoldCF has been in incubation since January, 2010. It was originally
a planned subproject of Lucene but is now a likely top-level project.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move
towards graduation:

  1. We believe we've reached graduation threshold.  More committers and
     greater breadth in the committer base is always welcome, of course.
  2. We need the current committer base to continue to broaden their
     commits to new areas of the project

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to
be aware of?

  We have an outstanding request to Apache Legal to determine whether we can
  distribute PDF files containing Japanese characters rendered with the IPA
  family of fonts.  It would be great to know the answer prior to the release
  of ManifoldCF 0.5-incubating.  A ticket is open (LEGAL-123) but no activity
  has taken place on it.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We've received sustained contributions from multiple individuals, and signed
  up one new committer.  Deployments of the project software are also now
  clearly reaching a much broader audience than they were a year ago, and
  this trend seems likely to continue.  A second revision of ManifoldCF in
  Action is also planned to keep up with developments on the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  An 0.1 release was made on January 31, 2011, and a 0.2 release occurred
  on May 17, 2011.  The 0.3 release occurred on September 20, 2011. The 0.4
  release took place on February 2, 2012.  The fifth incubator release is
  planned for March 30, 2012, and will include an ElasticSearch connector,
  full internationalization support and a Japanese localization, MySQL
  support, automated UI testing, and more.

Community Development Progress

  - Since our last report we have voted in 3 new Committers.
  - We have improved to act more as a self organized project to address
    and solve project related topics (e.g., budget transfer from SPI, forum
    moderation).
  - We accepted an offer from SourceForge to host our extension repository
    (host, upgrade, improve) as interim solution.
  - With the start of QA and translation effort, additional volunteers have
    now started becoming active in the project.
  - We continue to get trademark usage permission requests, including an
    interesting one to use Apache OpenOffice as "stage dressing" in a
    Hollywood motion picture.

Sqoop

A tool for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and
structured datastores such as relational databases.

Sqoop was accepted into Apache Incubator on June 11, 2011. Status information
is available at http://incubator.apache.org/projects/sqoop.html.

Progress since last report:

  - Sqoop PPMC voted in Kathleen Ting as a new committer.
  - Sqoop PPMC voted in Jarek Jarcec Checho (Jarsolav Cecho) as PPMC member.
  - Released Sqoop version 1.4.1-incubating, with support for Apache Hadoop
    versions 0.20, 0.23 and 1.0.
  - Sqoop started its graduation process on February 19th, 2012.

Progress on graduation:

  - Community Vote: PASSED. Vote (1), Result (2)
  - Incubator PMC Vote: PASSED. Vote (3), Result (4)
  - During IPMC vote a concern was raised that Sqoop contains deprecated
    Java source in com.cloudera.sqoop namespace which need be removed
    before graduation.
  - Sqoop dev expressed that this code was:
    - Marked deprecated and retained solely for backward compatibility.
    - That there was a concrete plan to completely remove it by next major
      revision, work for which had already started.
    - That it was not motivated by Cloudera's corporate interests.
  - The Incubator PMC and Sqoop community reached consensus that:
    - Sqoop was within its right to retain Java source code in
      com.cloudera.sqoop namespace to provide backwards compatibility.
    - And, that it was for the benefit of Sqoop community.
    - And, that there is no such policy in ASF that Incubator can enforce
      on any Incubating projects.
    - And, that if anyone feels that this should be a policy, they must
      establish it via the proper channel of providing the problem statement,
      impact of the problem, and solution to the board for consideration.
  - The draft board resolution that was voted on by IPMC has been submitted
    to the board for consideration in its next meeting scheduled for
    March 21, 2012.

Wave

Incubating since: Dec-2010

Description: Wave is a real-time communication and collaboration tool.
Wave in a Box (WIAB) is a server that hosts and federates waves, supports
extensive APIs, and provides a rich web client. This project also includes
an implementation of the Wave Federation protocol, to enable federated
collaboration systems (such as multiple interoperable Wave In a Box instances).

Most important issues are:

  - Building up community.
  - Bug fixes.

Community:

  The Wave project attracted significant interest recently - probably caused
  by Google Wave becoming read only. The activity levels on the mailing list
  are increasing constantly, as well as number of contributors.

Project development:

 - Added waves import from Google Wave.
 - Added SSL server capabilities.
 - Bug fixes + improved stability.
 - Some improvements to UI.

There are more features soon to be added to Wave in the review process.

Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  The biggest news this quarter was the first stable Jackrabbit 2.4 release,
  about a year after Jackrabbit 2.2 was branched.

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.4.0 on February 9th

  In the run-up to 2.4, we cut the following unstable 2.3.x releases:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.3.7 on January 24th
  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.3.6 on January 2nd
  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.3.5 on December 16th

  We made one patch release from the earlier 2.2 maintenance branch:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.11 on February 11th

  We also completed the end-of-life period of the last Jackrabbit 1.x
  maintenance branch, making the stable 2.x branches the only actively
  maintained versions of Jackrabbit.

o Community / Development

  No new committers or PMC members were added in this quarter.

  The work towards Jackrabbit 3 entered a major new phase as we decided
  to promote the effort from prototypes in the Jackrabbit sandbox to
  a new Jackrabbit subproject codenamed "Oak". This is a major rewrite
  of Jackrabbit, which is why we wanted to clearly separate the effort
  from work on the main Jackrabbit codebase. It is yet undecided whether
  the Oak codebase will eventually replace Jackrabbit trunk to become
  Jackrabbit 3.0 or if we want to rebrand the effort and branch it off
  to a separate TLP, possibly through the Incubator. Meanwhile we plan
  to start publishing early access versions of the Oak codebase as a
  series of monthly "Apache Jackrabbit Oak 0.x" releases (as the codename
  "Oak" is not unique enough for use as a standalone "Apache Oak" brand).

  Jukka Zitting wishes to resign as chairman of the Jackrabbit PMC due
  to his new role at the Incubator, so we have started the process of
  electing a new chairman.

o Infrastructure

  We are still in progress of migrating from Confluence to the new CMS.

Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Logging Project


This is an off-cycle report due to a missed report last
month.

- Community

Florian Semm has been added as a log4php member.


- Project Branding Requirements

No activity this quarter.

- Development

log4j 1.2:

Christian Grobmeier is intending to manage the release of
log4j 1.2.17 and push the release forward in the middle of
March to address a nasty memory leak. Ralph Goers has
volunteered to assist with Windows specific tests.

Two unreleased log4j companions (component and receivers) which
which primarily support Chainsaw are planned to be rolled into
the "extras" companion to minimize the number of products
supported by the project.

log4j 2.0:

Log4j 2 was moved out of the experimental branch and now has its own trunk
under log4j where further development can continue. The Logging team posted
a blog entry announcing this in February. It has remained a struggle to gain
new participants in this effort. Work is continuing towards an initial
release.

log4cxx:

log4cxx has had an extended period of no activity. In recent thread
"Is log4cxx still alive", there was a legitimate frustration at the
lack of a review or action on a bug report and a newcomer
announced that he was forking the project on github, unfortunately
with the name log4cpp which is yet another logging framework for C++.
Ideally, those frustrated with the lack of activity could be converted
to contributors as had happened to varying degrees with log4php and log4net.
However, that requires at least one committer to serve as mentor.

log4net:

Unfortunately the 1.2.11 release of log4net hasn't attracted new
contributors so far.  Development activity is very low, there are a few
questions on the user list that get answered timely and we see almost no
JIRA activity.

We have conducted a user survey last quarter and only very few users
requested support for .NET 1.x, so we may be able to clean up the code
base for upcoming releases.


log4php:

The log4php team has released version 2.2.1.
Florian Semm has joined then ranks of the log4php committers.
The log4php project is still small, but it seems it gets more and more
attraction. Since the last report we have found a few positive reviews
of log4php in the blogosphere.


Chainsaw:

Progress on release still blocked by lack of activity to push log4j companions
on which it depends to release.

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

TLP

We have added several new PMC members:

* Martijn van Groningen
* Dawid Weiss
* Jan Jøydahl

Trademarks:
We have not made progress on trademarks since the last board report, but
do intend to finish the necessary pieces.

   * Project Naming And Descriptions :
     We believe this is complete, but are still reviewing.
   * Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
     www.apache.org included.
     Likely complete, but under review.
   * Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
     footers, etc.
     The main TLP site is converted, subproject sites have not.
   * Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your
     site In progress.  Some have been converted to have TM, some not.
     We don't seem to have ready volunteers on the graphical front,
     so it is slower than we'd like
   * Project Metadata : DOAP file checkedin and up to date
     Done

that increased the number of package downloads significantly.
The community is working towards a Lucene & Solr 3.6 release and plans
to branch trunk in preparation for a Lucene 4.0 Alpha release.

Additionally, we have added several new committers:

* David Smiley
* Christian Moen
* Sami Siren
* James Dyer
* Stefan Matheis
* Tommaso Teofili

Open Relevance Project

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either as it is a niche
area.

PyLucene

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
almost entirely an automated port, so this project will never
require a lot of developers.  The user community is active.

Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache OFBiz Project

Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

*Releases*
- new releases; "Apache OFBiz 09.04.02" has been released in 2012-02-25;
- the community has discussed a plan for a time-based release roadmap:
  the release branch 09.04 is now closed; the active release branches are
  now 10.04 and 11.04 (and the upcoming 12.04); from each active release
  branch we will release about 2 releases every year (approx every 6 months);
  every year in April we will create a new release branch (that will determine
  the major release number YY-MM); no more than 3 active release branches
  will be maintained and then we will close (every year sometimes before April)
  the oldest one; the OFBiz site download page has been updated with the
  above information; even if the plan is not set in stone the community will
  try to implement it and it will be reviewed over time if needed.

*Community and Project*
- new PMC member: Erwan De Ferrieres
- Community interaction remains strong, user and dev mailing lists traffic
 is high
- Significant new development continues

Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache OODT Project

Apache OODT is a software framework, and an architectural style for
the rapid construction of scientific data systems. It provides
components for data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow
management, resource management and data processing.

Releases/Development:

Paul Ramirez volunteered to roll an 0.4 release candidate, and
hopefully that will be done in the next week or so.

There are over 100+ issues that have been fixed since 0.3. The major
innovations in this release are the PCS Operator Interface [1], the
complete refactoring and re-architecture of the Workflow Engine
(aka "Workflow2") [2], OODT RADIX [3] for easy deployment of OODT
systems, and improvements to our command line interfaces for all
components [4].

Community:

The Apache OODT PMC has had a busy 3 months of adding new contributors.
We added Shakeh Khudikyan, Paul Zimdars, Luca Cinquini, and Bruce
Barkstrom to our ranks, and are in the process of wrapping up another
PMC member VOTE currently.

In addition, Apache OODT was recently used by a Master's student,
Billy Webb, who also works at Northrup Grumman corporation, to study
software architecture, and data systems. He cited Apache OODT as a
great example of an open source community, and active software
project, that he could use to study in his class.

Branding:

No updates beyond last report. Looks good.

Press:

Apache OODT was mentioned in several recent articles, including a
link from NASA's new code.nasa.gov website [5], in NASA Spinoff
magazine [6] (includes quotes from Chris Mattmann, Dan Crichton and
Jim Jagielski) and also in a link from MSNBC to the NASA Spinoff
site [7] which links to OODT.

Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.


Status

As usual we had a low levels of traffic in our users mailing lists,
but usually we are able to give an answer on fast time.
Little activity on dev mail list and issue tracker, but sometimes we
receive some patches from our users via JIRA.
I tried many times to get more committers, but nothing new at the moment.

On the progress of the project, we are still working on bug fixing,
and we proceed slowly because all of us can work on it only at spare time.
After we'll start to develop our next release with many new features.


Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.


Releases
No new Release, but we are working on a maintenance one: 2.0.2,
to be releases in a few months.


Branding/naming issues:
During the last quarter I re-read the revised branding docs, identify
all things that has to be done, and fix some of them.
Remaining issues are:
* main site navigation needs some additional links
* create a DOAP file


Legal issues:
None.


Infrastructure issues/needs:
INFRA-4355: Enable svnpubsub for Pivot web site - resolved
INFRA-4356: Enable svnpubsub for Pivot distrib - resolved

Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache Synapse Project

Apache Synapse is a highly performant, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus and mediation framework.

Community

We have nominated 2 new committers - Sadeep and Miyuru.
In addition we implemented a new policy that all committers are PMC members.
This has resulted in a larger PMC.
Two PMC members took this opportunity to become emeritus and we would like to
thank Oleg and Rajith for their efforts.

The level of participation on mailing lists is consistent and active, and
neither growing nor shrinking. However, a number of new users have started
asking questions this quarter.

During the reporting period there have been 73 commits from 5 committers.

Releases

We did a Synapse 2.1 release including the following features:
- Support for creating and managing REST APIs with URL patterns and URI
  templates
- Define sequences and endpoints as templates and reuse seamlessly across the
  whole configuration
- Payload factory mediator for constructing custom XML payloads
- Recipient list endpoint
- HTTPD like access logging capability in the NHTTP transport
- Message stores and message processors for implementing complex integration
  patterns and advanced messaging scenarios
- Receiving sequence support in the send mediator to make service chaining
  easier
- Conditional router mediator for implementing complex routing scenarios with
  many conditions and rules

Board issues

None identified.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the development of
web application user interfaces.

The Tiles PMC is in the middle of a slow, but steady reconstitution. This
quarter, like most quarters, has been characterized by slow progress. The
development team is aware that it has been a while since our last release and
discussion is underway to bring things together for a 3.0.0 release, which will
probably be Beta quality. We have not added any new PMC members this quarter,
but there have been a couple of outside contributions that may someday lead to
new committers if they continue.

As I've stated before, we believe that, at some point the original PMC will be
mostly replaced by new members and a new chair will be named. We don't have a
timeline for that right now, but it does feel like the new effort still has
legs.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment AN: Status report for the Apache Whirr Project

Status report for the Apache Whirr project - March 2012

Whirr is a library for running services in the cloud. Whirr graduated from the
incubator in August 2011.

Community
---------

We have a healthy, growing community as shown by the growing number of
messages on the dev and user lists. Last month we voted in two new committers:
Frank Scholten and Ioannis Canellos. Paul Baclace gave a lightning talk about
Whirr at BigDataCamp before O'Reilly's Strata conference in February.

No new PMC members have been added since the last board report (December 2011).

There are no issues that require the board attention.

Community Objectives
--------

Over the coming quarter we plan to make improve the reliability of launching
Whirr clusters, as well as make clusters resizable and reconfigurable. We
would also like to support more services on more cloud providers.

Releases
--------
Version 0.7.0 was released in December, and a bugfix release 0.7.1 was made
last month. We are close to a 0.7.2 release later this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AO: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Status report for the Apache Wicket Project March 2012

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Working with Git is great, the team thanks infra@ for their support
- Voted in a new committer and PMC member: Emond Papegaaij
- One release has been completed: 1.5.4
- Work on Wicket 6 is in its final stages and we'll be releasing a first
  beta soon, and hope to have 6.0.0 complete with our next report.

On using Git

I asked our PMC for their view whether Git has changed any community dynamics
and here are their reactions (I've summarized a bit).

 - Applying a patch over several branches (e.g. using 'git cherry-pick') is
   a lot easier

 - With the exception of much easier patch and branch management, which is a
   huge win), I don't think anything has really changed community-wise. We
   still communicate with the community via jira and patches.

 - Git is just a source control tool, it's not a community tool.

One committer notes that his old SVN workflow-merging between branches-is
still engrained in his brain, but he's slowly adopting Git.

Compliance with branding/trademark guidelines

Only our logo on the webpage does not comply in missing a TM. We're still
working on a new web design and will incorporate the TM in that design. All
other items on the checklist are fulfilled.

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed
applications.

There were three new releases in the last quarter; 3.4.1, 3.4.2,
3.4.3. All of them are bug fix releases. 3.3.5 is expected soon as a
bug fix release on the 3.3 branch.

Trunk is also under development for an eventual 3.5.0 release. So far
primarily code cleanup and refactoring has been applied to trunk.
We intend to do a 3.5.0 release in June.  Our focus is on scalability,
jdk7 and openjdk support, maven build/rel, testing and audit logging.


Community:

Apache ZooKeeper had its first official meetup in Feb.
http://www.meetup.com/zookeeperusergroup/events/49372662/

It was very well attended and received good feedback. This was an
effort to collect feedback from users and to create a more vibrant
developer community for ZooKeeper. We intend to do it every 3
months and get more participation from our users.


Mailing list activity continues to be high and we are seeing more
contributor activity than we've seen in past quarters.

* 8 active committers representing 5 unique organizations
* 7 active PMC members representing 4 unique organizations
* 298 subscribers on dev (up from 276 last quarter)
* 597 subscribers on user (up from 551 last quarter)

service. The project also includes Hedwig which is a highly scalable
Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper and Bookkeeper with strong
durability guarantees.

We are working towards our next release, 4.1.0, and we are planning
on having it out late March. We are also getting ready for our first
large-scale deployment at Yahoo!. We will report on our experience as
soon as we have concrete information.

--------------

This is a status report on the Apache Thrift website as requested by
Greg Stein on Sunday, March 4, 2012. The Apache Thrift website has
been minimally maintained since the projects initial incubation and is
currently in the process of a new reworking. We are investigating
different build mechanisms which will allow for us to use markdown as
the primary site language to facilitate easier community contributions
as well as a new site structure. We are also looking at possibly
moving our tutorials and how-to guides from the Apache provided wiki
and integrate them directly into the Apache Thrift site.
