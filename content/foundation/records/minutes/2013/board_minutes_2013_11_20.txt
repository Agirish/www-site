 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Over the last month, we've seen a number of threads spill over to the
       board mailing list, which were at times quite heated. These all appear
       to have been resolved, with the relevant committees able to take the
       next action where necessary. One encouragement I took from the
       threads was seeing a few new faces among our members and officers
       contributing helpfully.

       The status of the audit, which we discussed last month, remains a
       prominent topic. It appears positioned well to move forward.

       Overall, projects at the ASF are going well and the reports list no
       major issues. Information on community health in the reports is
       steadily improving.

    B. President [Ross]

       A whirlwind month for me personally, but good progress is being made
       across the foundation.

       EVP has made some good progress on ApacheCon negotiations, although LF
       are now asking for a long running contract. This is understandable since
       we are not taking any financial responsibility for the event. However,
       we need to discuss the implications of this. Rich intends to raise this
       during the board meeting.

       Martin van den Bemt has uploaded the videos from the previous two Apache
       Cons to YouTube. He was assisted by many people but the vast majority
       of the work was done by Martin. This was no easy task for a number of
       technical reasons along with a significant time investment. Thank you
       Martin.

       EA and VP Fundraising have successfully cleared the fundraising backlog
       (with help from others). Thank you to Upayavira for firstly reaching out
       for help when it was needed and secondly helping Melissa be productive in
       this role. Focus is now turning to making it easier for additional
       volunteers to take on specific fundraising activities. This is
       centering around adding further detail to the process documents drawn
       up by Upayavira and Melissa.

       VP Fundraising is considering some new fundraising activities (see
       Attachment 3). I have asked Upayavira to provide an outline of his
       proposal and will provide some initial feedback before bringing it to
       the board for consideration. As ever early feedback is welcome.

       Thanks also go out to Chris and Upayavira for finally resolving the
       PayPal issues. We also have (thanks to Phil Steitz) an alternative
       payment method through Amazon.

       EA has also made good progress merging her observations with respect
       to trademark handling with the documentation VP Brand Management has
       been creating. The next step is to ensure there are clear boundaries
       between "first level support", i.e. activities that anyone can
       undertake and more sensitive issues that require careful handling.
       This will reduce some workload but as Shane observes the bigger
       problem is "the growth and popularity of our 130+ projects". I intend
       to work with Shane and Melissa to address this growing problem in the
       coming months.

       Jim has stepped up to lead the Audit process with EA and Treasurer
       available to assist. As far as I am aware work has not yet commenced
       but I will be asking Melissa for a weekly update so that I can assist
       in any way appropriate.

       I have sent a proposal to the board (privately) to change Melissa's
       contract to increase her hours to accommodate the
       increasing workload she is taking on. I encourage the board to consider
       this in light of Melissa's critical role in reducing the fundraising
       backlog and ongoing efforts to identify additional supporting roles for
       our volunteers. I welcome suggestions from the board about how best to
       use this time and will continue to report plans as appropriate. The
       initial use of this time will be to accelerate the Event in a Box work
       and to ensure sufficient time is available to assist with the Audit.

       I signed an NDA with Symantec with respect to infra's code signing work.

       I'm aware that my reports have been at the last minute (including this
       one). I've agreed with our Chair that my reports will be submitted the
       weekend before the board meeting in future.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       VP, Fundraising the EA and Treasurer's Office worked together to
       fix an issue with PayPal that was preventing our donations from
       going through. The issue is addressed now and the Treasurer has an
       action item in progress to move the majority of our PayPal funds
       into our WFS account.

       Treasurer's Office confirmed payment made to PR Newswire account
       at request of VP, Press/Marketing. In addition, responded to several
       requests from EA to confirm sponsor delivery of funds on several
       fundraising items.

       Phil Steitz worked with VP, Fundraising and Treasurer's Office and
       led the way to set up Amazon Simple Pay as another mechanism outside
       of PayPal for receiving donations.

       An audit list is being set up and will be used for communications
       related to the impending audit. Jim Jagielski will lead the audit
       and push it forward.

       Amazon payments are not reflected anywhere since this is a new
       account and the report reflects activity through the end of
       October. Seems like a lot of money in checking not earning any
       interest. AI: Chris look into getting a better rate of return
       on the assets of the corporation.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       October was another busy month for Secretary.  There were 76 iclas, nine cclas, and four
       grants received and filed. 

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        I'd like to give a verbal report on the progress of ApacheCon,
        as I should be receiving some information on Monday or Tuesday,
        making it difficult to get a report in on time.

       Draft agreement for ApacheCon run by the Linux Foundation is
       not yet available. Could not find a venue in Las Vegas; a
       venue is on hold for Denver for the 2014 conference.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

* Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
  treasurer@, comdev@, and board@) and following-up with appropriate personnel

* Fundraising:
* Fundraising has been progressing very well.  The backlog of sponsorship
  renewal invoices to be sent out have all been sent out, so now it's a
  more manageable system of "maintaining".
* Upayavira and I have agreed upon a three-strike system.
    1) Renewal invoice sent out;
    2) send a f/u email three weeks after the invoice was sent for a status
       update;
    3) three weeks after the first reminder, another reminder will go out
       for another status update.  In this reminder, we will be advising
       them that their sponsorship info will be removed from the "thanks"
       page as a sponsor.
* The "How-To" manual continues to be a WIP; we (Upayavira and I) add to
  this document as we go along.
* ApacheCon:
* Progressing well - Rich will provide more information
* Treasurer's Office:

* Will be creating a "How-To" manual for the Treasurer's Office (this has
  been put as a low priority for now)
* Will be assisting in the Audit in parallel with taking notes to incorporate
  into the manual

* Weekly status calls with Ross and Rich
* Event-in-a-Box:
* Received a lot of valuable feedback from the community

* Started a "How To Guide"
* Will need two boxes; one for the US, and one for the UK
* Will be getting an estimate for materials of two boxes (minimal list and
  maximum list); the estimate will also include shipping/insurance
  charges, etc.

* ApacheCon EU & NA videos:
* The recordings from Portland are done and posted online at
  http://www.youtube.com/user/TheApacheFoundation
* Martin working on the ApacheCon EU (Germany) videos
* Trademarks:
* Working with Shane to create a "How-To" manual for Trademarks

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

No current board level issues.

Stepped up trademark enforcements for several projects with good results.

Added ea@ to the trademarks@ list and reviewed our two runbooks as we
start to find ways the EA can assist with organizing answering issues
on trademarks@.

Sent [ACTION] Review your Apache project's brand use to pmcs@ with
pointers to various updated and clarified PMC-related branding
requirements to ensure that PMCs are aware of their responsibilities.
Oddly, there were no comments directed back to trademarks@.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

The main thing to report this month is that Melissa has got a handle on
contacting our outstanding bronze/silver sponsors. This is excellent,
as we can now be sure that things will progress as they need to with the
necessary follow through.

We shall contact sponsors three times, and if we hear nothing, we shall
be removing people from the thanks page.

As noted in the treasurer's report, we also managed to resolve the
issue at PayPal, meaning funds are flowing into paypal once more. Thanks
to Chris for his help providing the information required.

We also established, with the help of Phil Steitz, the ability to
receive donations via Amazon's payment service. We hope to extend our
donation services to send immediate thank you letters, with the
intention that this will meet US tax payer's need for proof of a
tax-efficient donation.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain on schedule and under budget. No vendor payments are due
at this time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 16 October: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache(tm) Hadoop(tm) 2

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were announced on @TheASF and 6 new posts
were made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feeds. Hearty thanks to Martin van den Bemt
for uploading 98 presentations from ApacheCon North America 2013 on
"TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube. There remains no working plan on
publishing the presentations from ApacheCon Europe 2012, however.

V. Future Announcements: Sally Khudairi has been reviewing podling and TLP
promotion processes and tactics. PMCs wishing to announce major project news,
as well as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator, are welcome to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at
least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 9 media requests, including several
process queries. The ASF received 1,400 press clips over this time period,
vs. last month's clip count of 1,090.

VII. Analyst Relations: Apache was mentioned in 13 reports by Gartner,
13 write-ups by GigaOM, 23 reports by Yankee Group, and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally will be working with Rich Bowen and
Melissa Warnkin on any issues needed for planning the next ApacheCon, with
particular focus on sponsor-related activities. She is also fielding
several questions regarding the next ApacheCon.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: the ASF has been
selected to win an award at SC13, and will be represented again this year
by Marlon Pierce and Suresh Marru, who will attend the award ceremony. We
have been nominated for a Design for Experience Award in the
"Bringing Order to Big Data" category, and invited to participate in
Data Innovation Day 2014 (responses received from the Apache Gora and
Apache cTakes PMCs thus far). Apache OpenOffice also received a
"Trusted Seal of Approval" award from PCMagazine. Sally is also following up on
two queries in the government and enterprise data space.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 10 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire
through December 2013, and 17 pre-paid press releases on the PRNewswire account
through May 2014. Our donation of free press release distribution by UK-based
service Pressat has no pre-established distribution timeframe(s).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

Discussed funding a pair of contractors to attend a Cloudstack
conference to gain additional skills- approved by VP Infra.  Only
one will actually attend.

Acquired a free license for Jira Help Desk - rollout forthcoming.

Installed wildcard SSL cert for *.openoffice.org.

In pursuit of outsourced code-signing capability for project
releases.  Negotiations have reached the NDA phase.

Migrated the bulk of our SQL infra to a centralized database server.

Discussed replenishing our Mac build infra.

Purchased a wildcard cert for *.incubator.apache.org.  3 years
at $475 per year.

Began holding informal weekly meetings via google hangouts.  Open
to all infra-team members.

Had a configuration regression regarding the PIG and DRILL Confluence
wikis, which allowed additional spam to reappear on those spaces.

Apachecon.eu DNS reacquired from our registrar.  Somehow it wasn’t
configured to autorenew so we lost that domain for a few days.

We are still considerably behind the curve in our Jira workload and
that is starting to inform some of the reporting at the board level.
Please be patient while we continue to ramp up with existing personnel
to support the org’s continued growth.  In response we have organized
a monthly jira walkthrough day dedicated entirely to outstanding
jira requests.  Raw jira stats show we have made significant progress
over the past month and we expect that trend to continue, with 116 opened
vs. 166 closed.

Aegis is reporting a bad disk and it needs to be replaced as the host
is seriously underperforming in its current state.

Dell has solicited a warranty renewal offering for arcas, our jira server.

We need to sort out licensing for our VMWare infra as we are currently in
a holding pattern for new VM’s until this gets resolved.

We’ve disabled the user ability to edit their profile page in confluence,
eliminating another common source of spam.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

The committee is getting ready to help with ApacheCon North America 2014,
as best as it can with the current information shared. We are currently
reviewing our Applications webapp, to see if any changes or additions will
be needed to it, and we'll select judges as soon as the venue and dates
are announced.

In general, to secure the best prices, we like to have all flights booked
90 days before the event. It normally takes a few weeks to work out the
best flights, then get approval from everyone to book them, and the
scoring and selection is typically about 2 weeks too. That means we
normally want to close applications 120 days out from the event. A typical
application period is about 1 month, giving a 5 month lead time. If the
event is to happen in early April, that means we're already behind!
The committee will do its best to work within compressed timescales, but
it may mean we don't get quite as many people as we'd hope for, and may
mean more expensive flights due to shorter notice bookings.

We will continue to watch the board list for updates, but we wouldn't
object if someone involved in the conference could talk to us about
timescales, bookings, but most importantly how best we can help support
the conference!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

ASF is no longer represented on:

* Patents and Standards Interest Group
* Push API Patent Advisory Group

(ASF was also represented on the Widgets Patent Advisory Group - this PAG
is now closed.)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Sam Ruby]

There was a request to classify CC-BY as a category A license, in support
of a W3C HTML WG experiment.  As no ASF projects are known to be affected
by this experiment, this request was resolved as Not A Problem.  In the
process, the entire Third Party Licensing Policy was called into question.
I thank everybody who helped resolve this.

Notable other discussions:

ODC-By was approved for use by VXQuery.

Distribution by ASF PMCs of ASF Projects as iOS Applications is stalled by an
Apple imposed requirement that precludes other distributions.

After over five years as VP, Legal Affairs I have decided to step down and
recommend Jim Jagielski as my replacement.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds
arriving at security@ in October. These continue to be dealt with by
the security team.

1 Support question
5 Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
2 Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
9 Vulnerability Reports
  1 [httpd, via security@]

  1 [aoo, via security@openoffice]
  1 [cloudstack, via security@cloudstack]
  4 [tomcat, via security@tomcat]
  2 [hadoop, via security@hadoop]

Microsoft, Facebook, and others launched a program offering a bug
bounty for flaws found in Apache httpd, https://hackerone.com/ibb
designed to run without interaction or endorsement by the ASF, but
we'll report how that actually works out in future months.

it into line with the underlying Apache Commons Compress library 1.6

Ivy
-------
Ivy 2.3.0 was released on January 21, 2013
Ivy-DE 2.1.0 was released on Aug 20, 2010
Ive-DE 2.2.0 is currently under vote for release

EasyAnt

I note with sadness the passing on September 5th of long-time committer and
PMC member, Bruce Atherton

http://www.apache.org/memorials/bruce_atherton.html

o Community

No issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Michele Mostarda]

Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command
line tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety
of Web documents.

Project Releases

The last release of Any23 (0.9.0) was on 3rd November 2013.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Project activity has actually picked up since last month.
We were able to engage more members of the community in
VOTE'ing for the 0.9.0 release candidate which subsequently
enabled us to make the release.
We have had positive feedback from both within the Any23 community
and over on dev@tika for possibly branching Tika and gradually merging
in the aspects of the Any23 codebase from which Tika could benefit.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Chris Mattmann was added back to the PMC on Wed, 15th May 2013.

How has the community developed since the last report?

We have had some users on the list but lists are far from busy.
We remain positive that the 0.9.0 release and the initiative to
take Any23 over to Tika will help to reinvigorate the project
for the benefit of a wider audience.

Changes to PMC & Committers

Nothing to report.

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of Apache projects
including, Nutch, Tika, OODT, Gora, Jena and Maven
(this is not an exhaustive list).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Gianugo Rabellino]

The Attic is currently experiencing a lack of volunteer time. We have two
projects in the pipeline (stdcxx and ESME) who’s archival process looks
stuck – and actually even never started for stdcxx. I guess it’s time
for the Attic PMC to do an open enrollment and see if we can secure more
helping hands.

On a somewhat unrelated note, I think the board should actively be aware
of the following tidbits, which don’t apply directly to the Attic but may
well have impact one way or another:

1. Two projects (XMLBeans and DDLUtils) have theoretically moved to the
Attic. However, both archival processes have been stopped as the community
decided to try and revive them. Work hasn't been started on the Attic side,
waiting to see what happens. XML beans is currently beginning an incubation
process.

2. Axis is expected to start moving inactive projects to the Attic. No
concrete follow-up yet as of today and we hope that when they do, they
come with volunteers ready to help out.

3. A long thread on dev@click.a.o and board@ happened in September,
moving quickly from retirement of Click into a general discussion on creating
a new category of "finished" projects with no real community but still not
attic-worthy. I assume there is no action for the Attic at this point in
time, but the thread may well be revived in the near future.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Scott Carey]

Apache Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

== Issues ==

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

== Community ==

There has been work across most language implementations, and healthy interest
in new features / enhancements.

User and Developer mailing list activity has been down about 10% this quarter.

== Releases ==

Avro 1.7.5 was released on August 26, 2013.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]

Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages
and tools.

We've made 3 minor releases (1.4.13, 1.4.14, 1.4.15) since September.
Development activity has been fairly high compared to our average for the
past 2 years, with about 140 commits including a few bug fixes, dependency
updates and better support for Ruby 2.0.  Collectively, these releases
contained 8 external contributions.

In October, we voted a new committer (Tammo van Lessen) and a new PMC member
(Peter Donald) into the project.

Our mailing lists remain relatively quiet.

We have no issues that require board attention.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Clerezza Project  [Hasan Hasan]

DESCRIPTION
Apache Clerezza is an OSGi-based modular application and a set of components
(bundles) for building RESTFul Semantic Web applications and services.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASE
Latest release (partial-release-20130710) was created on 10.07.2013

ACTIVITY

- Provision of Karaf features and Sling Partial Bundle Lists so that features
of Clerezza can more easily be integrated
- Solution to problems with Scala compiling
- Improvement of smushing to allow "smushing" of owl:sameAs resources with a
flexible API that allows client customizations (as for choosing the
preferred IRI of a resource)
- Improvement of memory usage when creating zipped backup
- Several locking issues, however some more fundamental problems with
the single-dataset tdb provider are still to be addressed.
- Initial commit of the Virtuoso/Clerezza storage adapter, an implementation of
the storage API of Clerezza to use Virtuoso as storage.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Click Project  [Malcolm Edgar]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it
is based around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is
very similar to Cocoon 2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and
designed to be easily used with Java code (= no frameworks required!).
On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal of becoming the best available
platform for RESTful webservices and web applications.

Issues needing board attention:
 None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
 None.
 Last modified: 2012/10/21 (change of PMC chair)

Community

Traffic on users and devs list continues be light. Some users asked
about the different versions of cocoon. Various devs attended the
questions and provided solutions.

Releases

2.1 has been released on 2013/03/20.


Development
None


Security issues reported:
 None.

Progress of the project:

 We need to release a new version of cocoon 3 and cocoon 2.2 but no
committer has stepped up yet to do so.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Luciano Resende]

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects


Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

PMC changes
-----------

No Changes. The latest addition has been Suresh Marru on 2013-04-26.

Google Summer of Code
---------------------

GSoC is over. Of the initial 51 students, 45 passed the midterm
evaluations and 44 passed the final evaluations.

The ComDev PMC initially decided to send Lewis John McGibbney and Ulrich
Stärk to the GSoC Mentor Summit in Mountain View in October. Uli could not
attend and we haven't contacted Lewis for a summary yet so there is
nothing we can report on the summit.

A blog post featuring 5 of our student's projects has been published in
Google's Open Source Blog. Several other blog posts, most notably from the
Apache CloudStack community have been written as well.

Overall, GSoC seems to have been a success again.

ASF-ICFOSS Mentoring Programme
------------------------------

The ASF-ICFOSS mentoring program has finished as well. The results are
disappointing. It seems that no student actually finished their project.
There is a discussion going on on mentors@community.apache.org (formerly
known as code-awards@apache.org) exploring possible reasons for this
failure.

ComDev & Events
---------------

The ComDev PMC is now a "home" for some of the ConCom responsibilities.
Recently there have been discussions about the planned "Event-in-a-Box"
and some progress has been made thanks to Melissa. Several events have
been added to the event calendar and Melissa has been granted access in
order to help with maintenance.

Other
-----

There is uncertainty among our projects due to upcoming changes to
Google's Google Code platform. In the future, projects won't be able to
host files there anymore. It is unclear how that will affect PMCs that
rely on file hosting on apache-extras.org which runs on Google Code.
Luciano said he'd check with Google.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
(Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
which are missing in the CDI core spec.

DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like Apache TomEE,
Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly, Oracle WebLogic,
Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also
on simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

Project Status:
Bugfixing goes on in the current code base.
Community is stable and active.
Mark Struberg did present DeltaSpike on the OpenBlend and W-JAX conferences.

Releases:
last release: deltaspike-0.5 on 2013-09-11.
There are discussions whether to ship 0.6 next or to go straight to 1.0.

Community:
Last Committer: Thomas Hug (thug) on 2013-06-20
Mailing list activity was ok. Users have been asking for a 1.0 release.

Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache DirectMemory Project  [Raffaele P. Guidi]

Apache DirectMemory is an off-heap cache implementation for the JVM

* General Information
DirectMemory is being evaluated by project jackrabbit for integration of off-heap
memory into OAK.
Another, more performant back-end implementation is being contributed by
noctarius

* Issues
Development is not moving really fast and adoption is still quite limited to other
apache projects - although more than some interesting integrations have been
contributed. Any help would be appreciated, though, in suggestions, spreading the word,
testing and facilitating the adoption of the platform

* Committers or PMC members change
Noctarius has been added as a new PMC member on 2013-09-25

* Releases
Release 0.2 has seen the light on 2013-09-17 - this is the first one since we left incubation

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  No activity on the user mail list.

  The only activity on the dev mail list was me making the progress that is
  described below. That will hopefully continue the efforts to re-vitalise
  this community.

  Soon after my almost-late board report in August, two PMC members responded.
  At this quarter, four PMC members responded to my draft report. This
  confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:

  Upgraded some of our supporting products, in particular Cocoon-2.1 and
  Batik and FOP and XML Graphics Commons and Xerces.

  In conjunction, upgraded our PDF output plugin to utilise FOP-1.0 version.
  (Note that Cocoon uses an old version of Java so we cannot do FOP-1.1).

  Finished configuring Gump. This utilises whatever products that Gump does
  provide, and uses our packaged supporting products for the rest (including
  Cocoon-2.1.*). So now we have various jobs for Forrest that also test some
  of our key plugins. This is great news, as we are now back to getting
  potential notifications from the head of some of our key supporting stuff
  and potential project interaction. Thanks to Gump.

  Improvements to some documentation, especially regarding building plugins
  and utilising extra JavaScript and CSS in project sites.

  Added some examples of the latter, and some tweaks to the system to better
  enable such.

  Last quarter i missed reporting that another of our PMC members did the
  follow-on upgrade work on our jail server following the machine upgrade by
  ASF Infra.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Project activity has been reasonably quiet with much less mailing list
activity than the summer quarter.
There has however been promising activity from a new member of the
community Yasin Tamer. We are currently working on GORA_94 a branch
of the trunk code which focuses on a long-overdue upgrade of our
legacy Avro dependencies from 1.3.3 to 1.7.5. As this is a major
undertaking therefore once this is addressed we will be pushing a release
candidate for 0.4.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Roland von Herget joined as PMC member and committer
on Thu, 7th Mar 2013.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Gora again participated in this years Google Summer of Code program.

    Apache Stratos 3.0.0-incubating       Oct 16      Oct 27         11

* IP Clearance

  * Rcouch, an alternative distribution of Apache CouchDB based
    the 1.3 release, has been accepted by the CouchDB PMC.
  * Juniper Networks, Inc has donated a plugin for Apache CloudStack to
    work with their Contrail networking software.
  * Citrix has donated a plugin for Apache CloudStack to support RDP
    connectivity for virtual machines running within Hyper-V hypervisors.

* Miscellaneous

  * Several discussion threads on project bylaws, initiated by Flex
    community pursuing refinement of their own, have made it clear just how
    difficult it is to draft good bylaws.  A number of people expressed a
    desire for a set of well-crafted, official project bylaws which all
    projects would "inherit".  Since that's hard, though, for the time being
    we're muddling through with patches to the existing ramshackle
    documentation.

  * The Incubator's perpetual difficulties getting podling releases approved
    has spawned another lively discussion.  We seem to have reached
    agreement that we can mitigate the problem by entrusting meritorious
    podling contributors with a binding vote on incubating releases; debate
    continues about what implementation to try.  At time of writing, the
    stratagem with the most popular support seems to be electing more
    podling contributors directly onto the IPMC, but the thread has not yet
    tailed off.

  Suresh Marru (smarru):

    * The podling seems to be very healthy and kudos to PPMC for pulling of
      their first release and getting ready for second.
    * A big kudos to couple of mentors for pro-actively engaging.
    * Blur website does not conform to the branding guidelines and should
      add the incubator logo and disclaimer prominently. Also, should
      include the ASF, security and thanks to sponsor links.

--------------------

  OpenDDR device data updates have been contributed.

  Extensive testing (hundreds of iterations through full set and various
  subsets of close to half a million unique user-agent strings) of all
  versions (java & .Net languages) currently in the repository showed
  that DeviceMapClient is literally over a 1,000 times faster than
  any other currently available tool (milliseconds vs microseconds)
  with a fraction of the code. Accuracy (approaching 98%) can be
  improved with n-gram tokens in resource data instead of
  regex patterns.

Open Climate Workbench

A tool for scalable comparison of remote sensing observations to climate
model outputs, regionally and globally.

Open Climate Workbench has been incubating since 2013-02-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Draft graduation resolution
  2. Pick chair
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community growth has slowed but development work has continued strong. A
  number of people on the project attended the International Conference on
  Regional Climate - CORDEX 2013 and spoke about research that is being
  powered by the Open Climate Workbench.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Quite a bit of development work has continued on the project. Michael
  Joyce pushed out the 0.3-incubating release on the October 11 which
  resolved about 85 issues. Denis Nadeau made a huge contribution to the
  project in the obs4MIPs code base which provides a great deal of utility
  to the project. Cameron Goodale added tests that run the toolkit through
  an entire comparison so users can validate dependency installations and
  get a feel for how to use OCW.

Ripple

Ripple is a browser based mobile platform development and testing tool.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Fix licensing issues, specifically some of the images.
  2. Build up the community.
  3. Make a release under Apache.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are still seeing increased non-committer participation in
  threads, issues, etc.

  However, aside from the odd contribution, most of the recent work
  has been committer based.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Intel has been doing a lot of work on the project (in a fork)- still
  waiting for a possible contribution back into the ASF project.
  http://software.intel.com/en-us/html5/tools

  Continuing Cordova 3.0 work to get to a stable, releasable product.

  The Chrome Extension build target was removed altogether from the project,
  in an effort to simplify and streamline the building/compilation of the
  project into a usable application, and because the project has been
  continually moving towards a [more feature-able] NodeJS backend, capable
  of being run in any Browser.

Sirona

Apache Sirona is a library around monitoring of Java application.  It aims
to stay simple, easy and efficient.

It will be composed of several modules which are globally a server very
easily extensible (and which will be integrated with other Apache softwares)
and several client modules to collect data and push them to any aggregator
you want (Sirona one or not).

Sirona has been incubating since 2013-10-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  - Finish bootstrapping project, IP clearance, initial website

Shepherd notes:

  Roman Shaposhnik (rvs):

    Given that it has been less then a month since project entered
    incubation I see that the most immediate needs of having a source code
    repo, JIRA and MLs have been met. Still it would be nice if the
    bootstrapping were to wrap up as quickly as possible. At this point, for
    example, there's no website and no wiki, etc. Those are the tools for
    helping the community growth and it would be very nice to see those
    coming online in a few weeks.

--------------------
Storm

Storm is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-performance realtime
computation system that provides strong guarantees on the processing of
data.

Storm has been incubating since 2013-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Release Storm 0.9.0 with the current github process (the next release,
     0.9.1 will be under the Apache process -- we have promised our
     community a 0.9.0 release prior to moving to the Apache process).
  2. Finish bootstrapping the project, migrate github issues to JIRA.
  3. Expand the community and adding new committers.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There has been a delay with some of the committers getting user accounts.
  This is an impediment to the bootstrap process.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Several new community members have submitted contributions, but we are
  largely still bootstrapping the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have continued to apply bug fixes necessary for the 0.9.0 release and
  expect one more release candidate before releasing 0.9.0 and migrating to
  the Apache process. We have adopted aspects of the apache process in
  anticipation of this.

  Our dev/user mailing lists have been created and we've notified the
  community that those lists should be used instead of the google groups
  list.  We will sunset the google groups list shortly.

Date of last release:

  - None. We are sill bootstrapping the project.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  - N/A -- We are still bootstrapping the project.

Tez

Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be
used to process arbitrarily complex data-processing tasks and also a
re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other
projects.

Tez has been incubating since 2013-02-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Making a release
  2. Growing the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No new PPMC members or committers added since the last report. We have had
  some interest on the mailing lists both from a user and contributor
  perspective. There have been a few contributions coming in from new
  contributors. We are hoping to grow the community once Tez becomes a more
  mainstream feature in use by Hive and Pig.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the first week of August, 2013 (last report), we have had around
  240+ jiras filed and 200+ jiras resolved. There have been multiple
  meetings with folks from the Hive and Pig projects. Folks in the Hive
  community have been working on integrating with Tez for quite some time
  (HIVE-4660 for more details). In the past few months, we have had more
  interactions with the Pig community on using Tez as one of the execution
  engines and there is quite a bit of work being done to integrate with Tez
  (more details on PIG-3446).

Date of last release:

  None yet, we anticipate making one end of November, 2013.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  At project incubation. No new PPMC members or committers added since the

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to the logging of application behavior.

Currently there are no issues, which require Boards attention.

- Community

Log4j 2 remains a very active project. The overall
community is healthy and friendly. The reception of Log4j 2
in the wider community is very good.

Christian Grobmeier gave a few more talks on Log4j 2.
The latest mention of Log4j 2 was at W-Jax in Germany (Nov 7).

The activity around log4cxx has stalled again. Mailinglists are read.

Log4net activity has increased and a release has been cut.

In general, the project is healthy and growing.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Board Report, ManifoldCF PMC

ManifoldCF PMC Chair: Karl Wright (kwright@apache.org)
Date: November 2013

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security
policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been five major releases, including a 1.4 release on October 28,
2013.

Committers and PMC membership
========================

The last committer and PMC member we signed up was Minoru Osuka (minoru), on
January 10, 2013.  We voted in a new committer and PMC member in May, but he
declined to accept the committership due to his company's policies.  Other
contributors have been approached, but have also declined to accept
consideration for possible committership. The most recent of these
encounters took place in September.

We are not entirely sure why people who are obviously interested and to some
degree committed to the project seem unwilling to become full committers.  I
suspect that corporate restrictions make this a challenge in some cases.
Also, we seem to be interacting more with contractors than with employees
recently, and it may well be that contractors have less interest in a
long-standing relationship with our project.

Mailing list activity
==============

Mailing list has been active, with a wide range of topics.  Most of our
connectors now have significant use cases and constituencies.  Dev list
comments centered around voting, extensions to the SharePoint connector,
people looking for integration advice, etc.  ManifoldCF also participated in
Google Summer of Code, and MCF committers mentored one student developer
through end of September.

External contributions and even committer contributions have been somewhat
lighter this cycle than in the last quarter.  Communication with committers
indicates that this is due in some degree to the maturity of the product,
but also to an uptick in everyone's work load.

I am unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

Both Infra issues that were outstanding at the time of the last report have
been resolved.

Branding
========

We have reviewed the site branding guidelines and believe we are now
compliant with these, with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos
from other Apache products that don't have any such marks.  Hopefully we
will be able to correct this issue soon.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

DESCRIPTION

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu OAuth2 0.31 was released on July 3rd.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard. New parts of the OAuth specification family are currently under
development (JWT, JWS and OpenId Connect)

We got a contribution of the Apache Oltu logo that has now been included in
the website and in the Oltu demo.

Users activity is growing slowly but steadily (the user@ mailing list has
got new messages from potential new users)

COMMUNITY

PMC composition has not changed since graduation
We have voted one new committer since graduation

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

2013). Last committer added was Pavel Moravec on 30th Aug, 2013. Last
PMC members to be added were Andrew Stitcher, Chuck Rolke, Justin Ross
and Keith Wall in September 2011.

Development since last the report has been mainly maintenance & bug
fixing on the various components. Development of a proposed new
component, the Qpid Dispatch Router, has continued along with some
discussion regarding its scope and aims.

Increased PMC and committer diversity would be desirable. At present
all but two of the active committers - and all but one of the PMC
members - are paid to work on the project by one of two
organisations. Some discussions have begun to try and find ideas for
proactively improving this situation.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache River Project  [Greg Trasuk]

Apache River is a Java-based Service Oriented Architecture, implementing
the Jini Specification and Jini Technology Starter Kit originally
donated by Sun Microsystems.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

There are no board-level issues at this time

RELEASES

Apache River 2.2.1 was released on May 2, 2013.
As of Nov 13, 2013, a release vote is in progress for Apache River 2.2.2 and is
expected to pass.

COMMUNITY

No new committers have been added since Nov of 2011.
We hope that with releases coming on a more regular basis, user interest will
pick up, and with it we will attract more potential new committers.

ACTIVITY

Mailing lists and development have been fairly quiet over the last few
months.  7 messages on users@ from Sept-Nov, and over 32 messages on
dev@.  Activity is on the upswing in November

Two issues have been reported on Jira and resolved.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Roller Project  [Dave Johnson]

Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based weblogging package that works
well on Tomcat and MySQL, and is also known to run on other servers and
databases. The ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org runs on Roller 5.0.2.

Issues

No board issues at this time.

Releases

The latest release of Apache Roller is v5.0.2, which was released
on October 30, 2013, a security vulnerability and bug fix release.
For more information:

http://rollerweblogger.org/project/entry/apache_roller_5_0_2

Community

The Roller community has been active recently responding to
security vulnerabilities reported by Coverity. We made the 5.0.2
release and upgraded blogs.apache.org to the new release.

Apart from that activity, the Roller community continues to be rather
quiet with low traffic that mostly concerns technical support and
installation issues.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

Development:
Implemented Matrices as a derivative of JAMA work [1]:
Experimented the use of MathML to render mathematical formulas in SIS
documentation
Submitted patches for better build support in Eclipse[2][3]
Implemented the geodetic datum package.

Community:
Nadeem Anjum successfully completed the Google Summer of Code!
Added Olivier Nouguier to SIS PMC on 2013-10-11

Branding:
Continue to enhance the project web site as well as project documentation

Issues:
Continue to seek a resolution with using the EPSG database in SIS[4]

The EPSG geodetic parameter dataset [7] is a freely available structured
repository of data used in geospatial applications. This dataset is of
critical importance to the Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) project.
All major geographic software that we know, both open-source and commercial,
include the EPSG database in one form or the other. Distributing SIS without
EPSG would be like distributing Java without data for Charset encoding
(UTF-8, ISO-LATIN-1, etc.).  References to EPSG appear in many corners of
core SIS API (e.g. [8]).

The EPSG database is maintained by the "International Association of Oil &
Gas Producers" (OGP) and members are big companies like Shell. Oil & Gas
producers maintain and provide the EPSG database free of charge because the
cost of installing a drilling platform in the wrong location is too high.
Since they rely on maps and data produced by various actors (national map
agencies, etc.), it is in their best interest that those actors have access
to the most accurate Map Projection definitions when they create their data.

The ASF has criteria for inclusion of third-party products [9]. However those
criteria seem to be designed for software, while the EPSG files are data. A
volunteer can rewrite a software from scratch until it complies with a
specification, but we can not recreate definitions data - there is no way
that such information could emerge from a volunteer's imagination without
significant expertise in each of the over six thousand available
transformations.

The EPSG terms of use [10] have two conditions which may be unusual for
Apache: one restriction on modification, and one restriction on distribution.
But we think that the restriction on modifications is reasonable and well
justified, while the condition on distribution may not have practical impact
for Apache.

Restriction on modifications
----------------------------
EPSG documents precisely the kind of modifications that users are allowed to
apply on their data. For those familiar with geodesy, it is immediately
obvious that those restrictions are designed in such a way that geographical
coordinates would still locate the same points on Earth. EPSG do not forbid
modifications, but basically said "if you apply any modifications that would
alter the location of points on Earth, then give to your definition your own
code (primary key) and do not attribute that to EPSG". We think that this is
reasonable because this engage EPSG's credibility. When one said "EPSG:4326",
we expect something that match the EPSG definition of Coordinate Reference
System 4326.  Changing that would be like changing the meaning of Unicode 65
from character 'A' to 'B' and still claim that it is a Unicode. If someone
really wants to make such change, he can but is probably not allowed to claim
that the modified code is Unicode (or at least, he is required to document
clearly his change according condition (c) of [11]). Likewise for EPSG, users
are allowed to make any changes they want provided that they apply their
changes on a *copy* of EPSG definition copied in the user's *own* codespace
(it doesn't have to be in a separated database - EPSG defines range of codes
reserved for user's definitions). Or if a user really wants to modify the
definition under the "EPSG" name, then the EPSG restrictions apply.

As the ASF increases in complexity and addresses more and more topics like
environment, health, laws, etc., maybe this kind of situation would happen
more often. For example if a medical authority maintained a free database of
drugs, we would not be surprised if that authority put restrictions on the
changes allowed in their database while keeping the authority's label. In SIS
domain, other potential data after EPSG (while much less critical for SIS)
could be tables and symbols from the World Meteorological Organisation for
example.

The key point of above paragraph is that this issue may not be a SIS/EPSG
issue only.  Maybe it could concern the inclusion of data emitted by any
authority (as opposed to data created by volunteers on the basis of their own
observations).

Restriction on distribution
---------------------------
In a nutshell, anywone can sell SIS + EPSG for profit, but can not sell the
EPSG tables alone (without Apache's work). While this condition would need to
be mentioned somewhere (in NOTICE file?), maybe Apache does not need to be
concerned further that point? If someone download Apache SIS and delete
everything - the *totality* of Apache's work - until only EPSG tables remain,
maybe the restriction that emerge only in this situation is not Apache's
business anymore? (provided that we mentioned it).

More discussion on this restriction is in [4]. If needed, Martin knows the
chairman of OGP's Geodesy Subcommittee and could ask for further
clarification.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache XML Graphics Project  [Chris Bowditch]

The Apache XML Graphics Project is responsible for software intended for
the creation & maintenance of the conversion of XML formats to graphical
output & related software components.

Issues for the Board
====================
No issues at present.


Community
=========
Last new committer: Robert Meyer on 05/08/13

Last new PMC member: Luis Bernardo on 04/03/13

The PMC discussed the problem of lack of active committers on Batik sub
project. There are some users logging bugs and posting occasional patches
into JIRA, but no one to process them. The PMC has agreed to allow all PMC
members commit access to all XML Graphics sub projects regardless of their
originating sub project. The vote has just concluded, so an adjustment to
the auth template file will be made later this week to implement this.
It is hoped that some of the FOP committers will periodically process
Batik patches to stop the sub project from dying.


XML GRAPHICS COMMONS
====================
2 bug fixes committed to SVN, and code added for OTF CFF Font support

There were no releases this quarter.

The latest release is 1.5 (20 October 2012)


FOP
===
User mailing list has several questions posted and answered each week. Some
new bugs logged and several patches have been submitted and processed.
27 separate commits in total to SVN. Significant new features of note,
started in this quarter are; support for a whitespace management extension
and fo:inline-container. Development for both have been started in branches
and several commits made to each as work progresses.

There were no releases this quarter

The latest release is 1.1 (20 October 2012)


BATIK
=====
Mailing list activity was very light. A few bugs have been reported by
users and a couple of patches submitted. Zero commits to the codebase,
which is why the PMC started a discussion on how to deal with the patches
and bugs being logged.

There were no releases this quarter.

The latest version is 1.7 (6 January 2008)
