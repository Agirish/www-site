 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       There was a brief board discussion of the chain of command
       within the ASF.  We agreed that our infrastructure contractors
       report to the VP of Infrastructure, who in turn reports to the
       President.  While we try to keep things informal, it's still
       best to know where everyone stands formally.  When the
       authority of our words are different depending on which hat
       hat we wear, whether officer, contractor, PMC member or ASF
       member, then we are wise to clarify.

    B. President [Jim]

       All President's cmmts reported and in general all is well. There
       are no issues with branding or marketing; fundraising has been
       active with renewals and this has created a delay in sending out
       the 'Thank You' letters. I am working with Fundraising to address
       their questions.

       ApacheCon NA 2013 is next week; I will be doing the standard 'State
       of the Feather' talk. Concom will be doing a post-con assessment.
       There will likely be an event in Bangalore in late March in which
       Concom is involved with.

       Both Infra and TAC are also progressing well.

       There were delays in getting reports this month; I will look
       into extending Marvin to better remind my cmmts to report earlier.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       On Jan 17th, Jim in his President's role informed Gav as TAC
       chair that for normal expenses related to TAC he is authorized
       to svn move bills from Bills/received to Bills/approved in the
       Treasurer workflow. However, TAC must provide a full accounting
       of such charges in their monthly report. It was also clarified
       that expenses for TAC team members cannot be approved by the
       TAC chair and must be approved by Jim and Ross
       (operations@apache.org)

       All bills continue to be paid as requested. We are currently in
       process for payment to the former ApacheCon producer for charges
       for ApacheConNA 2011 and 2010 and processing TAC on the ground
       helper charges for ApacheCon NA 2013.  Sally's flight expenses to
       ApacheCon NA 2013 have been taken care of on Sam's credit card,
       with details being provided to Sally by Gav.

       Sponsorship requested that the Treasurer's office look into
       notifications for incoming sponsorship payments from WFS.

       Nick Burch made a small update to
       https://whimsy.apache.org/fundraising/invoice to allow it to deal
       with non-whole numbers in invoices.

       Sam and Chris have agreed to send Melissa's check earlier in the
       month since her current Bill Pay is still not functioning correctly
       and is sent to the incorrect address.

       We received another contact from the Brazilian firm handling the
       SVN mark regarding its payments it claimed it never received.
       Treasurer's office reported that this matter has been handed off
       to the ASF President and CC'ed him directly on the reply.

       Nick Burch approached the Treasurer's Office mentioning that due
       to a TAC dropout the travel agent that handles TAC booking has a
       surplus of around 440.50 GBP and requested advice from the Treasurer
       on what to do with it. Treasurer's Office is OK with leaving the
       surplus with the agent.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Modulo a few hiccoughs due to changing the format of podling email
       lists, secretary is running smoothly.

       January was an average month for document filing. 54 iclas, five
       cclas, three ndas, and one grant were received and filed.

       James Carman continues to assist in the operation of the office
       of the secretary.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       A mostly uneventful month. There was a request from The Open
       Bastion to assist in generating more community interest in
       ApacheCon. The main concern was that VP ConCom appeared to be
       very busy elsewhere and was therefore unresponsive for a
       period. I did my best to fill the gap until VP ConCom was again
       available.

       One of the items that needed to be addressed was the collection
       of some sponsorship money from two sponsors who were unwilling
       or unable to pay The Open Bastion directly. This was addressed
       by VP Fundraising and the Treasurer but The Open Bastion felt
       this was a breakdown with respect to the single point of
       contact within the ASF.  Furthermore at least one of the two
       sponsors involved felt the delays this caused were somewhat
       unprofessional.

       These sponsorship payment issues have come up with both
       ApacheCon EU and ApacheCon NA. It is recommended that for
       future events we make provision for such sponsorships as part
       of our contract with the producer.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

No issues requiring board or President attention.

I've caught up on replying to all outstanding questions, which run the
usual gamut.

A branding complaint was made by one company whose engineers work on
a major Apache project about behavior in a private email sent from
another company whose engineers work on the same project.  This was
addressed well by trademarks@ volunteers, but serves to show a couple
of key points we need to continue to educate our communities about:

- Branding issues are almost never immediate-time-sensitive.  Unless
the question is about physical media being printed for an in-person
event happening within the week, branding questions can ALWAYS wait
a few days to organize a response and deal with.

- The ASF is responsible for enforcing brand use of the Apache brand(s).
While we certainly very much appreciate third parties alerting us to
potentially improper uses of our brands, it is NOT appropriate for
third parties to directly work on enforcing Apache brands without
our explicit consent.

The Apache OpenOffice project has made a request that we lodge a
complaint with certain search terms being used on Google AdWords
that may infringe on our marks.  They have examples of
infringing sites using these marks to drive traffic, which is
clearly a problem for this project with it's large end-user population.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Fundraising has been a bit more active this last month. We have sent out
four platinum invoices plus are following up one more. Hadrian has
offered to help contact some sponsors, and Bertrand has offered to
contact another. We were approached cold by a company wanting to become
a bronze sponsor. I sent an invoice, but have not yet seen note of
payment.

I attempted, but failed to send out thank you letters to PayPal
contributors. I believe I have the technology to do it, it just requires
a concerted input of time (in short supply). Given the January deadline
has passed, I would appreciate guidance as to whether I should still
persist in sending these letters. I would also appreciate knowing
whether a daily/monthly cron job could send out letters, rather than a
manual task undertaken from scratch each year.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

  I. Budget: we remain ahead of plans and under budget. We are
incurring a production expense for "Apache" promotional items for
distribution at ApacheCon, as well as travel expenses for Sally
Khudairi to attend and present at the conference. No vendor payments
are due at this time.

  II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are
planned. Sally has been assisting Upayavira in securing and processing
3 Platinum Sponsorship renewals.

  III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the
newswire, ASF Foundation Blog, announce@apache.org, or
announce@apachecon.com during this timeperiod.

  IV. Informal Announcements: 4 items were announced on @TheASF
Twitter feed, and 10 on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed. No new posts were
made on "TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

  V. Future Announcements: a graduation announcement is being planned
for a project currently in the Apache Incubator. PMCs wishing to
announce major project news —as well as podlings ready to graduate from
the Incubator— are welcome to contact Sally at press@apache.org for
more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

  VI. Media Relations: Sally responded to 4 media requests, 2
requests for project graphics/logos, and is coordinating 15 interviews
across various projects for a feature on the ASF's influence in the
world of Open Source. The ASF received 612 press clips over this time
period, vs. last month's clip count of 466.

  VII. Analyst Relations: no formal briefings are planned. Apache was
mentioned in 5 reports by Gartner, 1 write-up by GigaOM, and 3 reports
by 451 Research.

  VIII. ApacheCon liaison: a press release for ApacheCon will be
disseminated on 6 February. Sally will be attending the event to
organize and moderate "The Business of Open Source" plenary panel. She
also created new graphics and is working with Melissa Warnkin on
production of promotional items to be distributed at ApacheCon and
other ASF events.

  IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no new
activities are underway, aside from our working with O'Reilly regarding
our participation with OSCON 2013, as well as possibly the
Strata/Hadoop World conferences.

  X. Newswire accounts: we have 15 pre-paid press releases with
NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2013, and 12 pre-paid press
releases remaining on the PRNewswire account through May 2013.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

Placed a $15K order for a new vmware server with Dell which is now on
backorder through February.

Still dealing with the fallout of losing one of our public switch
interfaces.

Uli is working on OOB access for us at FUB.

Specced some additional drive capacity for eris.

Discussed setting up apaste.apache.org as a pasting service for Apache
based on Daniel Gruno's apaste.info site.

Started the process of reigning in the abusive maven traffic to
svn.apache.org.

Started the process of dealing with the missing Flex attachments for a
Jira import.

Shut off the people -> www rsync jobs for our websites. All project sites
now MUST be on either svnpubsub or the CMS to continue to be maintained.

Enabled redirects for our svn.apache.org services for graduated podling
trees.

Upgraded the software on adam (OSX) for $40 thanks to Sander Temme.

Was contacted by Traci to update our inventory with them.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the Apache Conference Planning Project  [Nick Burch]

Small Events
------------
It looks like there's a critical mass of organisers interested in an event
in Bangalore in late March, especially around CloudStack and GSOC. Once a
venue has been sourced, this can be announced. Depending on the venue, it
might be a pure BarCamp, or a BarCamp with hackathon.

Third Party Branding requests have come in from a few projects, and along
with trademarks we've been advising Subversion about their hackathon.

No other small events are on the horizon, and a few possible ones seem
to have gone quiet lately. We may want to hunt out likely suspects at
ApacheCon and try to persuade them to push ahead with smaller events
in their local areas. Spare mentor capacity currently exists.

Past ApacheCons
---------------
The finances for several past ApacheCons have largely been documented
and finalised this month. Figures for the last two NA ApacheCons have
now gone into SVN, and we've worked with TAC and Operations to handle
the ASF profits vs ASF TAC costs. The figures for ACEU have largely
gone into SVN, we're waiting for one EUR payment to come in from
NewThinking so we can finalise the USD accounts.

ApacheCon NA
------------
ApacheCon NA 2013 is happening in Portland next week. There will be a
BarCamp on the Sunday, Hackathon on the Monday, and community events in the
evenings.

Numbers are apparently looking lower than the last two NA ApacheCons. There
also seems to be less community engagement with the event than the previous
two NA events. Positively, the amount of volunteer energies going into the
event are well down on the previous two NA events, much much lower than EU,
and largely focused on the surrounding community events. Whether the lower
community engagement is linked to the lower volunteer involvement or not is
currently not clear.

Future ApacheCon Discussion
---------------------------
After Portland, no more ApacheCons are currently planned. Both Europe and
this event (along with the producer model) were one-off experiments to try
and find a future path for ApacheCon.

A session (with note taking) is planned for the end of ACNA, to discuss how
well the particular producer led approach worked, in terms of volunteer
energies and community outcomes. This will then be taken back to the list,
and shared especially with those with more experience of previous
ApacheCons, but less involvement in this one. We then need to decide if a
producer led ApacheCon under slightly different rules would work.

(A pure community event has been shown not to work, but a low cost for
committers and speakers event has been shown to, but may not be
possible financially with a producer. Co-locating has been tried a few
times now, and hasn't really seemed to work well. Berlin Buzzwords has
worked amazingly well, but sadly not under our flag...)

Committee
---------
No new members this month. A few people are likely to be approached in
Portland, to sound out their interest in joining


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

General
=======

Clarification on TAC budget spending was resolved last meeting with
TAC being able to approve for its TAC recipients. Any TAC Committee
Members or other appointed helpers that seek assistance of any kind
must be approved by the President or the EVP.

The travel-assistance@ mailing list has 13 people subscribed (no
change on last month.)

ApacheCon NA 2013 Portland
=======================

Everything seems to be in place. No hiccups with our final 7
candidates, tickets are issued as appropriate.  Final information on
what TAC folks need to know are being emailed out.

Budget Spending
=============

As the event is next week, and some things are still going through,
I'll report on the spending for this event next month. That said,
expenditure for 2 TAC members were approved.

Other Events
===========

No other events requiring TAC attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

ASF has made the W3C community group commitments on IP and copyright
so that Sergio Fernández can join the Open Data Spain Community Group.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Sam Ruby]

Extremely quiet month.  Only discussion of note is once best summarized by
Roy's statement: "Obey the license and follow the golden rule".

Upcoming: I plan to spend some time looking into the JCP TCK issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

For Jan 2013: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

3      Support question
2      User was hacked, but it wasn't ASF software at fault
7      Vulnerability reports
       1 [directory, via security@apache.org] [CLOSED, not an issue]
       1 [ofbiz, via security@apache.org] [CLOSED, dev version only]
       1 [httpd, via security@apache.org] [CLOSED, not httpd]
       1 [httpd, via security@apache.org] [STALLED, waiting for reporter]
       1 [tomcat, via security@apache.org] [CLOSED, not an issue]
       1 [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org] [CLOSED, not an issue]
       1 [maven, via security@apache.org]

Since the new year we have started a weekly review of open issues to
try to catch situations where the security team have not forwarded
reports correctly or where the project has not responded to the
reporter.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Gianugo Rabellino]

Apologies for missing the report last month. At this point there are
no issues requiring board attention in the Attic project. Things are
quiet, the pipeline is empty but the low to nonexistent mailing lists
traffic is being monitored.  Other than one small ongoing task on
closing the XML project, we are waiting for things to do!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]

Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based
applications, including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number
of JVM languages and tools.

Our last release (1.4.9) was on November 9th, 2012.  We are in the
process of voting for the release of Buildr 1.4.10 at the time of
writing this report; this release should contain 8 enhancements, 7 bug
fixes (one of which contributed by a non-committer) and 5 minor
changes. The mailing lists remain relatively quiet.

We have no issues that require board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache C++ Standard Library Project  [Jim Jagielski]

The Apache C++ Standard Library Project aims to provide an ALv2-licensed
system standard C++ library suite.

Releases:

  None.

Development:

  Since last report, activity has slowed down quite a bit. I expect partly
  this is due to simple timing (around the end-of-year holidays), and
  I plan to try to encourage a ramp-up of development with some emails.

Community:

  No changes.

We have no issues that require board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Jonathan Ellis]

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Report from the Apache Click Project  [Malcolm Edgar]

Apache Click is an easy-to-use page and component oriented Java web
framework.

The project is facing issues of having a viable community.

While the Apache Click is currently used for many applications under
current development, it has become superseded by more modern client
side MVC frameworks such as AngularJS.

The project needs to recruit new committers or faces the prospect of moving
into the attic over the medium term.

Infrastructure
-------------------
There are no infrastructure issues at this time.

Development
------------------
No headway has been made towards a version 2.3.1/2.4 release.

Community
----------------
There have been no new commiter or PMC members added during this period.

Mailing list traffic has been very light for the period.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it
is based around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is
very similar to Cocoon 2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and
designed to be easily used with Java code (= no frameworks required!).
On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal of becoming the best available
platform for RESTful webservices and web applications.

Community

Traffic on users lists continues be light but steady, people continue
be interested on C2 and newer C3. Especially c3 new developments from
Mansour Al Akeel, a user that had been quite active the last quarter,
has spoused some discussions and bug fixes. Various devs attended the
questions and provided solutions.  Simone has resigned from the
position of PMC chair, and Cocoon PMC voted for Thorsten to fill this
role.

Releases

No releases during the last quarter but the community is working to do
a release for all version, where the 2.2 version did get less
attention then 2.1 and 3.0. The whole release effort is driven by
Francesco Chicchiriccò and the 2.1 release is supported by David and
Cédric. Hopefully we can release all versions within the next quarter.

Development

Bugfixing on C3 and release preparation on the 2.1 branch. Various
tickets and patches had been applied to the code base, especially one
blocking issue on the c3 branch could be closed which opened the door
towards a stable c3 release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Luciano Resende]

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects


Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

GSoC
--------------

GSoC 2013 has just been announced and we need to start updating
website, and finding a volunteer for being the admin for 2013.

GSoC invoice for the GSoC and Mentor Summit has been submitted and are
being processed by Google.

Other
--------------

Outstanding:
  * Need to verify that GSoC invoice has been properly processed and
    that ASF has received the proper funds.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Continuum Project  [Brett Porter]

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security,
and integration with popular build tools and source control management
systems.

This quarter saw the long overdue release of Continuum 1.4.1 on
January 7, 2013, including a number of accumulated improvements. This
also included a fix for a security vulnerability reported earlier,
based on the version of the Struts library used. We have recommended
all users upgrade and published details on a security page.

The project has moved to using svnpubsub for publishing the site and
documentation, and for release distributions.

All branding requirements have now been completed.

We are likely to have low activity from this point onwards, as the
application is mature and serves current user's needs. New
contributors would be welcomed, and there is enough attention from the
PMC to respond to new users and contributors as that arises, and to
produce a release if necessary.

We have not added any new committers recently. The last committer was added
December 8, 2010 and the last PMC member was added on September 2, 2012.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

Apache CouchDB is a distributed JSON document database with an HTTP API.

Released version 1.0.4, 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 to address CVE-2012-5641,
CVE-2012-5650 and CVE-2012-5651 among other minor bugfixes.

Imported the codebase for a new, work-in-progress admin utility donated
by a set of users.

Added 5 new committers (among them the contributors & donators of the new
admin utility).

Starting the release procedure for 1.3.0.

Held a successful CouchDB Conf (http://conf.couchdb.org) bringing users
and committers together. ~70 people total over 3 days.

Branding Status: The project website and assorted assets are up to date
with the Branding Board Report Checklist[1].

-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Report from the Apache DirectMemory Project  [Raffaele P. Guidi]

Apache DirectMemory is an off-heap cache implementation for the JVM. It
features direct memory management (a-la BigMemory) to enable efficient
handling of a large number of java objects without affecting JVM garbage
collection performance.

* General Information
Community interest seems to be still high but nothing serious happened in
code and in the mailing list except for a proposal to contribute some
benchmarks and performance testing that, since we are still far away from a
release, could really help.

* New Committers
  * None

* Project Branding Requirements
  Already completed.

* Issues
  No board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Francis De Brabandere]

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application
development than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow
highly efficient database operations in combination with a maximum of
compile-time-safety and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

With our release last November many issues have been resolved and we are
now collecting new issues and ideas for future development. Mailing
list traffic was low, probably because of the holidays.

Changes in committers or PMC members

There have been no changes in committers or PMC members during the last
months.

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

Releases

NONE


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Report from the Apache Etch Project  [Martin Veith]

Apache Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent
RPC-like framework for building and consuming network services.

MILESTONES
Etch graduated from the Apache Incubator on January 16, 2013. Since
then, there haven't been new releases.

ACTIVITY
* The main activity within the last month was related to the
  "After graduation tasks". We are following the steps described by
  http://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.html#life-after-graduation
  and tracking the status of the different issues at
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ETCH-252.
  See INFRASTRUCTURE section for details.
* Development goes on, our main focus is the stabilization of the Etch C++
  binding. As soon as this is in a beta status, we are planning to perform
  our release 1.3.0.
* User activity is almost quiet. We are working on improvements of
  documentation and examples to make it easier for people to use Etch.

COMMUNITY
No changes regarding PMC or committers composition since graduation.
More work is needed to broad both user and developer community.

INFRASTRUCTURE
* Incubator website, SVN repository and mailing lists have been
  transfered from their Incubator to TLP locations. Users and
  developers have been informed about the changes.
* Website has been updated to reflect the new status.
* Incubator EXIT issues have been signed off.
* Etch is now listed on Apaches a.o, projects.a.o sites (DOAP files
  created).
* Updated officer information for new chair.
* Twitter used to keep followers up to date about TLP migration.

LEGAL
No issues.

BRANDING
Incubator logo has been removed from website, no other known issues.

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
Apache Flex 4.9.0 was released on 12/27/12.
Apache Flex Installer 2.0.x was released on 1/9/13.

ACTIVITY
Activity in Apache Flex is in two main areas:  improvements to the existing
Adobe Flash-dependent code base, including the two releases listed above,
and prototyping ways to create a version of Flex that is independent from
Adobe Flash.  There is another group working on Maven-related tools for the
existing code base.

Nick Kwaitkowski and other community members totally revamped the
flex.apache.org site.  Trademarks reviewed the site before it went live on
1/31/13.  Analytics were also added to the site.  In the first two days we
had 4,228 (3,534 unique) visitors and 11,965 page views.

COMMUNITY
Roland Zwaga was approved as committer on 1/15/13.

PRESS
Scott Guthmann worked with Press@a.o to publish a press release about
Apache Flex on 1/14/13.  One link to it is here:
http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2013/01/14/516186/10017952/en/The-Apache-Software-Foundation-Announces-Apache-Flex-tm-as-a-Top-Level-Project.html

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated
multi-channel documentation maintaining a separation of content and
presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2011-01-10

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  There was no activity on the user mail list. A user did add a comment for
  a workaround to an issue.

  There was some activity on the dev mail list, with one PMC member
  seeking assistance with their work (see below) and being assisted by
  two other PMC members.

  No other PMC members have been active during this quarter. Three
  people did respond to my draft board report. This confirms that
  there are at least four people hanging around, and so we are
  potentially able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

  Following the December quarter, the board feedback was returned to the
  private list, i.e. it is okay to appear to be "dormant" as long as there
  are 3+ PMC members actively following. This quarter the activity seems to
  have risen a little.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  There was good progress on the "wiki" plugin, which handles input from
  various wikis. The plugin should now support all relevant jspwiki markup.

  That also spurred some interaction in the community.

  Continued work on one of our Gump projects, which now deploys some
  plugins and then uses the built 'forrest' to generate a sample site.

  Discussion was commenced regarding extending commit access. Not much
  activity yet.

  The project was reminded that Apache Cocoon is attempting to release the
  next Cocoon-2.1 version, which the current forrest depends upon.

  No developer assisted with the required move to 'svnpubsub', so the chair
  stepped up again to arrange that. All done now. Thanks to Infra.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model and
persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, key
value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data with
extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.

Project Releases

The Apache Gora team was happy to announce the release of Gora 0.2.1 on
7th August 2012. No releases have been made since however a clear strategy
has been established for the 0.3 release.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Since last reporting, the PMC has geared the development drive towards
the 0.3 release. We have addressed and resolved 28 of 33 issues
meaning that the progression towards an RC for 0.3 is well on the
way. We currently have two blockers which nee to be addressed before
we can consider the 0.3 RC.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Activity on the user@ list has been very slow since last reporting. It
was invisaged that after ApacheConEU user interest might pick up
slightly, however this has not materialized as we hoped.  Activity on
dev@ has developed in line with our expectations as we move towards
more regular Gora releases. Generally speaking more work needs to be
done in an attempt to make it easier for people to use Gora. This is
something which the PMC need to work on.

Changes to PMC & Committers

The Gora PMC were very pleased to invite and have Alfonso Nishikawa
join our ranks in early December. After working with the PMC to ensure
smooth transition into the Apache community Alfonso is now
contributing to Gora and making a real impact. Alfonso also joined the
Gora PMC.

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of Apache projects
including, Nutch, Tika, OODT, Camel, Solr, Accumulo, Whirr & Hadoop
(this is not an exhaustive list). We are still actively seeking one or
more members to join the team from the Avro community so this will be
a main target for us in the future post 0.3 release.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Arun Murthy]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

On the people side, we have new people joining our ranks.
* We've added 3 new committers - Kihwal Lee, Arpit Gupta, Bikas Saha
* We've added 1 new PMC member: Harsh J
* We've elected a new PMC Chair, Chris Douglas. (Also added to the board
  agenda.)

On the project side, we have made 4 releases:
- hadoop-0.23.5 was released on 28th November, 2012
- hadoop-1.1.1 was released on 1st December, 2012
- hadoop-0.23.6 was released on 6th February, 2013
- hadoop-2.0.3-alpha was released on 13th February, 2013

PMC Chair Vote - We had a fairly contentious discussion after for the
PMC Chair resulted in a tie after STV. The discussions included
*analysis* of voting patterns w.r.t employers, accusations and
counter-accusations about reasons for those patterns such as marketing
etc., a proposal to *rotate PMC chair organization* as one of the
remedies, which eventually veered into a direction where one PMC
member perceived it as a of 'threat to remove all PMC members of an
organization' which was rapidly diffused by a clarification by the
other PMC member. In the end, one of the 2 candidates tied after the
vote withdrew to allow for an amicable solution and also cited
concerns about the nature of some of the discussions.

Clearly, the lesson the Hadoop PMC has learnt is that, in future, voting
should be done via the ASF Voting Tool.

As the outgoing Chair, my personal recommendation is that splitting
the Hadoop project into separate TLPs (HDFS, YARN, MapReduce) will not
only break up the 'umbrella' Hadoop project to better reflect the fact
that the communities are significantly disparate, but will also, more
importantly, help avoid excessive fascination with the Hadoop
brand. We've discussed about this in the past (see October 2012 Board
Report) - some people agree about this, others don't. We'll continue
to talk.

Overall, aside from these skirmishes, the community continues to
function in a healthy manner as evinced by the fact that we continue
to make a significant number of software releases, grow the community
by adding new users/contributors/committers/PMC-members and generally
make great forward progress. Hence, I feel there isn't any reason for
the Board to take any action.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Benson Margulies]

The main concern of the incubator continues to be the quality and
reliability of supervision.  We know that some projects suffer from
Mentor Inattention. Individual PMC members have been volunteering to
address some of these holes. Shepherds are an additional mechanism for
taking note of problems, but not a solution to those problems. The
supply of mentoring seems, still, to exceed demand. Changes to the
report format make it somewhat easier to notice, for example, mentors
who don't sign off on reports or reports that are altogether missing.

As a change from this theme, this reporting period includes a less
conventional issue.  A podling (HCatalog) proposes to 'graduate' by
absorption into the Hive PMC. However, the terms under which Hive
proposes to absorb HCatalog strikes some PMC members as returning to
the deprecated practices of 'umbrellas' and 'subprojects', which led
to strong -1 votes on the graduation thread. On the other hand, it may
be entirely between the board and Hive to sort out whether Hive is
creating a structure that is acceptable to the board or not, and not a
matter for the IPMC to rule on.

We'd like to pose this question to the board:

There are three possible dispositions of a podling:

1. It graduates. The IPMC has a vote to recommend that the board
establish the TLP.

2. It retires. The IPMC votes to retire. The board learns in the next
IPMC report.

3. The podling community strikes an agreement to merge into some
existing TLP.

It is the third case we'd like some board feedback on. What is the
role of the IPMC in this case? A minimalist view is that all we do is
certify that the IP is cleared, and then we 'retire' the podling -- no
vote at all, or a lazy consensus to certify the IP situation. The
board, on the other hand, might look to us to vote to approve the
scheme of adoption. If the vote fails, however, then what?

Ambari

Ambari is a monitoring, administration and lifecycle management project for
Apache Hadoop clusters.

Ambari has been incubating since 2011-08-30.

  - Release 1.2.0 done
  - Preparing for 1.2.1 release expected to be in the next week or so.
  - new committers have been added
    Jaimin Jetley, John Speidel, Tom Beerbower, Srimanth
  - We are hoping to do some meetups to get more user/dev engagement. This
    expected to happen in the next month or so.

Two most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Attracting users and developers
  2. Increase diversity of developers outside of Hortonworks

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - With new releases, there is more interest in user community. We hope to
    build on that with more releases and better docs.
  - Mailing list stats: dev - 79, user - 111

How has the project developed since the last report?
  - Release 1.2.0 is done
  - Release 1.2.1 is expected to happen in the next week or so

--------------------
Blur

Blur is a search platform capable of searching massive amounts of data
in a cloud computing environment.

Blur has been incubating since 2012-07-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Official IP sign off
    - Near Infinity signed CCLA and Blur Software Grant in July of 2012
    - All committers have submitted ICLA's in July/August of 2012
    - So I believe that an official vote is all that is needed.
  2. First Apache release which is dependent on #1
    - The biggest reason this has been delayed is due to several major code
      refactors to make use of Blur faster and easier
  3. Community growth, Blur needs to grow beyond the initial set of committors.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Overall message traffic was down through the holidays, but has started
    to pick back up since the beginning of the year.
  - Subscriptions: users@ - 31[+9]; dev@ - 33[+9]

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - There has been about 80 commits since the last report, from 2
    committors and 1 contributor
  - The 0.2 development branch is now functioning and is getting closer to
    feature parity with 0.1.

Clerezza

an OSGi-based modular application and set of components (bundles) for
building RESTFul Semantic Web applications and services.

Clerezza has been incubating since 2009-11-27.

The resolution to graduate Clerezza has been added to the board agenda, as
per the http://s.apache.org/rOw vote.

There was some prior discussion of the viability of the project, especially
the content management parts where activity has been fairly low recently,
but in the end enough volunteers have shown up to move the project forward.

Crunch

Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running pipelines of MapReduce
jobs on Apache Hadoop.

Crunch has been incubating since 2012-05-26.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  * None


Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  * Nothing that currently requires IPMC attention.


How has the community developed since the last report?

The Apache Crunch development team has released version 0.4.0-incubating
in November, the second release at the Apache Incubator. We have worked
with the Apache BigTop project and our release is now part of Apache
BigTop 0.5.0. For our next release, we have discussed and agreed on some
large-scale API cleanup and implemented the necessary changes.

We have performed the podling name search - the name Apache Crunch has
been approved by the trademarks team. This has been our last blocker for
graduation, we have already started a vote on a graduation resolution
within the community and expect to start the vote on incubator-general in
February.

Development activity around Christmas has been a bit lower than usual but
is now picking up again. There has been a significant increase in traffic
on crunch-user; it is great to see that more and more users show up, file
bug reports and contribute patches or test cases.


How has the project developed since the last report?

 - 53 issues were created on the Crunch JIRA in November
   to January, 39 issues have been resolved
 - crunch-dev has seen 615 emails in the reporting period,
   while 126 emails were posted to crunch-user

useful features for Java application developers. The goal of DeltaSpike is
to create a de-facto standard of CDI-Extensions that is developed and
maintained by the community.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention.

Since our last report in November 2012, we have accomplished the following:

  - Migration to ApacheCMS finished
  - JSF module continued
  - JPA module enhanced

Upcoming major goals:

  - Finish the work on the WindowHandler and Security
  - Release deltaspike-0.4-incubating
  - target Graduation until the next month

Droids

Droids aims to be an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows to
create and extend existing droids (robots).

Droids has been incubating since 2008-10-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Diversity is still an issue for the podling. Activity has picked up in
     the recent months, helping with the diversity of those involved.
  2. A different name is most likely needed. Droid is now largely associated
     with Android.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?
  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Commons was approached to see if that was a viable option for graudation.
  It is unsure that would be a good fit. Other TLPs may be a better fit,
  but it is unknown how sub-projects would be handled or if they would be
  allowed.

  Development activity has picked up in the past two months, since just
  before Christmas. Most of the development is by one developer, but others
  have been involved. If this level of activity continues for the next month,
  Droids may be ready for graduation.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Development activity has greatly increased in the recent months.
  There have been strides to make the code base cleaner, and easier to use.

  time building understanding of the Apache processes around working and
  releasing.
- Release
- Grow the podling community in terms of users and contributors.

Marmotta

An open implementation of a Linked Data Platform.

Marmotta has been incubating since 2012-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Ingest code and clear IP.
  2. A release
  3. Build dev and PMC.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

No such issues.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 * Communication mechanisms have been successfully setup: the
   dev@marmotta mailing list has quite important traffic (274 messages
   in January); Jira already registers more than 50 issues; regular
   meetings are held at IRC, sending the minutes to the mailing list
   to mitigate the barriers of people in different timezones. This
   approach is enabling the participation of new people in the
   community of the project.

 * Branding: Logo almost ready, trademarks@apache already contacted.
   Awaiting for the site installation.

How has the project developed since the last report?

The project is about publish the last release of the former project (LMF),
to them contribute the parts that will be actually Marmotta. This last full
release already advances some tasks for Marmotta, such as architectural
changes and dependencies clean up. After this major milestone, the
project's ambition is a rapid turnaround to get an Apache incubator release
as soon as possible.

NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache Maven.

NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. work out a concrete plan towards graduation ASAP
  2. encourage newer contributors to do so on a continuing basis
  3. reach out to other projects using .NET that might be interested in
     working with NPanday

We are still short on mentors, and would appreciate any volunteers.

We have had some recent patch submissions again and will encourage those
actively using the project to contribute on a regular basis. We haven't
added a new committer since 20 April 2011, so expect to have a low barrier
to any new committers.

The last release was on 16 May 2011. It is clear that this is impacting the
ability of the project to attract and retain new blood. Unfortunately,
there remain some blockers to releasing the current trunk. We need to push
forward with this ASAP.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. complete the ongoing pending releases
  2. involve more mentors
  3. start discussing the graduation on dev@

log4j 1.2: A few bugreports/patches came in, but no real work has
been done this quarter.

log4j 2.0: Good activity with further increasing interest from the
community which includes patches for new functionality. log4j 2.0-
beta3 was released on Nov 15, 2012. log4j 2.0-beta4 was released
on Feb 2, 2013. We are aiming at the first stable release.

The Apache Onami (incubating) project, which is creating Google
Guice extensions, created a new component which wraps log4j 2.

log4cxx: a few patches were applied from a contributor earlier
this quarter but then this component became inactive again. We have
started discussion on moving it to the Attic as it is becoming more
and more unlikely that it will revive.

log4net: patches have been reviewed and committed.

log4php: Constant activity. log4php moved to GIT, which motivated
several contributors to send patches. A new release is in the making,
along with plans for moving the web site to CMS.

Chainsaw: A new chainsaw release is blocked by the companions
release. The log4j 2.0.0 interest has increased interest in a new
Chainsaw release.

Companions (for log4j 1.x): No work has been done here, but it is
still on the plan to make a release and unblock Chainsaw.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum,
to target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr , OpenSearchServer
or ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security
policies.

Milestones
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since
then, there have been two major releases, including a 1.0 release on
October 3, 2012, and another major release is undergoing voting at the time
of this writing.

Mailing list activity
==============

Mailing list has been active, with a wide range of topics.  Most of our
connectors now have significant use cases and constituencies.  Dev list
comments centered around new committers, release-related communication, and
voting.

I am unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.

Committer and PMC membership
========================

We have signed up one new committer since the last report in November,
2012. We also continue to receive contributions in random bursts from
people using the software.  We've identified any contributor who seems to
have a medium-term or better commitment to the technology as being a
potential committer, and as always, we try to maintain an encouraging
attitude towards new contributors.

Branding
======

We are aware of no current violations of the Apache ManifoldCF brand.

Legal
====

There are no outstanding legal issues that need resolution at this time.

Infrastructure
==========

There are no infrastructure issues known at this time.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Roller Project  [Dave Johnson]

Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based weblogging package that works
well on Tomcat and MySQL, and is also known to run on other servers and
databases. The ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org runs on Roller 5.0.1.

Issues

No board issues at this time.

Releases

The latest release of Apache Roller is v5.0.1, which was released
on June 24, 2012, a security and bug fix release.

Community

Since our last report we gained one committer, Glen Mazza, who
single-handedly moved the Roller home page to the new Apache CMS.
Glen has also been working to clean up the project's JIRA backlog,
and closing hundreds of obsolete issues, and our wiki space.

Apart from that, the Roller community continues to be rather quiet
with low traffic that mostly concerns technical support and installation
issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

The Apache Santuario project is aimed at providing implementation of
security standards for XML.

There were no new releases during the last quarter. Overall project
activity was quiet. The main development activity was focused on the
forthcoming 2.0 release of the Java library, which will support a new
streaming XML Security model. This work is mostly complete, and a
release is expected in the next few months.

The svnpubsub migration is not finished yet, but is almost complete. We are
working with INFRA on finishing this task.

No changes to the PMC or new committers in this quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AP: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

Development:

There have been 87 commits since the last Board Report including the build
helper module [1], removal of an internal ThreadPoolExecuter[2] and
refinements to the Eclipse IDE integration build process[3]. SIS is moving
towards a reference implementation of GeoAPI, which is one of the few in
existence.  Chris Mattmann was also added as a voting member of the GeoAPI
community. Chris et al also suggested a major release, and Martin mentioned
that we may want to have the next release be for sis-metadata, and then the
one after be for sis-referencing. These will mark the first milestone
releases for Apache SIS.  We have been slowed down recently because of the
work temporarily shifted on GeoAPI and Unit of Measurement side. While
invisible work from Apache SIS perspective, we believe that this was a
necessary step to help ensure a more robust and full-featured Apache SIS
implementation.

Community:

OGC meeting at ESRI in Redlands California, where Martin, Paul
Ramirez, and Chris Mattmann met face to face for the first
time. Interactions from Johann Sorel and Geomatys were also visible on
the mailing list. Additionally, Chris Mattmann was contacted by a PhD
student from the University of Maine, Pathum Mudannayake
<pathum.mudannayake@maine.edu>, working on Spatial Information Science
and Engineering. Pathum is interested in continuing his doctoral
research in geoinformatics and contributing his research to Apache
SIS.

Branding:

The Website[5] and Project logo[6] are currently being worked on and
will be finalized soon. Andrew Hart worked with @infra to get the site
moved to the new CMS. The old site under incubator was in flux when
SIS was moved to TLP.  This caused some confusion that Andrew is
currently sorting out.

Issues:
Martin has reported ongoing issues with building and running unit
tests on ASF infrastructure. This issue is being logged with Sun for
JDK7 and ASF infra@ personnel are aware that these issues
exist. Additionally, the CMS integration with the SIS website is still
being worked on. On the Jenkins build, we would like to try with an
updated JDK (the current one is one year and half old). We don't know
if there is any way to help the build infra@ to update their JDK
installation so that the ASF infrastructure can support multiple
versions of the JDK.

Press:
Members of the SIS PMC met in person at the OGC meeting held in Redlands,
California in January 2013[4].

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

* Board Issue

There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

We have two new "partial" committers (their work is primarily
constrained to branches). One is Gabriela Gibson (gbg), who was
accepted as part of the [GNOME] Outreach Program for Women
(https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen), with Stefan Sperling
acting as her mentor. The second committer is Prabhu Gnana Sundar
(prabhugs).

elego is hosting a hackathon in Berlin in June. The past few years
have been a great success, with many from the Subversion community in
attendance. This year, there will not be an associated conference as
in the past, allowing for a stronger ASF branding and wider range of
visibility/invitations.

* Releases

Apache Subversion 1.7.8 was released on December 20th. The pre-ASF
Subversion had a maintenance update to 1.6.20 on January 8th.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Velocity Project  [Nathan Bubna]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Velocity is a java template engine and related projects.

RELEASES

* None

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* Minimal

COMMUNITY

* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not
changed since the last report.
* Activity remains low on all lists, though Stack Overflow
regularly has Velocity questions, of which the intelligent
ones and a few less-so ones are answered in reasonable time.
* Apache Velocity remains in a more-or-less dormant period.
The rise of client-side development has undercut one of the
major sources of users and thus developers. While Velocity
remains quite useful for generating text on the server,
overall demand seems unlikely to rise.

the infrastructure team to complete the remaining necessary migration
tasks.

Releases:
* None.

Activity:
* The community is working on the first Apache Wink TLP release.
* The community is working on website and source code cleanup to remove
incubator references.

Trademark/Branding:
The project needs to review website and other related artifacts
to remove any remaining mention of Incubation and to certify it
complies with Trademarks policy (in-progress).

Legal Issues:
* None
