 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Overall it has been a quiet month. The board received some requests to
       assist with PR, which various Directors responded to.

       The Attic has taken responsibility for the transition of two projects
       that were terminated in the July meeting.

       As agreed previously, there will be no face to face meeting of the
       board like we have had at around this time for the last few years. The
       next board may revisit that option again in 2014.

       Thanks go to Sam for adding web-based tools to manage the meeting
       agenda, which a number of directors and officers have been able to
       make use of.

    B. President [Ross]

       Details
       =======

       OSCON booth was a success. Thanks to Melissa for her hard work.
       Thanks also to Justin Erenkrantz, Martin van den Bemt, and Florian 
       Mueller for their help staffing the Booth. I'm not overly convinced 
       of the value of this booth (see EA report, Attachment 1). Raising
       awareness of the ASF is important, but ensuring good representation
       at the conference is probably more effective. We tend to get that
       representation through our volunteers speaking in various capacities.
       Personally, I feel the budget would be better spent in other ways
       (e.g. Event in a Box, see below)

       I met with Melissa to discuss her responsibilities (see
       http://jceventphoto.com/v/oscon_2013/content/DSC_7507_large.html). 
       Jim as previous president had agreed an increase in both salary 
       and hours with the intention of expanding the EA role. Melissa 
       and I agreed a number of areas that she can help. In summary, all 
       ASF positions that report directly to the President will be 
       encouraged to use time from the EA. Top priorities at this time 
       are Fundraising and Trademarks. Both of these require timely 
       responses and therefore EA support would seem to be top priority. 
       Over the next month we will work with the relevant VPs to identify 
       concrete actions that can be undertaken by the EA.

       EA, EVP and myself met at OSCON to discuss the future of ApacheCon.
       We were in unanimous agreement that we needed to take some time to
       figure out the correct way forward. Specifically, we felt it
       necessary to refine the models Nick defined for our events. 
       I have therefore informed The Open Bastion that we will issue a new
       RFP sometime in the future. Melissa is discussing with various event 
       producers to understand the different models they recommend. I will 
       submit a project timeline in the next board report.

       It is worth noting that since ConCom was disbanded project specific 
       events have been progressing at roughly the same pace. Together with
       EVP and EA, I intend to pursue the Event in a Box idea I originally
       raised as part of ConCom some years ago. We do not imagine that
       small events will require significant support beyond that provided
       in the Event in a Box structure.

       D&O insurance has been renewed. We ran right up to the wire as 
       the basic profit and loss report financial submitted was not 
       accepted as it has been in previous years. A full balance sheet is
       what is requested and this year was insisted upon. EA has updated 
       the calendar entry for next year to ensure we have more lead time
       to prepare the various reports. However, it may be wise to consider
       giving access to the reporting tools.

       D&O Broker suggested we consider the following insurances in addition to
       D&O. I assume previous boards evaluated the need for these. I see no
       reason to alter previous policies but include the list here for clarity.
         * physical assets
         * public liability
         * non-owned Automobile Liability
         * workers compensation
         * Media Liability (i.e. copyright infringement)
         * Privacy and Network Security Liability

       I'll be presenting at the All Things Open conference in Raleigh, NC 
       on Oct 23-24. The session will focus on the ASF and how it 
       facilitates collaboration between otherwise competing organisations.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
       Treasurer's Office generated a balance sheet and income statement
       required to renew Director's and Officer's Liability Insurance,
       working with the President and the EA.

       The Brazilian company that registered the SVN trademark is asking
       again if the ASF would look to see if the payment that was wired
       to them was returned to ASF accounts. The Treasurer's Office can
       look into this -- but we refer the matter to the President again
       to make an official reply since no one has replied since 7/18.

       The Treasurer's website has been set up and CMS'ed by infra. Chris
       will work to start using the website to document current Treasurer
       process and flow documents.

       DirectPay capabilities with WFS are now available to Chris and Chris
       has full access to the WFS account services.

       The Treasurer's Office is working with VP, Brand to pay a legal fee
       related to trademark registration.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

  * Daily monitoring of all email activity and following-up with
    appropriate personnel
  * Sent stickers to Uli Stark for his upcoming (early fall) events;
    sent FedEx receipt to Chris Mattmann for accounting purposes
  * OSCON 2013: Sent exhibit packages, forwarded receipts to Chris;
    completed registration information for booth staff and submitted
    to the O’Reilly contact.  As usual, the Apache booth at OSCON was
    an overwhelming success! There were some newbies that weren’t
    aware of what Apache is, but they left with an abundance of
    information and understanding; however, the majority of folks were
    involved in Apache projects and just wanted to stop by to give
    appreciation and thanks!  A HUGE thanks goes to Justin Erenkrantz,
    Martin van den Bemt, and Florian Mueller who were my main men in
    supporting me at the booth. Of course I’d like to thank everyone
    else who stopped by during their availability to socialize with
    the attendees and answer questions!!
  * Communication re getting the D&O insurance paperwork filed and
    paid
  * Worked with Ross and Chris regarding updating the corporate
    calendar
  * Continued work with Upayavira re fundraising and how I can assist;
    next step is a call between Upayavira, Ross, and myself to discuss
    the plan Upayavira has suggested.
  * Met with Ross and Rich at OSCON to discuss the new roles and
    responsibilities
  * Discussed w/Ross and Rich the future of ApacheCons and how to
    proceed going forward.  It was agreed that we are going to seek
    alternative prospects as producers.  I had a meeting with Angela
    Brown of the Linux Foundation re the possibility of them
    organizing future events.  The informational email that she sent
    has been forwarded to Ross and Rich for their review.  Rich has
    provided two other leads.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Trademarks has had a moderate month, with basic questions being answered. 
Some needed brand policing actions are being queued up for next month.

Burns & Levinson is ably supporting us in pursuing just the CLOUDSTACK
trademarks both here in the US as well as in Europe.

No board level issues; however, I may need to call upon operations@ folks to
help provide better coverage for questions: at least having someone reliable
get back to various questioners quickly with pointers to our policy and a
"we're working on it" would go a long way.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Fundraising work has been slow again this month, running below the rate it
needs to.

I have been in contact with the EA, and we are going to work together to see
if we can speed things up.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: all OSCON-related expenses have been submitted for payment. We
remain on schedule, with no vendor payments due at this time.
 
II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned. Sally 
Khudairi has secured an additional Gold-level Sponsorship renewal,
coordinated updates to the Foundation "Thanks" page, and has had several 
phone calls and numerous email exchanges with four Sponsors regarding
newly-incubated projects, organizational participation, sponsorship 
publicity, and events clearance/permission/signoff.
 
III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the 
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org:
 
  - 24 July: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache Mesos™ as a 
    Top-Level Project
  - 23 July: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache OpenOffice™ 4.0
 
IV. Informal Announcements: 8 items were announced on @TheASF Twitter feed.
No new posts were made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed or 
"TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.
 
V. Future Announcements: Sally is currently working with a TLP on a milestone 
announcement. Those PMCs wishing to announce major project news - as well as 
podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator - are welcome to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least 
2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.
 
VI. Media Relations: we fielded several general inquiries, reviewed/edited 4 
Apache-supporting organizations' proposed announcements and press plans, 
responded to 14 media requests, and 3 queries on Foundation 
background/operational information. The ASF received 845 press clips over
this time period, vs. last month's clip count of 1,695.
 
VII. Analyst Relations: Sally is planning the Autumn briefing schedule and is 
working with select Sponsors to piggy-back on formal analyst outreach. One 
briefing took place on 5 August. Apache was mentioned in 41 reports by
Gartner (including 31 Hype Cycle and 2 Magic Quadrant reports), 1 report by
Forrester, 7 write-ups by GigaOM, and 6 reports by 451 Research.
 
VIII. ApacheCon liaison: no activities are planned at this time. Melissa
Warnkin is leading the follow-up on the recorded videos from ApacheCon 
2013/PDX (February 2013) that are still not online.
 
IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally has also been
working with several event producers to secure Apache participation at 
various Cloud, big data, security, and mobile-focused conferences.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

About

The Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) exists to help those that would like to
attend ApacheCon events, but are unable to do so for financial reasons.

Overall Project Activity since last report

TAC has been very quiet as we would expect. There are currently no events
planned which require TAC's attention.
Regarding the more verbose report which was produced for board@ in June
reporting, action will be taken on this in the build up to the next event
which requires TAC organization and input.

There are no other issues for the board.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

W3C are discussing a proposal to make clear the licensing to permit
non-specification derivative works from content in W3C recommendations.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Sam Ruby]

Relatively routine month, nothing requiring board attention.  Thanks go out to
Jim Jagielski for monitoring the lists while I was on vacation.

Notable discussions:

By an overwhelming vote, the Legal Affairs Committee declined to add a
requirement for a copyright notice in source headers.  In theory this should
have unblocked the short form header discussion (LEGAL-172), but for the
moment it seems to have derailed it instead.  Hopefully this will restart
soon.

There is interest by Cordova and others to distribute code via Apple's App
Store.  At the moment this is waiting on somebody to do the work to find and
take a first pass at analyzing what the terms and conditions would be.

Clerezza wishes to allow users to use Virtuoso JDBC libraries.  These
libraries are made available under a GPL license with a special exception for
JDBC usage.  As it turns out Clerezza does not intend to distribute these
libraries, so there is no concern.

Apache Commons would like to distribute some sample CSV files from the US
government -- files without an obvious copyright.  As there is contact
information provided on the website, the best approach would be to ask for
clarification.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@. These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

1 Support question

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Jonathan Ellis]

Cassandra is a distributed database providing massive scalability,
high performance, and high availability.

Releases:

1.2.5 19/May/13
1.1.12 27/May/13
1.2.6 26/Jun/13
2.0b1 12/Jul/13
2.0b2 25/Jul/13
1.2.7 26/Jul/13
1.2.8 28/Jul/13
2.0rc1 8/Aug/13

Development:

Cassandra 2.0 warrants our first major version change in two years for
two main reasons:

1. Lightweight transactions are a first for a system built on eventual
consistency, and allows opting in to linearizable consistency when
necessary, giving users the best of both worlds [1].

2. We're dropping a lot of legacy baggage (but not API compatibility),
requiring users to upgrade through 1.2 first if they are on an earlier
release [2].

Community:

The 2013 Cassandra Summit was a two-day event for the first time and
saw over 1,100 attendees in SF [3].

Jake Luciani was added to the PMC on August 12.

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it
is based around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is
very similar to Cocoon 2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and
designed to be easily used with Java code (= no frameworks required!).
On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal of becoming the best available
platform for RESTful web services and web applications.

Issues needing board attention:
 None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
 None.
 Last modified: 2012/10/21 (change of PMC chair)

Community

Traffic on users and devs list continues be light but steady, people got
a bit more active after the release to give feedback. Further some user
started to adopt the latest addition of the examples. Various devs
attended the questions and provided solutions.

Releases

Maintenance release 2.1.12 has been released on 2013/03/20.


Development

Bugfixing on C3 and adding of some new features.
In c3 there have been a new set of components around TIKA (user asked to
migrate it to 2.1 but no work has started yet.
Further some new samples where added to the rest-optional-sample block
to show how to send eMails with c3.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Luciano Resende]


The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects


Project Status
--------------

No issues require board attention at this time.

PMC changes
-----------

No changes on this report period.

Last PMC addition was on April 2013 (Suresh Marru).

Google Summer of Code (section contributed by Ulrich Stärk)
-----------------------------------------------------------

GSoC is well under way. Of the initial 51 students, 45 made it through the
midterm evaluation.  AFAICT the majority of the failed students failed due to
missing commitment and only a minority because of lack of skills or other
reasons we could have foreseen. I am contemplating ideas how to improve our
selection process for next year.

After a call for proposals the ComDev PMC has decided to send Lewis John
Mcgibbney and Ulrich Stärk to the GSoC Mentor Summit in Mountain View in
October. The goal there is to network with other mentors and organization
administrators and discuss the program and ideas for improving it.

At the moment we are preparing a post for Google's Open Source Blog where the
ASF and some of its GSoC projects will be featured.

ASF-ICFOSS Mentoring Programme
------------------------------

This ASF and India ICFOSS joint program was kicked off with a local workshop
in Kerala - India presented by Luciano Resende to a group of about 60
students. From these 60 Students, we have received 10 proposals and selected
7 proposals. The accepted students are now starting the coding phase.

Note that this program is different from GSoC, where these students are
having no monetary incentives, which can be an explanation for the number of
proposals compared to the number of students that initially attended the kick
off workshop.

ComDev & Events
---------------

The ComDev PMC is now a "home" for some of the ConCom responsibilities, but
there hasn't been much discussion/requests around events on the ComDev lists
yet.

Invoices
--------


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Continuum Project  [Brett Porter]

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security,
and integration with popular build tools and source control management
systems.

There has been one burst of activity in the last cycle, cleaning up a number
of issues towards a further 1.4.2 release. No movement on that front yet,
however. There has been no activity on the users list.

Activity remains low as expected, but there are still enough PMC members
around to help when needed.

The last release was Continuum 1.4.1, on January 7, 2013.

We have not added any new committers recently. The last committer was added
December 8, 2010 and the last PMC member was added on September 2, 2012.

As there was another willing candidate, I have decided to stand down as chair
of the project. There were no other nominations from the PMC, so I expect to
include a resolution for the board's consideration once the vote has
completed.

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows 
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development 
than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient 
database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety 
and DBMS independence.

Project Status

We have not seen a lot of activity lately, could be related the holidays 
and the fact that the project is quite mature.

Changes in committers or PMC members

No changes to report.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Etch Project  [Martin Veith]

Apache Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent 
RPC-like framework for building and consuming network services. 

BOARD ISSUES 
There are no Board-level issues at this time. 

RELEASES 
There hasn't been any new release since becoming a TLP in January 2013. 
The work on biggest new feature of the next release (the C++ binding) 
is quite finished, at the moment there are only a couple of minor issues open.
Hence the 1.3 release is currently planned to be published by end of August.

ACTIVITY 
* User activity on mailing lists is quite stable, but still rather low.
* In order to get a better feeling about how many users we have we are planning
  to do some analysis on download counters/page visits.
* From a development prospective we are still concentrating on the C++ binding
  to bring it from beta to stable.

COMMITTERS OR PMC MEMBERS CHANGE 
* No changes regarding PMC or committers composition since graduation 
  in January 2013. 
* Our committer and user base is still quite small. After the C++ binding
  becomes stable there should be more time to take some actions to increase
  both user and developer community.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and codebases
wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

By Incubator standards, it's been a quiet month.  At 193 emails for July,
traffic on general@incubator was as light as it's been since May 2011, the
month before the Open Office proposal arrived.

* Community

  There were no changes to the IPMC roster.

* New Podlings

  Two new podlings entered the Incubator:

    Samza
    Sentry

* Graduations

  (None)

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

    Jul 24 Apache Ambari 1.2.4-incubating
    Aug 08 Apache Curator 2.2.0-incubating

  It took 3-6 days for the third IPMC vote to arrive.

    Release                             RC VOTE start  Third IMPC +1   Days
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Apache Ambari 1.2.4-incubating      Jul 17         Jun 23          6
    Apache Curator 2.2.0-incubating     Jul 31         Aug 02          3

* Miscellaneous

  o Discussions about a potential Incubator Ombud continued.

  o Discussions about a "welcoming committee" or other ways to facilitate
    orientation of new podlings, spun off from the WhatToExpect wiki page and
    the Ombud discussion, progressed but have not been put into action.

Knox

Knox Gateway is a system that provides a single point of secure access for
Apache Hadoop clusters.

Knox has been incubating since 2013-02-22.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Expand community to include more diverse committers.
  2. Align technically with security work going in in Hadoop.
  3. Clear the project name with legal and pick a new name if required.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  1. None

Shepherd notes:

  acabrera: Nice active podling.  It's already done a release.  I'm not sure
  why they haven't started discussing graduation but I would support such a
  move.

  There seems to be a few security oriented software named Knox.  There may be
  a naming problem here, unless the product was consistently named Knox
  Gateway and not Knox; just my opinion.

--------------------
MetaModel

MetaModel is a data access framework, providing a common interface for
exploration and querying of different types of datastores.

MetaModel has been incubating since 2013-06-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Roadmapping of our first Apache MetaModel release. Since the namespace
     change is going to break backwards compatibility of the project anyway, a
     couple of "old but breaking ideas" needs to be accepted or rejected.
  2. Bring more diverse committers and contributors to the project.
  3. We will probably be having several third party modules for MetaModel,
     because of (L)GPL dependencies. We want to figure out a good way to make
     this understandable for users (through website or similar means).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The pending INFRA work was finished in end-july, and we are starting to take
  it into use.

  We've decided to go for a Review-Then-Commit policy. We will allow lazy
  consensus after 3 days and a minimum of one +1 vote.

  There are currently no concrete plans for a release. We have some
  discussions and proposals of features on the mailing list which we want to
  settle on first.

  Since incubation we have not made any new appointments for either committer
  or PMC member.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The code has been moved from eobjects.org to Apache's Git server
  (https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-metamodel.git). 5
  bugfixes from the base release 3.4.4 was applied to our codebase as well.

  The namespace of the project has been changed to org.apache.metamodel
  (previously org.eobjects.metamodel). To aid migration, we've also
  implemented a helping facility for deserializing objects of the old
  namespace into the new.

  A performance optimization for the CSV module has been proposed and applied.

  The project now has a website (http://metamodel.incubator.apache.org/). The
  website is meant mostly as an 'appetizer', and we're planning to put
  lengthier pieces of information onto our wiki
  (http://wiki.apache.org/metamodel/), and if needed link to those from the
  website. Some initial content has been put on the wiki as well.

  The project contains a Microsoft Access module, which depends on the LGPL
  licensed Jackcess library. We are looking for a replacement dependency or to
  remove the module from the project.

NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven.

NPanday has been incubating since 2010-08-13.

Shepherd notes:

  acabrera: Not a lot of activity.  Most of the mail is comes from the Jenkins
  server.  :)  Still, the lone developer seems to be reasonably active.  I
  think it's telling that there is no report filed. 

--------------------
Olingo

Apache Olingo provides libraries which enable developers to implement
OData producers and OData consumers. While starting with an initial
code base implementing OData version 2.0 it is also a clear goal to
start implementing a library for OData 4.0 once the OData standard is
published at OASIS. The focus within the community is currently on the
Java technology but it is up to the community to discuss if other
environments find interest.

Olingo has been incubating since 2013-07-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community
  2. Make a first release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  - No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - All initial committers have signed the ICLA
  - Initial committers are all on board and started using the mailing
    list to coordinate project activities.
  - Committers started actively working on the code base
  - The code base was contributed by SAP AG via Software Grant


How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Infrastructure setup
    -- Git Repository (for OData V2.0)
    -- Issue Tracker (Jira)
    -- Mailing Lists 
  - Check in of OData Library V2.0 as initial code base
  - The code base is prepared and enhanced to be able to
    produce the first release
    -- Package name changes

--------------------
Open Climate Workbench

Apache Open Climate Workbench (Incubating) is an effort to develop software
that performs climate model evaluation using model outputs from a variety of
different sources (the Earth System Grid Federation, the Coordinated Regional
Downscaling Experiment, the U.S. National Climate Assessment and the North
American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program) and temporal/spatial
scales with remote sensing data from NASA, NOAA and other agencies. The
toolkit includes capabilities for regridding, metrics computation and
visualization. 

Open Climate Workbench has been incubating since 2013-02-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop an Apache community for Open Climate Workbench and connect to
     other relevant Apache efforts (Tika, Hadoop, SIS, OODT)
  2. Identify a Champion/VP candidate.
  3. Add new contributors to the project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No new committers or PPMC members added since the last report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Cameron Goodale made the 0.1-incubating release after 5 release candidates
    on July 29, 2013. 
  * Mike Joyce has a VOTE up for the 0.2-incubating release.
  * The UI and backend are now able to fully replicate the climate analysis
    performed by Kim et al., J. Climate 2013.
  * Maziyar Boustani and Mike Joyce both made screencasts demonstrating the
    UI, and linked them on the wiki.
  * A discussion of binding VOTEs by the IPMC on releases occurred, and the
    PPMC worked through the issues and were better informed of Incubator
    processes.
  * Kyo Lee and Alex Goodman continued to improve the metrics and viz for the
    toolkit.
  * Shakeh Khudikyan is working on a History page for displaying previous runs.

--------------------
Samza

Samza is a stream processing system for running continuous computation on
infinite streams of data.

Samza has been incubating since 2013-07-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Getting codebase imported
  2. Generating Apache community
  3. Imparting ASF way to new PMC

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

Spark

Spark is an open source system for fast and flexible large-scale data
analysis. Spark provides a general purpose runtime that supports low-latency
execution in several forms.

Spark has been incubating since 2013-06-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finish bringing up Apache infrastructure (the only system missing
     is JIRA, but we also still need to move out website to Apache)
  2. Switch development to work directly against Apache repo
  3. Make a Spark 0.8 release through the Apache process

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Nothing major. We've gotten a lot of help setting up infrastructure and the
  last piece missing is importing issues from our old JIRA, which we're
  working with INFRA on (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6419).

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We've continued to get and accept a number of external contributions,
  including metrics infrastructure, improved web UI, several optimizations and
  bug fixes.  We held a meetup on machine learning on Spark in San Francisco
  that got around 200 attendees. Finally, we've set up Apache mailing lists
  and warned users of the migration, which will complete at the beginning of
  September.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We are finishing some bug fixes and merges to do a first Apache release of
  Spark later this month. During this release we'll go through the process of
  checking that the right license headers are in place, NOTICE file is
  present, etc, and we'll complete a website on Apache.

Tashi

An infrastructure for cloud computing on big data.

Tashi has been incubating since 2008-09-04.

Shepherd notes:

  rvs: Tashi looks completely dormant at this point. Despite my repeated
  on-list and off-list emails it appears that I couldn't find anybody to
  compile a report. The only discussion that resulted from my attempts is
  captured over here: http://markmail.org/thread/mveeuubf2fcdmgcw

  Personally I think we need to figure out a path to *some* kind of a
  resolution here. I don't think Tashi benefits from being an incubator
  project and we need to figure out how to get it to a different trajectory.

--------------------
Tez

Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be used
to process arbitrarily complex data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set
of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.

Tez has been incubating since 2013-02-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop collaborations with other Apache projects, including Hadoop, YARN
  2. Make an initial Tez release.
  3. Grow the Apache Tez community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No new PPMC members or committers added since the last report. We need to
  work to do a better job of identifying new contributors, but there is great
  activity so I don't think this will be a big issue.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. 170 jiras filed and 120 odd jiras resolved since the first week of June
     2013.
  2. The first Tez meetup was held at the Hortonworks office on July 31st and
     had an attendance of around 30+ users/developers from across the Hadoop
     ecosystem community.
  3. Seeing more adoption from the Hive community as well as some initial
     prototyping work being done in Pig.
  4. Looking to make a release in the next couple of months after the release
     of hadoop-2.1.0-beta ( which Tez depends on ).

  We are to looking to increase both the user base as well as get more
  contributors by having more meetups and also expect a release to drive more
  adoption of Tez.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos]

JSPWiki is a Java-based wiki engine

Anything the board should be aware of?
---------------------------------------
Still having some issues transferring the resources from Incubator to TLP; 
currently unable to edit the website, except but doing directly on 
production/ URL. Following up this issue with Infra: INFRA-6577, INFRA-6611,
INFRA-6492 and JSPWIKI-787.

We're also looking forward to having a VM to host live (JSP)wikis with 
documentation, a sandbox and a general entry point to newcomers. 
Historically, these wikis have been were JSPWiki's community has built up. A
couple of JIRAs filed to follow up this issue with Infra: INFRA-6580,
INFRA-5588 and JSPWIKI-739. 

Hopefully by the time of the board meeting, these infra issues will have 
been resolved.

Releases / Development

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Kurt Stam]

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification for
(Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an implementation
of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR). 

jUDDI 
- We released version 3.1.5 adding a much improved distribution with
  quickstart examples, a way to create deployments using different JPA or
  JAXWS implementations for different target platforms, lots of fixes of bugs
  found by the work that is taking place on the console.
- Very low traffic on the mailing lists this quarter.
- Working on the 3.2 release which includes a full web based console.
- We deployed a jUDDI instance to the OpenShift Cloud, to make it easy for
  people to try it out.
  http://apachejuddi.blogspot.com/2013/08/uddi-in-openshift-cloud.html

Scout 
- No release this period, not really any development took place.
- Very low volume of JAXR related questions on the mailing list.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Logging Project  [Christian Grobmeier]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to the logging of application behavior.

- Issues, which require Boards attention

Both mentioned issues were reported with the last board report.

Issue 1: 

We have discussed the attribution request with Ceki Gülcü and refused
to give attribution that all of our work is based on logback.
Instead we proposed to give credits to logback as the framework
served as inspiration.

We haven't heard back of Ceki until now and consider the issue
closed.

Ceki Gülcü remains PMC member of Apache Logging, but has
unsubscribed from the private mailing list to give us room
to discuss. He has not subscribed to the list again.

Issue 2:

We have discussed the similarity of the logback logo and
prepared an email for QOS. In this email we would also
mention that our trademark must be prefixed with "Apache".
So far the Logging PMC has not sent the email.

The situation from issue 1 has cooled down and it might be
better to co-exist in freedom. In addition, the log4j
project has started a logo contest and the confusing
similarity would only exist for an outdated framework.

Issue 3:

This issue has been resolved.


- Community

Log4j 2 remains a very active project. The overall
community is healthy and friendly. The newly elected
committers are still active and already discussed
to become PMC members soon.

The mailing lists face lot more user questions and feedback.
A few Apache projects already discussed the inclusion
of Log4j 2 as their main logging framework (Onami,
Syncope, Struts).

Christian spoke on a german conference about Log4j 2
and received good feedback on the framework. Also recent
blog posts on Log4j 2 received a lot of good feedback.
Surprisingly the rise of Log4j 2 reactivated some discussions
inside the JCP to standardize a logging facade.

log4cxx got a lot more activity on the mailing list, which is
surprising. There is still no decision what should happen next.
At least Christian oversees the mailing lists.

In general, the project is healthy and growing.

Community changes:

JUN 03, 2013: Dominik Psenner joined the PMC
MAY 11, 2013: Nick Williams joined as a new committer
APR 23, 2013: Remko Popma joined as a new committer


- Project Branding Requirements

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in
C# and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

The board should be aware that while our mailing list is somewhat active - we
still answer and help the community, our development has stalled. Recently,
we have tried to reinvigorate the discussion. One of our community members
has stepped up and has a running version of Lucene.Net 4.0.3 core. We're
attempting to coordinate to get that into our official repo and rounding out
some of the additional contributed packages.

== Releases ==

Last release was 3.0.3. We're attempting with the help of a group of our
community members to get 4.0.3 bootstrapped.

== Statistics ==

Nuget package downloads:
Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 22619
Lucene.Net Contrib 3.0.3: 7695
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial: 945
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial.NTS: 324

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012. Since then,
there have been four major releases, including a 1.3 release on July 29, 2013.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer and PMC member we signed up was Minoru Osuka (minoru), on
January 10, 2013. We voted in a new committer and PMC member in May, but he
declined to accept the committership due to his company's policies.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been active, with a wide range of topics. Most of our
connectors now have significant use cases and constituencies. Dev list
comments centered around new release-related communication, new contributions,
and voting. We have had a number of current committers significantly increase
their involvement in the project over the last quarter as well.

I am unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

The ManifoldCF team has two outstanding Infra issues at this time: INFRA-6590
and INFRA-6588. No apparent activity on these issues has occurred over the
last few weeks. INFRA-6590 is the more critical of the two since right now
nobody except infra has write access to the ManifoldCF wiki pages.

Branding
========

We have reviewed the site branding guidelines and believe we are now compliant
with these, with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other
Apache products that don't have any such marks. Hopefully we will be able to
correct this issue soon.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides resource sharing and
isolation across cluster applications.
 
## General ##

All but a few loose ends remain for the graduation process. We completed a
press release at
https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces45
along with rolling out our new website at http://mesos.apache.org.

## Releases ##

 * Apache Mesos 0.12.1 (2013-08-13)

The 0.12.1 release included some bug fixes and back ported features for more
easily running frameworks like Hadoop. The release was voted on successfully
but was a bit delayed due to some infrastructure tickets that needed to get
performed in order to publish releases to dist.apache.org. We're on the verge
of releasing 0.13.0 as well!

## Community ##

 * Added 2 new committers and PMC members:
     Dave Lester (dlester) on 2013-08-05
     Ross Allen (ssorallen) on 2013-08-05

 * 92/67 created/resolved JIRA issues in last 30 days.

 * 51 messages to user@mesos.apache.org (July - August), which is a
   tremendous improvement but we're looking to add even more traffic
   there. 1796 messages to dev@mesos.apache.org (July - August).

 * Twitter hosted a meetup for the project on July 25 where we had
   talks from Vinod Kone (Twitter) on running Jenkins on Mesos and
   Brenden Matthews (Airbnb) on running Hadoop on Mesos. We have a
   meetup in NYC planned for August 20th.

 * We are (still) part of the Google Summer of Code:
     Project: Security and Authentication Support
     Student: Ilim Ugur
     Mentor: Vinod Kone (PMC)

## Issues ##

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Roller Project  [Dave Johnson]

Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based weblogging package that works
well on Tomcat and MySQL, and is also known to run on other servers and
databases. The ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org runs on Roller 5.0.1.

Issues

No board issues at this time.

Releases

The latest release of Apache Roller is v5.0.1, which was released
on June 24, 2012, a security and bug fix release.

Community

The Roller community has been fairly active recently and since our 
last report the community has continued to clean-up the JIRA issue 
list, make simplifications in the Roller codebase and re-organize the 
Roller source into a smaller number of Maven modules.

Apart from that activity, the Roller community continues to be rather 
quiet with low traffic that mostly concerns technical support and 
installation issues.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

Development:

* Moved part of the documentation from Maven APT pages to CMS pages on
  the web site.
* Completed minor missing features on metadata.
* Prepare room for the addition of more storage formats (SIS 0.3 reads
  only NetCDF headers). In particular, a Shapefile reader has been
  contributed on a branch. We will need to merge it to the trunk.
* Created Shapefile branch, added experimental Shapefile driver SIS-100 [9]

Work planned:

* Port the referencing module (coordinate transformation services).
  The hope is to get at least the main part for the next OGC meeting
  on September 23rd.

Community:

* Added Travis Pinney to Apache SIS PMC.
* The community resolved the outstanding issues with the SIS website [1].
* Established the Google Summer of Code project for Agent Based Modeling
* based geo-profiling of criminology projects [2]

Related event:

An OGC meeting is planned in Frascati on September 23rd to 27th [3]. That
meeting contains a session on Well Known Text (WKT) 2.0 format, to become an
ISO standard. ESRI provided a "proof of concept" implementation in C++ under
Apache 2 license [4]. We would like to get a WKT 2 Java parser ready in time
for the OGC meeting, in order to demonstrate an other proof of concept. Note
that the SIS parser would not be a port of the ESRI one however, since a WKT
parser already exists (in the code to be ported) and only needs some
adjustment for making it compliant with the new WKT 2 syntax.

Branding:

Finished moving SIS website to new bootstrap-enabled template [1]

Issues:
* More JUnit tests would be desirable, in particular regarding ISO
  19139 XML documents.

Releases:

* Created a 0.3 branch, experimented the release process almost fully
  documented the steps [6].
* 0.3 branch stabilized since July 30 and waiting for INFRA-6468 [7]
  proposing a release to vote.
* Release notes page already written [8].
* Release expected at or around August 15th pending final [VOTE] tally.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  Daniel Gruno was added as a committer in July (2013), Markus Schaber
  in June, and Mattias Engdegård in May. Our last PMC addition was in
  March, 2012.

  There is nothing special to report about the community. It is
  working towards 1.9.x, supporting the 1.8.x series on the users@
  mailing list, and responding to issues and security concerns.

  The elego hackathon in June went well, with many in the community
  attending. Lots of discussion occurred, with the consensus ideas
  brought back to the developer list.

  There will be a "Subversion & Git Live" series of events in October.
  This will be the third year WANdisco has run the event; they provide
  support for PMC members and other Subversion developers to attend,
  so it has been a good opportunity for the community to meet.

* Releases

  Apache Subversion 1.8.1 and 1.7.11 were released on July 24, 2013.

  The community will start the release process for 1.8.2 and 1.7.12,
  the week of August 19, 2013.

  * 1.1.3 (Jul 12th, 2013) 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AU: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

All development focus is on the coming 1.6.0 codebase and work towards
that release will likely start soon. Heavy amounts of user traffic has
kept the user list very very active and the dev list somewhat quieter
than usual keeping up under the weight of user traffic.  Some new
faces have started to show up on the dev list and hopefully we can
pull some of those people across.  Documentation contributions seem to
be the largest form of new contributions, though often just one-time
tweaks.

Demand for Java EE 7, expectation that this will be TomEE 2.x, and
requests for a timeline has spread through the user list.  We can
stave off being specific for a while, but we will need access to a
Java EE 7 TCK soon. This is a top priority for our users.  Based on
several years of Geronimo certification cycles and the TomEE Java EE 6
certification, it will likely take 10 to 15 months post getting access
to the Java EE 7 TCK before we can ship a final certified 2.x release.
Speculative implementation based only on specification text often
proves un-useful as critical details uncovered by the TCK often
require reworking implementation work at the core.  It is often a
matter of doing double work to pull out the previous attempt, then
putting in the new attempt.  Ideally we'd have the TCK and some
progress to show before the end of the year at the latest.

Sub-projects,  this nature results into TLP grows slowly but that does not
mean sub projects are inactive. Please refer following activity summery on
each sub project during the last quarter.   Community is small and grow
slowly but existing members are active and doing releases frequently.
