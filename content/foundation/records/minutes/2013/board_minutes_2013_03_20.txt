 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       We intend to hold our annual members meeting this May 21 and
       23, to elect a new board and add new members.  We're now
       entering the 60-day advance notice window and should hence
       start publicising the meeting, soliciting nominations, etc.

    B. President [Jim]

       The call for the 2013-2014 budget went out a few weeks ago. I will
       send a reminder this week. The due date for the budget requests is
       the end of the month. This should provide sufficient time for
       scrubbing the numbers, getting clarification and verification,
       etc... before the budget is set for approval at next month's board
       meeting.

       I've asked Chris and Melissa to work with CSC regarding our corporate
       status renewals and ensure that our status remains active and in
       good standing.

       Brand Management is working a name-conflict issue and has pulled in
       Legal for assistance, otherwise things are going well, if busy.

       Both Fundraising and M&P are doing fine. No issues with TAC although
       I am awaiting the final accounting of money used. No issues with
       Infra.

       Concom is working some smaller events but the big news was, as
       expected, ApacheCon NA 2013. The con was "generally held to be
       a success", a statement with which I agree, and it was clear
       that the volunteers in Concom were not as stressed or over-worked
       at this event as compared to others. A post-conf meeting was held
       and I am awaiting the notes and recommendations from Concom
       regarding future ApacheCons.

       Last month I presented the ASF State of the Feather at ACNA2013,
       a copy of which is on Slideshare. I'll be presenting at POSSCON next
       week about FOSS licensing and governance issues.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       Medium load this month for the Treasurer's Office.

       Confirmed to Sally in late February that Global Newswire invoice
       has been paid.

       Working on payment for Melissa for ACNA 2013 receipts, and to Nick
       Burch for TAC related expenses RE: ACNA 2013. Should be completed
       in time for the board meeting on 3/20. Some other ACNA 2013 expenses
       were charged directly to Jim's credit card (FedEx shipments by
       Melissa to ACNA 2013 hotel in Portland).

       Melissa noted that after all of the ACNA 2013 flights were booked,
       we still have a credit of 440.50 GBP with The Flight Centre for
       future bookings.

       There was a short discussion between Upayavira, Chris and Daniel
       Shahaf regarding providing more visibility into lockbox/sponsor
       mapping for traceability. Discussion centered around tooling, but
       in the end, Upayavira mentioned if he could simply get access to
       the statements monthly he was probably OK.

       Melissa Warnkin our EA requested a 1099. Since I've never made one
       of those before, I've requested assistance from Sam during my first
       time generating it. I should be fine after that.

       Upayavira added a bunch of invoices that generated into the financials
       SVN repository over the past few months.

       Sam and I sent a check to Matt Benson to reimburse his registration
       for ACNA 2013.  He hasn't received the check, and is looking into
       it. Sam and I have provided him with the WFS reference #, which
       Matt will use to try and track down the check.

       Sam received a routine call from Paschal Greene of Wells Fargo. We
       made a number of suggestions and Chris is trying to schedule a con
       call with Paschal to enact the following:

        1. Remove Geir, Aaron, Phillip, and Justin from account access
           (suggested by Sam, +1 from Chris).
        2. Provide Chris with full access to Bill Pay (currently missing
           access).  
        3. Reconcile Credit Cards -- Sam and Jim currently have one, as 
           does Justin. Should we decommission Justin's? (question to 
           Sam and Jim)
        4. Provide Full Signatory Access for Chris.

      Jim and Melissa sent along a note from Natasha Livingston of CSC
      who mentioned that our we need to get our standing in shape with
      the Delaware Secretary of State.  Apparently we need to reconcile
      a 2012 annual report, and pay off Franchise Taxes.  I've sent an
      inquiry to Natasha requesting a meeting or email conversation with
      her, and I have Jim's approval to contract with CSC to handle this
      for us. I've requested a quote from Natasha to take care of this.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The office of secretary is running smoothly.

       Last month was an average month for incoming documents, with 48 ICLAs,
       three CCLAs, one grant, and one NDA received and filed.


    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       The SGA for Ripple was finally signed-off, with none of the
       changes that had been originally requested by lawyers.

       ApacheCon went reasonably well. Attendance was lower in overall
       numbers but discussions with the producer led to the assumption
       that past ApacheCons had reported higher numbers because single
       day tickets were available.

       The producer did a good job without burning out our volunteers,
       my own feedback was to request they inject more of their own
       ideas into the event if they produce another. It would seem
       that they had chosen to stay aligned with the old model in
       order to understand the community before injecting more ideas.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

No board level issues.

I expect to submit the same annual budget request as last year.

Overall questions to trademarks@ are up, and we've had a lot of podling 
name search queries lately, which are working fairly well, although it's 
clear from comments on the searches that the Incubator documentation is 
not as clear as it could be.

The Apache UIMA project was contacted by Softmaker.de with a complaint [1]
that the sandbox plugin release of Apache UIMA TextMarker software was 
a name conflict with SoftMaker's TextMaker word processing software, 
which is registered in several jurisdictions.  ASF Counsel is preparing 
a detailed response, which will be sent directly to them via trademarks@.

An independent third party contacted trademarks@ about an interesting 
idea for an Apache product logo on merchandise; we are working to get 
feedback from the relevant PMC.  Trademarks@ will be working on improved 
and simpler merchandising policy for Apache brands, since this can be a 
great way to bring awareness when done in appropriate ways.

Shane was contacted to join a new cross-OSS-project wiki that claims 
to want to offer suggestions for trademark polices for open source 
groups - if this gets some traction, it would be a great thing for all
of us: http://modeltrademarkguidelines.org

Shane spoke at ApacheCon NA to give "Managing Open Source Community Brands"
which was well recieved and brought in a lot of good questions from 
Apache committers during the conference.  [2]

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

It has been a quiet month for fundraising. 

A discussion about privacy of sponsor's details led to the creation of a
private archived alias for vp-fundraising, which is accessible only to
the VP Fundraising and a select few others. If this alias is CC'd on
correspondence to/from sponsors, future VPs will have access to
conversations that otherwise only make it into private mailboxes.

There has been activity with two platinum sponsors, one accepting a PO,
the other having sent a wire. A third platinum is lined up.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain ahead of plans and under budget. No vendor payments
are due at this time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned.

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the newswire,
ASF Foundation Blog, announce@apache.org, or announce@apachecon.com during
this timeperiod.

IV. Informal Announcements: 3 items were announced on @TheASF Twitter
feed, and 26 on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed. No new posts were made on
"TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: a graduation announcement is being planned for a
project currently in the Apache Incubator, as well as several press
releases from a few TLPs. PMCs wishing to announce major project news —as
well as podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator— are welcome to
contact Sally at press@apache.org for more information. Kindly provide at
least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: Sally responded to 9 media requests, 4 requests for
project graphics/logos, and coordinated 15 interviews across various
projects for a recently-published feature on the ASF's influence in the
world of Open Source. The ASF received 1,203 press clips over this time
period, vs. last month's clip count of 612.

VII. Analyst Relations: no formal briefings are planned. Apache was
mentioned in 10 reports by Gartner, 3 reports by Forrester, 12 write-ups
by GigaOM, and 19 reports by 451 Research.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally created and moderated the "Apache and The
Business of Open Source" plenary panel, and met with several ASF Sponsors.
She also created new graphics and worked with Melissa Warnkin on
production of promotional items that were distributed at ApacheCon.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the Apache Conference Planning Project  [Nick Burch]

Small Events
------------
We'll hopefully be announcing an event in Bangalore in a day or so. This
will be a CloudStack heavy, but by no means exclusive one day BarCamp.

The Boston BarCamp is gathering momentum, aimed for May. We have a good mix
of new blood and old hands involved!

DC and New York are expected to have events after Boston, hopefully sharing
a great deal of experience and advice.

There has also been some discussion from this around support for small
events, both advice and physical stuff. The "Event In A Box" really needs
some work to finish off and publish.

In addition, people in other areas of the world expressed an interest in
doing a small event at ApacheCon, but none of them have piped up on-list yet.

Committee Structure
-------------------
No new committee members have been added this month. There are possibly a
few we should look at adding, once someone has a chance to compare the
planners@ and apachecon-discuss@ posts in the run-up to ApacheCon with the
committee list, and spot any we've missed...

There has been a general consensus to move to just two lists. This may
involve renaming the committee! Plans for naming the committee, naming the
lists, and what goes where in the move are still open.

Budget planning has just begun.

ApacheCon NA 2013
-----------------
This was generally held to be a success. We didn't get quite as many people
as we'd hoped, but we did have an engaged and interested group there. Final
attendence was about 350, we'll be getting exact numbers and details fairly
soon. Volunteer energy was used for community events, but very little for
the main conference (and if anything people felt too little was used).

Various community events around the conference were tried. Other than the
post-event hackathons (which there was no interest in until 9am the day
after the conference, when suddenly there was lots but it was too late!),
events were ok to amazingly attended, and with sustainable volunteer needs
to pull off. Local engagement wasn't as high as expected though, but ideas
were found for fixing that going forward. A hackathon space during the conf
on the same level was missed, and the difference between Sinsheim and
Portland on this was noticable, so we now know one really is required.

Future ApacheCons
-----------------
A fairly long discussion was held after the conf, with notes taken and
circulated. There hasn't yet been a lot of on-list review + discussions on
this, which may mean people are busy focusing on small events, list re-org
and video+audio.

The meeting did reach two rough decisions, still awaiting list confirmation.
One was that a producer led ACNA under TOB should be done for two more
years, with only minor tweaks (to address a few issues), building on the
knowledge that TOB have gained from Sinsheim and Portland. It was also felt
that there should be another Europe event, but that it had to be producer
led - not community (not) driven. That will need an updating of the ACNA RFP
based on the lessons learnt, then a search for a suitable producer to make
it happen.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Committee
---------
No new members, but our newest committee member (amongst others!) helped
out a lot with ACNA

Budget discussions are still at any early stage, but based on discussions
in Portland we're expecting to go for a similar number

ApacheCon NA 13
---------------
12 people were accepted, but several dropped out before the event
(thankfully none after ticketing). In the end, the TAC contingent was 8
people, plus part time assistance from Nick and Melissa.

Overall, it seemed to go fairly well, other than the wrinkle with the
webapp physical host dying and no-one having recorded the key that all the
backups were encrypted with (now fixed on the new setup!). Melissa was a
great help as ever, but hopefully had to put less work in than some
previous events.

The TAC team seemed to gel well, got into the role, learnt a lot and were
a great help for the event. All seemed much more confident by the end,
more engaged with Apache, knew more people, and a few even expressed an
interest in helping with future events (large and small). One issue faced
was with the welcome breakfast, where half met in the lobby of one bit of
the hotel, half in the lobby of the other, but we know for next time we
need to be more specific! The breakfast worked well to introduce everyone
and break the ice, and seemed to make the start of the process much easier
once again

Formal post-event surveys should be going out soon.

Future Events
-------------
There are no future events we're currently committed to helping. We stand
ready to help once ConCom finalise their future ApacheCon plans, and we
have the budget + volunteer energy to help with a smaller event, if the
organisers of such a gathering need our help.

Budget
----------

We are awaiting figures from EA on what we spent at ACNA (in turn the EA
may be waiting). Either way, we'll have a budget projection ready in time
for the requests deadline.

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

For Feb 2013: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

3      Support question
1      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
6      Vulnerability reports
       1 [httpd, via security@httpd] 
       1 [subversion, via security@] [CLOSING]
       1 [geronimo, via security@geronimo] [CLOSING]

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Activity in Abdera is low but there is a steady stream of commits,
mainly for bug fixes and minor updates. Three committers have been
committing since the last board report and we even managed to get a
release out in January this year.

There have been no committer or PMC member changes, its been a long
time since there has been any.

No board issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Michele Mostarda]

Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command
line tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety
of Web documents.

Project Releases

The Any23 team was happy to announce the first release of Any23
0.7.0-incubating around September 2012.  No releases have been made since.

Overall Project Activity since last report

Since January reporting, community traffic has remained relatively low both on the
user and dev lists. The community decided to move the source
code repository to Git as this was seen to be more convenient 
for the committer base. We are currently in that transition,
and plan to release Any23 0.8.0 shortly afterwards this job is complete.  

How has the community developed since the last report?

Mood reflects the previous admission that the Any23 community could 
benefit from more traffic. For the time being the 0.8.0 release is 
top of the agenda. It is also hoped that the move to Git will 
attract more Any23 users to the codebase.

Changes to PMC & Committers

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in Java,
Python, PHP, .NET, and Objective-C (and possibly other languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.


== Project status ==

The ObjectiveCMIS project, which provides an Objective-C CMIS client
library, joined Apache Chemistry and did a first Apache release.

The OpenCMIS (Java) subproject is in the process of adding CMIS 1.1
support. A first beta release already ships a complete CMIS 1.1
Browser Binding implementation.

The cmislib (Python) subproject started refactoring the library code
to eventually support the CMIS 1.1 Browser Binding.

There is not much activity around the other two subprojects
phpclient (PHP) and DotCMIS (.NET) at the moment.
A DotCMIS release provides the bug fixes and enhancements that have
been accumulated over the past months.


== Community ==

The six contributors of ObjectiveCMIS joined the PMC.


== Releases ==

ObjectiveCMIS 0.1 and DotCMIS 0.5 have been released in January.
OpenCMIS 0.9.0 beta 1 has been released in February.

The committee has voted to use svnpubsub to replace the currently use of the 
deprecated mechanism based on people.apache.org.
The committee has also voted to use Git for version control.
Respective INFRA issues are filed.

With respect to supporting other Apache projects, a better integration of
Apache Stanbol has been achieved so that Stanbol modules can be run within
Clerezza.

COMMUNITY
No new committers or PMC members are added.

BRANDING
No issues

LEGAL
No issues

INFRASTRUCTURE
Transfer of resources (source codes, website) as part of graduation tasks is
in progress


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Luc Maisonobe]

Apache Commons provides a large set of reusable Java components. Commons
components are widely used in many projects, both at Apache and outside.

There are no particular problems that would require board support.

For information, a vulnerability in the example use of the library in
Apache Commons FileUpload documentation has been identified
(CVE-2013-0248). The vulnerability does not lie in the library itself,
but users may copy the example and introduce an insecure way to handle
temporary files in their application. The documentation was updated.

Several components have been released since last report:
        Commons Math          3.1    (2012-12-24)
        Commons Email         1.3    (2013-01-11)
        Commons Math          3.1.1  (2013-01-13)
        Commons Daemon        1.0.12 (2013-01-24)
        Commons Daemon        1.0.13 (2013-02-13)
        Commons Email         1.3.1  (2013-03-04)

As mentioned in the last report, Commons was very late on the svnpubsub
migration and tried to catch up. This was finally done thanks to the
help of Olivier Lamy (thanks to him for his tremendous work).

Concerning community aspects, several new committers have been elected:
Mark Struberg and Benedikt Ritter as well as a new PMC member: Olivier
Lamy, welcome to them. One PMC member has resigned: Henri Yandell, we
thank him for everything he has done within our community.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running
MapReduce pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

MILESTONES
We completed our most recent release (0.5.0-incubating) on 2/19/13,
just before we left the Incubator.

ACTIVITY
* Most of the Incubator transfer procedures have been completed.
  We still have our old release directory at the Incubator, but
  we plan to update that upon our next release.
* The PMC is currently voting on a set of bylaws for the project
  modeled after the bylaws of the Apache Zookeeper project with
  some small tweaks based on the bylaws of the Apache Pig project.
* Nine JIRAs have been resolved since our most recent release,
  primarily small bug fixes. One major feature was adding the
  ability to start and monitor a MapReduce pipeline
  asynchronously, which was contributed by a new developer on
  the project.

COMMUNITY
* 50 subscribers to the dev mailing list, 62 subscribers to the
  user mailing list.
* There have been no changes to the PMC or committer composition
  since our recent graduation, although the PMC is currently
  holding a vote on adding two new committers.
* The user mailing list has seen small but steady traffic in the
  form of questions and requests from Crunch users.

INFRASTRUCTURE
* The major TLP creation tasks are completed, but we have one
  outstanding issue from the move from the Incubator: our
  github mirror hasn't been updated to reflect the new repo
  name. This is tracked in INFRA-5933.
* The website has been updated to reflect the project's new
  status as a TLP.

LEGAL
No known issues.

BRANDING
No known issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Report from the Apache Etch Project  [Martin Veith]

Apache Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent 
RPC-like framework for building and consuming network services. 

MILESTONES
Since the last report in January there haven't been any new release.
Next major release is planned for the next month.

ACTIVITY
* Graduation process has been concluded. 
* Work on C++ binding is going on, there are some patches in the patch
  queue which are going to be merged in master soon.
* It is planned to bring Java code base to newer concepts available from 
  Java 6.

COMMUNITY
* No changes regarding PMC or committers composition since last report.
* It seems TLP presence helped us to get more visibility. 
  We have a new contributor which is participating on the dev mailing list
  and has provided already some new patches.
* More work is still needed to broad both user and developer community.

INFRASTRUCTURE
* Finished all known task in Incubator
* Updated website

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
Apache Flex 4.9.1 was released on 2/28/13.
Apache Flex Installer 2.0.x was released on 1/9/13.

ACTIVITY
Activity in Apache Flex continues to be in two main areas:  improvements to
the existing Adobe Flash Platform-dependent code base, including the
releases listed above, and prototyping ways to create a version of Flex that
is independent from the Adobe Flash Platform.  There is another group
working on Maven-related tools for the existing code base.

Justin McLean presented on Apache Flex at ApacheCon NA 2013.

COMMUNITY
No changes to our set of committers or PMC members.  We did implement
analytics on the Apache Flex website and in the month of February we had
100,000 page views and more than 36,000 visitors.  That is way more than
anyone would have expected.

The estimated number of Flex SDK 4.9.0 downloads from the Apache Flex
website is 16,701.  This is from the day it went live on December 27th
2012, through Feb 27th, 2013.  This includes downloads directly off our
website and people who downloaded the SDK via the Installer.  We don't know
how many additional downloads occurred directly from our mirrors or other
hosts.

PRESS
Per a request from the Apache Press VP, I was interviewed by a writer from
InfoWorld, but it appears that the article has not been published.

Harbs was interviewed for an article published on http://www.pro-linux.de.

LEGAL
Nothing to report.

TLP MIGRATION
The last of our repos was reconnected to Git-syncing this weekend.  I don't
know of any other remaining migration issues.

INFRASTRUCTURE
 * Infra attempted to resolve INFRA-4380 but ran into problems.  In the last
   report I thought we had a solution, but it appears that we are back to
   trying to devise a new solution.  Tony has been helpful, but he was away
   for a bit, so we'll re-start on this when he gets caught up after his
   return.
 * We will be trying to migrate from SVN to Git as soon as possible.  We
   have opened https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5549 and are
   awaiting infra response.
 * The build system keeps failing for lack of disk space.  I've seen this
   complaint brought up by other projects as well.

BRANDING
No issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

No Board level issues.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Activity ==

Since early this year our self-written maven repository proxy faces
random hangs when requesting artifacts from the central Maven
repository which leads to build processes being killed after the
timeout of one hour.  As a result Gump runs currently take several
days and we disabled nag emails as build failures were more often
related to this problem than a change in the project itself.  The
underlying problem hasn't been fully analyzed so far.

The dataset of projects built by Gump is maintained by only a few
people contributing across all projects and a few additional people
maintaining the metadata of the projects they are interested in the
most.

The Mac OS X server usually running Gump, adam.apache.org, has
undergone an OS upgrade.  The Gump installation is awaiting
restoration.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Report from the Apache Hive Project  [Carl Steinbach]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Apache Hadoop. It
provides SQL to query and manage data (in the form of tables and
partitions stored in HDFS or external systems) and provides a
metastore containing metadata information about the stored data.

RELEASES

* The last release of Apache Hive was version 0.10.0, released on
  January 11th, 2013.

COMMUNITY

* In early February the PMC voted to approve two related measures:

** Measure 1: Amend Hive Bylaws to Define Submodules and Submodule
              Committers

   Passage of this measure will result in the Apache Hive Project
   Bylaws being amended with the following changes:

   http://s.apache.org/WKU

   The motivation for these changes was discussed in the following
   email thread which appeared on the hive-dev and hcatalog-dev
   mailing lists:

   http://s.apache.org/Ht0

** Measure 2: Create HCatalog Submodule and Adopt HCatalog Codebase

   This measure provides for 1) the establishment of an HCatalog
   submodule in the Apache Hive Project, 2) the adoption of the Apache
   HCatalog codebase into the Hive HCatalog submodule, and 3) adding
   all currently active HCatalog committers as submodule committers on
   the Hive HCatalog submodule.

* The HCatalog PPMC subsequently voted to merge the project into Hive
  as a Hive submodule. The voting thread can be viewed here:
  http://s.apache.org/5WX

* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following
  report: http://s.apache.org/z8E

* A user-group meetup was held on February 12th in San Francisco.
  100 people RSVPed for this event.

* The next user-group meetup is scheduled for April 25th in
  Palo Alto. Currently 70 people have RSVPed for the event with
  another 30 people on the waiting list.

* Existing committer Kevin Wilfong was added to the PMC

* Gang Tim Liu was added as a new committer.

* The following PMC members requested that their membership status
  be changed to emeritus: Prasad Chakka (prasadc), Zheng Shao (zshao),
  John Sichi (jvs), and Paul Yang (pauly).

* PMC composition has changed due to the aforementioned changes,
  as well as several members changing their affiliations. The current
  affiliations of PMC members are: Facebook (5), Qubole (2),
  HortonWorks (1), Citus Data (1), and Media6Degrees (1).

* Currently there are:
- Total of 576 subscribers to the developer list
- Total of 1441 subscribers to the user list
- Total of 14 committers
- Total of 10 PMC members
- Total of 6 Emeritus PMC members

-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Benson Margulies]

This month saw a significant discussion around a proposal to modify the
Incubator's policy to eliminate the option for podlings to graduate as
sub-projects of existing PMCs. While this discussion still has unresolved
issues, including moving short-form IP Clearance to legal, there is
significant support for eliminating the option for a proposed podling
to explicitly target a sub-project graduation path.  Many participants
agreed that retaining it as a viable exit path, by exception, was a
logical compromise to eliminating it all together; specifically, when
it is apparent that achieving TLP is not a viable option and there is a
PMC willing to accept the code/community.  The effect of this discussion
can already be seen in the modification of the Curator proposal to keep
TLP as a potential graduation target.

Additionally, the Incubator saw a substantial influx of new, accepted
projects with more proposals currently under discussion.  In prior
reports, the issue of mentor time & attention was raised and will need
to be watched closely with the addition of so many new projects in a
short timeframe.  The only point of immediate concern in this space is the
failed experiment for Shepherd's to self-organize. As a PMC, the Incubator
needs to determine how we will handle the assignment and execution of
the up-till-now successful shepherd role for any given report without
the direct intervention of a single individual, such as the PMC chair.

Lastly, the MRQL project proposal was championed by an individual who is
a PMC chair, but is not a foundation member or IPMC member.  Discovery
of this fact, combined with the perception that the vote was rushed,
led some in the IPMC to immediately invalidate the project proposal and
take actions to cancel creation of its resources.  Further discussions
have prompted other IPMC members to step forward as proposed champions
and mentors in an effort to get the proposal and project creation back
on track.

o Community

New IPMC members:
None

People who left the IPMC:
None

o New Podlings

The Incubator PMC voted to accept 6 new podlings since the last report

Curator - a set of Java libraries for working with Apache Zookeeper
Knox - a single point of authentication for Apache Hadoop services
MRQL* - a query processing and optimization system for large-scale
data analysis
Open Climate Workbench - a framework focused on the rapid comparison of
climate model output to remote sensing data.
Provisionr - a service to manage pools of virtual machines on multiple
clouds
Tajo - a relational and distributed data warehouse system for Hadoop
Tez - a framework for processing arbitrarily complex data-processing tasks

* The MRQL acceptance has been mired in controversy due to an issue with
the Champion's status. (See commentary)

o Graduations

The board has motions for the following:

Bloodhound
Cloudstack
cTAKES

The following projects are graduating to an existing PMC:

EasyAnt to the Ant PMC

o Releases

Apache Onami Parent 0.3-incubating
Apache EasyAnt 0.9-incubating
Apache Crunch 0.5.0-incubating
Apache Mesos 0.10-incubating

o Legal / Trademarks
No issues at this time

o Infrastructure
No issues at this time

Still getting started at the Incubator
These projects are still getting started, so no immediate progress
towards graduation is yet expected.

Allura

Forge software for the development of software projects, including source
control systems, issue tracking, discussion, wiki, and other software
project management tools.

Allura has been incubating since 2012-06-25.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Continue to grow community
 2. Move project development to ASF hardware
 3. Continue to remove non-AL code from the repo

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 No issues at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

 1. Lots of contributions from Stefano Invernizzi and Simone Gatti.
 2. Small patch received from SourceForge user 'honyczek'. No other
 new contributors.
 3. Some new faces on IRC and the mailing list.
 4. Professor mentoring Stefano and Simone has expressed willingness
 to recruit more students to work on Allura.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 1. Allura instance set up at http://allura-vm.apache.org/ but nothing
 moved to it yet.
    Need to finish setup and address any problems before moving
    development to the new vm.

 2. GPL code made optional. Licensing review by Peter shows that only one
    Creative Commons javascript library needs to be addressed. LICENSE
    and NOTICE files created. Still need to apply Apache License header to
    all files.

Shepherd notes:

Commit activity & mailing list traffic look good.  I see that there
are license issues that the podling has been dealing with, specifically
removing non AL code.  I am looking forward to seeing discussions about
making a release in the near future.

--------------------
Bloodhound

Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool,
including issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.

Bloodhound has been incubating since 2011-12-23.

The most important issue the Bloodhound community needs to address
is diversifying the community, but we believe this is no longer
any impediment to graduation.

We're hoping to graduate soon, before the next report. While
growing our community further continues to be important, we
have seen more outside interest recently. This addresses the
only barrier to graduation raised after the December2012 report.
We have further prepared by completing the PODLINGNAMESEARCH,
and just recently completed the community vote on graduation
readiness.

The project now has two online demo instances running of
Apache Bloodhound, one of which shows the current state of the
trunk branch [ http://bh-demo1.apache.org ] and providing
a first implementation of the new search functionality,
responsive layout and multi-product architecture that has
been developed. Together these represent the main strands of
what Apache Bloodhound set out to achieve. Unfortunately,
we do not yet have the ability to make use of the repository
browser, which was something that was brought up in the
previous report.

We added two new committers to the project in January, and
a fourth incubation release. We have also seen more interest
in the project from a number of channels including irc and
the dev mailing list which we are, as ever, hoping to convert
into growth of the developer community and continue to improve
upon diversity.

P.S.: The Incubator vote to graduate Bloodhound passed on 2013-03-13.
      A resolution to establish the Apache Bloodhound TLP has been
      submitted to the Board.


Shepherd notes:

--------------------
cTAKES

cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) is
an natural language processing tool for information extraction from
electronic medical record clinical free-text.

cTAKES has been incubating since 2012-06-11.

Three most important steps moving towards graduation
  Attract new contributors
  Make at least one cTAKES release
  Get everyone's ICLA on file and start developing code at Apache
  and using the infrastructure

Anything required IPMC attention?
  None

Community:
  We added over 10 new committers after the podling was formed.
  We initiated a community VOTE for graduation
  (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-ctakes-dev/201303.mbox/browser)

Development:
  We successfully produced one released (ctakes-3.0.0-incubating).
  Roadmap has been created on Jira and currently working on future
  releases.

Apache: Project Drill

Description:

Apache Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of
large-scale datasets that is based on Google's Dremel. Its goal is to
efficiently process nested data, scale to 10,000 servers or more and to
be able to process petabyes of data and trillions of records in seconds.

Drill has been incubating since 2012-08-11.

Three Issues to Address in Move to Graduation:

1. Continue to attract new developers with a variety of skills and
viewpoints
2. Develop community skills and knowledge by building some releases
3. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among
multiple project members

Issues to Call to Attention of PMC or ASF Board:

none

How community has developed since last report:

Mailing list discussions:

There has been active participation in discussions on the developer
mailing list, including new participants and developers. A few have
participated in the users list; mainly activity takes place on developer
mailing list.

Journal, authored by Ted Dunning and Jacques Nadeau.

In addition there have been a variety of blog postings about Drill.

Social Networking

@ApacheDrill Twitter entity is active and has grown to 147 followers.

How project has developed since last report:

1. Wiki has been built
2. Significant code drops have been checked in from a number of new
developers
3. Added our first additional committer and PMC member, additional
candidates are developing
4. Additional non-code contributors have become active and are being
encouraged

Shepherd notes:

Drill appears to be healthy.  Mailing lists are seeing a ton of traffic
and work in the sandbox seems to be progressing at a reasonable pace.
Question to the community: When do you estimate that you would want to
start putting a preliminary release of some kind together?  I assume
this would require identifying at least some components that should be
moved from "sandbox".

--------------------
Hadoop Development Tools

Eclipse based tools for developing applications on the Hadoop platform.

Hadoop Development Tools entered the Incubator on 11/09/2012.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
- Support multiple versions of Hadoop in a single IDE instance. During
this time building understanding of the Apache processes around working
and releasing.
- Release
- Grow the podling community in terms of users and contributors.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
- None

How has the community developed since the last report?
- Bob Kerns was added to the PPMC
- Rahul sharma has begun contributing to the project (HDT-18)

How has the project developed since the last report?
- Wiki group permissions sorted out with mentors (thanks Adam Berry)
- Confluence permissions sorted out (thanks Adam Berry)
- requested FISHEYE instance for HDT code base
https://support.atlassian.com/browse/FSH-11186 (thanks Bob Kerns)
- discussed moving to Confluence for wiki
- David Crossley mentioned that HDT needed to fix its project metadata
- Bob Kerns put up HDT Product Experience Roadmap on the wiki

Shepherd notes:

The report adequately represents the state of the project.  My only minor
comment is that there appears to be a single individual responsible for
most of the commits; but, it is way too early in the podling's lifecycle
to determine whether or not there is a lack of community involvement.

--------------------

Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares,
and resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. cut off a couple of incubating releases
  2. we identified "high" priority features/changes for 0.7.0-incubating
  release. Kscripts and different "ecosystems" (OSGi, JavaEE, etc)
  providers could be included in this release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
 None so far

How has the community developed since the last report?
 We submitted a couple of Kalumet 0.6.0-incubating releases to vote.

 Unfortunately, due to "discussion" around legal files (especially
 NOTICE), the votes didn't pass.

 We are fixing the legal issue and will submit a new 0.6.0-incubating
 release to vote.

How has the project developed since the last report?
 We created the Jira corresponding to the changes that we want to include
 in Kalumet 0.7.0-incubating release.

 We decided to increase the release cycle in order to give more visibility
 to the users.

 We completed a first documentation. The documentation is part of the
 0.6.0-incubating release and is also available directly on the website.

Shepherd notes:

I am a concerned about the recent drop in activity for the podling.
There was a flurry of mail around the 0.6.0-incubating release and very
little of substance since then, with absolutely nothing in the month
of February.  I wouldn't be so concerned if the vote was successful;
but, since it was a cancelled vote, I would have assumed the community
would try to fix the issues and get it out as soon as possible.
These observations are, of course, made from a quick review, so I could
be missing an important detail.

--------------------
Knox

Knox Gateway is a system that provides a single point of secure access
for Apache Hadoop clusters.

Knox has been incubating since 2013-02-22.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. Complete the infrastructure setup for the project.
  2. Complete the initial code grant.
  3. Clear the project name with legal and pick a new name if required.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
  1. None.

How has the community developed since the last report?
  1. Since we don't have all of our infrastructure setup yet we haven't
  made much progress on this front.
  2. Have received a number of inquiries about participation in spite
  of this.

How has the project developed since the last report?
  1. Have some of our infrastructure, such as mailing lists, setup.
  2. Created PODLINGNAMESEARCH-25 to determine if Knox is a viable
  project name.
  3. Auditing and cleaning up the existing code base in preparation for
  SVN import.
  4. Working on website but that requires completing code grant.

Open Climate Workbench

Apache Open Climate Workbench (Incubating) is an effort to develop
software that performs climate model evaluation using model outputs from
a variety of different sources (the Earth System Grid Federation, the
Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment, the U.S. National Climate
Assessment and the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment
Program) and temporal/spatial scales with remote sensing data from NASA,
NOAA and other agencies. The toolkit includes capabilities for regridding,
metrics computation and visualization.

Open Climate Workbench has been incubating since 2013-02-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop an Apache community for Open Climate Workbench and connect
  to other relevant Apache efforts (Tika, Hadoop, SIS, OODT)
  2. Make an initial release.
  3. Add new contributors to the project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

The project is still adding members of the initial project proposal. So
far 71% of the proposal initial committers on the projects have ICLAs on
file and accounts either already or under processing. 29% of the project
committers (8 people) are still working on filing their ICLAs. Chris
Mattmann is working to get these accounts opened.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Chris filed INFRA-5874 to bootstrap the podling. All mailing lists are
setup, and now archiving, SVN repo has been created and is underway. The
site has been created (using the CMS) by Suresh Marru.

Chris is also working with Craig Russell on filing a Software Grant
for the RCMES initial codebase drop. As of Thursday March 14, 2013,
the grant has been filed in r40293 of the foundation repository.

S4

S4 (Simple Scalable Streaming System) is a general-purpose, distributed,
scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows
programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous,
unbounded streams of data.

S4 has been incubating since 2011-09-26.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. growing the community
  2. verifying (changing?) the name of the project. See
  PODLINGNAMESEARCH-10

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?


How has the community developed since the last report?

We have a new committer (dferro).

How has the project developed since the last report?

We kept iterating on the integration with Apache Helix. We also
added major updates to the codebase for improving configurability
(and usability).

We added the sources of the website to our Apache git repository, and
prepared updates to the website and documentation for the forthcoming
release (0.6). This includes migrating the documentation from the
confluence wiki to the S4 website.

We are aiming at cutting a release candidate during the second week of
march for a new release.

Things seem to be going well despite the smaller size.  Do you think
you will be proposing graduation before the next reporting period?

--------------------
Streams

Apache Streams is a lightweight server for ActivityStreams.

Streams has been incubating since 2012-11-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Diverse participation in development.  More of the community needs
  to be actively engaged.
  2. Increase the codebase
  3. Develop a larger community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
Not at this time

Tez

Tez is a framework for processing arbitrarily complex data-processing
tasks.

Tez has been incubating since 2013-02-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop collaborations with other Apache projects, including Hadoop,
  YARN 2. Make an initial Tez release.  3. Grow the Apache Tez community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?  The community is
still bootstrapping and we will need to probably finish getting ICLAs on
board. Chris started a thread on dev@tez to request clarification on who
needs ICLAs filed, and who needs accounts set up. Chris can help with this
as can the other mentors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich
communication. It can be used like email, chat, or a document.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make a release (stalled).
The licensing issues have been resolved, and build scripts have been
put into the repository. Documentation (see 2) is missing, after which
point we can finalize a commit suitable for release.
  2. Improve documentation.
This is currently scattered between the old WaveProtocol site, the
mailing list, and elsewhere. It needs to be pruned (of no-longer
relevant documentation), structured and put on the wiki.
  3. Increase community size.
We are lacking any contributors who are able to make/support large
code changes at the moment. A release should help increase wider
knowledge of the project, to hopefully bring in more development
support.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None at this time. (Though see Shepard's notes).

How has the community developed since the last report?

The mailing list traffic continues to consist of new people asking
questions about setting-up/running a WIAB server. (Which could be
resolved by #2). Other than that, mostly stagnation.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Some progress towards a release (licensing) has been made.
Internationalization support has been added.

Shepherd notes:

grobmeier: The project is very silent with less commit activity (last
commit before 5 weeks). Even when the committers are usually responsive
on mailing-lists it is very clear that nobody there can spend enough time
to actually drive Wave forward. The next weeks the question needs to
be asked if the Incubator goals can ever be reached or if GitHub would
be a better home for Wave. A new committer has been elected before a
couple of months but the situation didn't change. The missing project
report does unfortunately reflect the situation. From Mentor side of
view, only Upayavira is actively and constructively contributing to the
project. Actually the other mentors should be asked if they are still
interested in mentoring Wave.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Steve Rowe]

The Apache Lucene project develops open-source search software.

TLP
---

We added two new PMC members in the last quarter: James Dyer and Stefan
Matheis.

No new committers were added in the last quarter.  The most recent committer
addition happened in October 2012.


Lucene Core and Solr
--------------------

Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit.

Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core.

In the last quarter we made two releases of both Lucene Core and Solr:

 - 4.1 on 22 January 2013
 - 4.2 on 11 March 2013

The community is very active.

Open Relevance Project
----------------------

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene and others
tools for judging the quality of search and machine learning approaches.  The
community is not very active, but we don't expect it to be very high volume
either as it is a niche area.


PyLucene
--------

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is almost
entirely an automated port, so this project will never require a lot of
developers.  The user community is active.

PyLucene 3.6.2 was released on 04 January 2013.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Jake Mannix]         

Apache Mahout provides implementations of machine learning algorithms
(collaborative filtering, clustering, classification, and more) for
large-scale data, mostly via Hadoop-based implementations.

Issues:

Sean Owen wishes to leave the Mahout PMC (but retain his commit rights),
but this is the only issue which needs the Board attention.

Current Activity: How has the community developed since the last 
report? In February:

Originally planned for 0.8 release by March 8, but will be letting that 
slip forward a few weeks.

and

Feb 2011, 352 
Jan 2011, 473
Dec 2010, 267

We've not had this low developer involvement since the first half of 2009.

User Mailing List Posting

http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/mahout-user/
User list discussions are primarily in support of very new users, as well 
as bug reporting on released versions (0.6 and sometimes even 0.5), 
highlighting the need for 0.8 to be released.

While the traffic to the user mailing list has gone down slightly from 
previous years:

Feb 2012, 288
Jan 2012, 367

Feb 2011, 359
Jan 2011, 458

Feb 2010, 497
Jan 2010, 272

This is not a dramatic decrease, as there is still considerable 
interest in the user community.

Summary: How has the project developed since the last report:

A 1.0 release is not yet on the horizon.

== Milestones ==
1.) Working towards a 0.8 release
2.) Development on new, faster clustering code

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache MRUnit Project  [Brock Noland]

DESCRIPTION

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 0.9.0-incubating, released on
  May 12, 2012 while in Incubation.
* MRUnit is currently working on a 1.0.0 release. All blockers are closed and
  the RM is working on building RC.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Development activity has slowed while the project discussed how to support
  both Hadoop1/Hadoop2: http://s.apache.org/DUs
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report:
  http://s.apache.org/QO7
* 10 JIRAs were resolved since the last report.
* Mail traffic is largely on the DEV list. Messages since Dec 1st: dev 62,
  user 5

COMMUNITY

* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
  the last report.
* Currently there are:
  - Total of 34 subscribers to the developer list.
  - Total of 52 subscribers to the user list.
  - Total of 10 committers
  - Total of 10 PMC members

ISSUES

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

*Releases*
* new release: "Apache OFBiz 10.04.05" has been released in 2013-01-17; the
  release contains bug fixes including some fixes for security
  vulnerabilities reported by the ASF Security team (CVE-2013-0177)
* new release: "Apache OFBiz 11.04.02" has been released in 2013-01-17; the
  release contains bug fixes including some fixes for security
  vulnerabilities reported by the ASF Security team (CVE-2013-0177)

*Community and Project*
* mailing list traffic is lower than in the past years but there is
  still good community interaction: users are getting help and helping
  each other in the user list and in the dev list we are preparing for
  the upcoming 12.04.01 release, the first release in the 12.04 branch
* no new committers or PMC members have been added in this quarter; the
  last committer was Paul Foxworthy (paulfoxworthy), invited in
  November 2012

*Infra/Legal*
We have no issues.

to authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources
they control while avoiding the need to share their username and
password credentials.

MILESTONES

Oltu graduated from the Apache Incubator on January 16, 2013. Since
then, there have been no new releases.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* the main activity at the moment is related to the "After graduation
tasks". We have been following the instruction as for
[http://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.html#transfer].

* We are tracking our progress in
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5772] and
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBER-76];

* development is freezed because of
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-5777]; we would rather
continue tracking issues on AMBER as soon as possible in order to
avoid any confusion in our community; As long as we understood rename
of a JIRA project is not possible but it would be nice to have at
least a new JIRA project named OLTU.

* we have been discussing the possible synergy between Apache Oltu and
other Apache projects (e.g. CXF)

* development activity is healthy, new contributors are emerging as
potential new committers;

* users activity is almost quiet.

COMMUNITY

* PMC composition has not changed since graduation.
* We have voted a new committer : Stein Welberg

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Sean Kelly]

DESCRIPTION

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

For our Christmas-day gift of 2012, we released version 0.5 of OODT [1], which
closed out 61 issues in JIRA [2] and provided improvements to:

* OODT File Manager, and Lucene- and Solr-based catalog indexing
* Curator JAX-RS web application
* PushPull remote file retrieval
* WEngine workflow system

Future work in the next quarter will focus on cross-fertilization projects
with Apache Airavata and Apache Tika, as well as fleshing out our Python APIs.

OODT Jenkins jobs are now prominently featured from our project home page [3].

Our development mailing lists remain quite popular, while the user list shows
less activity.  The table below lists the number of postings by list, by
month, in 2013:

List Jan Feb Mar
---- --- --- ---
dev   57  75  12
user  12  16   0

COMMUNITY

The North American ApacheCon 2013 conspicuously featured Apache OODT.  Seven
speakers gave eight presentations about OODT in the "Apache in Science" track at
the conference [4].

We established a third social media base at Google Plus [5], complementing our
existing Facebook [6] and Twitter [7] presence.  We also created a read-only
mirror of OODT at Github [8], enabling a wider base of code contributions and
future participants.

BRANDING

There are no outstanding branding issues since our last report. All's good.

PRESS

Apache OODT received noteworthy attention in two articles penned by our
eminent member Chris A. Mattmann:

* Nature published "Computing: A Vision for Data Science" [9] in volume 493
  (p. 474) featuring Apache OODT, Hadoop, and Tika in the face of "big data".

* Software Development Times published "Apache Does Science" [10], discussing
  OODT's and Apache Airavata's places in scientific endeavors.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Sandro Martini]

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.


Status

As usual, low levels of traffic in our users mailing lists.
Low activity on dev mail list, mainly automated emails from the issue tracker.

Developments on our next major release 2.1 (on trunk) at the moment
are limited to merge fixes from the maintenance branch, and
discussing some important feature to put in that release in our mailing lists.

We get some interests from users with other JVM languages (Groovy and Scala).

One of our PMC members, Roger Whitcomb, attended the ApacheCon NA conference
in Portland the last week of February.  He reports that he got a lot of
helpful information from the sessions and was able to connect personally with
a number of people: some looking to use Pivot in other Apache projects, some
working on other Apache projects that may be helpful in his work, and also
with some Apache board members.  There may be some opportunities to
collaborate with the Apache Flex project, which we are also exploring.

Roger Whitcomb has expressed his interest in becoming the new PMC Chair, and
after one year that I'm in that role and the experience gain in doing that I
think it's a good choice (even to do a kind of rotation between PMC Members
in the Chair role, as done in the past), and note that Roger has been
valuable in this project.  I'll submit the resolution next month.


Issues
We delayed a little our 2.0.3 release due to some strange issues in applications 
of some our users. We still have some important fixes to do but only on Mac
with Asian languages, so we moved to next maintenance release.


Releases
Last Release was 2.0.2, published 21 May 2012.
Since past Friday we are in the voting process for 2.0.3 .


Branding/naming issues:
None.

Legal issues:
None.

Infrastructure issues/needs:
None.

Community changes
Last Committer Piotr Kolaczkowski (pkolaczk) was created 09 May 2012.
A user ask me commit rights in one of our subprojects at Apache-Extras,
to put there an extension for Dependency Injection. I hope to be able 
to get him as a Committer in the future (currently he is not interested).

unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status

While we continue to have an active community, we also have lost

maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community

No changes since last report.

Community Objectives

Since our last board report, we have finished the long-awaited 4.5.0
release.  We're preparing to release 4.5.1 later this month and have
started working on Apache ServiceMix 5.0.0, in which we are dropping
support for some older technology to allow for a more frequent release
cycle.

Documentation and website remain important working topics.

Branding Status

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- We have not released anything since our previous 1.2.1 bugfix release.
  However, enough community desire has surfaced for a 1.2.2 patch release
  as well as a 1.3.0 release.  We are making strong efforts this and
  next week to accomplish this.

- After these next 1.2.1 and 1.3.0 releases, we might start targeting a
  2.0 distribution, which would incorporate a lot of desired changes.  We
  have been careful about this because this would very likely introduce
  backwards incompatible changes that we can't do on minor or patch releases
  as we follow the APR versioning guidelines.

Community & Project:

- Les presented Intro to Apache Shiro at ApacheCon this year - it was a good
  experience to see so many Apache folks.

- We still haven't had the time/volunteers to convert over to infra@'s CMS
  system for our public website, even though we're well past the deadline.
  This means that our public website can't be updated with new content until
  this occurs since (as we understand it) the confluence wiki is no longer
  supported.

- The Shiro community remains helpful, with steady month-after-month mailing
  list traffic.  No noticeable changes here.

- Everyone on the Shiro dev team has been quite busy w/ their respective
  full time jobs.  Coupled with the holidays, not much development was
  accomplished last quarter, but efforts are ramping up significantly for
  a 1.2.2 and 1.3.0 release.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment.

The project is active and development is steadily going on for the components
Enhancer, Entityhub, and Contenthub. One of the latest contributions is an
archetype for easily getting started with implementing an enhancement engine.

Unfortunately, there is not much activity in the development of the
Ontologymanager, Rules, and Reasoner components. The project needs to discuss
the status and future plans of those components since there are about 50 open
issues in Jira.

Subscribers on the dev list: 178
Meric Taze was elected as a new committer on Feb 14th 2013.

The project cut releases of the following components:
- source-assembly-1.0.0

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Greg Reddin]

Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the development of web 
application user interfaces.

Over the last couple of quarters it seems that Tiles has started to stagnate 
again. It's probably time to discuss retirement again, so I will get that 
discussion started and report on it again in the future. There has been a small
amount of discussion on various mailing lists, but not nearly enough to say that
the project is moving forward at this time. I'll check with the PMC and see if 
they see that changing any time soon.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Whirr Project  [Tom White]

Whirr is a library for running services like Hadoop or ZooKeeper in the cloud.

Releases:
No new releases this quarter.

Community: 
The PMC composition did not change, and we had no new committers since the last
report. There was a good discussion on the dev list about the new Apache
Provisionr project (incubating) and how it relates to Whirr, and in particular
whether to bring it to the ASF as a part of Whirr. In the end the community
decided to create a new project (Provisionr has now entered incubation). There
is interest in using the Provisionr service in Whirr for more reliable machine
provisioning.
