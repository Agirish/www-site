 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The last month has been rather quiet at the board level, with no
       particular issues needing our attention. In contrast, there is plenty
       happening on the operations end of the Foundation, and of course
       within our projects. That is a good thing.

       We do have some long standing items on the agenda for the meeting,
       which I hope we can bring some closure to.

       I've also raised the question of whether we should hold a special
       members meeting this year as we are at about the time where that
       process would need to start.

       I will be on holidays during the first week of November.

    B. President [Ross]

       It's been a busy month. 

       Thanks to Melissa for moving forwards on providing hands on support 
       for our VPs, most significantly VP Fundraising. As a result of her 
       excellent work Upayavira reports that his backlog is reducing. Melissa
       has been working with VP Branding and the treasurer to identify first 
       level support activities there. Furthermore Melissa has been working
       on an "Event in a Box" via the ComDev PMC to help support small event
       production within our projects. Finally, Melissa has been working with
       EVP on ApacheCon.

       Melissa, EVP and myself meet weekly to discuss progress on these items.
       Starting this week I will circulate notes from these meetings to board@
       for increased visibility. There is no need for the board to review these
       notes, but we will be happy to address any concerns that are raised as a 
       result.

       The EVP report contains more information about the ApacheCon status. I
       want to raise one concern I have with progress to date. In the initial
       discussions I was told that the proposed producer would underwrite the
       event. However, as we have progressed it has become apparent that this is
       not the case. To my mind this changes the relationship significantly. I've
       asked Rich to expand on this in his verbal report in order to get early
       feedback from the Directors.

       A director asked for an update on the status of our Audit. In response I
       reached out to Hadrian and am working with both Hadrian and Treasurer to 
       come up with a plan for delivering on the report. The problem seems to
       be one of "ownership" since Hadrian's recommendations include 
       recommendations for process change which affect both fundraising and 
       treasurer. I've asked Hadrian to own this and drive it forward with my 
       full support. At the time of writing I'm awaiting a response.

       We are still working on getting our bank to own the problem with missing 
       payments to a Brazilian company.

       I'm speaking twice with an ASF hat, once today in London at Subversion &
       Git live (standing in or Greg) and one next week at All Things Open (this
       is mostly ASF and partly day job).
            
       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       The big issue this month is the status of the ASF Audit.  Provided
       information as requested by the President's Office as to the
       Treasurer's side of the audit. Interacted with ASF Audit Lead,
       Hadrian Zbarcea and suggested what the next steps as seen by the
       Treasurer's Office:
       
        1. Develop contract/procurement order/invoice between ASF and CPA
        agency depending on cost/etc. Treasurer's Office is happy for a
        recommendation or to simply receive a list and make a selection.
        
        2. Someone besides the Treasurer's Office (Chris/Sam) take point
        in starting the audit and levying a set of requests/steps on the
        Treasurer's Office. Maybe the EA or the President/EVP?
        
        3. Treasurer's Office replies and provides as much information as
        we have in response to requests from #1.
        
        4. Hired CPA agency goes through their audit process based on
        responses from #2 and delivers report/results in a timely fashion
        (some agreed upon X months after contracting date) to the Treasurer's
        Office/Prezo/EVP and EA.
        
        5. Treasurer reports on results to the board in following board
        report and identifies responses/actions to the results.
        
       Also referenced former report from May 2013 in which the plan for
       the audit was documented.
       
       Working with Sally/Press to handle payment to PR Newswire.
       
       The VP Fundraising and Treasurer's Office are working together to
       deal with an issue that has prevented our PayPal contribution system
       from accepting payments. Should be closed/fixed this month.
       
       DirectPay set up for the EA and Joe Schaefer as tests to validate
       Chris's access to WFS DirectPay. Successfully used to remit payment
       to both parties last month.
       
       Was put in touch with our new WFS relationship manager and committed
       contact info to financials SVN repo. Investigating issue with wire
       payment regarding CloudStack trademark.
       
       Provided information to Ross as requested to deal with lingering
       SVN trademark payment questions.
       
       Working with the EA to identify a potential CPA firm to deal with our
       corporate tax filing.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The office of secretary is running well. September was a relatively 
       light month with 47 iclas, three cclas, one grant, and one trademark 
       assignment received and filed. 

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        Over the last several weeks we (primarily Melissa and myself) have
        been in discussion with the Linux Foundation about producing an
        ApacheCon in the May/June timeframe, in the United States. There's
        been some back-and-forth regarding some items that we're concerned
        about (most importantly, content selection, sponsorship, co-location
        with related events), and we are content that we're seeing eye to eye
        on these issues, with some details remaining to be worked out.

        The summary, however, is that we intend to let them run the show in a
        way that they feel is most likely to lead to success - that we will
        pitch in where required, but not volunteer to do any of the tasks
        that they offer as part of their service. This leaves us with content
        as our only real task.

        The notes from our meeting on Thursday the 10th may be found in SVN,
        in $SVN/foundation/ApacheCon/2014 and questions should be directed to
        me and Melissa.

        We hope to have a contract signed in the early November time frame,
        so that we can get a CFP out at the end of 2013, or very early 2014,
        and so that we can be on the Linux Foundation event sponsorship
        prospectus for 2014.

        A concern that still remains to be worked out is that the Linux
        Foundation will not be underwriting the event, so, if the event is
        unsuccessful, we will be on the line for losses. This is a point
        which we are still discussing with Angela.

        Details will be send to the dev@community.apache.org mailing list
        when they are worked out, but at the moment Melissa and I are
        handling this with the Linux Foundation, and expect to have more to
        report very soon.

 8. Discussion Items
        A. Status of audit
    
           Jim volunteered to help if needed.
    
        B. Status of Email to PMCs re: TCK availability (ASF policy)
    
          Sam will work on this.
    
        C. Special meeting for member elections
    
           In some years a special meeting has been called, primarily to allow
           for the election of new members more than once a year. November marks
           six months since the annual meeting, so a suitable time to hold a
           mid-year meeting would be mid-December, or mid-January. We have not
           held one since January 2011.
    
           There are pros and cons. On the upside, it allows new members to be
           elected sooner, and may reduce the volume of voting required at the 
           annual meeting.  However, it does require some time and effort from
           our volunteer members, and particularly the executive officers.
    
           I'm interested in whether the Board feels this would be valuable to
           conduct this year, and if so what their availability is for those
           timeframes.
    
        Discussion:
          Most of the people on the member watch list have been elected. 
          Time is getting short to plan a meeting to avoid the holidays.
          Suggest asking members@ for guidance.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

* Daily monitoring of all email activity and following-up with appropriate personnel

Fundraising:
* PayPal - Our PayPal account is "locked" and cannot accept donations. Chris, 
  Upayavira, and I have been working to get this situation rectified.
* Verizon - we received a matching gift notification. Followed the online 
  procedures to claim the matching gift, which should hit our account by the 
  end of October.
* Started creating a "How-To" manual - it is designed to be like a 
  "Fundraising for Dummies"...step-by-step directions complete with 
  screenshots.

ApacheCon:
* We've made a lot of progress with this. We're in the pre-contract 
  negotiations stage with the Linux Foundation. We've received a proposal 
  from LF, we sent back our feedback on that proposal and are having a 
  ConCall at the end of this week to discuss it.
* We're interested in doing a joint event in the May/June timeframe, which 
  we are very excited about - details to follow.

Treasurer:
* Follow-up needed to secure estimates for outsourcing the taxes to a CPA
* Will be creating a "How-To" manual for the treasurer's duty

Weekly status calls with Ross and Rich
* Event-in-a-Box:
* Created and sent out an initial content list to ComDev for comments and 
  feedback
* Will create a "How To Guide"

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

No board level issues.

Progress on getting through the backlog of requests and podling name 
searches is going well.  Otherwise a slightly busy month for trademarks 
but no major unexpected controversies.

I have started documenting foundation/Brand/runbook.txt for common 
procedures in answering questions on trademarks@; in particular 
questions that either relevant Apache project VPs can answer themselves, 
or that members of the Trademarks Committee can answer directly.
Similarly, the President has asked the EA to assist with monitoring 
the trademarks@ list, and she has started a set of "common questions 
and how to address" list which looks to be helpful in the future.

I have a call with counsel shortly before the board meeting to discuss
specific legal agreements for intake of trademarks, in particular to 
cover graphical logos.  This is needed to ensure that we have clear 
trademark rights in the future for our projects, as we have seen in 
some cases where for-profit companies who at the start have the best of 
intentions, but over the long run change behavior to our detriment. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Fundraising has been progressing, with Melissa's help. We have received
a platinum payment from Citrix, and welcomed a new Silver sponsor,
Produban.

We are still battling to resurrect PayPal, and have a concurrent effort
to build an equivalent using Amazon as the payment processor. We have
managed to get past a major vendor invoicing system problem with the
vendor finally accepting a PDF invoice 

We are still behind on seeing renewals, which needs to be our next task.

Melissa has been extremely helpful in getting fundraising moving again.
I have asked to have as much of her time as possible over the next month
or so in order to work through the backlog. My intention is that after
that, it can be maintained as more of a background activity, with
Melissa handling a reasonable amount of the day to day fundraising
activities.

-----------------------------------------

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

An onslaught of Confluence spam required us to change
the default permission scheme to match what we've done
for the moin wiki.  We've also formally withdrawn all
support for the autoexport plugin.

Closed out the account of a deceased committer.

Received delivery at OSUOSL of the gear we ordered last
month.  Now in the process of bringing it online.

Upped the default per-file upload limit for dist/ to 
200MB (from 100MB).

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Releases
Version 1.4.4 was released on 8/23/2013.

Activity
The mailing lists have been active.  The dev list has increased by 16
subscribers to 212, and the user list has increased by 27 subscribers to
316.

We have set a feature freeze date for 1.6.0 to November 1st.  We have
voted on a process to take if there is disagreement about whether a
major feature has been tested enough at the feature freeze date to be
included in the release, as we had difficulty in 1.5.0 with incomplete
features coming in and extending the testing cycle unreasonably.

We have successfully switched from svn to git.

Community
No new committers since the last report.
Mike Drob was added as a committer on 6/27/2013.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]

Apache Airavata is a software framework to construct, execute, and manage 
long running applications and workflows on distributed computing resources.

== Releases ==

Apache Airavata 0.9 was released on September 24th 2013. The release 
planning for 0.10 version is ongoing. Community is brainstorming the readiness
to do the Apache Airavata 1.0 release towards end of the year. 

== Activity ==

The mailing list, jira and commit activity remains very high.  

== Community ==

Airavata has mentored 6 Google Summer of Code students. The community has 
deeply engaged with students and plans to integrate student contributions to
the main code base. The students seems to be committed (rather hoping to) 
continue to contribute to the project. Airavata, OODT, SIS are engaged in
cross-cutting projects and discussions primarily initiated through student
research projects.

== Committer/PMC Changes ==

During this reporting period, one PMC member was added to the roster. Last
member was added on July 24th 2013. There are close to a dozen active 
contributors from GSoC students and otherwise on mailing lists and are in 
the PMC watch list. The PMC will be discussing their contributions and 
additions to the PMC/committers within the next quarter. 

== Other Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Michele Mostarda]

Having missed last months report, this months report is rather
peculiar in the sense that we are at crossroad within the very few
(active) members of the community as to where to take the project.


Progress has been very very slow. There have been a couple of new
users of the software but the community, for all intent and means,
has been unable to help them on mailing list. It is therefore sad
that new users questions have gone virtually unanswered...  which
is a real pity.


This email I suppose serves to act as a direct line of communicating
the current community position within Apache Any23. This is not the
first time that the attic has been mentioned.

It is also important to say that we intend to approach the Apache
Tika community in an attempt to invoke motivation behind merging
some/all of the Any23 codebase into Apache Tika as there are numerous
areas which one could define as being of common interest to both
projects. I am kicking off this discussion on dev@tika.a.o
<mailto:dev@tika.a.o> after I close this thread.


If a formal report in the usual structure is required then I will
be more than happy to post it here, however in all honesty there
is literally zilch to report.

-----------------------------------------

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

The 2.x series reached beta status in August, targeting a GA release before the
end of the year. Work hardening the release continues apace.

The project updated its bylaws to allow for "branch committers" in support of
feature development by newer contributors. The first set are collaborating on a
security initiative that has been discussed on the dev list, in meetups, and in
related JIRAs since last spring. No work on the branch has started, despite
exchanges on the lists on possible, seminal issues to tackle.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Michael Stack]

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database
built on top of Hadoop Common and Hadoop HDFS

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’s ATTENTION
In our last report, we noted a marked improvement
in how MapR refer to their “HBase compatible” M7
product.  A 09/25/2013 press release relapses at
least regards putting the ‘Apache’ prefix before
first-mentions of HBase and Hadoop.

We are very probably going to commit code that makes
use of the JDK’s cryptographic APIs [1].  Apache legal
affairs [3] were notified as per [2].

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Hive Project  [Carl Steinbach]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Apache Hadoop. It
provides SQL to query and manage data (in the form of tables and
partitions stored in HDFS or external systems) and provides a
metastore containing metadata information about the stored data.

* Miscellaneous

  * Allura's release candidate, which spent weeks waiting for IPMC
    feedback, was ultimately withdrawn after flaws were discovered.

  * Commons-monitoring seems likely to enter the Incubator.  The name is
    still under discussion.

  * A question about old Chukwa binary artifacts was resolved by
    reaffirming that the ASF makes no guarantees about convenience
    binaries.

  * The Incubator paid elevated attention to trademarks this month.

  * Old controversies about what criteria to apply when adding personnel to
    a proposed podling finally bit an unlucky live podling candidate
    (Usergrid).  Hopefully it will never happen again.

Celix

Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on
interoperability between Java and C.

Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community
  2. Find more committers
  3. Publish a new release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Several new people are working on additional code for the project. One
  person is working on a GSoC project, someone else is working on a new
  remote services protocol and is actively communicating over the list and
  using jira to post patches. Overall this is an increase in activity.

  The Native-OSGi project is still progressing, but rather slow. So there
  isn't anything new on that end. Celix is still the reference
  implementation, so I still expect this to be a great drive for Celix, for
  the code as well as the committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  As mentioned above, a student is working on a GSoC project and has
  implemented an Event Admin which will be included in Celix. Also a
  additional Remote Services implementation based on shared memory is being
  made.

  Work for a new release is still ongoing, the focus is slightly changing,
  one of the main users has requested a release. Since they don't use
  Win32, Win32 support can be stripped from the release plan and postponed
  to a later release.

Date of last release:

  16-12-2012

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  2013-01-07 Roman Shaposhnik joins as a mentor.
  2012-03-20 Pepijn elected as committer.

DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images
and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.
smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that data, APIs
will also be created to use and manage it.

Shepherd notes:

  Dave Fisher (wave):

    I see good activity recently. It looks like it took DeviceMap quite
    awhile to get started, but the community has grown and it looks like
    they are working towards a release. Mentors are active. I'm not sure
    why they have not reported. (Oct 6)

  Marvin Humphrey (marvin):
  
    Podling did not report, expected next month.

--------------------
Helix

Apache Helix is a generic cluster management framework used to build
distributed systems and provides automatic partition management, fault
tolerance and elasticity.

Helix has been incubating since 2012-10-14.

We feel that we are ready for graduation and have started the discussion
internally. We need to update the status page with new committers and also
resolve trade mark.Our processes are continuing to improve and adoption is
increasing both inside and outside of LinkedIn.

--------------------
jclouds

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API

jclouds has been incubating since 2013-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  The jclouds IPMC graduation vote passed on Sep 23rd, 2013.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The jclouds community is looking forward to the next ASF Board meeting
  and hopes to be confirmed as a TLP.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  jclouds held its first committer vote as an Apache project and is proud
  to have Zack Shoylev on board!

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Our second incubating release was successful, with no issues related to
  ASF process or guidelines raised. The remaining trademark and IP issues
  have been resolved, and changes to the project website to bring it in
  line with ASF guidelines successfully made. The project also held a
  successful vote to adopt a set of Bylaws.

  With those items completed and a new committer on board, the jclouds PPMC
  proceeded to a graduation vote, which was passed and confirmed by the
  IMPC.  Andrew Bayer was elected as the first project PMC chair and will
  thus be proposed as Vice President, Apache jclouds.

Date of last release:

  2013-08-28 (1.6.2-incubating)

--------------------
Marmotta

An Open Platform for Linked Data.

Marmotta has been incubating since 2012-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Check whether Marmotta is a suitable name
     (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-39)
  2. PPMC & IPMC discussion and vote about gratuation
  3. Graduate tasks

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No such issues.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The NOTICE&LICENSE issues from last time are now properly solved.
  * The 3.1.0-incubating release was rescheduled to "after summer
    vacation time" and prepared in late September (released October 3rd).
  * Traffic on dev@marmotta.i.a.o was decreasing over the summer
    months, but is rising again in September during the preparation of
    the last release.
  * We are starting to get bug reports from non-committers in JIRA
    while traffic on users@marmotta.i.a.o is slowly evolving.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * The 3.1.0-incubating release has been accepted on October 3rd.
  * The project was explicitly recommended for graduation after the
    last report in July (<http://s.apache.org/LIF8>)
    but we wanted to have another release before graduation to stabilize
    the release process and and have another check of the N&L by the
    incubator community.
  * Consequently the discussion graduation is being resumed after the
    release, trying the do it by the end of October if no new issues
    appear.

Date of last release:

  2013-10-03 (3.1.0-incubating)

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  2013-05-21 (Raffaele Palmieri, committer&PPMC)
  2013-06-24 (Peter Ansell, committer&PPMC)

So no new committers and/or PPMC member since the last report.

    requiring any special attention. Good luck guys!

--------------------
MetaModel

MetaModel is a data access framework, providing a common interface for
exploration and querying of different types of datastores.

MetaModel has been incubating since 2013-06-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. More contributors to increase diversity of the community
  2. Make first release under ASF umbrella
  3. Looking forward to setup CI builds under ASF infra

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

 None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Ankit Kumar has taken the role of being release engineer for our first
  ASF release.

  A draft for bylaws for the project has been added to the wiki, we are
  discussing and finalizing the details.

  We are still not seeing a lot of involvement from new contributors, but
  expect that a release will give us more users and thus involvement from
  more newcomers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The primary focus has been on making our first release under ASF
  umbrella.  The work is coming along well and we have a practical TODO
  list of less than 5 points now.

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents.

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community, especially attracting new developers.
  2. Address issues of too much code development happening outside of
     Apache
  3. Hold an informal graduation readiness vote

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  It has recently been pointed out that the project status page on the
  Incubator project site is out of date, we hope to update that shortly.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Higher feed-back from the users mailing list, but no new developers.

  Discussion has started, but without much conclusion, of whether we should
  aim for TLP status, or merge into an existing TLP with similar alignment,
  such as POI or OpenOffice.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Clear unnecessary dependency from the Clarizza project.

Olingo

Apache Olingo provides libraries which enable developers to implement
OData producers and OData consumers. While starting with an initial
code base implementing OData version 2.0 it is also a clear goal to
start implementing a library for OData 4.0 once the OData standard is
published at OASIS. The focus within the community is currently on the
Java technology but it is up to the community to discuss if other
environments find interest.

Olingo has been incubating since 2013-07-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make the first release
  2. Work on documentation
  3. Grow community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  - n/a

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Committers actively working on making the release. Effort is
    coordinated by Jira and mailing list.
  - Committers are in mailing list contact with mentors and infrastructure
    to extend infrastructure setup (e.g. Jenkins, KEYS files ...).
  - Some committers have started with KEY signing. This is in progress to
    get all committers involved.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - There is currently no feature development
  - Instead committers do concentrate on making the first release
  - A release candidate is available and discussed by community on mailing
    list
  - Release voting has started
  - Documentation on web site is growing and will be published as soon as
    the first release is available

    Apache Olingo goes direction first release. They allready use mailing
    list in a good way. It looks like they allready knows how to work with
    lazy consensus.  The Mentors are active in a good way. Well, the
    documentation is poor at the moment. But the project knows this problem
    and work on it.  Looking forward for a release.

Spark

Spark is an open source system for fast and flexible large-scale data
analysis. Spark provides a general purpose runtime that supports
low-latency execution in several forms.

Spark has been incubating since 2013-06-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Move JIRA over to Apache (still haven't gotten success from INFRA
     on this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6419)
  2. Add more committers under Apache process
  3. Make further Apache releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We still need some help importing our JIRA -- see INFRA-6419. For some
  reason we've had a lot of trouble with this. It should be easier now
  because Apache's JIRA was updated and now matches our version.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We made the Spark 0.8.0 release, which was the biggest so far, with 67
  developers from 24 organizations contributing. The release shows how far
  our community has grown -- our 0.6 release last October had only 17
  contributors, and our 0.7 release in February had 31. Most of the
  contributors are now external to the original UC Berkeley team.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We made the Spark 0.8.0 release mentioned above, which so far seems to
  be doing well. It brings a number of deployability features, improved
  Python support, and a new standard library for machine learning; see
  http://spark.incubator.apache.org/releases/spark-release-0-8-0.html
  for what's new in the release.

Storm

Storm is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and high-performance realtime
computation system that provides strong guarantees on the processing of
data.

Storm has been incubating since 2013-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Transition community to new infrastructure and mailing lists
  2. Test and mature the Netty message passing implementation so all future
     releases do not include 0mq transport (which is LGPL)
  3. Make a release under Apache

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are still waiting for ICLA's from Flip Kromer and David Lao.

  We are waiting for infrastructure to be set up so we can switch mailing
  lists and code hosting over to Apache.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A few more users have been added to the Powered By page. Otherwise, we've
  received a steady amount of new patches and messages on the mailing list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A software grant has been filed by Nathan Marz for the project. Also, all
  contributor agreements Nathan has collected pre-Apache have been
  submitted to Apache. All committers except for two have filed ICLA's and
  CCLA's.

  We are making one last release via the old route during the transition
  into the incubator (0.9.0). We have switched development to an
  Apache-like consensus-driven approach and have made lots of progress on
  closing pull requests (as well as getting committers active in
  discussions, merging, and managing release process).

management, and platform- wide insight including monitoring and billing.

Stratos has been incubating since 2013-06-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Moving all Stratos related trademarks from WSO2 to Apache. Certain
     WSO2 technologies such as StratosLive still bear the Stratos name.
     These have to be resolved in the near future. We are in the process of
     sorting these out.
  2. Get the first Apache Stratos (incubating) release out, and in the
     process ensure all ASF release requirements are met.
  3. Build the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  - none -

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Three new committers & PMC members have been added to the project. (In
  Stratos, committers are also invited to join the PMC). Six Google
  Hangouts were held in order to educate the community about the project &
  the technical details/architecture in the project. A Cloud BarCamp is
  being organized for end of October to enable the Stratos community
  members as well as other Apache cloud project community members to meet
  up & exchange ideas & build synergy. Community members have also written
  several blog posts. The project has also seen a number of new
  contributors who have started actively participating in the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code has been refactored to get rid of non ASL 2.0 compatible third party
  library dependencies.  Package names have been changed. License files
  added. Several bugs have been fixed. Builds have been made available for
  review & testing. In anticipation of the first release, the project has
  made available several RC packs to get community feedback. Documentation
  has been added to the wiki. The project site has been properly setup. The
  roadmap discussions are currently taking place on the dev list.

Shepherd notes:

  Roman Shaposhnik (rvs):

    Stratos appears in a solid shape and working on its first incubator
    release. That said, their report is late which makes it difficult for
    the shepherding work to feel complete. I will try to ping some of the
    mentors.

VXQuery

A standards compliant parallel XML Query processor.

VXQuery has been incubating since 2009-07-06.

The most important issue to address in the move towards graduation is
still the first release. The third release candidate is currently up
for vote on vxquery-dev. So far there at 4 positive votes.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are still a little low on mentors, but since Ant Elder has agreed
  to help out, the situation has improved.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

Apache Isis is a framework to enable the creation of software using
domain-driven design principles, being an implementation of the naked
objects architectural pattern


== Community ==

Mailing list activity has been steady; user mailing list subscriptions 
continue to slowly increase month-on-month.

This quarter we voted in a further new committer to Isis, Oscar Bou [1],
on 12 Aug 2013.  Oscar was also voted to the PMC.  We also voted our 
previous two committers, Jeroen van der Wal and Maurizio Taverna, to the PMC
as well [1].


== Activity ==

This year Apache Isis took part in the Google Summer of Code [2].  We 
accepted two students [3], [4], both working, respectively, on new viewers
for Isis [5], [6].  Both have successfully completed their 
projects.

Because the students projects were standalone components, we decided that 
they would work in their own github projects [7], [8] (while interacting on
the Isis dev mailing list, of course).  Both have expressed a willingness to
continue with their projects after GSOC.  We therefore intend to bring their 
code into Isis codebase (both have completed ICLAs), such that they can 
continue to develop through patches.  If they do do this (given that they 
are no longer being paid by Google!), then this will provide visibility to 
the rest of the community such that we might vote them in as committers.

As noted in the previous report, I will be presenting on Apache Isis at the 
Oredev conference in Oslo in Nov 2013 [9].  In addition, Isis has been 
accepted for a presentation and a one-day tutorial slot at the UK's largest
developer conference, DevWeek, in Mar 2014 [10].


== Releases ==

Our last release was on 31 May 2013.  We had expected to put out a further
release this quarter; instead it will be later this month (in time for the
Oredev presentation).  


== Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

== Project Description

Apache Jena is a Java framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data
applications based on W3C and community standards.

== Issues

There are no issues to raise with the board.

== Releases

Jena 2.11.0 released on 2013-09-18

== PMC

PMC member last added: 26 January 2013
Committer last added:  16 August 2013

== Activity

dev@ list:     200-560 messages a month
users@ list:   200-450 messages a month

August was the busiest month on both users@ and dev@ since being at Apache.

== Community news

1/ The Jena GSoC project has successfully finished and the latest release
includes the new spatial indexing module.

2/ New website design contributed.

3/ 4 new modules in the last release from different contributors.

4/ The SDB module was mentioned last time as not seeing enough attention.
The dev community has decided to roll this into the main release process,
while it does not block a release, to reduce overhead.  While it still has
users, none have come forward to actively maintain it so it remains "at
risk" of being moved to a separate area and not released any more.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

The Apache JMeter desktop application is a pure Java application
designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

JMeter 2.9 was released on Jan 28 2013.

Work continues on fixing bugs and making improvements which will
feed into the next release. We hope to release 2.10 soon.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
the committers.

There have been no committers added since October 2011, when Philippe
Mouawad was added. There are a few regular contributors who may be
suitable candidates for committership, pending discussion by the PMC.

There have been no changes to the PMC since it was established in October 2011.

We are looking into setting up a Twitter account.

There are no board level issues at this time

---------------------------------------
There are no Board-level issues at this time.

Releases / Development
----------------------
Last release on 15th May, 2013

Little activity regarding development this month.

Development has been mainly focused on setting up our public wikis, 
which are near complete, pending for some redirections to be performed
at infra, cleaning up the website now that we're able to edit the 
site, and fixing an issue regarding oscache to ehcache transition.

Community

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Nick Wellnhofer]

The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for dynamic
programming languages. It is a "loose" C port of the Apache Lucene search
engine library for Java.

ISSUES

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

RELEASES

Version 0.3.3 was released on 05 Aug 2013.

We're working towards a new major release featuring C bindings, support for
compiled extensions, and Clownfish as a separate product. Clownfish is the
object system which Lucy is based on.

ACTIVITY

Development

    * Started with migration to immutable strings.
    * Renamed some variables generated by Clownfish.
    * Moved some Lucy-specific code from Clownfish to Lucy.
    * Made Clownfish modules ABI-compatible if methods or instance variables
      are added or reordered.

Mailing lists

User list subscribers: 88 (+2)
Developer list subscribers: 65 (-1)

Judging by the number of messages, participation in the developer mailing
list decreased from the quarter before and was below average. Traffic on the
user list was up and all questions were answered.

COMMITTER/PMC CHANGES

No new committers in the last quarter. The last addition was on 15 Feb 2013.

No new PMC members in the last quarter and since Lucy graduated from the
incubator in March 2012.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Grant Ingersoll]

Apache Mahout has implementations of a wide range of machine learning and
data mining algorithms: clustering, classification, collaborative filtering
and frequent pattern mining

Project Status
--------------

The project continues to have a large and active user base and the developer
base continues to grow, as well.

Suneel Marthi was added to the PMC.

Community
---------

The third quarter of 2013 has seen continued activity on par with the
last report.  We are primarily working on 0.9 release, some new
recommendation integration with Solr.  The user list is quite
active with a mix of new and experienced users.

No new committers have been added since the last report.

If all goes well one of the committers will be having her first baby
early April 2014. Patches/commits from her will need some extra
careful review from the community. [Disclaimer: Due to timing issues
this amendment was added to the report after it was submitted by the
committer in question. Sorry for the additional noise.]

Community Objectives
--------------------

Our main focus is on cleanup and preparation of 0.9 and 1.0 releases, as
well as the usual bug fixes.


Releases
--------

None since last report.  Next likely one is sometime between Nov. '13 and Jan. '14.


Issues
------

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Stephen Connolly]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

* General Information

  We have begun reviewing our compliance with the ASF source header policy.
  Counting the number of release roots we ended up at the number 108, after
  retiring 3 components. Using Apache Rat we then determined that 72 of our
  release roots did not fully comply with the source header policy. At the
  time of writing we have pushed that number down to 31. Most of the 
  offending files so far have been in integration tests.

  We are currently in discussion with the legal-discuss@a.o list to clarify
  whether our understanding of the requirements for NOTICE and LICENSE files
  in source control are aligned with legal's thinking. If our current
  understanding proves to be at odds with legal's thinking then we may
  have to ensure that there are NOTICE and LICENSE files checked in for
  each and every module (i.e. not just the 108 release roots, but also each
  sub-module of those release roots)

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides resource sharing and
isolation across cluster applications.

## Releases ##

 * Apache Mesos 0.14.0 (out for vote)

The primary feature in the 0.14.0 release is "slave recovery" which
allows slaves to restart (e.g., in order to upgrade, or after a
crash) to recover and "reconnect" with live executors/tasks. This was
a much anticpated feature that Twitter engineer and Mesos committer
Vinod Kone has been working on for a while.

Regarding releases, we plan to move to a model where the conversation
around releases will take place on a public JIRA ticket rather than
via release candidate tags. We hope this will bring more people into
the community and help them contribute to and vet releases.

## Community ##

 * No new committers added in the past month. Last committer and PMC
   member added on 2013-08-05. We have 2 contributors that we'll
   likely be adding as committers imminently.

 * 42/37 created/resolved JIRA issues in last 30 days.

 * A meet up was hosted in Washington D.C. in early October.

 * The Google Summer of Code project has concluded. The committers
   used the contributions of the GSOC to complete the authentication
   component of Mesos.

## Issues ##

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Julien Nioche]

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler 
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene™, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop 
datastructures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

No releases since the previous board report but quite a few bugfixes and 
improvements, notably a contribution from Amazon for indexing to AWS 
CloudSearch (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-1517) (which needs 
additional work) and a discussion on how to improve document deduplication
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-656).

We are seeing contributions and bugfixes from new users.

COMMUNITY

No new committers/ PMC member since the previous report.

The traffic on the user and dev mailing lists has come back to its usual 
levels after a few months of exceptional high activity.

A talk on Nutch by Julien Nioche has been accepted for  Lucene/Solr 
Revolution EU 2013. 

DigitalPebble Ltd published a benchmark comparing the performance of both 
versions of Nutch which should help improving Apache Gora and hence Nutch 
2.x in the longer term.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Tammo van Lessen]

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes written
following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services, sending and
receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error recovery as described
by your process definition. It supports both long and short living process
executions to orchestrate all the services that are part of your application.

STATUS

After a couple of rather quiet development periods, this one was pretty busy.
We were able to successfully cut our 1.3.6 release, the vote is still open but
it looks like everything is fine and we're looking forward that it will be
published in this reporting period.

RELEASE

Apache ODE 1.3.6 has been released (hopefully).

DEVELOPMENT

Main development focus was on the release. We have fixed 42 bugs in total,
some were bug fixes, some were minor to major improvements, some addressed
compatibility issues with recent ServiceMix versions. We have also addressed a
bunch of issues that have been discovered by Betsy, a BPEL standard compliance
testing tool, provided by the University of Bamberg. Besides of this, the
JACOB refactoring has been pushed forward as well.

COMMUNITY

Nothing to report. Last committer was added on Dec 10, 2012, last PMC member 
was added on Jun 28, 2013.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

Issues for Board Awareness
---------------------------

OpenOffice, like the ASF as a whole, is hit by the announced policy
change of Apache Extras. The project hopes that a solution will be
found at the ASF level.

Community Development/Outreach Progress
---------------------------------------

The project added 3 committers (July: elish, christef; August: sebb)
since our last report in July. The last PMC addition is jani (April
2013).

The new committers span different areas of expertise, ranging from
QA to localization, recruitment of new volunteers, website updates
and procedural advice.

A new documentation effort for an end-users manual under the ALv2
licence is progressing well on the OpenOffice Wiki.

The OpenOffice forum infrastructure was successfully updated last
Summer. The OpenOffice custom infrastructure is now in a "minimal
maintenance" mode, and the project could benefit from more
volunteers helping with infrastructure work and more well-defined
processes for system administration. A proposal is currently under
preliminary discussion, with contributions from Infra.

Experimental solutions to make website translation easier are
being developed, with a couple of translated versions of the
website close to completion.

New versions of the Extensions and Templates sites, externally
hosted, were put online in the last months.

OpenOffice participated in the Google Summer of Code program for
the first time after several years.

OpenOffice was accepted for a track (devroom) at FOSDEM, a
major European free and open source software conference, to be held
1-2 February 2014 in Brussels, Belgium.

Community support forums remain popular with users: on the
English forum, registered users reached 60,000 on 17 September and
the forum hit 300 users online, a new traffic record.

The mailing lists for user support, localization, QA and marketing
are quite active. Activity in social media is progressing well. As
Apache OpenOffice is a client product, we continue to investigate
ways to direct users to appropriate support venues. The developer
(dev) list remains very active.

Product/Project Development Progress
------------------------------------

Apache OpenOffice 4.0 was released on 23 July 2013, followed by
another release, Apache OpenOffice 4.0.1, on October 1st.

Version 4.0 featured a new, more modern, user interface, a
reworked directory layout to simplify development and installation,
code updates to allow building on newer platforms and 23 languages.

Version 4.0.1 added 9 languages (some of which hadn't been updated
in years) and important bugfixes. The additional translations were
made possible by the community growth and the availability of new
volunteers.

Activities that are already ongoing for the next release include:
the rejuvenate01 branch, to explore using native platform
capabilities and libraries for building; the IA2 accessibility work;
actions for an easier installation and availability on mainstream
Linux distributions; a new localization process, now progressing in
the l10n40 branch; a build approach that is progressively dropping
the historical dmake in favor of GNU make.

The download trend remains very strong, with over 70 million
downloads of Apache OpenOffice so far.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe M. Chiasson]

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since the last report.

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

Work to fully support httpd-2.4 is moving along.

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

Apache-Test 1.38 was released on August 6th, 2012

No new Apache-Test releases since the last report.

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since the last report.

--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Apache-Reload 0.12 was released on March 31st, 2012

No new Apache-Reload releases since the last report.


-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

Apache-DBI 1.12 was released on June 12nd, 2013

No new Apache-DBI releases since the last report.

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

Releases
--------
Release of version 3.4.0 is still imminent.  The latest release candidates
were created Jun 20th and Oct 10th.  

Our rules releases have been much more consistent with 62 nightly rule
collections published since 8/9 which is a perfect record!

No other releases for this quarter.  

3.4.0 will be a major release.  It introduces nearly two years of bug fixes
and features including the Bayes Redis back-end (bug 6879), eDNS changes (bug
6910), Native IPv6 Support, numerous URIBL.pm changes/features and a small API
change in libspamc (bug 6562) with many other subtle changes.

Overall, this release has been tested in many production-level environments
for nearly a year.  It is highly recommended and stable.

Community & Development
-----------------------

Our RuleQA dev list has been active and community support is good allowing the
project to publish rules more consistently.  We have had much fewer problems
this quarter getting rules published nightly!

The project users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

Apache Struts is an action-based Java web application framework.

The Struts team made two releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.15.1 - critical security fix release (2013-07-16)
* Struts 2.3.15.2 - security fix release (2013-09-20)

In the last quarter we had to deal with various security issues, including a
severe code execution vulnerability that led to the release of Struts
2.3.15.1. The said release was prepared with highest priority and published
in coordination with a well known company whose products were partly
affected by this vulnerability. Nevertheless, we heard a lot of news that
many high profile Struts 2 adopters did not update in a timely manner,
leading to successful hacking attacks by exploiting the said vulnerability.
In coordination with the Apache Security Team we adjusted our vulnerability
disclosure procedure to not include detailed information such as proof of
concept examples, at least within a reasonable waiting period after the
release date.

Again all involved Struts developers along with the reporters of said issues
did a great job regarding analysis, resolving and releasing in a timely
manner.

In the last quarter we saw constant community activity on the mailing lists
and issue tracker. The development activity was noticeably influenced by
resources being busy with security topics, leading to slightly slowed down
development on new features.

A group of Struts PMC members, most notably Christian Grobmeier, organized
an open Struts hackathon in Augsburg, Germany, in cooperation with the local
Java User Group. The two-day event started on 2013-09-06 with a mini
conference which was overwhelmingly attended. On day two we had a hackathon
featuring three Struts PMC member, some Struts adopters and people being
just curious about Struts and open source development. All in all the event
was huge success.

Our fellow PMC member Łukasz Lenart is currently organizing a similar event
in Warsaw, Poland, in cooperation with the Warsaw Java User Group.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Greg Reddin]

General:

Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the
development of web application user interfaces.

Tiles continues to be one of those projects with very little development 
activity but a decent-sized user base. There does not seem to be much momentum
for future development with the project. Questions are continuing to be answered
and the PMC continues to be responsive to requests that come in. The existing 
community has been in place for several years now, moving at a slow pace. I see
no reason to believe that will change anytime soon.

Releases:

There have been no releases this quarter. The last Tiles release was in Q2 2013
when we released the Tiles Request library 1.0.3 Beta.

Community:

There have been no changes to the Tiles community in this quarter.
The last addition to the PMC was in April, 2012.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AX: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based on,
but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java Enterprise
Edition Specifications.

Demand for the 1.6.0 is quite high with 2 or 3 requests a week.  Development
of features has slowed, bug fixes still remain quite high and the codebase is
nearing release quality.  The last remaining details are waiting for the
dependencies in snapshot form to be released.  Most snapshot dependencies have
been resolved to their related released versions in the last two months.  The
last remaining dependency is OpenJPA 2.3.0 snapshot, which should hopefully be
ready for release at some point soon.

Work on an administration console has revived, which is a frequently requested
feature.  The new effort is more or less a "from scratch" effort and shows
great promise.  Exploratory work has also started in the community on adding
support for TomEE in Microsoft Azure.

Java EE 7 is still highly demanded.  I spoke with a few people at Oracle while
at JavaOne and expressed some of the concerns about communities retaining
control of projects and more.  At individual levels, everyone I spoke with is
very open to finding common ground and willing to compromise.  My personal
take: the will is definitely there.

Last release was 1.5.2 in April.  Last committer was added 2011-12-14.  Last
PMC addition was 2010-08-26.

Events
======

A BarCamp was held July 9-10th in Denver. This was received as an overall
positive experience, and as such, we're doing it again. October 16-17 we'll
hold our 2013 Fall Summit, hosted by Yahoo! More information is available at

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Fall+2013+Summit

The tentatively planned BarCamp in China was unfortunately canceled. We hope

This also marks a major update to our release process. For more details, see
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Release+Management. Some
highlights from this are:

   * Strict Semantic Versioning. Upgrading within a major version is always
     compatible from APIs, ABIs and configurations perspective.
   * Patch releases (e.g. v4.0.2) are made for security and critical bugs.
   * All releases are considered stable (i.e. no more development release).
   * Quarterly minor releases, on fixed schedules (May, Aug, Nov and Feb).
   * Major releases at the most once a year, but could be longer.

Upcoming releases include

   * Imminent: v4.0.2, fixing 4 critical bugs in v4.0.1.
   * November: v4.1.0
