 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       At the June meeting, the Board appointed a new slate of Officers for
       the coming year:

         Chairman - Brett Porter
         Vice Chairman - Greg Stein
         President - Ross Gardler
         Execute Vice President - Rich Bowen
         Treasurer - Chris Mattmann
         Asst Treasurer - Sam Ruby
         Secretary - Craig Russell
         Asst Secretary - James Carman

       Our thanks go to Jim for his tireless efforts as the President, and
       his service in the many executive officer appointments he has held in
       the years since the Foundation was established!

       Thanks also to Doug for serving as the Chairman for the last 3 years,
       who leaves big shoes to fill. I'm honoured to be able to serve as the
       current Chairman, and thank the Board for the opportunity.

       Congratulations to Ross and Rich in their new roles as President and
       EVP, and James as the new Assistant Secretary.

       The new process for notifying the Board of PMC changes seems to have
       transitioned smoothly. Thanks to Greg for communicating and
       documenting the change. One PMC addition was pushed back in the last
       month. The handling of inactive PMC members continues to come up from
       time to time, but the documentation we have seems sufficient. We
       haven't yet been asked to approve a removal under the revised process.

       Overall, the Board is operating effectively.

    B. President [Ross]

       As expected I've been mostly offline this month, dealing with essential
       items only as I relocated to the US. That task is now complete. Normal
       service can be expected next month.

       The EA contract is due for renewal - this matter is now urgent and
       will be dealt with ASAP.

       Our Directors and Officers Liability insurance is due for renewal.

       Melissa is still working to clarify the accounts for ACNA13. The lack of
       clarity around this issue, coupled with a number of other issues that
       have arisen have prompted us to reconsider the plans for ApacheCon. 
       Melissa, Rich and myself will be meeting to discuss plans at OSCON in 
       July. Once a date and time is set we will extend an invite to board
       members interested in attending.

       I have reached out to VP of Fundraising in order to offer the assistance
       of both the EA and the President during busy times (see Attachment 3).

       At the suggestion of VP Infra and with input from myself and EVP the 
       Infrastructure contractors have drawn up a brief mission statement which 
       is designed to provide a "code of conduct" under which we expect all
       contractors and volunteers to operate.

       No TAC report has been submitted at the time of writing, Gavin sends his
       apologies. There are currently no events planned that TAC are
       assisting with.

       VP Marketing and Publicity is unable to attend OSCON this
       year. Sally is liaising with Melissa to ensure she has everything
       she needs.

       I will be at OSCON and will assist with the ASF booth whenever possible.
       I'll be meeting with Rich as EVP in order to outline the best way for us
       to work together in our new roles. More importantly I look forward to 
       meeting many ASF Members at the event.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
       The first and most important item to report this month is that Chris
       has been added as a signer to the account and the list of former
       signers has been culled.
       The Treasurer's Office is happy
       to report that Chris now has full access to the account including
       Bill Pay and Direct Pay (or Direct Deposit).  This means better
       service for the EA, our sysadmin contractors, and others b/c now
       both Chris and Sam have the needed access to get things paid and
       on time.
       
       The Treasurer's Office paid an open invoice with Corporation Service
       Company.
       
       Jim reported IRS Notices that we neglected to submit a Form 941 for
       our FY2011 Tax Year. Form 941 corresponds to quarterly tax returns.
       After some research Jim and Chris found out that we can simply
       respond and state that we have no employees and hence there is no
       need to file.  Chris is preparing that response and will send it
       post haste.
       
       Interactions between Sponsorship and the Treasurer's Office remain
       active, with Sam often responding to inquiries from Upayavira
       regarding sponsorship visibility quickly.
       
       Sam Ruby was impromptu contacted by Paypal and he worked with them
       to add himself and Chris to the PayPal account and to remove Chuck
       Murcko. In addition, Sam worked with Paypal to lift the bank transfer
       limit (currently $500/month).
       
       Travel expenses to the GSOC 2013 mentors summit were approved by
       operations@.
       
       Sam and Chris worked with Daniel Gruno to set up his payment
       information now that he has been brought on as a part time
       infrastructure contractor.
       
       Chris is still working with the infrastructure team on the setup
       of the treasurer website. Again this will be new home for docs and
       information on Treasurer Office related policies and procedures,
       and information.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

A normal month for trademarks@, although a bit behind on resolving
questions in the past couple of weeks.

Thanks to Ross for updating various policy documentation to reflect that
trademarks@ now handles all event-based branding approvals.

DLAPiper has been doing plenty of registration and recordation work for
us this month, including recording the change of ownership of various 
donated registered marks in key jurisdictions.

Registration applications have been made for ACTIVEMQ and
SERVICEMIX to replace earlier applications that timed out.

OPENOFFICE application is being updated and re-submitted in Canada, which if
successful would allow us to note that name is registered.

SUBVERSION is being applied for "incontestability", which would ensure
our very clear ownership of the name in the US.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

This month has been very quiet, after the activity of the previous month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

 I. Budget: a handful of OSCON-related charges will be submitted
 towards the end of the month. Otherwise, we are ahead of plan with no
 vendor payments due at this time.

 II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are
 planned. Sally Khudairi has been working with VP Fundraising
 Upayavira to secure an additional Sponsorship renewals at the Silver
 level, and is helping close one new Platinum Sponsor. She continues
 to counsel a few organizations regarding publicity and promotion
 around projects ready to enter the Apache Incubator, as well as for
 podlings under incubation. Discussions with an existing ASF Sponsor
 regarding strategies to market Apache Top-level Projects have gone
 silent over the past month.

 III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
 via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and
 announce@apache.org:

   - 18 June -- The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache(tm)
     Subversion(r) 1.8.0

 IV. Informal Announcements: 2 items were announced on @TheASF Twitter
 feed. No new posts were made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed or
 "TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

 V. Future Announcements: a podling is working with us to prepare for
 graduation from the Incubator, and two TLP announcements are
 currently planned to support major releases. Those PMCs wishing to
 announce major project news —as well as podlings ready to graduate
 from the Incubator— are welcome to contact Sally at press@apache.org
 for more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for
 proper planning and execution.

 VI. Media Relations: the workload has taken a rather sharp turn
 behind the scenes, with activities that included fielding 6 general
 inquiries, reviewing/editing 5 Apache-supporting organizations'
 proposed announcements and press plans, responding to 11 media
 requests, and 6 queries on Foundation background/operational
 information. The ASF received 1,695 press clips over this time
 period, vs. last month's clip count of 428.

 VII. Analyst Relations: Sally connected with three analyst firms, and
 has one formal briefing scheduled to take place the first week of
 August. Apache was mentioned in 6 reports by Gartner, 1 report by
 Forrester, 3 write-ups by GigaOM, and 5 reports by 451 Research.

 VIII. ApacheCon liaison: no activities are planned at this time,
 however, there is still follow-up regarding the recorded videos that
 are still not online.

 IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally has been
 working with Melissa regarding our participation at OSCON 2013, where
 we will be exhibiting in the non-profit pavilion. Melissa is
 overseeing production and logistics for promotional materials, as
 well as assisting with booth tactics where needed. Sally will not be
 able to attend OSCON this year; Martin van den Bemt has kindly
 offered to be there in her stead, and his travel/lodging expenses
 will be covered by the Marketing & Publicity budget. Sally has also
 been working with two events to secure speakers from the Apache
 Hadoop PMC and big data community.

 X. Newswire accounts: we have 14 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
 GlobeNewswire through December 2013, and 17 pre-paid press releases
 on the PRNewswire account through May 2014.

-----------------------------------------

confirmed that the current arrangement for the foundations membership
remains unchanged.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Sam Ruby]

Busy month.

Carry overs from last month:

* Issue 144: (short version of license headers)
  Despite the previously approved license header not having a copyright
  statement, we have a single individual strongly opposed to approving any new
  versions unless a copyright header is included in every source file that
  contains a license header.  A large number of people have expressed
  strong opposition to any requirement for copyright header to be added to
  every source file.  Sadly, I don't see anybody changing their mind on this
  matter, so this will need to proceed to a vote (the first time I recall this
  happening since I took this position)

* Issue 167 (CC-By license)
 
  Barring any additional discussion, this license will be moved from Category
  A to Category B. 

Notable new discussions:

* Our previous agreements for access to various TCKs has expired, and Oracle
  has provided a new agreement.  This new agreement is not consistent with
  the 2002 side-letter we received from Sun:

  http://jakarta.apache.org/site/sideletter.pdf

  This matter was referred to the SFLC, and they provided this feedback on our
  behalf to Oracle.  Oracle has not yet responded.

* I've forwarded on a review the current the ECCN process to the SFLC to 
  see if there needs to be any updates.

* The SFLC is collecting data for a response to the Teradata request made
  to the Hive PMC (see last month's Hive board report for details).

* Whether or not it is permissible to distribute third party binaries which
  are made available under a license that permits distribution but has
  a field of use restriction, a requirement to pay attorney's fees, and
  a requirement to pass on restrictions.

* Similar discussion over shipping in source form third party code that
  fixes a JavaDoc security problem, where the license limited how that
  source could be used.  This request was withdrawn as other, better,
  alternatives were found.

* As the Maven report indicates, the project is currently not complying with
  license header requirements as applied to their test data, but is working on
  building a plan to correct this over time.  Kudos to the Maven PMC for both
  catching this and to committing to build a plan to bring Maven releases into
  compliance.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Deltacloud Project  [Marios S. Andreou]


Apache Deltacloud defines a web service API for interacting with cloud service
providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In
addition, it consists of a number of implementations of this API for the
most popular clouds. It also provides an implementation of DMTF CIMI,
and tools around that API to help make it more easily consumable.

-- Issues for the board's consideration --

The Apache Deltacloud project has until recently been heavily sponsored by
Red Hat, in the form of full time engineers including travel budget and
a streamlined monthly testing and release cycle. Red Hat announced that
this support is being drastically reduced [1] so this is an interesting
period for the project. Furthermore, the project has recently elected a new
PMC chair as David Lutterkort was unable to continue in this position due
to other commitments.

It has been encouraging to see the continued interest with a daily trickle
of activity on the mailing list, irc channel and JIRA since the Red Hat
announcement. The biggest and most immediate impact is the change to the
release cycle - the monthly release cycle is currently unsustainable.
The next release date has not yet been determined though as PMC chair it
is my aim to encourage a release towards the end of the summer or early in Q4 2013.

-- Releases/Development --

1.1.4 - in progress
1.1.3 - 2013-04-22
1.1.2 - 2013-03-13
1.1.1 - 2013-02-13
1.1.0 - 2013-01-15

-- Overall activity in the past quarter --

JIRA: 30 JIRA tickets filed in this quarter by 10 individuals - 8
closed/resolved and work ongoing on some others (needs tidy up).

Commits: 103 individual commits [2] by 10 committers [3] in this quarter

Much work on bug fixes and improving the DMTF CIMI frontend exposed by a
Deltacloud server. Some interest in the OpenStack driver (work ongoing to
change the library used to talk to OpenStack services).

Next week (8-12 July) will see a revival of the Deltacloud community call
[4][5].

-- Last committers and PMC members elected --

Change of PMC chair 29 May 2013
(Marios S. Andreou takes over from David Lutterkort)

Tomas Sedovic (August 2012) and Dies Koper (December 2012) voted in as
committers.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI Extension library 
which contains lots of useful tools and helpers which 
are missing in the CDI core spec.

DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a 
portable Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!
DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like Apache TomEE,
JBoss AS, Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also
on simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

Project Status:
We are now finally done with all Graduation tasks.
We recently added 3 now Extension modules.

Releases:
last release: deltaspike-0.4 on 2013-05-31. 
We are currently working towards deltaspike-0.5.

Community:
New Committer: Thomas Hug (thug) on 2013-06-20
Our first new committer after graduation.

Jim Jagielski batch-resigned as Mentor. 
We still keep him around as silent PMC though ;)

Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Kevan Miller]

Apache Geronimo is an open source server runtime that integrates
the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes
that meet the needs of enterprise developers and system
administrators.

The community has generated multiple releases in the past 3
months. Most significantly, the community released Geronimo
Server 3.0.1. Several initiatives related to Java EE 7 have been
started (both by committers and also some new contributors).

New releases were:

* geronimo-tomcat 7.0.39.1 and 7.0.39.2 (May),
* Geronimo Server 3.0.1 (May),
* xbean 3.14 (June), and
* Geronimo Eclipse Plugin 3.0.1 (June)

The current PMC chair (Kevan Miller) informed the PMC that he
wished to step down as chair of the Geronimo PMC. The community
voted to recommend to the board that Jarek Gawor be appointed as
the new chair of the Geronimo PMC.

No new PMC members. The last new PMC member was added in March,
2013.

No new committers. The last new committer was added in March,
2013.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

There is little to report, as we submitted an off-cycle report in June.
Security discussions on the dev list converge slowly, but consensus is
developing around implementation tasks, if not the precise shape of that work.
Preparation for the 2.1-beta release continues. Contributors continue to
stabilize APIs, iron out incompatibilities with the 1.x codebase, and integrate
with related projects.

When the Hadoop project spun off subprojects a few years ago, the projects
adjusted their committer roles. We'd been ambivalent about finishing that, but
finally did, removing about 11 accounts (none had participated since then).

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Michael Stack]

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database
built on top of Hadoop Common and Hadoop HDFS

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’s ATTENTION

In our last report, we wrote of how the HBase PMC had gotten no
response to petitions requesting that MapR Technologies fix
conflation of Apache HBase with their MapR M7 product ("Making
HBase™ Enterprise Grade").  After a new set of violations were
raised on trademarks@ on May 3rd [1], Shane wrote them on
May 17th[2].  He got a response.  Since this exchange,
there has been a marked change in how they market their MapR
M7 product; now they talk of it as being a "nosql" store.
Offending text remains[3] but is minor relative to what was
there previous.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and codebases
wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

The Incubator expanded to 37 podlings this month.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

    (None)

  People who left the IPMC:

    Davanum Srinivas

  New IPMC Chair:

    Marvin Humphrey, replacing Benson Margulies

* New Podlings

  Four new podlings entered the Incubator:

    MetaModel
    Olingo
    Spark
    Stratos

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

    Apache Mesos
    Apache JSPWiki

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

    Jun 20 Apache Mesos 0.12.0-incubating
    Jun 20 Apache jclouds 1.6.1-incubating
    Jun 22 Apache ODF Toolkit 0.6-incubating
    Jul 02 Apache Curator 2.1.0-incubating

  The availability of IPMC votes for podling releases remains a perennial
  problem and source of discontent.  This month, it took between 4 and 20 days
  from the start of the RC vote on the podling dev list for the third IPMC +1
  vote to be cast.

    Release                             RC VOTE start  Third IMPC +1   Days
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Apache Mesos 0.12.0-incubating      Jun 11         Jun 17          6
    Apache jclouds 1.6.1-incubating     Jun 13         Jun 17          4
    Apache ODF Toolkit 0.6-incubating   May 27         Jun 17          20  
    Apache Curator 2.1.0-incubating     Jun 20         Jun 28          8

* IP Clearance

  Cloudant's donation of BigCouch passed by lazy consensus.

* Miscellaneous

  A schism in the IPMC membership was revealed with regards to whether the
  text of a proposal may be modified while a vote is underway.  It was
  resolved that proposals may not be modified, but opinion remains sharply
  divided.

  Two new draft documentation pages were well received:

  o "What to Expect", an introduction for incoming podling contributors.
  o "Mailing List Options", guidance for requesting mailing lists.
 
  The following topics were discussed on general@incubator but have not yet
  resulted in concrete action:

  o Provisional top-level projects ("pTLP" for short), a less radical offshoot
    of the "Incubator Deconstruction" proposal.
  o The language of the Incubator's IP Clearance template (*not* the software
    grant form, only the checklist) is out of date.
  o A "Poding Bill of Rights" was proposed.  It has not been formally adopted,
    but discussion influenced the subsequently spawned "What to Expect"
    document.
  o A formal ombud position for the Incubator was proposed, and its
    composition and potential responsibilities were discussed.
  o Exit interviews for graduated podlings were proposed.  Debate centered on
    whether responses should/could/must be anonymous.

  An audit by the Chair revealed that autogenerated report reminders sent on
  July 1 failed to make it to the mailing lists of three podlings (Celix,
  Tajo, VXQuery), presumably because the emails did not make it through
  moderation.  Manual reminders were sent on July 3 (after subscribing
  temporarily to the dev lists in question to sidestep moderation).

Celix

Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on
interoperability between Java and C.

Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community
  2. Find more committers
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None.


How has the community developed since the last report?

  Activity on the mailing list is still a bit slow, but there is still
  progress. But more importantly, the Native-OSGi effort has taken a few big
  steps. The most important one is the publication of an RFP at the OSGi
  Alliance[1]. The purpose of this RFP is to standardise OSGi for native (C
  and C++) languages. After the RFP is finalised work will be started on a
  RFC, this will be done in conjunction with writing a reference
  implementation. For this purpose Apache Celix will be used. This also means
  that C++ will be introduced in the Celix project. Most likely large parts of
  C++ code will be donated by 2 participants of the Native-OSGi project. This
  gives us a great opportunity to add extra committers and increase the
  diversity of Celix.

How has the project developed since the last report?
 
  As mentioned above, to be able to write a reference implementation for
  Native-OSGi the scope of Celix will be extended to also include C++. Details
  of this extension still need to be worked out. But for continuity the
  current (C) code base will (for now) remain the same. So any work related to
  Native-OSGi will (for now) be done independently from the current
  implementation.

  Also work is underway to make a second release. Whereas the first release
  focused primarily on the releasing itself, this second release will focus on
  the actual implementation. Important points are:

  * API consistency
  * Win32 support
  * APR usage

  More details can be found in [2]

  A (Mini) Hackathon for Apache Celix was organised at June the 30th. There
  where 4 people present on the hackathon (2 committers) and focus for the
  hackathon was the remote services implementation. The hackathon was received
  well and we like to do this more often to encourage community growth of
  Apache Celix.

  Apache Celix is now also involved the Google Summer of Code for 2013. Erik
  Jansman is doing a project on the Event Admin for Apache Celix and Pepijn
  Noltes is mentoring him. The idea is to discuss the result on the mailing
  list. This is a new experience for Apache Celix and we hope that helps the
  community and also provide technical progress.

Chukwa

Chukwa is a log collection and analysis framework for Apache Hadoop clusters.

Chukwa has been incubating since 2010-07-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Generating an active community
  2. Keep code up-to-date with Hadoop trend
  3. Make another release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  Chukwa code needs to be maintained to keep up with new versions of Hadoop.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Committers are communicating more actively than previous quarter.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  More contributors have open JIRA to request features and experiment with
  code base.  Website is now svnpubsub enabled.  Team member list is updated
  with new committers.  Javadocs are regenerated to remove frame injection
  vulnerability.

Shepherd notes:

  ant: I'm a mentor not sheperd but i'll add some comments here. I think we
  should just graduate Chukwa. They have met all documented Incubator
  requirements, the only reason they're not graduated is that there isn't
  loads of development activity going on. Other low activity podlings have
  graduated before, Wink is a good example, or Steve which didn't even
  incubate. Chukwa has been incubating for 3 years so aren't just some
  fly-by-night thing, the "How has the project developed since the last
  report?" section of this report shows there is work going on, and that they
  fixed the javadoc frame injection security vulnerability shows they do jump
  to it when issues that need to be addressed arise. We're not adding any
  value to the podling by keeping it here in the Incubator, we should graduate
  them, perhaps including the mentors on the PMC if that helps alleviate any
  worries.

--------------------
DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information, images
and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices, e.g.
smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that data, APIs will
also be created to use and manage it.

DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.

There are no issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or the ASF Board need to be
aware of.

Our last report indicated a need to reboot the podling, this has been
successfully done.

Three new committers and PPMC members have been elected since April, and have
been quite active in expanding and improving the podling's code base.

New Java and C# modules have been added and tests are ongoing to validate and
compare the various implementations.

The community stays small but is now regularly active, making a release or two
in the next period should allow DeviceMap to graduate.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make at least one release
  2. Clarify how/where DeviceMap gets its device data. Not strictly required
     to graduate but good for the viability of the project, various options
     are being evaluated.
  3. Graduate - apart from having made a release the podling seems ready for
     that.

Date of last release:

  none yet.

Falcon

Falcon is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop designed for
data motion, coordination of data pipelines, lifecycle management, and data
discovery. Falcon enables end consumers to quickly onboard their data and its
associated processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters.

Falcon has been incubating since 2013-03-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Add new and diverse committers
  2. Build and grow community
  3. Releases at frequent and regular intervals

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  - No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * We had a meetup of Falcon Users along side Hadoop Summit @ San Jose (Jun
    25th 2013)
  * More users have joined the falcon users group and mailing lists

How has the project developed since the last report?

  9 new JIRAs were created since the last report and 5 of them have been
  resolved. We are in the process of preparing for our first release since
  incubation.

Helix

Apache Helix is a generic cluster management framework used to build
distributed systems and provides automatic partition management, fault
tolerance and elasticity.

Helix has been incubating since 2012-10-14.

We feel we are good to graduate, we have had two smooth releases and are
working on next release 0.6.2 soon.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  - NONE

How has the community developed since the last report?

  -- Added 2 committers Shirshanka Das( LinkedIn) and Vinayak Borkar (UC
     Irvine)
  -- Good activity on mailing list.
  -- Increase in adoption of Helix outside of LinkedIn

How has the project developed since the last report?

  -- Released 0.6.1-incubating with lot of new features.
  -- Issues:  54 created, 25 resolved
  -- Next release 0.6.2 will focus of api refactoring without adding major
     features.

Shepherd notes:

  Suresh Marru: The podling is healthy and I echo it seems ready to graduate.
  They have cut few releases, are engaging well with contributors and voted in
  two new committers. Its a small group with activity on the low end but the
  diversity is decent enough and podling seems to be ready for
  self-governance.  If the project decides to graduate, it might be advisable
  for one or two mentors continue through for a little while.

--------------------
jclouds

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API

jclouds has been incubating since 2013-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Garnering additional committers and growing our community
  2. Now that we've been through a first successful release, ensuring that
     subsequent releases progress smoothly and can be handled by multiple
     members of the community
  3. Agreeing upon a new release schedule and roadmap input gathering strategy
     as part of our first major Apache release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  Not at the current time. Feedback on the next release will indicate whether
  the work we've done around license headers is sufficient.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No changes in committer list. Still plenty of activity from existing
  committers as well as submissions from "new faces" across many of the
  different jclouds components.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * A very important milestone: our first Apache release!
  * First meetup as an incubator project coming up:
    http://www.meetup.com/jclouds/events/126378842/

Shepherd notes:

  adc: I think this podling is good to go as far as activity and community
  diversity goes.  It's hard to discover what their real status since they've
  neglected to keep http://incubator.apache.org/projects/jclouds.html up to
  date, but it seems to me that none of the issues listed above are a barrier
  to their graduation.

  It's troubling to see "THE JCLOUDS LOGO IS TRADEMARK OF JCLOUDS, INC." on
  the Apache JClouds incubator home page.  Either the trademark should be
  assigned to the ASF or it should be removed altogether.

--------------------
JSPWiki

Java-based wiki engine

JSPWiki has been incubating since 2007-09-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. IPMC vote (?, currently running)
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  * We currently have open some JIRAs with Infra. Specifically, having
    INFRA-5588 (Ubuntu VM for JSPWiki) solved would be a great +1 in terms of
    community building, and would be a really nice way of entering TLP.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Community graduation vote passed with 16 +1 (http://s.apache.org/uM)
  * There was a call for completing i18n files, which has been fastly addresed
    by community: Chinese, Portuguese, French, Italian, Brazilian and Russian
    language files have been completed completed by community
  * Mail activity has tripled previous quarter at jspwiki-dev,
    2.9.1-incubating release and graduation being responsible of part of the
    increase of this activity. jspwiki-user traffic has decreased a bit,
    though.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Apache JSPWiki 2.9.1-incubating released on May, 15th
  * 8 JIRAs resolved in this period
  * Switch to Maven as build tool almost complete
  * Upgraded some libraries

--------------------
Knox

Knox Gateway is a system that provides a single point of secure access for
Apache Hadoop clusters.

Knox has been incubating since 2013-02-22.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Expand community to include more diverse committers.
  2. Align technically with security work going in in Hadoop.
  3. Clear the project name with legal and pick a new name if required.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  1. None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Voting initiated to invite a new committer to the project.

Marmotta

An Open Platform for Linked Data.

Marmotta has been incubating since 2012-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Ingest code and clear IP.
 2. A release
 3. Build dev and PMC.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  No such issues.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * dev@marmotta.i.a.o continues with high traffic but slightly decreasing:
    Apr. 265, May 161, Jun. 137. We expect the numbers to raise again with the
    preparation of the next release.
  * Two new persons have been elected as new committer and PPMC members:
    Raffaele Palmieri (Eustema Spa) on May 21st, 2013, and Peter Ansell
    (University of Queensland) on Jun 24th, 2013.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * The first release (3.0.0-incubating) has been published on April 24th,
    2013. Since that the project is actively working of different
    improvements, bug fixes and new features, registering 266 issues at jira
    (60% resolved).

  * The next release (3.1.0-incubation) is planned for the upcoming weeks
    (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-marmotta-dev/201307.mbox/%3C51D40104.3060203%40apache.org%3E).

  * The first two most important issues the project targets to move towards
    graduation have been already achieved; and the third one, dev community,
    is being addressed too. Therefore the project has already started to
    discuss about such option
    (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-marmotta-dev/201305.mbox/%3C51A35FFA.2070707%40apache.org%3E).

MetaModel

MetaModel is a data access framework, providing a common interface for
exploration and querying of different types of datastores.

MetaModel has been incubating since 2013-06-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete INFRA setup to move the code to ASF git repository (pending
     INFRA action): https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6404
  2. Redirect MetaModel website to Apache one once available.
  3. Bring more diverse committers and contributors to the project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  NO

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have moved the community discussions to
  dev@metamodel.incubator.apache.org to have more open and engaging
  discussions.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the Incubator accepted MetaModel, there's obviously been a lot of
  attention around the project.

  The tech lead for the project, Kasper, had posted some mentionings on
  TheServerSide.com and is putting the final touches on an article for
  InfoQ.com as well (expected published later this week).

  The base code has cut another release
  (http://eobjects.org/trac/query?milestone=MetaModel+3.4.4)

  We are still waiting for INFRA work
  (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6404) to move the code to ASF
  git repo.

MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop and Hama.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete the first release
     a) Ensure proper transfer of code
     b) Verify distribution rights
  2. Use maven as our project management tool

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  none

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No new PPMC members or committers added since last report, We are still
  working on our first release. We believe that, as soon as we make the first
  release available, many users will start using the system and will become
  new contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have sent a request to trademarks@apache.org to review and verify our
  searches that establish that "Apache MRQL" is a suitable name.  More
  specifically, our US and EU trademark searches, and a Google search, show
  that the project name MRQL does not conflict with a previously registered
  trademark.  We are now in the process of completing the MRQL codebase to
  make it ready for the first release. There are two component missing that
  delay this release: switching to maven as our project management tool and
  verifying copyright information.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community, especially attracting new developers.
  2. Hold an informal graduation readiness vote

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware

Open Climate Workbench

Apache Open Climate Workbench (Incubating) is an effort to develop software
that performs climate model evaluation using model outputs from a variety of
different sources (the Earth System Grid Federation, the Coordinated Regional
Downscaling Experiment, the U.S. National Climate Assessment and the North
American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program) and temporal/spatial
scales with remote sensing data from NASA, NOAA and other agencies. The
toolkit includes capabilities for regridding, metrics computation and
visualization.

Open Climate Workbench has been incubating since 2013-02-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop an Apache community for Open Climate Workbench and connect to
     other relevant Apache efforts (Tika, Hadoop, SIS, OODT)
  2. Make an initial release.
  3. Add new contributors to the project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Apache Open Climate Workbench elected its first new committer and PPMC
  member, Alex Goodman, in the past month.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Cameron Goodale is working to push the 0.1-incubating release out the door
    (currently on RC #4, with #5 coming soon)
  * Tons of development going on (already up to nearly 200 JIRA issues;
    ReviewBoard actively being used)
  * The UI is receiving the most work in particular by Michael Joyce and
    Shakeh Khudikyan.
  * Kyo Lee and Alex Goodman and Kim Whitehall and Jinwon Kim are working on
    the metrics module.

Shepherd notes:

  adc: The missing report is in line with this project's weakness, filling out
  paperwork.  ;)  The podling status page
  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/climate.html needs to be filled out.

  With that said, the project seems pretty active with more than one developer
  doing the heavy lifting.

  Again, it would be good to fill out the status page so we can see where
  they're at since they may be good candidates for graduation soon.

Spark

Spark is an open source system for fast and flexible large-scale data
analysis. Spark provides a general purpose runtime that supports low-latency
execution in several forms.

Spark has been incubating since 2013-06-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finish bringing up infrastructure on Apache (JIRA, "user" mailing list,
     SVN repo for website)
  2. Migrate mailing lists and development to Apache
  3. Make a Spark 0.8 under the Apache Incubator

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  While most of our infrastructure is now up, it has taken a while to get a
  JIRA, a SVN repo for our website (so we can use the CMS), and a
  user@spark.incubator.apache.org mailing list (so we can move our existing
  user list, which is large).

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We only entered the Apache Incubator at the end of June, but in the existing
  developer community keeps expanding and we are seeing many new features from
  new contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  In terms of the Apache incubation process, we filed our IP papers and got a
  decent part of the infrastructure set up (Git, dev list, wiki, Jenkins
  group).

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]
 
Apache Isis is a framework to enable the creation of software using
domain-driven design principles, being an implementation of the naked
objects architectural pattern


== Community ==

Mailing list activity has been steady; user mailing list subscriptions are
increasing month-on-month (albeit slowly).

In the previous report (April 2013) we reported on a substantial new third-
party component being developed.  Directly following from this, the Isis
PMC voted in Maurizio Taverna as a new committer [1], on 26 Apr 2013.


== Activity ==

Apache Isis is taking part in the Google Summer of Code [2].  We have
accepted two students [3], [4], both working, respectively, on new viewers
for Isis [5], [6].  The students are being mentored by Dan Haywood and by
Maurizio Taverna.

An introductory article on Apache Isis was published in Jun 2013 in the
Methods & Tools online magazine [7].

Presentations on Apache Isis have been accepted for the Oredev conference
in Oslo in Nov 2013 [8], and at the inaugural MedIT Symposium conference
in Sicily in Oct 2013 [9].


== Releases ==

On 31 May 2013 we made a further release of Isis [xxx].  This consisted of
our core module, 5 components, and 1 archetype:

- Apache Isis Core version 1.2.0
- Wicket Viewer 1.2.0
- Restful Objects Viewer 2.0.0
- JDO Object Store 1.1.0
- Shiro Security 1.1.1
- File Security 1.0.1
- Quickstart Archetype 1.0.3

We expect to put out a further release in the next quarter.


== Project Branding ==

Compliant as of previous report; no changes.


== Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache James Project  [Eric Charles]

The Apache James Project delivers a rich set of open source modules and
libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which build into an
advanced enterprise mail server.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASES

No new release. The lastest release has been done on 19 March 2013.

OVERALL ACTIVITY

Although this period has been quiet on new development, we have
fixed a long standing blocking bug (deadlock).

The activity on the mailing list has mainly been answering to the
user questions.

We are now ready to release the different subprojects to rollout
the first 3.0 final version after the beta ones.

COMMUNITY

A new committer (Andrzej Rusin, andrzej) has been voted.

There is no new PMC member (last was on 17 Jul 2012) voted.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

== Project Description

Apache Jena is a Java framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data
applications based on W3C and community standards.

== Issues

There are no issues to raise with the board.

== Releases

Jena 2.10.1 released on 2013-05-15
Jena SDB 1.3.6 released on 2013-05-30

== PMC

Committer/PMC last added: Jan 2013

== Activity

dev@ list:     150-200 messages a month
users@ list:   200-300 messages a month

== Community news

1/ Jena has a GSoC project just getting under way, hoping to add spatial
query to the RDF query language, SPARQL.

2/ There has been a contribution of website redesign which is gathering a
lot of support.

3/ The developer community is dealing with one module, SDB (RDF query over
SQL databases), that has up to now been released sporadically and
separately.

The last release managed to get the necessary 3 +1's but the module
receives very little in the way of contributions from the whole community.
The committers (who don't use it) have kept it working as the main codebase
changes.

The current plan is to include in the main release on a maintenance basis
on the understanding that any architectural changes to the main system may
cause it to be dropped unless active contributors emerge.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

The Apache JMeter desktop application is a pure Java application
designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

JMeter 2.9 was released on Jan 28 2013

Work continues on fixing bugs and making improvements which will
feed into the next release which due shortly.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
the committers.

There have been no committers added since October 2011, when Philippe
Mouawad was added.

There have been no changes to the PMC since it was established in October 2011.

There are no board level issues at this time

-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in 
C# and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

The board should be aware that while our mailing list is somewhat active - 
we still answer and help the community, our development has stalled. Recently, 
we have tried to reinvigorate the discussion, it's too early to tell how much 
momentum we can gain and maintain.
 
Since last months (late report), not much progress has been made.

== Releases ==

None recently. One of the members of our community has started a 4.3 port, and 
we're hoping to take that up and get that moving. 

== Statistics ==

Nuget package downloads:
Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 20032
Lucene.Net Contrib 3.0.3: 6839
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial:  905
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial.NTS: 296

-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Nick Wellnhofer]

The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for dynamic
programming languages. It is a "loose" C port of the Apache Lucene search
engine library for Java.

ISSUES

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

RELEASES

No releases in the last quarter. The latest release is version 0.3.2 from
10 Jul 2012.

We're working towards a new major release featuring C bindings, support for
compiled extensions, and Clownfish as a separate product. Clownfish is the
object system which Lucy is based on.

ACTIVITY

Development

    * The C bindings are finished. Only the documentation needs some work.
    * Support for compiled extensions written in C was improved.
    * The code base of Clownfish was isolated from Lucy so it can be released
      as a separate product.
    * There's ongoing work to make Clownfish modules ABI-compatible if
      methods or instance variables are added or reordered.

Mailing lists

Judging by the number of messages, participation in the developer mailing
list has increased from last quarter and is only slightly below the long-term
average. Traffic on the user list was low but all questions were answered.

COMMITTER/PMC CHANGES

No new committers in the last quarter. The last addition was on 15 Feb 2013.

No new PMC members in the last quarter and since Lucy graduated from the
incubator in March 2012.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Jake Mannix]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Olivier Lamy]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build
lifecycle.

* General Information

  Olivier Lamy resigned as PMC Chair.
  Stephen Connolly has been elected by the PMC to act as PMC Chair.

  There have been a number of discussions on the project mailing lists with regard to the foundations
  requirements for releases and the exact content of source release zip files. The areas of concern to
  the Maven project are:

    * Ensuring that all releases have a corresponding source release zip in the dist area

    * Ensuring that the NOTICE and LICENSE files in source release zip files are correct
      (a number of small typographic errors have been identified in some files and are in the process
      of being corrected)

    * Ensuring that the appropriate compliance with the foundations requirements on source headers
      has been achieved. The majority of issues in this regard is with "test resources", these are
      data files which are used as resources for the integration tests used when releasing Maven and
      Maven plugins.

      There is the potential that some very small fraction of tests will only identify
      the bugs they are designed to catch if there is no header comment in the file. Adding headers
      to these test resources runs the risk of invalidating the test suite, so the current position
      of the PMC is as follows:

        - No releases will be permitted by the PMC where source files are violating the foundation
          policy on license headers.
        - A temporary exception will be made for legacy test resources, i.e. those test resources which
          were encorporated in previous releases of the component
        - An exception will otherwise be allowed for test resources where it can be clearly shown that
          the test cannot function correctly when the test resource includes a license header.
        - New test resources will only be excempt in those cases where it can be clearly shown
          that the license header is interferring with the sensitivity of the test.

      Once we have identified the scope of the issue, we intend to see whether we need to put a
      plan in place to resolve the issue, or whether it is an issue that can be resolved relatively
      quickly.

  We are currently working on a tool to have a list of missing sources release zip in dist area and
  setting up additional tooling to have a list of files with missing license header.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Julien Nioche]

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler 
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene™, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop 
datastructures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

We have done 3 releases since the previous board report:
* Nutch 1.7 : release for the trunk branch
* Nutch 2.2 : release for the 2.x branch
* Nutch 2.2.1 : minor release to include an important bug fix (NUTCH-1591) 

These releases contain numerous bugfixes and improvements, notably the 
upgrades of various Apache-related dependencies (Hadoop, Tika) and the 
addition of NUTCH-1047 in the 1.x branch which allows to plug new indexers.

COMMUNITY

The traffic on the user and dev mailing lists has kept a relatively high
level in the last quarter.  Our user@ list in June had the highest traffic 
since July 2011. We are also getting contributions and bugfixes from 
new users.

It has been announced during the BerlinBuzzwords conference that the 
CommonCrawl project [http://commoncrawl.org/] are now using Apache Nutch 
for their future crawls.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Tammo van Lessen]

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes 
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services, 
sending and receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error 
recovery as described by your process definition. It supports both long 
and short living process executions to orchestrate all the services that 
are part of your application. 

STATUS 
This was a rather quiet development period, but we found some 
time to discuss several issues we want to address for the next release, 
which delayed the 1.3.6 release again. We still have some development 
items on our agenda, e.g. the OModel refactoring, backporting features 
from our experimental branch. An ODE 1.3.6 release is still planned and 
in the works. 

RELEASE
No release to report in this quarter. 

DEVELOPMENT
Some patches have been applied to trunk and the upcoming 
1.3.6 release branch. We identified some issues with the current TX 
manager configuration which we plan to fix for the next release. We're 
also planning to upgrade the Axis IL to Axis 1.6.x and look into 
clustering support for ODE. 

COMMUNITY 
Our new committers Sathwik Bantwal Premakumar and Hadrian 
Zbarcea committed some nice bugfixes and have been voted into the PMC. 
Alan D. Cabrera has resigned from the PMC.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Onami Project  [Simone Tripodi]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Onami is a project focused on the development and maintenance
of a set of Google Guice extensions not provided out of the box by the
library itself nor the Google developers team, such as integration
with 3rd part frameworks or extra functionalities.

MILESTONES

Since last report, there have been three new releases:

 * Apache Onami Validation 1.0.0 - Release Date: 06/Jun/13

 * Apache Onami-Configuration 6.3.0 - Release Date: 10/Jun/13

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Development activity is quite healthy, two new proposals for developing
Onami-Persist and Onami CLI-bootstrapper have been accepted.

COMMUNITY

PMC composition has not changed since graduation.
Stephan Classen is a new Onami Committer since 22/Jun/13.
Users community is quite silent, it still happens that people write

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache OpenMeetings Project  [Sebastian Wagner]

Apache OpenMeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white
board, collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using
API functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.

== Releases ==

A maintenance release of the 2.1 tree has been released: Version 2.1.1
25 issues have been resolved, main focus of the fixes has been bug fixes and
maintenance.

== Activity ==

There is constant activity in mailing list, jira and commits.
The main focus since the last report have been:
- Release 2.1.1 (finding consens around appropriate Release Notes was one
  obstacle)
- Development of version 3.0 (HTML5 version) of OpenMeetings
- GSoC project (whiteboard)

== Community ==

There is a constant stream of new users, users that become developers and
developers that become PMCs.
There was one new PMC member voted:
 * Yuliya Algaer (at 25th of April)

Current community statistics:
 - 21 PMC members
 - 112 subscribers to dev list
 - 247 subscribers to user list
 - 697 issues in Jira in total, (532 of them are closed)
All data based on Incubation start date at: 12-2011

== Infrastructure ==

There has been a discussion ongoing about having a basic demo server at the
Apache infrastructure as relying on private or corporate sponsored resources
is not as good as having a community owned server/hardware. However the steps
to complete that process might take weeks/months.

== Board ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

Issues for Board Awareness
---------------------------

OpenOffice, like the ASF as a whole, is hit by the announced policy
change of Apache Extras. The project currently stores several libraries
there, in an area known as ooo-extras, and the build process downloads
them when options like --enable-category-b are used. A solution should
be found at the ASF level.

Community Development/Outreach Progress
---------------------------------------

The project added 4 committers (May: dwhytock, akerbeltz, vkadal;
July: pmralbuquerque) and one new PMC member (April: jani) since our
last report in April.

These new committers are primarily involved in the translation efforts
to incorporate additional native language capability into Apache
OpenOffice. Our new PMC member has many years of experience in open
source, and is assisting in administration of our LAMP servers.

A new documentation effort for an end-users manual under the ALv2
licence was started on the OpenOffice Wiki and is progressing well.

OpenOffice is participating in the Google Summer of Code program for
the first time after several years.

Community support forums remain popular with users. The mailing lists
for user support, localization, QA and marketing are quite active. As
Apache OpenOffice is a client product, we continue to investigate ways
to direct users to appropriate support venues. The developer list,
ooo-dev, remains very active.

Product/Project Development Progress
------------------------------------

We will be releasing Apache OpenOffice 4.0 in July, likely the week
of July 15.

This release will feature a new, more modern, user interface, a
reworked directory layout to simplify development and installation,
code updates to allow building on newer platforms and (at least) 23
languages.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache PDFBox Project  [Andreas Lehmkühler]

The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF
documents.

General Comments
----------------

There are no issues that require Board attention.

Community
---------

There is a steady stream of contributions and bug reports from the community.

After adding Maruan Sahyoun and Thomas Chojecki to our ranks in the last
quarter there weren't any changes this time.

364 subscribers on the user@ list
156 subscribers on the dev@ list

Releases
--------

Version 1.8.2 was released on 2th of june 2013

1.8.2 is an incremental bugfix release based on PDFBox 1.8.x.

Development:
------------

We are now using the Apache CMS for our website. Thanks to Maruan Sahyoun
and Joe Schaefer the migration went smooth without any issues.

A discussion about a new major release of PDFBox just started. We already
gathered a lot of ideas of possible changes, such as

- switch to java 1.6
- modularization
- replace/enhance the parser
- refactor the underlying COS model
- update dependencies including possible api-changes, e.g. bouncy castle
- code cleanup 
- ...

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Portals Project  [David Sean Taylor]

Apache Portals is a project for building freely available and interoperable
portal software. With the Pluto project, we provide a reference
implementation for the Java portlet standard. The Jetspeed project is a full
feature enterprise open source portal. The Portals Applications project is
dedicated to providing robust, full-featured, commercial-quality, and freely
available portlet applications.

Releases

None is this quarter.

March 6, 2013 - Portals Apps Web Content 1.3
October 10, 2011 - Portals Jetspeed 2.2.2
26 September 2011 - Portals Pluto 2.0.3

Committer/PMC

No new members added this year.

Security updates:

None

Community update

The Jetspeed User list has had a small amount of traffic. The sub-project
Portals Apps, and in particular the Web Content code, has had discussions and
commit activity this month. Last month a roadmap was submitted to the
Jetspeed mailing list. Work has started, but no commits yets. Several
developers are working on a project to upgrade the new release of Jetspeed to
Java generics support. Sub-project Apache Pluto has had no mailing list
activity this quarter. While the lack of activity is concerning, I expect
discussions to pick up with increased commit activity and possible releases
this coming quarter.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Gert Vanthienen]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status:

While we continue to have decent community activity, we also have lost
a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community:

No changes since last report.  The last addition to the PMC dates back
to September 2009.  The last committer was added in November 2011.

Community Objectives:

Since our last board report, we have finished the 4.5.1 release and we
are continuing to work on both a 4.5.2 and 5.0.0 release at the moment.

It was raised on the dev@ list that we can no longer publish release
artifacts larger than 200 MB without intervention from infra@.  Since
some of our assemblies are larger than that, we pinged infra@ to figure
out how to get that addressed for doing these next 2 releases.

Branding Status:

Since our last board report, we have found a volunteer to add the TM
to our logo. The new logo is now being used on the website.

Releases:

- Apache ServiceMix 4.5.1 in March
- A set of 35 OSGi bundles in April
- Another set of 20 OSGi bundles in April
- A set of 24 OSGi bundles in May
- A set of 23 OSGi bundles in July

A series of severe security issues popped up in the last quarter,
including one zero-day exploit. All involved Struts developers along
with the reporters of said issues did a great job regarding analysis,
resolving and releasing in a timely manner.

Our security team has received a new vulnerability report of high
severity. We have prepared a patch and we are ready to release. We have
to coordinate our actions with a company co-reporting the issue, since
some of their products are affected.

In the last quarter we saw slightly increased community activity on the
mailing lists and issue tracker along with again rather high development
activity.

Within this reporting period we added Christian Grobmeier (grobmeier -
2013-05-11) to the PMC. Bruce Phillips (bphillips - 2013-06-24) was
added as a new committer.

A group of Struts PMC members is currently preparing an open Struts
hackathon in Augsburg, Germany, in cooperation with the local Java User
Group [1]. The two-day event will start on 2013-09-06 with currently
four Struts PMC members having confirmed their participation.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the board's attention.


Community
=========

No new committers or PMC members  were added since last report, we're still
at 33 currently active committers. Our primary mailing lists are seeing
small but steady increase, and normal activity:

    users@   - 344 subscribers (up 4.5% since last report)
    dev@     - 236 subscribers (up 2% since last report)


In Jira, 167 new tickets were created, and 150 were resolved or closed since
the last board report. 292 changes were committed to our git repository from
23 contributors.

Participation from community members on our official Blog site and Twitter
account is good, but this is still an area that needs more work. We're to
the point where we need to evangelize the project and software to attract
more contributors, to continue innovation and improve code stability.


Events
======

Comcast made an interesting presentation at the CDN Summit in New York,
showing how they built their next generation CDN on Apache Traffic Server.

At Velocity, LinkedIn presented their entire content management and delivery
tools stack, based on Apache Traffic Server and plugins. They also announced
their PageSpeed plugin, which they will release to the ASF and the Apache
Traffic Server project soon.

A BarCamp is planned for July 9-10th in Denver. More details are available
at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/BarCamp+Denver+2013 .

We are also contemplating either hosting or participating in a BarCamp in
China this year. This is an area where there is a lot of potential growth
for our community, and we already have many active contributors and
committers in the area.


Releases
========

Two developer releases were prepared:

    Apache Traffic Server v3.3.2
    Apache Traffic Server v3.3.4


Our last stable release was v3.2.4, released on January 25. Our hope is that
the next major release, v3.4.0, should be ready by the end of July. This is
later than expected, we're currently 4-6 weeks behind schedule. A v3.2.5
stable release is also imminent.
