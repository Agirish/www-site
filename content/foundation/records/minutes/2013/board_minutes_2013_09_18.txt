 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Last month's experiment to reach out to PMCs with comments on their
       reports the day before the meeting had moderately successful results.
       Many responded or amended their reports before the meeting, or soon
       after. It seems worthwhile pursuing more tools to ensure PMC chairs
       are aware of comments as they come in.

       We seem to have a higher than usual number of PMCs missing reports
       this month, which hopefully is an anomaly.

       Marvin Humphrey has edited the PMC documentation related to adding a
       new member to the PMC, allowing the chair to optionally run the
       notice and vote period simultaneously.

       Thanks to Doug and Cloudera for organising continued access to a
       conference bridge for the board calls.

    B. President [Ross]

       EVP, EA and myself have started having short weekly meetings to
       coordinate our activities.

       Melissa has reminded me that I have failed to renew her contract.
       This is unacceptable and will be addressed within the week.

       Melissa, as EA, has started to work with VP Fundraising to identify
       activities the EA can undertake to support the VP. Melissa will
       document these activities as they are defined.

       ApacheCon
       ---------

       After various discussions between myself EA and EVP
       together with consultations with a number of event producers we
       propose to invite the Linux Foundation to make a formal
       proposal to run (and underwrite) the next ApacheCon (an informal 
       proposal has already been provided). The estimated timescale is 
       as follows:

         - End of Week 1 Oct - feedback on intiial proposal
         - End of Oct - revised proposal from Linux Foundation
         - End of Nov - contracts signed

       Event in a Box
       --------------

       This is an old ConCom idea that we are revisiting. The intention
       is to provide a lightweight process to support community members
       who wish to organise comunity focussed Apache related events. 
       There are few details and no timescale as yet.

       Trademarks
       ----------

       Shane has added Christian Grobmeier and David Nalley to the Trademarks
       Committee in recognition of their helpful and thoughtful trademarks@ 
       work.

       Fundraising
       -----------

       There continues to be a problem with submitting an Invoice to Microsoft
       for their sponsorship. I am looking into this in my day job role,
       although the problem appears to be one of lost credentials on the part
       of VP Fundraising. 
  
       Infrastructure
       --------------

       A contentious issue relating to a data removal request has
       resulted in the Infrastructure team considering a change to
       existing policy. Current thinking is that the policy should not
       be changed significantly, but a clarification of when
       exceptions will be granted. A full report is available in
       Attachement 5.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       The biggest ticket items are the filing of form 8688 for an IRS tax
       extension for FY2012 taxes which gives us until December 15, 2013
       to file.  We are currently looking for a CPA to take over filing
       the taxes.

       Our PayPal account contributions are on hold while Sam investigates
       an account update issue. Sam is working on this, with support from
       Chris.

       Director's & Officer's Liability insurance has been renewed, in
       coordination with the Prezo and EVP. Payments for the renewal have
       been processed by the Treasurer's Office.

       Processed a payment in coordination with infra for new Dell hardware.

       Set Melissa and Joe up with Direct Pay and will test it for this
       month.

       The Brazilian law firm that filed the SVN trademark continues to
       contact the ASF regarding a payment that was confirmed to be sent
       by the Treasurer's Office per WFS records -- but that can't seem
       to be tracked down on the law firm's end. The President has agreed
       to take the lead in replying on this, with support from the Treasurer's
       Office as needed.

       The EA passed along another request by someone in the EU asking to
       make EU donations and contributions easier.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       August was another busy month with over 80 documents received:
       72 iclas, nine cclas, and three grants were received and filed.

       A small number of documents, six percent or so, need special handling:
       non-standard form, duplicate of a previous document, missing digital
       signature, illegible name or email, etc. These issues are usually
       resolved within a few days.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Due to a very serious personal issue, I had to focus my activities and
life around handling that situation for a couple of weeks in the past
reporting month.  Unfortunately; with that being said, my activity and
production level was lower than normal.  I thank you greatly for your
patience and understanding during this difficult period.

  * Daily monitoring of all email activity and following-up with
    appropriate personnel
  * Continued work with Upayavira re fundraising
  * Working with Chris to secure estimates for outsourcing the taxes
    to a CPA
  * Working with Ross and Rich to setup weekly calls
  * Contract renewal is still not completed; awaiting contract from
    Ross
  * ApacheCon NA 2013 videos: Rich has been working on this.  He was
    able to reduce a 17G movie file to a more reasonable 250M range
    and put it on his YouTube account.  More work is needed before it
    can be put up on the ASF’s YouTube account, I believe.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

No board-level issues.

Trademarks@ continues to run at a moderate pace; hopefully with my return
from summer leave we will be able to improve this.

Ross (+1!) has stepped in to push on improved guidelines for approving use of
Apache project brands in events, documenting a basic process for pushing as
much of the evaluation and approval process out to PMCs as is practical. This
will be part of a larger effort to push more work out to PMCs.

The first step will be to work with the Trademarks Committee to ensure we have
a more detailed policies and very clear procedures for evaluating and
approving brand-related requests of various kinds.  We need to ensure that
PMC members have sufficient information to understand enough of the larger
issues around branding and trademarks to make informed decisions about
specific kinds of requests that can be raised to trademarks@ for a NAK
process similar to PMC changes.  This will be a long term effort, both
in documenting as well as in ensuring PMCs are informed.

I am naming Christian Grobmeier and David Nalley to the Trademarks
Committee in recognition of their helpful and thoughtful trademarks@ work.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

Fundraising continues to be very slow (too slow), but we have started the
process of transferring some tasks to Melissa. This will continue over the
coming month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain on schedule, with no vendor payments due at this time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned. Sally
Khudairi worked with FUB on their press release announcing their server
hosting/bandwidth donation.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org:

 - 4 September: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™ Cassandra™
   v2.0

IV. Informal Announcements: 1 item was announced on @TheASF Twitter feed. No
new posts were made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed or "TheApacheFoundation"
account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: Sally has been coaching several podlings regarding the
project promotion process, both during incubation as well as TLP/milestone
announcements. Those PMCs wishing to announce major project news —as well as
podlings ready to graduate from the Incubator— are welcome to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks'
notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 18 media requests, and 3 queries on
Foundation background/operational/process information. The ASF received 625
press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count of 845.

VII. Analyst Relations: the Autumn briefing schedule is set, and we've kicked
off formal analyst outreach. Whilst we've had several informal interactions
with top-tier analysts, no formal briefings have taken place since 5 August.
Apache was mentioned in 19 reports by Gartner, 2 write-ups by GigaOM, 6 reports
by Yankee Group, 1 forecast by IDC, and 4 reports by 451 Research.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: no activities are planned at this time. Melissa
Warnkin continues to follow-up on the recorded videos from ApacheCon 2013/PDX
(February 2013) that are still not online.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally continues to work
with several event producers to secure Apache participation at various Cloud,
big data, security, and mobile-focused conferences.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 11 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through December 2013, 17 pre-paid press releases on the
PRNewswire account through May 2014, and have just received donation of free
press release distribution by UK-based service Pressat, which we have begun to
use with the 4 September announcement.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

Discussed recent scaling issues with roller and made
appropriate adjustments to the install.

Discussed picking up an SSL cert for openoffice.org.

Dealt with disk issues in the Y! build farm.

Dealt with high CPU consumption on the moin wiki.

Dealt with a vulnerability on the analysis VM.

Dealt with disk performance issues on erebus (VMware).

Discussed creating a dedicated database server again.

Dealt with a wide brute force password guessing attempt
against our LDAP database.  About 800 users were impacted,
none of them apparently had their passwords guessed.

Replaced a bad disk in hermes (mail).

Setup an organizational account with Apple to allow devs
to put their wares in the App Store.  Cordova will be the
first guinea pig.

Ordered some new Dell gear for slated for replacements of
existing hosts.  Trying a new supplier largely for cost
savings.

Trying unsuccessfully to get our free VSphere license
updated.

A contributor inadvertently included customer data in two bugzilla
attachments, and politely requested that it be removed.  This request
was initially denied based on a careful reading of the current policy.
Subsequently, the author of that policy described his intent, the
contributor provided more information as to what they were requesting
to be removed and why, and as a result, the request was implemented.
The infrastructure team plans to revisit whether or not the policy
needs to be updated.

As to the potential policy change, there is a saying in legal circles
that "Hard cases make bad laws"[1] -- as well as a saying that "Bad
law makes hard cases"[2].  To some extent, both apply here.  The
overwhelming majority of requests for deletions are for people who
want something removed from a mailing list that is widely archived and
mirrored.  Often these requests come in after a considerable period of
time has elapsed.  For these reasons, it probably is best that the
documented policy continues to set the expectations that most requests
will be denied -- and further I believe that we should be open to
granting exceptions whenever possible.

Reflecting on (a) the low frequency with which exceptions will be
granted, (b) the amount of effort it took to resolve this, perhaps the
simplest thing that could possibly work would be an addition of a
statement like the following:

Exceptions are only granted by the VP of Infrastructure; request for
removal of items that have already been widely mirrored outside of the
ASFs control are unlikely to receive serious consideration.

Attachment B: Report from the Apache APR Project  [Jeff Trawick]

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
since 2007.

Releases
--------
APR 1.4.8 was released on June 21, 2013.  The previous stable
APR-util release was in April of 2013.

The most recent release of the legacy APR 0.9.x branch was in
September of 2011.  The most recent release of the legacy
APR-util 0.9.x branch was in October of 2010.  Both of these
legacy branches were used primarily by Apache HTTP Server 2.0 (retired),
so additional releases of these branches are unlikely.

Community
---------

New PMC members: none
The last new PMC member was added in November of 2011.

New committers: none
The last new committer was added in March of 2013.

About 12 bugs were opened during the reporting period, with some
sort of developer followup (closure or discussion) on 5 bugs.

Mailing list activity has been modest this quarter, dominated by
a couple of Windows-specific issues.

Development
-----------
Activity has been low overall.

Issues
------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache Archiva Project  [Maria Odea Ching]

Apache Archiva is an extensible repository management software that helps
taking care of your own personal or enterprise-wide build artifact
repository. It is the perfect companion for build tools such as Maven,
Continuum, and ANT.

Releases
--------

* Last release was on 1 June 2013 (Archiva 1.4-M4)

Community
---------

We have not added any committers or PMC members recently, with the last
addition for both groups on 14 Sep 2012.

More activity in the users and dev lists since the 1.4-M3 and 1.4-M4
milestone releases previewing the new webapp UI based on javascript.

Development
-----------

Due to a lot of major changes in the recent 1.4 milestone releases, it
has been decided to release it as 2.0.0 instead of 1.4 final. Target
release date is end of the 3rd quarter or early 4th quarter of this year.

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================
Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.

Issues
======

There are no issues that we believe currently require the board's attention.

Releases
========

There have been two releases over the last three months. The last releases
were:

* apache-bloodhound-0.6 (16th July 2013)
* apache-bloodhound-0.7 (23rd August 2013)

Community & Development
=======================

No new committee members have been added this quarter. The last addition to
the committee was on 10th April 2013.

Bloodhound continues to be involved with GSoC with one of the three projects
passing the mid term review. As mentioned in the June 2013 report to the
board, all the students were granted access to the Bloodhound repositories.
Although it is disappointing to see two of the projects fail, the committee
has left the associated students with committer access and have encouraged
these students to continue if they wish. This is not expected to have any
impact on their ability to join the committee in the future.

Bloodhound is also involved in the ASF-ICFOSS mentoring scheme where we have
one student. As for the GSoC scheme, we have granted this student commit
access.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]

Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools.

At the time of the last report, we were undergoing voting for the release of
Buildr 1.4.12, which ultimately happened last May 4th.

Development activity since May has been moderate, with 33 commits including a
few bug fixes, dependency updates, better support for Ruby 2.0 and updates to
our build/test scripts. The mailing lists remain relatively quiet.

Our last committer addition dates back to October 2010. Our last PMC addition
dates back to September 2010. Our discussion/vote to add Peter Donald (our most
active committer in the past 2 years) to our PMC stalled back in May. This is my
responsibility; I will resume the discussion and request another vote that
hopefully will conclude with more participation.

We have no issues that require board attention.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matt Benson]

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
the foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases.

### Activity ###
Java Bean Validation v1.1 has been implemented in a branch that successfully
passes the TCK. Previous reports have mentioned that BVal awaited the
availability of the new Commons [weaver] component, which is mostly baked
and should have been released by the time that PMC reports again in
December. The PMC must next determine a strategy to finalize its 1.0 API
and merge this work with that having been done on the 1.1 branch to release
both codebases.

Mailing list traffic continues to be minimal.

### Community  ###
A new committer, Romain Manni-Bucau, has been welcomed to the BVal roster.
Romain is the driving force behind the implementation of spec v1.1.

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in Java,
Python, PHP, .NET, and Objective-C (and possibly other languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.


== Project status ==

The OpenCMIS (Java) subproject released version 0.10.0.
It is now preparing a 1.0 release, which doesn't add any new features,
but provides better documentation, better test coverage, and
cleaner code.

The ObjectiveCMIS (Objective-C) subproject released version 0.2
after the code refactoring in the last quarter.

There is not much activity around the other subprojects at the moment
except for bug fixing.

There is steady traffic on the mailing list and on JIRA.

There are no Board-level issues at this time.


== Community ==

No community changes this quarter.


== Releases ==

Releases this quarter:
OpenCMIS 0.10.0    2013-08-15
ObjectiveCMIS 0.2  2013-07-30

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Click Project  [Malcolm Edgar]

The development of the Apache Click project has effectively stalled as the
two primary committers are unable to dedicate the time to maintain or
progress the project.

I recommend that the project is moved to the Attic.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Chip Childers]

DESCRIPTION

Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage
large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly
scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform.

ISSUES

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* The community continues to work on new features, continued architectural
  improvements and bug fixes. Most focus has been on our 4.2.0 release.

* Due to the high volume of emails on both dev@ and users@, Daan (dahn) has
  been providing the dev@ list with a responsiveness report listing questions
  that are unanswered (helping get them answered).

* The community participated actively in the CloudStack Collaboration Conference
  in Santa Clara in June. A second collaboration conference is scheduled for Nov
  in Amsterdam (this has been shared with trademarks@), and the planning includes
  many PMC members, committers and community members.

* Our community goal of having "time-based" feature releases continues to be
  challenging, due to the level of testing required to ensure that we are not
  introducing regressions into the software. Automated testing has continued to
  improve, but the community is also discussing how infrastructure changes could
  help manage the code quality with such a high rate of change.

* We have broken out our CLI tool, CloudMonkey, from the main CloudStack git
  repository, and will be working toward independent releases of that software.

* We are discussing breaking the product's documentation out into it's own
  repository, as well as potentially changing the format of the documentation
  source as a potential way to reduce the learning curve for new documentation
  contributors.

RELEASES
* 4.1.1 was released on August 6, 2013.
* 4.2.0 has passed the vote, and will be announced shortly.

COMMUNITY

Including the following additions, CloudStack has 74 committers and 23 PMC members.

New Committers:
* Jayapal Reddy Uradi (jayapal)
* Mike Tutkowski (mtutkowski)
* Toshiaki Hatano (haeena)
* Kirk Kosinski (kirk)
* Venkata Siva Vijayendra Bhamidipati (vijayendrabvs)
* Dave Cahill (dcahill)
* Daan Hoogland (dahn)
* Ian Duffy (duffy)

New PMC Members:
* Ilya Muyasev (ilya)

The Apache CloudStack project remains a high volume community:
* dev@ 674(+58) subs / msgs = Jun: 2192, Jul: 2865, Aug: 2362
* users@ 938(+115) subs / msgs = Jun: 737, Jul: 1262, Aug: 1200

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Luc Maisonobe]


Apache Commons provides a large set of reusable Java components. Commons
components are widely used in many projects, both at Apache and outside.

There are no particular problems that would require board support.

A discussion was held in August on the list to decide if [math] should
become a TLP or remain within commons scope. The consensus was that it
should remain in commons. There has been activity in the sandbox for
[weaver] and [monitoring]. Also of note is that [csv] is inching towards
a 1.0 release.

The single change in the community this quarter is that Benedikt Ritter
has been elected to the PMC, on 2013-06-26. The last committers were
added in December 2012 and January 2013, they have already been mentioned
in the previous Commons report.

The release pace was really low: only one component has been released
since last report, as an alpha release:

        Commons Collections   4.0-alpha1    (2013-07-06)

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
(Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
which contains lots of useful tools and helpers which are
missing in the CDI core spec.

DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like Apache TomEE,
Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly, Oracle WebLogic,
Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also on simple Servlet containers
like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination with either JBoss Weld
or Apache OpenWebBeans.

Project Status:
Since our last release, 3 new modules (Servlet support,
Bean-Validation support and a JPA Entity abstraction)
got added and reviewed.
There was plenty of work done to get all our CI builds
on the 30+ container constellations green again.
We also had a few discussions about features which have
broken since the new CDI-1.1 spec released and how to deal with them.

Releases:
last release: deltaspike-0.4 on 2013-05-31.
We are currently VOTEing on deltaspike-0.5.

Community:
Last Committer: Thomas Hug (thug) on 2013-06-20
Mailing list activity was ok during the summer and we
see a few new users asking questions.

Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Report from the Apache DirectMemory Project  [Raffaele P. Guidi]

Apache DirectMemory is an off-heap cache implementation for the JVM

* General Information
DirectMemory is being evaluated by project jackrabbit for integration of
off-heap memory into OAK.

Another, more performant back-end implementation is being contributed by
noctarius

* Issues
Development is not moving really fast and adoption is still quite limited
to other apache projects - although more than some interesting integrations have been
contributed. It has to be said that DirectMemory is a niche product - its
target is people and organizations that need to enable their application to handle
large (gigabytes) quantities of objects into memory and it competes in the same space
of terracotta, jboss, memcached and other big players with strong corporate backing
and sponsorship. We feel that we accomplished at least, being the first open source
offheap cache implementation, the goal to bring big memory to the masses, forcing,
in a way, companies to offer free tiers of commercial products (as bigmemory go).

We feel that we are moving, although slowly, and we are making things move.
Any help would be appreciated, though, in suggestions, spreading the word,
testing and facilitating the adoption of the platform

* Releases
  No releases since july 2012. Release 0.2 is planned for the end of the
month - this will be the first one since we left incubation

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
Apache Flex SDK 4.10.0 was released on 8/6/13.
Apache Flex Installer 2.6.0 was released on 8/6/13.

ACTIVITY
Activity in Apache Flex continues to be in  two main areas:  improvements
To the existing Adobe Flash Platform-dependent code base, including the
releases listed above, and prototyping ways to create a version of Flex
that is independent from the Adobe Flash Platform.  There is another group
working on Maven-related tools for the existing code base.

Since the 4.10 release we've seen:
- Significant web visits increase (especially for the week after the
release up 100% or more)
- More JIRA activity (more bugs raised than resolved however)
- More activity on the users mailing list (flex-users markmail archive is
broken so I can't see exact numbers)


Other highlights:
-Over 200 bugs were fixed in 4.10.0.
-4.10.0 supports Linux.
-FlexUnit was finally committed to its repo.
-Several users have submitted applications for a "showcase"
-Flex CI now runs over 30,000 tests.
-One committer overhauled the wiki to make it better organized.
-Adobe submitted the software grant for the BlazeDS software.  There are
some .jar files in the donation that need to be removed and replaced and
that is holding up the actual committing of the code to the repo.

COMMUNITY
-Cyrill Zadra promoted from committer to PMC on 6/11/13.
-Mark Kessler promoted from committer to PMC on 8/13/13.
-Scott Guthmann added as committer and PMC on 7/19/13.  Scott's main
contributions will be on the marketing side.
-Latest analytics include over 600,000 hits on the website in the last six
months.
- Since April 11, 2013, the Installer has been used to install over
16,000 copies of the SDK.  There were more than 5000 installs of 4.10.0 in
the month since its release.
-Several Apache Flex committers presented at 360|Stack which is the
largest Flex-oriented conference in the world.
-Flex mailing lists are now 'mirrored' on Nabble.  Mailing list traffic is
so high that many folks I talked to at 360|Stack have stopped reading
emails.  Many of our committers are unable to keep up.  June and July
almost hit 1000 emails per month each.  Folks requested a "forum" interface
as being more friendly than the archive or mailing list interfaces.

AREAS OF CONCERN
-RELEASE EFFORT:  Getting a release out seems more difficult than it
should be because  folks don't start serious testing on the first RCs so
important bugs are found just before the VOTE ends and another RC has to
be made.  For 4.10.0, the 72 hours had just passed and VOTE results sent
out when a critical issue was found.  And, on each subsequent RC, fewer
and fewer people vote.  Not sure what can be done about this but this
tends to make folks want to avoid becoming the release manager.  One
thought is that, if the area of code change for a critical issue is small,
then past votes should still count in the total.
-NUMBER OF ACTIVE COMMITTERS:  Even though 200 bugs were fixed in 4.10.0,
the majority were done by one committer.  Only six of the nearly 40
committers have committed something to the main repo in this reporting
period.  There is activity in the other repos though.  Not a critical
issue yet, but worth noting.


INFRASTRUCTURE
* I'm still hoping to find time to resolve INFRA-4380 (attachments in old
Flex bugs).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

The set of projects has been stripped down to those who actively
expressed interest in the service, we seem to be able to handle the
reduced set well.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Activity ==

In late June we sent an email to the dev lists of all ASF projects
that were built by Gump asking the communities whether they'd still be
interested in the service.  Of all communities only the Tomcat, POI,
XML Graphics and Forrest dev teams asked to continue the Gump builds,
log4net asked to drop the builds and the rest ignored the mail and was
deemed not interested.

Since mid-August Gump only builds the projects who signaled interest
as well as their dependencies, nag mails have been turned off for all
projects who don't want them.  One result was immediate interest by
the Tomcat and FOP communities to get their builds green again.

== Infrastructure ==

We've given back our FreeBSD jail and now concentrate on a single
installation on vmgump.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.  The most
recent addition to the PMC was in December 2006 when we added Sander
Temme.

== Statistics ==

vmgump runs about 130 build jobs for 50 source trees, 32 from ASF
repositories.  A complete builds takes about two-and-half hour by now.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

It's been another relatively quiet and smooth month for the Incubator.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

    Ben Hindman
    Jake Farrell
    Andrei Savu

  People who left the IPMC:

    (None)

* New Podlings

  (None)

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

    Curator

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

    Aug 15 Apache Falcon (incubating) v0.3
    Aug 27 Apache jclouds 1.6.2-incubating

  It took 5-8 days for the third IPMC vote to arrive.

    Release                             RC VOTE start  Third IMPC +1   Days
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Apache Falcon (incubating) v0.3     Aug 07         Aug 12          5
    Apache jclouds 1.6.2-incubating     Aug 18         Aug 26          8

  However, the first incubating release for Allura has now been waiting since
  at least August 28 (13 days as of this writing) with only 1 IPMC vote cast
  so far.  Two rounds of polite pings have yet to scare up additional votes.

* Miscellaneous

  * Several proposals are in various states of preparation.  Two seem close
    to launching an entry VOTE: Storm, "a distributed, fault-tolerant, and
    high-performance realtime computation system that provides strong
    guarantees on the processing of data", and Aurora, "a service scheduler
    used to schedule jobs onto Apache Mesos."

  * Tashi's developers are currently running a community retirement vote.  It
    seems likely that the podling will be retired within the next few weeks.

  * VXQuery is being pressured to show progress by some IPMC members and
    defended by others.

  * The tradition of sending a "welcome" email to new podlings once their
    mailing lists are set up has been quietly introduced.  Such mails are
    cross-posted to the podling's dev list and general@incubator.  This is
    another offshoot of the "Incubator Ombud" discussions which began a few
    months ago, like the WhatToExpect wiki page.

Allura

Forge software for the development of software projects, including source
control systems, issue tracking, discussion, wiki, and other software project
management tools.

Allura has been incubating since 2012-06-25.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Streamline release process (including voting)
  2. Continue to grow community
  3. Move project development to ASF hardware

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A merge request from long ago was improved and merged.  Daniel Hinojosa,
  SourceForge Community manager, introduced himself and a flyer he is working
  on to promote Allura.  A few emails on the users list.  All other commit
  and email activity has been from existing PPMC members.

  Developers from SourceForge continue to move their internal discussions to
  public forums when possible. Ticket updates now go to the mailing list, and
  more discussions and sharing of plans are occurring on the mailing list and
  IRC.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  First release has been created and approved by PPMC, after a few weeks of
  tweaks and voting.  It is now pending IPMC approval.  Infra has helped us
  get https://forge-allura.apache.org/ up, so we will be able to migrate our
  wiki, tickets, etc. to it.

  Allura has gained an import infrastructure, bulk export, wiki macros for
  youtube and gittip, more extension points, SCM log view and API
  improvements and a variety of other assorted fixes & improvements.

Date of last release:

  As of Sep 3, our first release is pending IPMC votes.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Apache: Project Drill

Apache Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of large-scale
datasets that is based on Google's Dremel. Its goal is to efficiently process
nested data, scale to 10,000 servers or more and to be able to process
petabyes of data and trillions of records in seconds.

Drill has been incubating since 2012-08-11.

Three Issues to Address in Move to Graduation:

  1. Continue to attract new developers and and early users with a variety of
     skills and viewpoints
  2. Continue to develop deeper community skills and knowledge by building
     additional releases
  3. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among
     multiple project members

The community has made significant progress on items 1 and 2.

Issues to Call to Attention of PMC or ASF Board:

  none

How community has developed since last report:

  The most important activity is the run up to the Milestone 1 release.

  Additional events include:

    * Apache Drill project website redesigned to have a new look:
      http://incubator.apache.org/drill/

    * Interactive "How to Run Drill" demo added to the Apache Drill wiki:
      https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DRILL/Demo+HowTo

  Mailing list discussions:

    Subscriptions to the Drill mailing lists have risen to 383. There has
    been active and increasing participation in discussions on the developer
    mailing list, including new participants and developers. Participation on
    the user list is growing although still small; mainly activity takes
    place on developer mailing list.

  Activity summary for the dev mailing list:

    http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-drill-dev/

    * September to date 05/010/2013: 397(mainly jira; some discussion)
    * August 2013, 394  (jira, focused discussions)
    * July 2013,370  (jira; focused discussions)
    * June 2013,297 (jira, focused discussions)

  Recent topics on the dev mailing list have included:

    * Usability and introductory tutorials
    * SQL semantics and extensions to type inference cases
    * Implementation of various storage engines, including Parquet and ORC.
    * Optimizer rewrites and operator implementations.

  Code

    For details of code commits, see http://bit.ly/14YPXN9

    There has been a very significant ramp up of code commits during this
    quarter, as shown in this chart from GitHub:

    Ten contributors have participated in this GitHub code activity; there
    have been 77 forks of the Apache Drill project on GitHub which is a good
    indicator of strong interest outside the group of core contributors.

    Recent code commits include but not limited to:

      * full end-to-end execution of queries
      * reorganization of the source tree to simplify initial user experience
      * a number of new operators for the execution engine
      * a pro tempore query optimizer that allows a physical plans to be
        generated
      * the entire code generation framework
      * Value Vector implementation

  Community Interactions

    The weekly Drill hangout continues, conducted remotely through Google
    hangouts Tuesday mornings 9am Pacific Time to keep core developers in
    contact in realtime despite geographical separation.

    The community stays in touch through @ApacheDrill Twitter ID, and by
    postings on various blogs including Apache Drill User
    http://drill-user.org/

    Viability of community is also apparent through interest in next meet-up
    event for the Bay Area Apache Drill User group in late September, which
    is already attracting a robust audience. Volunteers are coming forward
    from audience members of presentations, such as the Drill workshop in
    July (see following).

  Presentations

    There have been presentations and a Drill workshop from community members
    at conferences and meet-ups.

    Several Drill contributors have other talks scheduled with different
    meetups in the upcoming months.

  Sample presentations (out of many):

    * Drill talks by @mhausenblas at Hive London and in Paris in June
    * Talk on Apache Drill by @mhausenblas and @ted_dunning at Berlin
      Buzzwords
    * Apache Drill hands-on workshop by @ted_dunning and @intjesus at OSCON
      in Portland, Oregon USA in July for ~40 participants.
    * Apache Drill project featured by panelist @tshiran in Aug for the
      "Hadoop + SQL" Hive Data Think Tank event in California Bay Area.
    * Next meeting for the Bay Area Apache Drill User group is planned for
      September with talk and demo by Steve Phillips

  Slides

    Slides from Drill presentations posted online such as at slideshare get a
    large number of views.

    Example:

MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop and Hama.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete the first release
     a) Ensure proper transfer of code
     b) Verify distribution rights

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  none

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have already addressed most issues that prevented us from releasing our
  first release, which we now expect to take place in the next few weeks.  We
  believe that, after we make the first release available, we will get many
  new users and contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have switched to maven as our project management tool. We refactored the
  source tree to make it compliant to maven; we created maven modules for
  compilation; we used the maven assembly plugin to create binary and source
  release artifacts; we updated the MRQL wiki page accordingly (getting
  started, how to contribute/build/commit). We have sent a request to the ASF
  Infrastructure to setup our project in Nexus so that we can deploy our
  snapshots there. We need also to verify the copyright information. As soon
  as we get these two tasks done, we will upload our first release on Nexus
  and stage it for vote.

Olingo

Apache Olingo provides libraries which enable developers to implement
OData producers and OData consumers. While starting with an initial
code base implementing OData version 2.0 it is also a clear goal to
start implementing a library for OData 4.0 once the OData standard is
published at OASIS. The focus within the community is currently on the
Java technology but it is up to the community to discuss if other
environments find interest.

Olingo has been incubating since 2013-07-08.

S4

S4 is a general-purpose, distributed, scalable, fault-tolerant, pluggable
platform that allows programmers to easily develop applications for
processing continuous unbounded streams of data.

S4 has been incubating since 2011-09-26.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. The frequency of releases has been low in the past. Working to put out
     more releases.
  2. The community rise, to be more active and flourish.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  There also was discussion related to “retirement”. Currently people of the
  community stepped up and decided continue the project. As result, came up
  with building community, providing more patches, implementing new features.
  Moreover, Kurtt Lin wrote:

    “Cheer up, guys. I'm seeing opportunities in this stream processing field
    as well as in S4. What I haven’t mentioned is that, S4 had found
    successful applications in our research group even back in the 0.3.0 days
    and now in our start-up. We have built scalable real time search over
    microblogs with some S4 features enhanced (the paper appears in 2013’s
    EDBT proceedings, link is
    http://www.edbt.org/Proceedings/2013-Genova/papers/edbt/a31-lin.pdf); we
    also built a platform on top of S4 for detecting and analyzing real-time
    traffic conditions, processing over hundreds of millions of records every
    day. Now we plan to contribute to the community. I personally have
    created and responded to some JIRAs, but I would like to do more.
    Actually, I am ongoing proposing a design documentation of integrating S4
    with Helix along the roadmap; this would help enhancing the elasticity
    feature for S4. So, I suppose we could put the "retirement" discussion
    aside? Give us the new comers some time perhaps a couple of months to see
    what we can do to make the community healthier. Of course, some of us are
    new; we shall ask for your help and guidance occasionally, please be
    responsive (as what you are doing now), :) You all have done brilliant
    jobs! :) “

  One particular problem we have been having is with growth of the community.
  Having said that in a recent e-mail thread, we have received very positive
  feedback from some developers, so we would like to remain in incubation for
  a little longer so that we can get some traction.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Was reported by March 2013 (Daniel Gómez Ferro).

When did the project last make any releases?

  June 2013: S4 0.6.0 released.

  Two patches are available now, due to 0.7 release 3 of 18 issues was
  solved, the rest in progress.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  In March, the dev mailing list was reasonably busy (132 messages) and then
  that's dwindled to less than 35 per month since March. There was no
  activity in git on August at all. A little in July, more in June. There has
  been no change in the community. We have been seeing some traffic on the
  mailing lists, mostly questions about how to use S4, but the code
  contributions have been fairly minimal. However, some developers have
  expressed interested in contributing so we expect to start receiving more
  contributions in the near future. To grow the community, we plan to have a
  closer interaction with other Apache projects like Gora and Helix.

Shepherd notes:

  (Dave Fisher/Wave) S4 knows how make releases. Is concerned about community
  growth and think that may impede graduation.  I think that they are
  actually ready to graduate.

--------------------
Samza

Samza is a stream processing system for running continuous computation on
infinite streams of data.

Samza has been incubating since 2013-07-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Bringing in new contributors
  2. Building an Apache community around the code
  3. Doing a release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Discussion lists have become active with numerous questions.  First patch
  from the community has been received and committed.  Initial committers are
  very good about using public lists and seeking community input.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  All initial bootstrapping has been completed and all requested
  infrastructure is available and being used.  Forty-nine JIRA issues have
  been opened. First Incubation release could be considered in the next month
  or two.

Date of last release:

  None.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  None yet.  Project has just completed one full month of incubation, having
  entered July 30.

Sentry

Sentry is a  highly modular system for providing fine grained role based
authorization to both data and metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop cluster.

Sentry has been incubating since 2013-08-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Get rest of the project infrastructure in place, namely build and webpage
  2. Release at regular intervals
  3. Build community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  This is the first board report for Sentry. There are 15 sign-ups on the dev
  list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  This is the first board report for Sentry. At this time, the basic project
  infrastructure is setup (git repo, review board, JIRA and wiki). Most
  committers (also PPMC members) have their accounts and are subscribed to
  the dev, commits and private lists. Few JIRAs have been filed and they are
  being actively worked on.

Date of last release:

  We have not done a release of Sentry since it started incubation.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  This is the first board report for Sentry. Last committers and PMC members
  were elected when the project entered incubation.

Spark

Spark is an open source system for fast and flexible large-scale data
analysis. Spark provides a general purpose runtime that supports low-latency
execution in several forms.

Spark has been incubating since 2013-06-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make a first Apache release (we're in the final stages of this)
  2. Move JIRA over to Apache (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6419)
  3. Move development to Apache repo (in progress)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We still need some help importing our JIRA, though Michael Joyce and INFRA
  have looked into it (see <http://s.apache.org/fi>).

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We're continuing to get a lot of great contributions to Spark. UC Berkeley
  also recently hosted a two-day training on Spark and related technologies
  (http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/3/) that was highly attended -- we sold out at
  over 200 on-site attendees, and had 1000+ people watch online. User meetups
  included a well-attended meetup on Shark (Hive on Spark) contributions at
  Yahoo!.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We've made a lot of progress towards a first Apache release of Spark,
  including changing the package name to org.apache.spark, documenting the
  third-party licenses as required in LICENSE / NOTICE, and updating the
  documentation to reflect the transition. This month we've also moved our
  website to an apache.org domain (http://spark.incubator.apache.org) and
  updated the branding there. Finally, on the code side, we have continued to
  make bug fixes and improvements for the 0.8 release. Some recently merged
  improvements include simplified packaging and Python API support for
  Windows.

Streams

Apache Streams is a lightweight server for ActivityStreams.

Streams has been incubating since 2012-11-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Growing the active developer community
  2. Making our second incubating release
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has welcomed one new committer, Danny Sullivan, to the team.


How has the project developed since the last report?

  Architectural discussions (e.g.: handling issues of condensing unusually
  high volume/noisy streams, publisher identification, message splitting,
  etc.) continue to happen on-list and provoke thoughtful responses. We have
  also heard from a number of outside individuals about issues and questions
  related to deployment of our first incubating release. Several of these
  have turned into deeper relationships including the addition of Danny
  Sullivan as a committer/PPMC member last month. Streams is now working to
  create our second incubating release.

  any special attention, except it would be nice to have to have a second
  release out (since the first release was done immediately after entering an
  incubation).



--------------------
Tajo

Tajo is a distributed data warehouse system for Hadoop.

Tajo has been incubating since 2013-03-07.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. The first release
  2. IP clearance check
  3. Various committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None


How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The mailing list traffic grows.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Tajo is rapidly evolving and is being stable by core committers and
    contributors.
  * Since the last report, 45 issues have been resolved, and 58 issues have
    been created.
  * The logical planning and SQL parser are improved.
  * Tajo cluster can be on standby mode for more interactive query processing
    or on on-demand mode for sharing cluster resource by using Yarn.
  * The overall query response times are significantly reduced.
  * We've started to design the JIT and vectorized query engine.
  * We've started to discuss the first Tajo release.

Wave

Wave is rich, web-based, distributed, collaboration platform that allows
users to interact in near real time.  The wave platform includes a
web-based user interface containing an rich-text.  The system is
extendable though widgets, robots, and editor doodads.  The Wave In a Box
implementation is developed in Java using a variety of web technologies
such as Websockets, Javascript, GWT, and supported by an operational
transform based conflict resolution algorithm.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make the initial release
  2. Extend the community
  3. Decide on the future of the existing codebase

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Following the busyness noted in the last report, the community has since
  returned to a relatively quiet state.  Last month, a second public
  discussion (on Hangouts) was held, to extend Wave's public image.  Some
  experiments using volunteers from the community, to test out possible
  changes to the OT algorithm, have been planned.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Following on from 0.4-RC3 being rejected at the Incubator list. Work on
  0.4-RC4 has been completed (albeit fairly slowly), with a request for
  review for RC4 posted to the Wave-dev list only a few days ago. This
  addressed the remaining licensing problems, and merged in some of the trunk
  development that had occurred in the meantime (new translations, federation
  fixed).

  Some questions have been asked about the future of the existing codebase
  beyond the 0.4 release, with a rewrite looking preferred if enough
  development time can be secured.

Date of last release:

  N/A.

Still having one issue noted on the past report, regarding the
transfer of Incubator resources to TLP: we're currently unable to edit
the website, unless we do it directly on production/ URL. Following up
this issue with Infra at INFRA-6611.

Releases / Development
----------------------
Last release on 15th May, 2013

Little activity regarding development this month.

Development has been mainly focused on three points: replacing oscache
with ehcache, simplifying JSPWiki configuration via a custom properties
file and fixing the integration tests.

The VM for the live JSPWikis has just been created, so work on setting
up the wikis should begin shortly.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Tim Williams]

Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF committers.

[STATUS]

A typically slow quarter for Labs. The PMC remains quiet and healthy.

[DETAILS]

== Community ==

The Mavibot lab has been quite successful.  They have found a permanent home under the Apache Directory project
and closed the lab.

A new lab, Panopticon was accepted for research.  Panopticon is web UI for tracking/managing ASF projects and
Incubator podlings based on Python/gunicorn.

During a vote this quarter we realized that our bylaws have had a non-traditional definition of “lazy consensus”
since our inception.  Since the bylaws actually provide the definition, it seems not to be a simple typo.  It
doesn’t seem to affect our functioning but it’s a confusing quirk that should be fixed at some point. Several
folks have stepped up to clarify and attempt to clean it up.

== Labs Statistics ==

- new: 1
- status changes (last 3 months): 1
- total number: 40
- active: 17
- idle: 14
- promoted: 3
- completed: 8
- labs with commits: mavibot, yay, panopticon
- last PMC addition: June 2011

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Uwe Schindler]

The Apache Lucene project develops open-source search software.

TLP
---

No new PMC members were added in the last quarter.  The most recent PMC
member addition happened in April 2013.

We added one new committer in the last quarter: Cassandra Targett.

Lucene Core and Solr
--------------------

Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit.

Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core.

In the last quarter we made one release of both Lucene Core and Solr:

 - 4.4.0 on 23 July 2013

In addition, for the first time, we released the PDF version of the
Apache Solr Reference Guide, which is developed in the Lucene Confluence
Wiki. The reference guide's content was donated by LucidWorks Inc.
and incorporated into Lucene's Confluence Wiki on 3 June 2013. The
first PDF release (corresponding to the 4.4.0 Lucene/Solr release)
was made on 29 July 2013 and is available through the ASF mirrors.

The community is very active.


Open Relevance Project
----------------------

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene and others
tools for judging the quality of search and machine learning approaches.  The
community is not very active, but we don't expect it to be very high volume
either as it is a niche area.


PyLucene
--------

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is almost
entirely an automated port, so this project will never require a lot of
developers.  The user community is active.

In the last quarter we made one release of PyLucene:

 - 4.4.0-1 on 23 August 2013.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in
C# and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

Over the past two months we have tried to re-invigorate our efforts on the
Lucene.Net project. Interest, progress and discussion had waned. One of our
community members has stepped up and has a running version of Lucene.Net
4.0.3 core. We have voted to invite him into the Lucene.Net PMC. We've begun
coordination of including his code into our official repo (waiting on a
signed ICLA). We hope to continue this progress.

== Releases ==

Last release was 3.0.3. We're attempting with the help of a group of our
community members to get 4.0.3 bootstrapped.

== Statistics ==

Nuget package downloads:
Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 26993 (+4374 over last month)
Lucene.Net Contrib 3.0.3: 8773 (+1079 over last month)
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial: 1035 (+90 over last month)
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial.NTS: 378 (+54 over last month)

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Jake Mannix]

Apache Mahout has implementations of a wide range of machine learning and
data mining algorithms: clustering, classification, collaborative filtering
and frequent pattern mining

Project Status
--------------

The project continues to have a large and active user base. With the book
Mahout in Action it has become simpler for beginners to get started using
the project.

Community
---------

The third quarter of 2013 was seen continued activity on par with the
second quarter, with our first new release in more than a year, a
new committer, and our first live google hangout for users and
developers. There has been continued effort fixing bugs and reviewing
contributor patches, especially with the recent release.

We added one new committer to the project: Ellen Friedman

There is a SF-Bay Area Mahout MeetUp scheduled for August 27 in Redwood
City. Sebastian Schelter will be the main speaker, talking about new
directions with Mahout recommendation. Grant Ingersoll, Ted Dunning and
Ellen Friedman be there to do a short introduction for the meet-up and
update on the 0.8 release.


Community Objectives
--------------------

Discussions regarding the 0.9 planning and 1.0 release has continued on
the mailing list, revolving significantly around what features/algorithms
will be supported in 1.0 and onward, with an eye toward streamlining the
scope of the project to not contain as many rarely used / unsupported
algorithms.

The PMC and especially the PMC Chair apologize for missing the last several
Board Reports, and we have discussed internally as a PMC the need for a
new PMC chair who is a bit more "bureaucratically minded", and with
several experienced volunteers stepping forward, we should be calling a
vote and moving forward with this by the end of August.

Releases
--------

Mahout 0.8 was released in July, see below for details, and
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAHOUT/Release+0.8 for
release notes.

Code
----

The 0.8 release contains one significant new algorithm
implementation, Streaming K-Means ( MAHOUT-1154 ), as well as numerous
performance enhancements and API improvements to the core linear algebra
library and many bugfixes. Additionally, two new directions have started
up, regarding visualization of recommender and co-occurrence calculations
(http://s.apache.org/mahout_viz_thread); and creating a scala DSL for
some Mahout calculations (http://s.apache.org/mahout_scala_dsl). Both of
these are at the design and prototyping phase, but seem promising.


Issues
------

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides resource sharing and
isolation across cluster applications.

## General ##

The biggest highlights of the past month are another release (0.13.0)
and continued growth in the community. Another Mesos framework was
also released (Marathon) and Twitter proposed moving a framework they
wrote (Aurora) into the incubator! We're looking forward to working
with these projects to help grow our community.

## Releases ##

 * Apache Mesos 0.13.0 (2013-09-10)

The 0.13.0 release includes some bug fixes and back ported features
for more easily running frameworks like Hadoop (just as 0.12.1
did). The release also includes the beta stage of the "slave recovery"
feature that has been being worked on for quite some time (the 0.14.0
release will make this feature stable).

## Community ##

 * No new committers added in the past month. Last committer and PMC
   member added on 2013-08-05.

 * 23/17 created/resolved JIRA issues in last 30 days.

 * 101 messages to user@mesos.apache.org (August - September), which
   is another improvement!

 * Twitter hosted a meet up in NYC on August 20 with a 60 - 80 person
   audience. Hubspot hosted a meet up in Boston with about 30 people,
   and a meetup was also held in Austin with close to 50 people.

 * The Google Summer of Code project is wrapping down. Some of the
   committers are building upon and expanding the work done by the
   student in an effort to get some of the code committed back to the
   project.

 * There have been a lot of packaging scripts pushed back from the
   community but we haven't successfully gotten them standardized (do
   configuration the same way, use the same/similar defaults) and
   committed. Hopefully we can put the time in to try and make this a
   priority before the 0.15.0 release.

## Issues ##

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache MRUnit Project  [Brock Noland]

DESCRIPTION

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES
* The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 1.0.0, released on
  May 21, 2013. This was MRUnit's first release since graduation in May 2012.


CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Development activity continues as can be seen from the following report: http://s.apache.org/uc9
* 1 JIRA was resolved since the last report.
* Mail traffic is largely on the DEV list. Messages since July 1st: dev 20, user 20
* As you can see there is little development in progress and email activity is dropping off.
I sent an email to the dev and user list to understand what our community would like to see.

COMMUNITY

* The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
  the last report.
* Currently there are:
  - Total of 34 subscribers to the developer list.
  - Total of 59 subscribers to the user list.
  - Total of 10 committers
  - Total of 10 PMC members

ISSUES

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Joern Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks,
such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging,
named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution.
These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text processing
services.

Development
------------------
The team is currently working on the new features for the 1.6.x release branch
and it is expected to take quite a bit more time until the next release.

Community
---------------
The community activity reduced a bit over the summer months, a few patches
were committed for the recently contributed entity linker component.

No new committers have been voted in and no new PMC members.

Releases
------------
The last release OpenNLP 1.5.3 was released on 15.4.2013.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Pig Project  [Julien Le Dem]

Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level 
language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for 
evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their 
structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables 
them to handle very large data sets.

Releases:  None

Community:
* 387 subscribers to the dev mailing list (349 in the last report)
* 1079 subscribers to the user mailing list (944 in the last report)
* We have one new Committer: Koji Noguchi
* We have two new PMC members:  Rohini Palaniswamy and Cheolsoo Park
* The PMC has 14 active members and the project counts 7 additional active committers

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Apache Pivot is a platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
robustness of the Java platform.

Status:
Relatively steady (but low) traffic for the last six months.  We have
some first time users showing up asking good questions.  There is
one new user in the ASF-ICFOSS program who is using Pivot to build
a new GUI for parts of Lucene.  Another user has tried to run a
Pivot app on the Raspberry Pi machine, and others are trying Pivot
with JRuby and Jython.

Most user's questions are answered within a day or so, many within
a few hours.  There have been 12 new issues created since the last
Board report, and 6 resolved.

The Pivot 2.0.3 maintenance release was finally approved.  Some
work has been done toward the next 2.0.4 release, and work has
definitely started on the next (2.1) release.  We have switched new
coding to Java 7.

Issues:
No real issues at this time.

Releases:
Last Release was 2.0.3, published 01 August 2013.

Branding/Naming issues:
None.

Legal issues:
None.

Infrastructure Issues/Needs:
Jenkins build problems seem to have been resolved.  The new Javadoc
was generated from latest Java 7 JDK, so the (one) Javadoc vulnerability
on our site has been handled.

Community Changes:
One of the founders of the Pivot project and a PMC Member, Greg Brown
(gbrown), has asked today (10 Sep 2013) to be moved to Emeritus status.
Last Committer Piotr Kolaczkowski (pkolaczk) was created 09 May 2012.

Still looking for more committers.  Most users seem to be taking up Pivot
to build their applications and when they are done, they are done. But
that could be good too, meaning the code is overall of good quality and
usefulness.

Respectfully,
Roger Whitcomb on behalf of the Apache Pivot PMC

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Qpid Project  [Carl Trieloff]

Apache Qpid™ is a project focused on creating software based on the
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), currently providing a protocol
engine library, message brokers written in C++ and Java, and  with client
libraries for C++, Java (including JMS), .Net, Python, Perl and Ruby.

Releases:

Proton 0.5; 29th Aug, 2013
Qpid 0.24; 7th Sep, 2013

Progress:

Now have a new website which not only looks a lot better, but also provides
better information on the components offered.

There has been some refactoring of the Java broker to turn the various
protocol versions into plugins.

For the c++ broker, the work on a new approach to high availability is
progressing well with transaction support being finalised. AMQP 1.0 support
has also progressed well, as it has for the c++ qpid::messaging client.

In proton, the API has been extended to provide better non-blocking support
and proton-j (java) has been brought into line with the development on proton-c.

There is work underway to build a new JMS client using proton-j. A separate
JIRA instance has been set up for this.

There is also a new component being worked on (yet to be released), called
Qpid Dispatch Router, which is a lightweight message router using proton-c.

Community:

The main developer and user lists continue to be active. The proton sub-project
also has a list. Issues are being raised and fixed.

Have added Pavel Moravec as a committer. Carl Trieloff is standing down as
Chair. Gordon Sim will take over and the plan is to rotate this role more
frequently in future.

Issues:

No issues to report.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Gert Vanthienen]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status:

While we continue to have decent community activity, we also have lost
a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community:

No changes since last report.  The last addition to the PMC dates back
to September 2009.  The last committer was added in November 2011.

Community Objectives:

Since our last board report, we have finished the 4.5.2 release and we
are continuing to work on our 5.0.0 release.

Thanks to the excellent support of the folks at infra@, we now have a
setup in place that allows us to publish some of larger assembly
artifacts ourselves again.

Releases:

- Apache ServiceMix 4.5.2 in July
- A set of 14 OSGi bundles in July
- Another set of 35 OSGi bundles in September


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- No new releases since our May 30 2013 1.2.2 bugfix release.  A 1.3 release
 may be on the horizon as an interim before 2.0.

Community & Project:

- Initial efforts towards a 2.0 distribution are still under way.
 It is still quite early, and a new release is probably still at least 6
 months away.

- It might be possible to have a 1.3 interim release before 2.0, adding in
 official JSF support + a few minor bug fixes.

- User mailing list is still active, with questions (more than usual)
 picking up over the last month.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment.

The project's activities in terms of new development got a little bit slower
during the summer. Nonetheless do we have a steady activity on the mailing
list through user requests and interest in possible new features.
There were plans for a summer term release but this has not been finally
prepared yet. So the next step is to cut a new release which is really needed
for the community. In this context we have also started to work on a new
branch towards a 1.0.0 release of Stanbol.

Our PMC member Reto Bachman-Gmür wrote a book about Apache Stanbol
which got published at Packt Publishing:
http://www.packtpub.com/apache-stanbol/book

two new contributors have started to attract a lot of attention in the
community via regular patch submissions. These contributors will be
considered for committership during the new quarter.

During the reporting period there have been 201 commits from 7 committers.
We are observing a sudden increase in activity level due to the ongoing
3.0 release effort.

Both user and developer mailing lists continue to be active with a
moderate amount of traffic.


Releases

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on
January, 2012.

Work is currently underway for a 3.0 release. In light of this
upcoming release, several architectural and performance enhancements
have been introduced to the Synapse trunk over the last quarter.


Board issues

None identified.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]

General
  Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
  responsiveness on both dev and user lists.

Issues
  In our last report we raised an issue about being unable to
  access latest TCKs for the Servlet, JSP, EL and WebSocket
  specifications. It is our understanding that there is an
  ongoing discussion with Oracle on this subject. We have now
  released the first Tomcat 8 Release Candidate and access to
  the TCKs would benefit future releases.
  What is the status of the discussions with Oracle, when do
  you expect those discussions to conclude and is there a view
  of what the outcome of the discussion is likely to be?

Releases
 * Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC1
 * Apache Tomcat 7.0.42

Development
  There was lots of development activity on Apache Tomcat 7
  and Apache Tomcat 8 release candidate.
  With Apache Tomcat 8, support is added for the Java WebSocket
  specification. This adds to the Servlet, JSP and Unified
  Expression Language specifications already supported.
  Java WebSocket support has also been back-ported to Tomcat 7.
  There is also some development to enable IPV6 support for mod_jk.
  One of our contributors has been doing great work improving the
  look of our documentation and web site. The updated main website
  has been rolled out and the documentation will be updated as new
  releases are made.

Community
  There were no changes in community membership.

Security
  There were no publicly disclosed security issues from
  the last Board report.

Trademark
  Detailed status:
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/tomcat/trademark-status.txt
  There are no pending trademark issues which would require board's
  attention at this time.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

DESCRIPTION

VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Discussions on the dev list included a thread to reorganize the release
  roadmap. The main new feature planned for VCL 2.4 had been a configuration
  management system. There is still a lot of work to do in order to implement
  this feature. There are other features which could be completed sooner which
  would provide significant benefits to some implementations such as NAT
  support. There was general agreement to go this direction.
* There has been an increase in the amount of development interest and
  activity:
** A provisioning module to support OpensStack Essex is currently
  being worked on [1]
** A provisioning module to support OpenNebula is
  currently being worked on [2]
** Interest has been expressed in contributing
  a new module to support VirtualBox provisioning [3]
* The community realizes it needs to continue to work to attract development
  contributions. Efforts are underway to add new committers and at least 1 PMC
  member over the next year. [4]

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Junqueira]

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed
applications.

Trunk is under development for an eventual 3.5.0 release. A couple of
important improvements on the way for 3.5.0:

- One important new feature in 3.5.0 will be the ability to reconfigure a
ZooKeeper ensemble. This feature was discussed a long time in
ZOOKEEPER-107 and we have finally converged and committed it;
- We are also focusing on a number of improvements over the code that
performs recovery. In particular, we are targeting an implementation that
avoids sending and taking unnecessary snapshots, which reduces time
to recover in the presence of crashes.

There are other various patches we are working on related code cleanup
and refactoring.

Note that the status of releases hasn't changed since the last board report.
3.5.0 release date is not defined yet.  Our focus is on scalability, jdk7 and
openjdk support,  maven build/rel, testing and audit logging.

A bug fix release 3.4.6 is also expected to go out, but given the low traffic
of reviews and patches committed, it is unclear when it will happen.

Community:

Mailing list activity is moderate and the number of patch reviews
and commits has dropped significantly.

* 10 active committers representing 8 unique organizations. No change to
the list of committers.
*  9 active PMC members representing 7 unique organizations. No change
to the list of committers. I'd like to note that the name of Michi Mutsuzaki
still doesn't show up in the list of PMC members for the project in the
committee-info.txt file. He has been voted and the board has acknowledged
on May 14, 2013.
* 408 subscribers on dev (up from 387 last quarter).
* 866 subscribers on user (up from 816 last quarter).
* 1756 jira issues have been created to date (45 more since June 2013)
* Patrick Hunt has given a talk at Airbnb

=== Apache BookKeeper (subproject)

Bookkeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance
logging service. The project also includes Hedwig which is
a highly scalable Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper
and Bookkeeper with strong durability guarantees.

Focus in the last quarter has been on the 4.2.2 release which at the
time of writing has a release candidate under consideration. 4.2.2 is
a mostly a bugfix release, though we have also exposed some new
administrative functionality.

Release 4.3.0 is still being worked on, though scope may be reduced to
allow for a more regular release cycle.

Infrastructure issues:
No issues.

Graduation:
The community overall feels that we should consider graduation after
release 4.3.0. We plan to have release 4.3.0 before the end of this
calendar year.

Community building:
The community growth has settled down and there's now a core set of
people across 4 companies regularly contributing to the project.

Community:
* 53 subscribers to bookkeeper-dev
* 66 subscribers to bookkeeper-user
* 670 issues opened to date, 64 since June 1, 2013
* 438 issues resolved to date, 40 since June 1, 2013
* 41 reporters of Jira issues, 9 since June 1, 2013
* 20 patch contributors, 7 since June 1, 2013
