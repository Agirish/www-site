 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       Nothing to report.

    B. President [Jim]

       Trademarks, Concom and Marketing/PR are all fine.

       TAC requests verification regarding payment of expenditures. My
       initial desire was to see all TAC expenditures and approve them,
       even though TAC has a pre-approved budget. The sole reason was to
       be able to follow the money stream in TAC, and not to create a
       bottleneck. For TAC, this may not be feasible, due to the way
       expenses are done (lots of little bills). Assuming the board
       is OK with this, I will inform TAC that they can self-approve
       bills received.

       Sally is helping w/ Fundraising. If anyone on the board can help
       as well, please let Upayavira or myself know; things always go
       easier when "titles" are used.

       We are still working out delegation "kinks" within Infra. Even
       so, Infra is doing well. I would encourage the board to review
       the thread and web-page referring to the "relaxed" SVN ACLs (aka
       "UCB") and provide some guidance.

       I will representing the ASF at a panel discussion at the NSF SI2
       meeting in Arlington, VA tomorrow (Jan 17th). This event came
       through via Ross, who was unable to attend.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


       Comment: Regarding TAC, expenses for TAC members (not TAC
       beneficiaries) should be approved by Jim.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       December 2012 was a fairly quiet month for the Treasurer's Office.

       The Office processed bonuses for infrastructure contractors per
       the direction of the VP of Infrastructure. In addition, we
       processed a train ticket reimbursement for Melissa from
       ApacheCon EU 2012 and the reimbursements for Apache Open Office
       travel support for ApacheCon EU 2012 went through.

       The Office is working with Sally to process payment for NASDAQ
       GlobeNewswire 2013 costs. Waiting for an invoice. We are also
       working with Sally and Jim to process payment for Sally's
       travel to ApacheCon NA 2013.

       We received a strange notice from one sponsor that their bank informed
       them while processing an invoice payment that Apache's ACH routing
       # has changed -- Chris is investigating.

       The Treasurer is giving a heads up to the Prezo and EVP that there
       will be a few quick turnaround approvals needed for ApacheCon NA
       2013 and TAC (including one that will have hopefully been approved
       and Processed by the time of this meeting for the #1st TAC flight
       advance).
       
       Note the double bill for the EA below will come back since she is 
       ripping up one of the checks per month while we try and get Bill pay
       fixed for her.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       December was a slow month for document filing, with 36 ICLAs, 
       one CCLA, and three grants received and filed. The secretary 
       tools continue to make light work of the load.

       Secretary took a week off and James Carman filled in to file 
       documents and Sam Ruby to take minutes at the board meeting. 

       Thanks to both substitutes. 

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Things seem to be smoother this month. OpenBastion contacted me
       about contacting our sponsors about ACNA. I bounced this
       straight to Fundraising where it is being addressed. The issues
       concerns RIM have with their SGA remain but we are taking steps
       forwards. Thanks to both trademarks and legal for their help
       here. Other than that nothing to report.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       Another month with zero official activity.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

No issues requiring board or president attention at the moment.

We've had a higher than usual rate of general questions from third parties 
and from our PMCs.  Overall this is a good thing, as we're starting to have 
more documentation available to point to, and many of the questions from 
PMCs (and especially most incubator podlings) are showing a slightly better 
understanding of branding issues.

Shane is speaking at ApacheCon in Portland, both as a session and as a 
tutorial on How To Manage Your Apache Project Brand.  This is a tutorial 
specifically aimed at PMC members and committers in terms of how to 
apply Apache Brand policy in real life.  I hope to work with Concom to see 
if there's some way to provide discounted tickets to PMC members (a'la the 
press training provided by Sally in the past), since this providing better 
support to PMCs is a key Brand Management need.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

A quiet month. We have started the process of contacting sponsors for
renewal, however we have a lot more work to do, as we have 15 sponsors
up for renewal. So far, two are in hand.

Sally has offered to do much of the legwork contacting sponsors, if I
can provide her with the necessary backup information. This strikes me
as a very workable division of labour.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain ahead of plans and under budget. We have renewed the
  contract with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire via HALO Worldwide that provides the
  ASF 17 pre-paid press releases with an additional 20% discount over
  already-reduced wire distribution rates.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
  newswire, ASF Foundation Blog, announce@apache.org, and
  announce@apachecon.com (where appropriate) --
- 14 January 2013: The Apache Software Foundation Announces
  Apache Flex™ as a Top-Level Project
- 2 January 2013: The Apache Software Foundation Announces
  Apache Cassandra™ v1.2

IV. Informal Announcements: 4 items were announced on @TheASF Twitter
  feed, and 33 on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed. No new posts were made on
  "TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: no ASF announcements are currently planned,
  although a press release for ApacheCon is in development and will be
  disseminated the week of 21 January. PMCs wishing to announce major
  project news —as well as podlings ready to graduate from the
  Incubator—are welcome to contact Sally Khudairi at press@apache.org for
  more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
  planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: an addition to select pre-announcement briefings, 3
  media requests were responded to, and 2 interviews coordinated for
  various projects. The ASF received 466 press clips over this time period,
  vs. last month's clip count of 702.

VII. Analyst Relations: no formal briefings are planned. Apache was
  mentioned in 1 report by Forrester, 9 reports by Gartner, 1 write-up by
  GigaOM, and 2 reports by 451 Research.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally continues to advise The Open Bastion
  regarding sponsorships and publicity for ApacheCon North America, and had
  established the Lanyrd site for the event and populated the full program
  and speaker list. She will also be attending the event to organize and
  moderate "The Business of Open Source" plenary panel.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no new activities are
  underway. Sally has connected with the team at O'Reilly regarding our
  participation with OSCON 2013, as well as possibly the Strata/Hadoop
  World conferences.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 15 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
  GlobeNewswire through December 2013, and 12 pre-paid press releases
  remaining on the PRNewswire account through May 2013.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

Rainer Jung and Jan Iversen have done a stellar job of
coordinating and collaborating on a new wiki host for
openoffice, among other activities from Rainer in particular.

Discussed with the secretary the best way to populate
a new tlp's LDAP groups from either the unapproved minutes
or the agenda file.  After a bit of back and forth we
settled on the agenda file for the time being, however
this effort remains a convenience for the incoming chair,
not a means of setting up the groups in a permanent and
official way.  The chair remains responsible for vetting
the groups post-setup.

Had a robust yet not entirely satisfying discussion with
the membership about relaxing ACL's for our subversion
service, culminating in the following url

    http://www.apache.org/dev/open-access-svn

It is expected to take an extended period of time before
such changes can be effectively implemented as infra policy,
but the goal of simply raising awareness has been met.

We are in the final phases of withdrawing support for rsync-backed
websites, which we expect to complete before the end of the month
rolls around.  At this time there are still several outstanding
projects who have yet to file a jira ticket with us to migrate
to either svnpubsub or the CMS, and their ability to continue
to service their live site with updates and new content will
be impacted.

Daniel Gruno and others have been working on a gitpubsub
service over on github and have rolled out a demo version
to our live writable git repos.  We expect even more coordination
between the svnpubsub service maintained by the subversion
crew and the gitpubsub service Daniel and others have worked
on.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the Apache Conference Planning Project  [Nick Burch]

ApacheCon
---------
Things seem to be progressing for ACNA, and volunteer energies needed
at the moment are much much lower than in the past. Volunteers are
mostly focused on the smaller community focused events around
ApacheCon, such as the BarCamp, Hackathon and evening events.

A call for participation in the community events was sent out before
Christmas, and generated a spike of activity that has rather subsided.
Hopefully engagement and interest will pick up again as the event gets
closer, as not all of these surrounding events are fully planned yet.

There has been some discussion around communications of committer
discounts, what speakers need to do, the pmc engagement in the talk
selection etc. Some of this seems just to be people not reading their
emails, which we can't really help. Some others seem to stem from the
producer not fully understanding the differences in communities that
would be in Portland than Sinsheim, despite advice. This can hopefully
be put down to their learning about the ASF, and hopefully didn't have
too much impact.

Finances for ACEU12 are being finalised, and it looks like there was a
small profit as expected, which is provisionally going towards
community events/support at ACNA13.

Finances for ACUS 09-11 have now come in, and we're working with TAC
and the Treasurer on these. (They contain concom and tac merged)

A discussion on the next ApacheCons is provisionally planned for the tail
end of Portland (see apachecon-discuss@ for scope and involvement)

Small Events
------------
Other than small events around ACNA, there are currently no small
events known to be in planning with ConCom support / needing ConCom
support.  There's probably not many spare volunteer cycles to help
with others though, as we're hoping to do quite a lot of community
events around ACNA.

Committee
---------
Following clarification of how we add new committee members in the new
committee setup, three new volunteers were invited. Two confirmed they
still wanted to join, and we're pleased to welcome Justin Mclean
<jmclean> and Donald Harbison <dpharbison>


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

General
=======

Last month a hardware issue with our VM host meant we had to rebuild with
a new VM. The webapp was brought online but unfortunately an important
piece of the backup puzzle was not off-site, therefore a rebuild from
scratch was needed to get it back online. This meant we had to ask all of
our successful applicants again to -re-register their details. We had
another issue due to the webapp going away. We are very good with our
anonymity of our applicants. So any details of them that we need outside
of the webapp, are usually stored using an identifier that gets
cross-referenced back to the webapp database. Long story short, we lost 4
applicants details and have no way of getting back to them. Our original
accepted applicant list of 12 is now down to 7 with another one pulling
out voluntarily a few days ago. Should any of the remaining missing
applicants contact us in the meantime, we will try out best to verify and
help them out. New backups are in place and all pieces are verified as
being off-site should a similar thing happen in the future.

TAC Chair (Gavin McDonald) requests clarification on expenditure process
now that we are a Presidents Committee. As a board committee, board
approved our budget for the year, and TAC spent what it needed to based on
applicant figures. We were free to go ahead and book flights,
accommodations etc without having to approve every amount along the way -
budget was approved and we never went above budget even one time. As a
presidents committee it seems the process has changed, does every dollar
spent now need to be re-approved by the president or EVP now ? Even though
budget is already approved? I much prefer that we be trusted that we spend
what we need to and that our previous track record speak for itself. The
committee will of course abide by the decision made, but is pleading its
case for status quo.

The travel-assistance@ mailing list has 13 people subscribed (no change on
last month.)

ApacheCon NA 2013 Portland
=======================

After our webapp disaster we are gathering steam again. Melissa is in
charge of liaising with our Travel Agent. Our shepherds are in charge of
ensuring Melissa receives all information needed. In return, Melissa will
provide things like Accommodation and Event confirmation letters for those
that need them. Our current revised figure is 7 applicants are
re-confirmed as attending. The first payment to the travel agent has been
wired, thanks to all involved. Our final figures for this event should
therefore be lower than originally estimated. We believe we are still on
track to get the remaining successful applicants sorted in time.

Other Events
===========

No other events requiring TAC attention at this time.

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Sergio Fernández is a committer on Incubator project Marmotta. 
He is not employed by a W3C member company. 
o
He has joined the Linked Data Platform (LDP-WG) and rejoined 
the ReadWriteWeb (RWW) and WebId community groups under 
ASF affiliation. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Sam Ruby]

List traffic is up, but remains constructive.

Key topics include license headers, not allowing modification of our
grant agreements, and avoiding adoption or use of Category X licenses
in Apache code.

Export requirements is not resolved; Santuario and Wookie accepted the
recommendation to submit a notification, now Subversion has questions.
I'll keep pinging the SFLC.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

For Dec 2012: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

4      Support question
1      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
2      Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
6      Vulnerability reports
       2 [httpd, via security@apache.org]
       1 [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org]
       1 [commons, via security@apache.org]
       1 [openoffice, via security@openoffice.apache.org]
       1 [not asf project, via security@apache.org]

For the calendar year 2012 as a whole we saw

27    Support questions (31 in 2011)
18    Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
       (19 in 2011)
18    Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache" (15 in 2011)
0     User was hacked, but it wasn't ASF software at fault (0 in 2011)
78    Vulnerability reports  (60 in 2011)
      38 of which came in to security@apache.org, the others direct
        to projects
      25 projects got vulnerability reports, top 4 accounted for majority:
           21% httpd
           15% tomcat
           11% openoffice
           10% hadoop

Note that not all vulnerability reports are valid or lead to a
security fix being issued; we do not track this (resource intensive to
capture).  However in 2012 we managed to annoy several reporters by
failing to respond to their reports in a reasonable time; this is
because our process [http://apache.org/security/committers.html]
relies on the project following up with the reporter and the security
team does not track if this has been done.  Given the relatively low
number of real reports, for 2013 we'll try some approaches to better
close the loop.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Releases
Version 1.4.2 was released on 11/14/2012.

Activity
The mailing lists have been active.  The dev list has increased by 87
subscribers to 226, while the user list decreased by 42 subscribers to
150.  I was momentarily concerned until I verified that we only lost 7 
subscribers overall since the last report, and that the rest of those 42
either switched to the dev list or were already subscribed there.

Development is active.  We have set a feature freeze date for version
1.5.0 of January 18th, after which we plan a month of testing before
release.

Community
Drew Farris was added as a new committer on 11/01/2012.

(Non-)Issues
A friend of Accumulo who is not involved with the project was using the
Twitter account @ApacheAccumulo.  We asked if he would be willing to
donate the account to the PMC, and he graciously agreed.

In early December, the Senate passed a version of the 2013 NDAA that
contained a section prohibiting use of Accumulo by some parts of the
government unless Accumulo was deemed to be a successful open source 
project.  The version of the bill the House had passed did not contain
this section, and when the differences between the two versions were 
reconciled the Accumulo section was removed [1][2][3].  Last week, 
the President signed the bill, which we can hope brings an end to 
Accumulo-related legislation.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]

Apache Airavata is a software framework to construct, execute, and manage 
long running applications and workflows on distributed computing resources.

== Releases ==

The PMC has not made a release this reporting period. The PMC is
preparing for a RC and a subsequent release vote to target a release
for mid-january.  This release has been delayed due to holidays and to
get good amount of testing done.

== Activity ==

The mailing list, jira and commit activity remains very high. The current 
activity is focused on designing a good API to access Airavata services
and a light weight client. Significant workflow registry revisions have
also taken place during this quarter. Reimplementation based around OpenJPA
was completed, work on REST interfaces to registry occurred, as well as 
integration with overarching API work.  Science gateway provenance
requirements were also taken into account in the redesign.

== Community ==

Amila Jayasekara was voted in as the new Airavata PMC member/committer
and announced to the community on December 22nd. The next big step for
the project is to engage the community in designing the roadmap for
Airavata 1.0.

Airavata had good success with the GSoC students and we would like
engage the students more. We have a talk related to this topic in
'Community over Code' track at ApacheCon NA -
http://na.apachecon.com/schedule/presentation/134/.

Will start a comdev discussion before the conference. 

== Outreach ==

Two talks related to Airavata are accepted and published on schedule for 
ACNA. Airavata and OODT PMC members have proposed a 'Apache in Science'
track and now has a good collection of talks.  

== Infrastructure ==

There are no infrastructure issues.

== Other Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Michele Mostarda]

Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command
line tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety
of Web documents.

Project Releases

The Any23 team was happy to announce the first release of Any23
0.7.0-incubating around September 2012.  Since then Simone Tripodi
developed documentation which now means release candidates (and
subsequent releases) can be made by any Any23 committer in an
efficient and streamlined manner.

Overall Project Activity since last report

The last Any23 board report was in produced at the end of July 2012.
Since then community traffic has remained relatively low both on the
user and dev lists. The Any23 code base has however witnessed a
significant restructuring effort in an attempt to create a more modular
(OSGi-inspired) code base. Currently there are no immediate efforts
aimed towards the next release.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Once in a while the community receives traffic from new Any23 users,
one such example is a newly improved RDFa compliant parser proposal
which has been logged and is being tracked through Jira. It is
recognized that the community could benefit from more traffic. One
method for building out the community would be better collaboration
with developers behind the OpenRDF community. Peter Ansell (one of our
PMC members) is a committer on the OpenRDF Sesame project so we look
forward to increased collaboration in an attempt to build out the
Any23 community.

Changes to PMC & Committers

Since adding Peter Ansell, there have been no new additions to the PMC. 

PMC and Committer diversity

We currently have committers from a wide variety of projects including,
Nutch, Tika, Gora, OODT, Maven and OpenRDF Sesame however this is not 
an exhaustive list. 

Project Branding or Naming issues

NONE

Legal issues

NONE

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Jeremy Hughes]

Apache Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

##Project update

* The SPI Fly component now fully implements the ServiceLoader Mediator
Specification 1.0 from the OSGi Enterprise R5 spec (chapter 133). It is
the Reference Implementation of this spec and passes all the OSGi TCK
tests for it.
* The JMX component in Aries now fully implements OSGi/JMX 1.1 from the
OSGi Enterprise R5 spec (chapter 124). As of this version it is the
Reference Implementation of this spec and passes all the OSGi TCK tests
for JMX.

    Both components are available in SNAPSHOT versions in the Aries code
base. They are waiting to be released.

* The Semantic Versioning maven plugin component is now being used in our
own builds - for modules that have 1.0 or above releases. For those
modules, the bytecode output to the target directory will be checked for
semantic changes since the last release. If the semantic version is
incorrect, the build will fail.

* Apache Karaf 2.3.0 - one of our significant consumers - has moved up to
include Apache Aries 1.0.0 releases.

No releases this quarter.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache ESME Project  [Richard Hirsch]

Apache ESME's mission: Enterprise Social Messaging Environment (ESME) is a

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Kevan Miller]

Apache Geronimo is an open source server runtime that integrates
the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes
that meet the needs of enterprise developers and system
administrators.

The community has not had any releases in the past 3 months.
There have been a variety of bug fixes, etc. There has been some
discussion of a Geronimo 3.0.1 release.

Mark Struberg has joined the Geronimo project as our newest
committer.

Largely due to the efforts of Jarek Gawor, the Geronimo web site
is being migrated to svnpubsub. Thanks to infra@ for their
assistance.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Arun Murthy]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Michael Stack]

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database
built on top of Hadoop Common and Hadoop HDFS

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’s ATTENTION

MapR Technologies released MapR M7 Edition on
10/23/2012.  Their website and supporting
materials for the M7 product claim, "Making HBase
Easy, Dependable, and Fast", and making "HBase
Enterprise Grade" though their product is not HBase.

The HBase PMC, with the help of trademarks@, wrote
MapR on 10/31/2011 asking them to make proper Apache
attribution (They referred to HBase, not Apache HBase),
to note our Apache trademark, and to make clearer the
distinction between their M7 product and HBase on
their website and in their marketing materials.

They have since made changes to their website adding
our Apache prefix and trademark but have yet to address
the larger conflation of M7 and "HBase" issue.  We
sent them a second letter on January 9th (after letting
the text stew a week on trademarks@).

RELEASES

0.94.3 on December 3rd, 2012
0.94.4RC0 was put up on January 3rd, 2013

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Benson Margulies]

In the past month the IPMC voted to retire, and retired, Photark.  We were
unsuccessful in engaging the community members in this process; they did not
respond to email over an extended period of time.

This is the first report using a new template that helps take note of mentor
participation.

There are 53 total mentors attached to projects; 27 signed off on their
projects' reports, and 26 did not.

One project (Tashi) failed to report, this has led to a start of a
conversation about their future.  (A report was supplied on 12 Jan and has
been added here.)

This reporting cycle includes several projects that look as if they may have
stalled; shepherds have started conversations with some, and we will engage
over time with the others.

o Graduations

The board has motions for the following:

   OpenMeeting
   Etch
   Otlu 

o Releases

   None in the month covered by this report.

Celix

Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on
interoperability between Java and C.

Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow a community
  2. Find more committers
  3. ..

Celix is maintained by 2 committers and a small group of users. Questions to
the mailing list are (most of the time) answered quickly. We are also trying
to give talks on Celix or related stuff on conferences.  We see and recognise
the problem of the small community, but are also confident that Celix and its
community will grow. Especially the Native-OSGi work might be important for
this (see below).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?
None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

There is no active growth, but in the past few months talks have been given
on Native-OSGi. Native-OSGi is an effort to standardise C/C++ implementations
of OSGi. The goal of this is to be able to reuse bundles from other OSGi like
implementations. Also working together might attract more users/committers.
The talks are attended by a good group of people, and reactions are positive.

How has the project developed since the last report?

A first release has been made. After struggling with several problems,
consensus has been reached to solve these in a next release.  On a technical
note, Celix now also compiles and runs on Win32 platforms.

Shepherd notes:
Dave Fisher: Celix has a release. It looks like they have a good, but
small community.  Roman is a new Mentor which Celix needed. I think
that they need to identify a couple more committers and they can push
for graduation. I think that they are on the verge and hope to see
graduation sometime in 2013.

--------------------
Chukwa

Chukwa is a log collection and analysis framework for Apache Hadoop
clusters.

Chukwa has been incubating since 2010-07-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Added a new policy page for how to contribute to Chukwa at:
     http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Chukwa_How_To_Contribute
  2. Added irc channel to improve interaction among developers
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

A retiring voting thread on Chukwa mailing list, and the voting
passed.  A second vote thread in Incubator mailing list was cancelled.
After further discussion, there are activities on Chukwa community
from contributors, and there is only a few contributors voiced to
continue.  William A Rowe Jr and Chris Douglas have resigned from
mentor position.  Bill resigned to reduce excessive participation in
too many communties.  Chris resigned in protest of difference in
opinion of Chukwa graduation/retirement decision.  There were
important discussions in Chukwa private, and incubator list, which
mentors did not agree on the community activity can meet graduation.
The worry of growth has taken it's toll in Chukwa community in the
past 2 years.  New plans are recommended from Alan Cabrera to plan for
what the community want to do in 2013.
 
How has the community developed since the last report?

The development activities is near the same level as the last report,
incremental and small improvements.

How has the project developed since the last report?

We added new JMX adaptor to stream monitoring metrics from Java
process.  A small number of bug fixes, and planning for the following
changes in 2013:

- Primary focus is to collect Hadoop and related technology log files and
  metrics
- Add web UI for showing a list of running adaptors
- Add web UI for showing status of data streams written to destination
- Consolidate Agent and Collector features to use Chukwa Agent as the
  primary process for data collection 
- Replace SequenceFileWriter with WebHDFS support, discuss if changing
  sequence file format to avro make sense

Retirement? How much more time to see if the community redevelops?

--------------------
CloudStack

CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastructure as a Service”) cloud orchestration
platform.

CloudStack has been incubating since 2012-04-16.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Continuing to build the community and increase diversity, while
     effectively managing the overall scale of the project.
  2. Ensuring all deliberation, decision-making, and development is
     happening openly and collaboratively.
  3. Transfer trademark, etc. to Apache

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No issues at this time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have noticed a trend of features for CloudStack being developed
  outside of the Apache CloudStack community and "thrown over the
  wall." We are identifying features that may not have been developed
  appropriately and requiring contributors to either demonstrate that
  they have been discussed and developed in the open, or requiring IP
  clearance for those features. We have also opened discussion about
  this on the -dev mailing list and ensuring that committers
  understand the obligations to development in the open.

  The project has continuted to grow and has added several new PPMC
  members and committers since October:

  - Edison Su, Alex Huang, Hugo Trippaers, Chiradeep Vittal, and
    Joe Brockmeier have joined the PPMC since October.

  - Rohit Yadav, Marcus Sorensen, Gavin Lee, Sudha Ponnaganti, Kelcey
    Damage, Min Chen, and Sebastien Goasguen have become committers.

  Members of the CloudStack community have been active in promoting the
  project since the last report, with members giving talks about Apache
  CloudStack at USENIX LISA, CPOSC, ApacheCon EU, LinuxCon EU, and other
  events.

  The CloudStack Collaboration Conference (sponsored primarily by
  Citrix) was a fairly successful first conference. More than 300
  people attended the event, held November 30 - December 2 in Las
  Vegas at The Venetian.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The first release, 4.0.0-incubating, was announced on November 6th.

  The CloudStack.org domain now points to Apache infrastructure.

  4.0.1 and 4.1.0 are currently in development. The community has
  decided to work on a time-based release cycle for feature releases,
  with 4.1.0 expected at the beginning of April. Feature releases will
  follow a four-month cycle thereafter.

Shepherd notes:
  Looks great! Progress is still needed on the mentioned issues,
  but there seem to be no major, insurmountable obstacles on the
  way to graduation.

--------------------
DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information,
images and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices,
e.g. smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that
data, APIs will also be created to use and manage it.

DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Integrate and release the OpenDDR code and data donations
  2. Integrate additional data sources for device identification
  3. Grow the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No issues

How has the community developed since the last report?

Still very low activity, but signs of improvements with some proposals for
concrete work, that need to be turned into code.

How has the project developed since the last report?

No notable progress in terms of code, some community activity but
minimal for now.

Some proposals have been made around creating services for device
identification and using various (noSQL and other) backends for device
data.

Shepherd notes:
  Third consecutive quarter with low activity. There's some improvement
  over the previous quarter, as mentioned in the report, but turning that
  into sustainable community activity may take some effort (or luck). Is
  there anything the broader Incubator community could do to help? 

--------------------
Drill

Project Summary:

Drill is a distributed system for interactive analysis of large-scale
datasets, inspired by Google's Dremel.

Drill has been incubating since 2012-08-11.


Issues:

Discussions on these key areas were __very focused__ and productive toward
this project's graduation goals:

Healthy discussion of target use cases from the community

New Syntax Interpreter

Continued Logical Plan Syntax discussion & development (with focus on JSON)

Leveraging existing ideas/lessons learned from Optiq, LucidDB, DynamoBI,
Eigenbase and Saffron

How has the community & project developed since the last report:

User interest has slowed due to the Holiday season but discussion on the
the above topics is healthy. Commit and list activity are consistent with
the above. Development is continuing onward.

An addition of employer supported contributor to the project.

New users continue to ask to be formally part of this project.

On going discussion with schema-less data scanners amongst the project
members.

There is some cause for concern due to a drift toward isolated
development of components with less on-list discussion than before.
We will work to encourage more public styles of work.

--------------------
EasyAnt

Easyant is a build system based on Apache Ant and Apache Ivy.

EasyAnt has been incubating since 2011-01-31.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. doing a release: it will show that the EasyAnt committers are
     dedicated to maintain it and keep it going
  2. shortly after that, ask the Ant PMC again to accept EasyAnt as a
     subproject
  3. if accepted, EasyAnt could then leave the Incubator.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No progress. There was only one thread on the mailing list. That
  thread from few days ago was about releasing.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, there was some activities on svn. A release
  is scheduled just after the Apache Ivy one (EasyAnt has a dependency
  on it), Ivy release which is under way.

--------------------
Hadoop Development Tools

Eclipse based tools for developing applications on the Hadoop platform.

Entered 11/09/2012

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
- Migrate current code from Hadoop contrib, fill podlings.xml.
- Porting and releasing existing codebase to support multiple versions of
  Hadoop in a single IDE instance. During this time building understanding of
  the Apache processes around working and releasing.
- Grow the podling community in terms of users and contributors.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?
- None

How has the community developed since the last report?
- All committers have completed ICLAs.
- Project infrastructure (git repository, website, wiki) up and open
  for business.
- IP clearance is done since the incoming code is from existing Apache
  sources (Hadoop).

How has the project developed since the last report?
- We are now open for business and ready to get going migrating and porting
  the code.

Helix

Apache Helix is a generic cluster management framework used to build
distributed systems and provides automatic partition management, fault
tolerance and elasticity.

Helix has been incubating since 2012-10-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make a release, taking longer than expected. Lack of Apache process
     experience in making releases apart from mentors.
  2. Develop user community and increase adoption.
  3. Come up with tutorial/use cases where Helix can be used out of
     the box.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
None

How has the community developed since the last report?
- users +2
- little activity on user mailing list. Hopefully release should help.
- Current integration
-- S4.
-- In talks with Archiva, Bigtop on potential integration.

How has the project developed since the last report?
-- Issues (11 created, 8 resolved)
-- Additional recipes ( distributed lock manager )
-- Work on standalone Helix agent.

JSPWiki

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

JSPWiki has been incubating since 2007-09-17.

Most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. community and IPMC graduation vote
  2. resolution acceptance

However, we feel that in this period we've strongly advanced towards
graduation (cfr. below).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No such issues

How has the community developed since the last report?

- 4 patches incorporated into trunk
- new mentor - Siegfried Goeschl
- vote to ask Glen Mazza (gmazza@apache.org) as PPMC & committer
  passed, with Glen agreeing to join in.
- The traffic on jspwiki-dev has kept growing these months, whereas the
  traffic at jspwiki-user has remained more or less the same.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  2. A release
  3. Build dev and PMC.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

Mesos

Mesos is a cluster manager that provides resource sharing and
isolation across cluster applications.

Mesos has been incubating since 2010-12-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. Add more committers (see "issues" below).
2. Do more releases (see "issues" below).
3. Grow community (do more meetups and try and get more people interested
in hacking on codebase rather than just using the software).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

We've had issues getting enough votes for adding committers and doing
releases. We recently added a new mentor (thank you Jakob Homan!) who
promptly helped out on one of our stalled releases, but we still have yet
to conclude a committer vote (to be clear, the vote has received unanimous
+1's from all existing committers, but nothing from any mentors).

How has the community developed since the last report?

We performed a "meetup" at AirBnB which drew a large crowd. The mailing
list continued to be active in December. People are generally interested
and excited about the project, but we have not gotten very many developers
working in the codebase. We hope to rectify this in the coming months by
holding some developer specific meetups to talk about working on and
contributing to the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

There were a considerable number of bug fixes, especially around the use of
Linux cgroups for doing resource isolation. There was also a lot of work
done on the slave/worker component of the system to enable upgrading Mesos
without killing all tasks/processes that it is managing. See
https://reviews.apache.org/dashboard/?view=to-group&group=mesos.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community, especially attracting new developers.

  2. Successfully complete another podling release. 

  3. Hold an informal graduation readiness vote.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

Shepherd notes:

--------------------
Tashi

Tashi originally encompassed just the tools to manage virtual machines
using Xen and QEMU, but has been merged with Zoni, which manages the
physical aspects of a cluster like power control, network settings and
handing out physical machines.

Activities from October to December:

In the period from October to December, the project did not ask to make
another incubating release, but is ready to start the process for a new
release incorporating the development efforts of the last 6 months.

This period was dedicated to testing and performance testing of the system.

Minor updates to the code include adding support for sub-domains
within Tashi.  Also some bug fixes to the recently imported code from
a collaborator.  Next efforts will be to more tightly integrate the
physical and virtual aspects of the system as well as create a front
end UI.


The project has a user community, but it is small. Growth mostly has
happened by word of mouth. To show potential users at large the utility
of this project, the author of this report is creating web pages to
demonstrate how to accomplish distributed computing tasks. Base images
of (free) OS installs will be provided to allow new users to get started
quickly. Hopefully this will increase visibility of the project.

Items to be resolved before graduation:
    * Generate more publicity for the project.
    * Develop members of the user community to submit feature
      extensions.

(no signoffs)

--------------------
VXQuery

A standards compliant XML Query processor.

VXQuery has been incubating since 2009-07-06.

The most important issue to address in the move towards graduation is the
first release. The release preparations had started before the October
report, but they were not completed as the release manager was not able
to work on the release artifacts during November and December.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
There currently is only one active mentor (Jochen), which could be a
problem for the release vote.

How has the community developed since the last report?
no changes

How has the project developed since the last report?
There has been progress on the creation and execution of parallel plans
for XQueries and some issues around the creation of release artifact have
been resolved.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

Apache Isis graduated from the incubator in Oct 2012.  This is the third of
the monthly reports required for three months post-graduation.


Project Description:

Apache Isis is a framework to enable the creation of software using
domain-driven design principles, being an implementation of the naked
objects architectural pattern


Community / Development:

We believe we have now completed our work to transition to a TLP.  In
particular, our most important content from our old incubator website
has been moved over to our new CMS-based site [1], and the incubator
site [2] now redirects to the TLP site.  The last of the incubator
metadata pertaining to Isis has been updated [3].

Following on from last month, we have now restructured our codebase in
order to support more frequent releases [4].

We have had a few new correspondents on our users mailing list.


Releases:

As hoped, we made our first release of Isis as a TLP just before Xmas [5].
This consisted of our new core module, 4 components, and 1 archetype:

* Isis Core 1.0.0
* Isis JDO Object Store 1.0.0
* Isis Wicket Viewer 1.0.0
* Isis RestfulObjects Viewer 1.0.0
* Isis File-based Security 1.0.0
* Quickstart (Wicket/Restful/JDO) archetype 1.0.0

Since Xmas we have released one further module and an update to the
archetype:

* Isis Shiro-based Security 1.0.0
* Quickstart (Wicket/Restful/JDO) archetype 1.0.1

This would seem to have validated the work we did to be able to push
out more frequent releases.


Project Branding:

We have checked the branding on our site [1] as per ASF guidelines [6] and
made a number of small changes in order to comply.

Our old incubator site [2] that had invalid/out-of-date branding has
now been retired.


Issues:

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

The Apache JMeter desktop application is a pure Java application
designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance.

The project now uses svnpubsub for releases and for the website.

Work continues on fixing bugs and making improvements which will
feed into the next release in due course.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
the committers.

There are no board level issues at this time

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed pub/sub system for efficiently collecting and
delivering a large number of messages to both offline and online systems.

Development
===========
We are actively testing Kafka 0.8 (supports intra-cluster replication)
and fixing blocking issues that show up. We expect to release 0.8
towards the end of Jan.

Community
===========
Lots of activities in the mailing list. kafka-user has 241 emails in
Dec (down from 335 in Nov, mostly due to the holidays). kafka-dev has
498 emails in Dec (up from 448 in Nov). More patches are being
contributed by non-committers.

Infrastructure
===========
This is the second month since Kafka became a top-level project. Apache
infra has helped us migrate the website and move from svn to git.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Jake Mannix]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Olivier Lamy]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build
lifecycle.

* General Information

The PMC noticed that it had not, historically, been placing releases
for plugins and components into the Apache dist area. All the current
releases have been published on dist, all the historical releases have
been handed off to the infrastructure team to be published on the
dist archive, and the release procedure documentation has been
updated to ensure that new releases end up on /dist.

Main website has been moved to CMS/svnpubsub and components
documentation to svnpubsub (without CMS). Tweaks have been found to
limit the content in main site's extpaths.txt to make main site
publish efficient. We still suffer from severe performance issues with
component documentation publication and we are working on workarounds
in our publication process to improve.

* New PMC Members

* New Committers

* Releases

* Plugins

  * Maven Source Plugin 2.2.1 (2012-10-13)

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache MINA Project  [Emmanuel Lecharny]

Apache MINA is a network application framework which helps users
develop high performance and high scalability network applications
easily.

Releases
--------

No new release since the last report

Community
---------

* The last ApacheCon Europe has been a very good opportunity for some
MINA committers to meet (Julien, Bernd and Emmanuel). We spent quite
some valuable time discussing about new features and technical challenges
for the next versions.

* No new committers or PMC changes.

* After a slight decrease of subscribed people on the dev list, we 
see an increase since 2011.

 Development
-----------

* MINA 3 is having a lot more activity those last few months. We now
have a working TCP client and server, which is 50% faster than MINA 2
and 30% faster than Netty. We are currently working on some new features
and improvements.

* MINA 2 code has been cleaned up, but we don't feel like it worthful to
create a new release.

* The CMS web site is now fully operational, and we switched to svnpubsub
for all the releases. Everything is now on track.

* We have voted the migration from SVN to GIT. All MINA projects are
now only available under GIT.

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Julien Nioche]

Apache Nutch is an open source web-search software project. Stemming from
Apache Lucene, it now builds on Apache Solr adding web-specifics, such as
a crawler, a link-graph database and parsing support handled by Apache Tika
for HTML and an array of other document formats.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Nutch 1.6 has been released since the last report. There have been quite a 
few improvements and issues fixed since on both trunk and the 2.x branches.
There is currently a discussion about a Nutch Admin GUI using Wicket.

COMMUNITY

The traffic on the user and dev mailing lists has kept a relatively high
level in the last quarter. Julien Nioche gave a talk about Nutch at
the ApacheCon Europe in November [http://s.apache.org/ndp] and
did an interview for InfoQ about Nutch 2 [http://s.apache.org/Sz9].
Julien also talked to the people from the CommonCrawl project 
[http://commoncrawl.org/] about getting them to contribute some of their
code to Apache Nutch and get them to use it for their crawls. No tangible 
results yet.

No new Committers or PMC Members since the previous report but a vote is
under way for inviting Tejas Patil to become a committer and PMC member.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Tammo van Lessen]

# Apache ODE
Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes 
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services, 
sending and receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error 
recovery as described by your process definition. It supports both long 
and short living process executions to orchestrate all the services that 
are part of your application.

## Status
This was again a quiet development period. We still have some
development items on our agenda, e.g. the OModel refactoring,
backporting features from our experimental branch. We decided to keep
the 1.3.x branch as a stable branch and to address the root of the
backwards compatibility issues in trunk, which is supposed to become
ODE 2.0 then. Once this is stabilized, we will focus on providing a
migration tool for process instances from 1.3.x to 2.0.

## Release
No release to report in this quarter.

## Development
No significant development progress to report. We have migrated the 
Confluence-powered website to the ASF CMS.

## Community
We had some very interesting discussions about a potential
collaboration at ACEU. As a result, we now have a new committer,
Hadrian Zbarcea, who is now climbing down to the engine room, cleaning
up our virtual processing unit.  We have also voted Sathwik Bantwal
Premakumar to be a committer. He provided a lot of great patches.

## Project Branding Board Report Checklist
We moved to the ASF CMS and also to a new template that should now comply 
with the branding requirements. (Warning: unicode characters ahead)

 * Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org ✔ 
 * Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc. ✔ 
 * Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included ✔
 * Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in
   footers, etc. ✔ 
 * Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your
   site ✔
 * Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date ✔


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Report from the Apache TomEE (OpenEJB) Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

A rename of the project from OpenEJB to TomEE is mostly complete.  The
committee-info.txt updated, lists migrated, permission groups renamed, etc.
All that remains are minor details.  A logo contest was organized and
announced late November and has now officially closed as of January 15th.
Around 27 logos where submitted.

TomEE 1.5.1 and OpenEJB 4.5.1 were released in mid December.  The
community is very happy to get a stable minor release.  This is also a
bit of a milestone for the project as the first release of trunk to
happen so quickly -- 2 months -- and is a positive trend in the right
direction.  Most trunk releases have taken 4-6 months.  Discussion has
started on queuing up another release for the end of January.

As can be implied by the stable releases from trunk, the large part of
developer activity is focused on digesting and incorporating the
overwhelming amount of feedback we're getting which is mostly of the
bugfix to improvement variety.  As these things go there's a short
window till the next major spec round and the community of users and
developers is focused on the right thing -- maturing the codebase.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AG: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Pinaki Poddar]

There are no items requiring board attention at this time.

* Highlights
   Apache OpenJPA provides POJO persistence for stand-alone JSE, JEE   
   container and many other lightweight frameworks, such as Tomcat,  
   Spring or OSGi.
   
* Community

   Mailing lists continue to be active and many applications are
   migrating from other vendors to OpenJPA. 

   The developer community had maintained the codebase stable, 
   supported for previous releases and backported resolved defects. 
   
   New features (auditing, access pattern tracker) are implemented 
   by the community of developers.
 
   Helen Xu of IBM has joined the project as a committer.

* Governance

    We continue to monitor contributors for possible committers and
    PMC members. 

* Releases

   No new releases since last report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AH: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

Issues for Board Awareness

None at this time.

Community Development/Outreach Progress

Recruiting new volunteers for the project through announcements on
the website is proving very effective. The current effort, after a
successful call for translation volunteers, is aimed at finding Quality
Assurance volunteers willing to help with early testing of OpenOffice
4.0, due later in 2013. The volunteers mailing lists keep growing in
traffic and diversity of posters.

We continue to use social networking accounts – Google +, Facebook – to
collect feedback and ideas from our user base. A Google+ community was
recently started. An initiative called "Ask OpenOffice" was run to
collect the top 10 non-support questions from our users, which were then
discussed on the dev mailing list and answered in a blog post.

We have several volunteers ready to attend FOSDEM (February 2013,
Brussels, Belgium) where the Apache OpenOffice project will have a
dedicated track for developers ("devroom") and a stand for the whole
conference. We also submitted talks for the ApacheCon NA in Portland
and we'll have several volunteers attending it too.

Project Development Progress

The graduation process can be considered complete. All relevant
resources have been fully migrated.

The next OpenOffice release will be labelled 4.0. Plans are to release
around April 2013. Volunteers have taken responsibility for the major
new features, which are being documented for developers and for users
on the project wiki.

The project prepared test snapshots for new languages of OpenOffice
3.4.1 (the current stable version), with the aim of releasing at least
8 new languages in late January. The project will release an update to
the 3.4.1 sources (including the new translation resources) and binary
packages for the added languages only.

Community support forums remain popular with users.
The mailing lists for user support and localization are quite active,
and those for QA and marketing are fast growing. As Apache OpenOffice
is a client product, we continue to investigate ways to direct users to
appropriate support venues. The developer list, ooo-dev, remains very
active.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

Apache Struts is an action-based Java web application framework.

The Struts team made two releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.7 - Improvements and bugfixes (2012-11-20)
* Struts 2.3.8 - Performance improvements (2012-12-22)

The Struts project was represented at ApacheCon EU in November. PMC
members Johannes Geppert and René Gielen gave a talk on Struts 2, which
seemed to be well received.

We are currently in the discussion to switch parts of the development
from Subversion to Git.

The Struts project web site hasn't yet moved to the new CMS / SvnPubSub
infrastructure. We were notified by infra on 2012-12-10 that this
migration is now due. The Struts team worked out it's desired migration
path and filed a corresponding JIRA issue for infra support on
2012-12-15 [1]. We are now working with infra to proceed on that issue.

In the last quarter Martin Cooper (martinc) decided to go emeritus on
the Struts PMC. No new committers or PMC members were added in this period.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiricco]

Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities
in enterprise environments, implemented in JEE technology.


Status

We are receiving some considerable contributions from new people: if
they will keep with this in a consistent way over some time, we will
start discussing about offering committership.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.


Community

user@ ML activity is raising, with new users evaluating the project and
asking questions: currently 45 subscribers, including 4 archive / non
human addresses.
dev@ ML activity is quite consistent: currently 40 subscribers,
including 4 archive / non human addresses.

Some new contributors are helping with code re-organization and
migration of REST interfaces from Spring MVC to Apache CXF.

No changes in committers / PMC members were made.


Releases

We released the first version after graduation (1.0.4) last Dec 10th.

While some bugfixing is still going into the 1_0_X branch, most of
development effort is devoted to next major release 1.1.0 that will
introduce some relevant new features.

The migration of REST interfaces from Spring MVC to Apache CXF has been
discussed and targeted to release 1.2.0, while some preparatory work is
already being part of 1.1.0.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features
high productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific
performance.

Mailing list activity remains constant at about 1000 messages per month.

After a long delay, Tapestry is now again building correctly on the
Jenkins CI server.

Great progress has been made on Tapestry 5.4, which is primarily
concerned with significant improvements to Tapestry's client-side
JavaScript. Two early alpha preview releases have been made available.

We are currently in the process of migrating the website to svnpubsub.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Massimo Manghi]

 Apache Tcl is an umbrella for Tcl-Apache integration efforts. Current 
projects are

 * mod_tcl
 * Rivet
 * Websh

Community:

 Apache Tcl was established in 2000 and during the long life 
of the project several mailing lists lost their interest
and became inactive. We got them removed and concentrated 
everything on 'rivet-dev' and 'websh-dev'. We also got the 
list moderators reassigned.

 We are about to complete the transition of our website to svnpubsub.

Development and releases:

 + Rivet: On Dec 1st 2012 Rivet 2.1.0 and Rivet 2.0.6 were released.
Rivet 2.1 comes with new commands and features and some important
reorganization. We applied several fixes for bugs that had been 
opened on Bugzilla. 
Rivet 2.0.6 is a bugfix release of version 2.0 and includes the 
bugfixes applicable to this module's version. We are still 
supporting 2.0, we will take a decision about how long we 
will support it.

 + Websh: no relevant activity to be reported

 + mod_tcl: no activity to be reported. mod_tcl has no active maintainer

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Dave Meikle]

What is Tika?  
========================= 
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information
from, a growing a list over 1200 different file types including most
of the major types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images,
Video, Code, and science data) as recognised by IANA and other
standards bodies.

Issues
=========================
There are no issues that needs the boards attention.

Releases
========================= 
Work continues on version 1.3 with 47 resolved and 18 open/in progress
JIRA tickets adding new features and providing bug fixes, with a
discussion thread underway to assess the need for a new release.

Community 
========================= 
No new committers or PMC members were added since the last report.

Jukka Zitting presented a session at ApacheCon EU titled "Content
Extraction With Apache Tika" [1].

Mailing list activity on dev@ was at 124, 109 and 21 messages in
November, December 2012 and January 2013, respectively. user@ was at
19, 18 and 6 messages, during the same timeframe.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Greg Reddin]

Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the
development of web application user interfaces.

The Tiles project had an extremely slow quarter with no community
changes and no releases. Mailing list activity was at a trickle until
the very end of the period. At that time a few user-related questions
were asked and answered and there was some activity on the dev@ list
about switching over to the svnpubsub website architecture. The
website migration was not completed by the deadline set by
infrastructure. Work to implement this is still underway.

Overall, it seems that interest in Tiles is slowing again, but has not
come to a complete standstill. We should monitor over the next few
quarters to see what happens before making any decisions about the
future.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the board's attention.


Community
=========

Two new committers were added since the last report, bringing us to a
total of 33 active committers. The mailing lists are seeing less growth
than previous quarters:

    users@   - 328 subscribers (up 1% since last report)
    dev@     - 231 subscribers (up 5% since last report)


An introduction to Apache Traffic Server was presented at ApacheCon-EU
in November. Two ATS presentations were accepted to ACNA-13, and one
plugin authoring tutorial session is scheduled. Many of our committers
are attending ACNA13, and we look forward to meet and hack with the
communities.

A Usenix LISA presentation on the topic of choosing HTTP intermediaries,
including ATS, was given in December.


Releases
========

No releases since last report, but we have two releases planned for the
very near future.
