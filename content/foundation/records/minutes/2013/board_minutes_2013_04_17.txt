 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       I announced this year's members meeting, which will be held on
       IRC this May 21st and 23rd at 10:30am Pacific.

    B. President [Jim]

       I presented a Keynote at POSSCON 2013 regarding "Licensing, Governance,
       Community and more". Copies of the slides can be found at:

          http://www.slideshare.net/jimjag/three-shallbe

       At present there are no issues with the running of the foundation.
       All presidents' committees are working well, with the normal expected
       delays due to volunteer cycles. To alleviate this I plan on ramping
       up the involvement of our EA to better track and assist these cmmts.

       I will work with Upayavira and Chris to ensure that Upayavira has
       the view into payment's rec'd to support his fundraising activities
       (as requested by Upayavira).

       The proposed ASF 2013-2014 budget is ready for discussion and
       approval. The board will note that our overall expenses are slightly
       down from last year.

       Branding is quite busy but handling the load well. Fundraising has
       an issue which I'll be tracking, and it's referred to above.
       Concom is taking the number of suggestions and comments provided
       by the board and the President/EVP into consideration, and are
       making the required changes to implement those, including a "refocus"
       of the cmmt and a clean-up of the mailing lists. I anticipate
       some discussion of all this at the board meeting. There are no
       issues with TAC. I received no report from Infra. This follows
       a somewhat disappointing reaction to the budget call. As per
       the agreed upon work-flow, I ask the VP of Infra to see where
       the problems are and to address the problems.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       Fairly low activity this month.

       Contracted Natasha Livingston with CSC to bring Delaware Annual
       Report in good standing for the Foundation, and to pay for their
       annual service. Annual report checked into the SVN financials repo.

       Obtained account information and forwarded to Jim for yet another
       inquiry into the SVN trademark -- Jim told them that according to
       our records the funds were sent.  On the first inquiry, the law
       firm registrant claims that a wire transfer was sent to their account
       at HSBC Bank which is closed since 2011. On the second inquiry, the
       registrant claims that the wire transfer was sent to the intermediary
       account at Citibank NY, not to the beneficiary account at Citibank
       SA Brasil.

       Obtained 1099 forms from IRS - 5 copies in case anyone else needed
       one - for Melissa. Forms will be en route to IRS.

       Sam processed an ACNA 2013 registration reimbursement.

       Redhat notified us of an address change to their corporate office.

       Sam processed Bill pay for InterVision Systems.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       March was a busy month for document recording, with 69 ICLAs, four CCLAs,
       and four grants received and filed. There are still people who believe
       that they can write additional terms on Schedule A or Schedule B of CCLAs
       and these need special handling.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       A little work helping VP ComDev evaluate a mentoring programme proposal
       referred by Sam. Luciano quickly took over discussions and recently
       indicated they are nearing completion. 

       I was scheduled to participate in a panel at OSCON discussing
       the various foundation models. However, Noirin Plunkett had
       also signed up to represent the ASF. I therefore stepped down
       in order to make way for Noirin.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       Nothing to report for this month.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

No board level issues.  The trademarks@ list has had a very busy month.  

Along with a number of podling name searches with a variety of questions, 
Christian Grobmeier and others worked to centralize an ASF-wide name search 
procedure.  With the growth of the ASF and the wide number of ASF products 
and even sub-projects having such a large impact on the technology industry, 
we will need to be correspondingly careful when selecting new product 
brands for our many Apache projects.

Early draft merchandising guidelines are being discussed; with so many projects 
in different areas we need to provide much better and simpler guidelines for 
the many volunteers and respectful organizations that simply want to give away 
t-shirts and swag with Apache project logos on them.  This is a recurring 
question that we need a better way to answer.

Infra created the vp-brand@ alias which is saved to a restricted archive, 
which will be used for legal privileged conversations with counsel.

Brand Management submitted the same budget request as last year.  While we 
under-ran our budget last year, we do expect (now that we have experience 
with how long things take) to use most of the budget this year.

The Apache UIMA project has agreed to change the name of their newly created 
TextMarker sandbox component to avoid a potential legal conflict with a 
long-established and registered product name from the European company 
SoftMaker. It is important to understand that this is a unique situation, 
and in *no* way serves as a precedent for other Apache project name choices.

It is clear from the wide variety of third party software products using 
the Hadoop name that we need to work with the vendor community to make 
some changes to ensure the Apache Hadoop project gets the credit it deserves.
Apologies to the Apache Hadoop PMC for the delay in working through a plan 
with them after conferring with counsel from DLAPiper; I've been quite 
sick on and off for a few weeks.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Upayavira]

We have been approached by two companies offering us new sponsorships,
one gold, one silver.

I have been considering the operation of ASF fundraising, and some of
the issues that I see with it. I wish to address them here.

The most significant issue in fundraising is the lack of visibility into
incoming payments. As VP Fundraising, I need to have real-time access to
payment information. Without such real-time access of some kind, I am
coming to the conclusion that it is not viable for me to continue in
this role.

Also, whilst we have some basic tools for tracking sponsors, they
require quite a bit of attention, and the information we keep needs a
lot of updating. I am finding it very hard to both keep the information
up-to-date, and follow up sponsor renewals. I am therefore going to
suggest that I focus on keeping info up-to-date, whilst soliciting
volunteers to actually chase sponsors for renewal. I will happily
undertake the invoicing and payment tracking part of the process, and
will aim to keep complexity for volunteers to a minimum. I will seek
volunteers for each sponsor as their renewal becomes needed. If you are
prepared to take on contacting a single sponsor on occasion, please let
me know.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain ahead of plans and under budget. No vendor payments
  are due at this time. The proposed budget for FY 2013-2014 was submitted
  to Jim Jagielski on 13 March.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings are planned.
  Sally Khudairi has spoken with an existing Sponsor regarding a possible
  submission to the Incubator, as well as a possible new ASF Sponsor who is
  also interested in submitting a project to the Incubator.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via
  the newswire, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
  time period:

-9 April: The Apache Software Foundation Community Development Project
          Welcomes Student Proposals for Google Summer of Code 2013

  feed. No new posts were made on the @ApacheCon Twitter feed or
  "TheApacheFoundation" account on YouTube.

V. Future Announcements: no announcements are currently planned. PMCs
  wishing to announce major project news —as well as podlings ready to
  graduate from the Incubator— are welcome to contact Sally at
  press@apache.org for more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks'
  notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: Sally responded to 11 media requests and 3 requests
  for project graphics/logos (she created new "Community Partner" graphics
  for a request from an Apache project training event). The ASF received
  1,615 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count of
  1,203.

VII. Analyst Relations: no formal briefings are planned. Apache was
  mentioned in 9 reports by Gartner, 1 report by Forrester, 11 write-ups by
  GigaOM, and 14 reports by 451 Research.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [Sam Ruby]

Attachment 5: Report from the Apache Conference Planning Project  [Nick Burch]

Small Events
------------
A BarCamp was held in Bangalore a few weekends ago, which was largely a
success, especially considering it was our first event in India. It is hoped
that more events will happen in the area in future, and that other
organisers can learn from what went well, and less well

Planning continues for a number of US events for later in the year. An email
was sent out to all committers about upcoming BarCamps, from which a few new
volunteers for planned events have been found

Spare mentor capacity exists for when any of these events feel they have
reached the point of needing it.

It seems to be generally felt that the current documentation is holding back
potential small event organisers from reaching the point of requesting
mentors, and means extra mentor work for those rare few who do get there. In
addition, an emphasis on finding supplies and sponsorship for the first
event in an area/of a type has been identified as putting a lot of people
off.

Because of this, the budget proposal for this coming year is a little
different to in the past, as we hope to make it easier for the first event
of a type/location to occur. (The hurdle is the first one). In addition, we
are planning a mixed in-person + online weekend to try to turn the current
incomplete "event in a box" documentation on the wiki into a finalised and
ready-to-use set of instructions on our website. We hope this all combined
will lead to many more small events occurring

ApacheCons
----------
A number of ACNA sponsors were incorrectly given the full attendee list, due
to a mixup at The Open Bastion, which lead to a number of emails going out
to attendees. TOB believe all sponsors have now got rid of the list and
won't use it going forward. TOB have implemented tweaks to prevent this
occurring again, and intend to send out an apology soon.

Final numbers have yet to be produced for ACNA, but are expected soon.

Very little feedback has been received on the discussions + minutes on the
future of ApacheCon meeting from Portland. The plan will therefore be to
produce a new RFP for a producer for Europe, building on the experiences of
ACEU12+ACNA13, hopefully over the next few weeks, and work with TOB on a
future ACNA.

Committee
---------
Several years after first suggested by the board, we are planning to
massively cull the number of lists we have. A plan for what goes where has
been discussed by the committee and approved. We intend to document the new
structure and ask Infra to make the required changes soon

A special order has been submitted to the board to rename the VP position
and associated committee, to better match what the roles are (and aren't!)
covered by them.

Following discussions, several people who helped with ACEU12 and ACNA13 have
been approached to see if they have the cycles+interest in joining the
committee


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

The Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) exists to help those that would
like to attend ApacheCon events, but are unable to do so for financial
reasons.

Committee
---------
No new members or changes to TAC.

ApacheCon NA 13 Follow up
-------------------------
Formal post-event surveys were issued and are now being chased up.
The idea here is to gather feedback from TAC recipients in an effort
to improve process organization and execution within TAC. This will
be on going over time and we hope to report on the feedback at next
reporting window.

Future Events
-------------
There are no future events we're currently committed to helping. We stand
ready to help once ConCom finalise their future ApacheCon plans, and we
have the budget + volunteer energy to help with a smaller event, if the
organisers of such a gathering need our help.

Budget
----------

We are awaiting figures from EA on what we spent at ACNA (in turn the EA
may be waiting). Either way, we'll have a budget projection ready in time
for the requests deadline.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]

Apache Airavata is a software framework to construct, execute, and 
manage long running applications and workflows on distributed 
computing resources.

== Releases ==

Airavata 0.6 was released on January 30th 2013.

The release vote for Airavata 0.7 version was called on April 11th 2013. 
The VOTE is called after extensive testing on 5 RC's. 

== Activity ==

The mailing list, jira and commit activity remains very high. Community is
currently voting on two policies for following a 6 week release cycle and
to adopt Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology.  

== Community ==

Airavata experimenting to better align GSoC projects with mainstream
development. During the GSoC community bonding period, the students are
being encouraged to first follow along the tutorials and get fully
comfortable with the code base. Secondly a release is called out with a
focus on JIRA competition. All potential GSoC students are encouraged to
bring out as many bugs as possible and the PMC is committed to do virtual
hackathon's to close out these JIRA's teaching students along the way to
contribute patches and documentation. These approaches are nicely helping
to identify students who have interest in the project itself and not just
the GSoC program.

== Outreach ==

Co-ordinated by Google India University Programs, Suresh Marru has given
virtual google hangout talks on Apache, GSOC and Airavata. The focus of
the talks is to encourage students to apply for GSOC at Apache and make
use of the opportunity to go beyond the summer projects and contribute to
open source. The response is good with Airavata attracting interest from
15 students from premier academic institutions. Sample slides are at -
http://www.slideshare.net/smarru/gsoc-iiitkgp.

== Infrastructure ==

There are no infrastructure issues.

== Other Issues ==

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

2.7.4  (Apr 2, 2013)

Apache CXF Fediz - 1.0.3 released.  (Feb 22, 2013)

Apache CXF DOSGi 1.4 released. (Jan 22, 2013)


Committer/PMC:
No changes this period.  
Last changes:  2 new PMC members and 1 committer were added for our 
    January 2013 report.

Security updates:
Two security vulnerabilities were made public this quarter and added 
to http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.html 
* CVE-2012-5633 - was fixed and released last period, but not made public 
                  until January.
* CVE-2013-0239 - was fixed this quarter and released and made public.

Community update:
We started some discussions around whether to go with a 2.8 version 
or jump to 3.0.   Some of the reason was due to the uncertainty around 
the TCK situation and what restrictions and limitations that is going 
to place on us.    Some refactoring is going on in both the Fediz and 
DOSGi sub projects based on some feedback.   Basically, a lot of 
questions being asked and answered, several discussions going on, lots 
of new features being working on, and of course lots of bugs being 
fixed.   All good.   :-)

Attachment O: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Myrna van Lunteren]

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 * DdlUtils : a small, easy-to-use component for working with
                  Database Definition (DDL) files.
 * Derby    : an open source relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 * JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
                  testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
                  persistence.
 * Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

-- Status --
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

-- Activities over the last quarter --
* Torque has released version 4.0.
* Derby is testing version 10.10.1.
* Branding: the Derby web pages were checked for the first step of
  the Branding requirements - links were put in to point to the Apache
  pages. This was already in place for the top level (DB) project page.
* The Derby wiki pages have become a target of spammers.
  The community has decided to lock the wiki down and only allow
  changes by approved editors.
* The PMC has not take any further action regarding moving DdlUtils
  to the Attic - it was discussed before the October report.

-- Community --
No PMC changes since August 2011.
No new committers since August 2010.

-- Releases --
- Torque version 4.0 was released
- releases testing/voting in progress for Derby 10.10.1.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Deltacloud Project  [David Lutterkort]

Deltacloud defines a web service API for interacting with cloud service
providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In
addition, it consists of a number of implementations of this API for the
most popular clouds. It also provides an implementation of DMTF CIMI,
and tools around that API to help make it more easily consumable.

There are no issues for board consideration

-- Releases/Development --

1.1.3 - in progress
1.1.2 - 2013-03-13
1.1.1 - 2013-02-13
1.1.0 - 2013-01-15

Work on 'classic' Deltacloud API, DMTF CIMI frontend, and related tools
continues to progress. Started a Deltacloud-independent test suite; will
participate in another interop event around CIMI at the end of April.

Added a driver for DigitalOcean.

Will present Deltacloud at Openstack design summit next week, and try to
get more collaboration between the two projects started.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Etch Project  [Martin Veith]

Apache Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent 
RPC-like framework for building and consuming network services. 

BOARD ISSUES 
There are no Board-level issues at this time. 

RELEASES 
There hasn't been any new release since graduation in January 2013. 
The release planned for this month has been postponed for a couple of 
weeks due to some more issues in the C++ binding.
Besides some bug fixes and code cosmetics in other bindings the C++ 
binding is the next big feature coming in the next Etch release. 

ACTIVITY 
* User activity has increased (in comparison with the  past months), 
  we got good patches by users (and possible new committers) which are 
  currently in review and validation phase. 
* One major patch updates our Java code bases by bringing it to the 
  newest Java APIs. 
* Most of activity has occurred in the C++ binding. It is now in a beta 
  state, needs some more tweaks before including it in the next release. 
* As already mentioned in the last two months, more work is still 
  needed to broad both user and developer community. 

COMMITTERS OR PMC MEMBERS CHANGE 
* No changes regarding PMC or committers composition since graduation 
  in January 2013. 
* Our Committer base is still kind of small but where are in a good 
  work mode. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
Apache Flex 4.9.1 was released on 2/28/13.
Apache Flex Installer 2.0.x was released on 1/9/13.  The next version of the
Installer is being voted on as of this writing.

ACTIVITY
Activity in Apache Flex continues to be in two main areas:  improvements to
the existing Adobe Flash Platform-dependent code base, including the
releases listed above, and prototyping ways to create a version of Flex that
is independent from the Adobe Flash Platform.  There is another group
working on Maven-related tools for the existing code base.

We moved our code base from SVN to Git in mid-March.  It has been a much
more difficult transition than expected.  Three weeks later, folks are still
confused about how to use Git as it has many options for performing tasks
that can have significant implications.  Git's database model is not suited
for partial checkouts like SVN, making the management of our "whiteboard" (a
playground for committers) much more difficult as you have to download the
entire whiteboard (currently 245MB) first.  There is discussion of managing
the whiteboard on GitHub, but others feel that it doesn't conform to the
Apache way.

The move to Git has slowed contributions from some committers as folks
aren't sure they have the time to learn to use Git and are afraid of using
the wrong options.  Hopefully, the net benefit promised by the Git
supporters will eventually be realized.

The move to Git has also broken our release and build scripts and we are in 
the process of fixing them.  We also need to get the Git mirrors working 
again, as well as our CI implementation.

The FishEye plug-in was added to our JIRA project.

COMMUNITY
Harbs and Mark Kessler were added as committers.

Frederic Thomas was added to the PMC.

PRESS
Per a request from the Apache Press VP, I was interviewed by a writer from
InfoWorld in early February and the article was finally published in March.
The link is: 
http://www.computerworld.com.au/slideshow/455802/pictures_15_high-impact_apa
che_projects/?image=1

Nick Kwaitkowski presented on Apache Flex at the Flex Users Group in
Chicago.  Mike Labriola also presented on his Randori framework which uses
compiler source from Apache Flex.

INFRASTRUCTURE
 * Infra attempted to resolve INFRA-4380 but ran into problems.  In the last
   report I thought we had a solution, but it appears that we are back to
   trying to devise a new solution.  Tony has been helpful, but his time is
   limited.  Every month we spend a few minutes discussing solutions.
   JIRA's migration tools are definitely insufficient, and Apache's desire
   to have one large centralized JIRA DB makes it difficult or impractical
   to experiment with custom solutions.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Kevan Miller]

Apache Geronimo is an open source server runtime that integrates
the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes
that meet the needs of enterprise developers and system
administrators.

The community has had multiple releases in the past 3 months:

* genesis 2.1 (March), 
* xbean 3.13 (March), 
* aspectjrt and aspectjweaver 1.6.8_2 (March), 
* commons-httpclient 3.1.2 (March),
* geronimo-jsp 2.2 (March), 
* geronimo-el_2.2_spec 1.0.4 (March),
* geronimo-jaxws_2.2_spec 1.2 (April), 
* yoko 1.4 (April)

The community is preparing for a Geronimo 3.0.1 server release.

Mark Struberg has joined the Geroimo PMC. 

Romain Manni-Bucau has joined the Geronimo project as a
committer.

The Geronimo web site was migrated to svnpubsub. 

The community remains active. However, there has been some drop off in
committer activity. Several Geronimo users have been useful in
identifying issues and helping to drive the resolution of certain
issues. Hopefully their contributions will continue.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

Two significant development branches merged to trunk:
- Support for Windows
  ( http://s.apache.org/e7c )
- (HDFS) Fast-path for local reads on Linux (merge vote closing presently)
  ( http://s.apache.org/gM )
  ( http://s.apache.org/7y1 )

Developers have run Hadoop on Windows by emulating its *NIX dependencies,
but the former branch effects a cleaner integration. The latter branch
removed a performance hack for trusted services, replacing it with a more
secure and general implementation for all HDFS clients. Developers on
Windows requested that the workaround remain intact while comparable
functionality is implemented on that platform.

The two merge votes were nearly concurrent, so the development community
discussed the tradeoffs in supporting the new platform, particularly given
the present example of its impact. The informal consensus laid the burden of
support, testing, and monitoring on the subset of developers working on
Windows. Concretely, this extracted commitments to set up and maintain CI
infrastructure while relieving others of requirements to fix breakage on a
platform they may not run. As applied to the HDFS branch being merged, the
implementor(s) of the feature restored the workaround. The dev community
converged on these banal agreements fairly quickly.

Increased collaboration with the Apache Bigtop project in the release
process has improved early detection of downstream integration issues. The
upcoming release of 2.0.4-alpha (currently being voted on) has benefitted
significantly.

Hadoop continues to be an umbrella hosting effectively independent projects
(HDFS, MapReduce, YARN). The PMC has not discussed its disposition to
partition them recently. While one of the prenominate merges is an example
of cross-project work, such patches remain rare.

No issues require board attention at this time.

built on top of Hadoop Common and Hadoop HDFS

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

Following on from our last report where we raised the issue
of MapR Technologies conflating Apache HBase and their M7
offering, we have had no response from MapR to our letter of
January 9th -- we just sent them a ping -- and to my untrained
eye, their website continues in violation [1].

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Benson Margulies]

April was a month of much email at the IPMC. Two different
non-Foundation-member candidates for IPMC membership led to
controversy (each in his own way), and exposed the difficulties of
achieving consensus in a large, diverse, group.  Eventually, the two
cases were resolved, and the community proceeded to a public
conversation about decision-making process, agreeing to use a
3/4-majority voting rule when considering non-Foundation-member
candidates.

The voluminous and frustrating email on this subject, combined with
the ongoing questions around supervision (are enough mentors paying
attention?) led to a renewed debate on the structure, and indeed,
existence, of the IPMC as currently constituted. This debate
continues.

Celix

Celix is an OSGi like implementation in C with a distinct focus on
interoperability between Java and C.

Celix has been incubating since 2010-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow a community
  2. Find more committers
  3. ..

Celix is maintained by 2 committers and a small group of
users. Questions to the mailing list are (most of the time) answered
quickly. We are also trying to give talks on Celix or related stuff on
conferences.  We see and recognise the problem of the small community,
but are also confident that Celix and its community will grow.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?
None.

How has the community developed since the last report?  
There is no active growth, but there is currently one students doing
his internship with Apache Celix and we are trying hoping to get some
projects in the Google Summer of Code 2013. We hope that this will
lead in more activity on the mailing-list and hopefully to extra
committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?
Technically progress has been slow the last months. There was a
hackathon organized for remote services in Java [1], which although not
directly related to Apache Celix, should eventually work together with
the Apache Celix and as result the committers of Apache Celix where
present. We also expect an increase in contributions the coming months
because of the student internship / GSoC activities.

--------------------
Chukwa

Chukwa is a log collection and analysis framework for Apache Hadoop clusters.

Chukwa has been incubating since 2010-07-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Chukwa wiki is currently hosted in Hadoop subproject, it may be
     good to move it fully independent of Hadoop wiki.
  2. As of late, the overall activity has declined.  The podling needs
     to grow its active community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  * The podling is still working on increasing community activity.
    It's hoped that the addition of three new committers will help.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * 3 Committers have been added.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * The project has a few patches and discussion on improving Chukwa
    architecture design.  The main focus is removing Chukwa collectors
    to reduce deployment complexity.

Curator

Curator - ZooKeeper client wrapper and rich ZooKeeper framework

Curator has been incubating since 2013-03-11.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. build community
  2. create a first release
  3. finalize name search/trademarks

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

This is the first report.

There are currently 12 subscribers on the dev list. There are 13
subscribers to the user list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Initial resources have been created (Mailing lists, SCCS, Jira,
Jenkins, etc...). All mentors are signed up for the mailing lists. All
committers have accounts and are also registered for the ML.

Mentors have been educating the initial committers/community on the
workings of Apache.

A first release candidate for a 2.0.0 release has been created and
feedback provided by mentors. The community is iterating on new RCs.

Shepherd notes:

DeviceMap

Apache DeviceMap is a data repository containing device information,
images and other relevant information for all sorts of mobile devices,
e.g. smartphones and tablets. While the focus is initially on that
data, APIs will also be created to use and manage it.

DeviceMap has been incubating since 2012-01-03.

It looks like DeviceMap needs to be rebooted - there's almost zero
activity from the initial committers, but a few people have proposed
contributions that could help restart with a mostly new set of
committers (without kicking existing ones out of course - they're
welcome to be more active if they're willing and able).

Two committer/PPMC elections are pending, and with two active mentors
this can provide the embryo of a new community.

The podling could be considered a failure at this point, but giving it
another chance does no harm, so we recommend trying that.

Falcon

Falcon is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop
designed for data motion, coordination of data pipelines, lifecycle
management, and data discovery. Falcon enables end consumers to
quickly onboard their data and its associated processing and
management tasks on Hadoop clusters.

Falcon has been incubating since 2013-03-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Bootstrap the project (source code, documentation, issue
     tracking)
  2. Add new and diverse committers
  3. Build and grow community
  4. Releases at frequent and regular intervals

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
- No

How has the community developed since the last report?  
This is the first report for Falcon since its acceptance into
Incubator. We have requested for infrastructure for bootstrapping the
podling (awaiting source control, mailing list and issue tracking) -
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-6115). We will look to
move the source code and make documentation and easy startup-guide
available for users to try it out and collaborate.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Ingest code and clear IP.
  2. A release
  3. Build dev and PMC.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

No such issues.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 * The project has been completely setup in the ASF infrastructure,
   and community starts to evolve healthily (i.e., the monthly
   evolution of traffic at the dev mailing list is 77, 274, 292, 490
   messages, starting in December).
 * After intensively discussing and reviewing 5 internal release
   candidates, now, besides little legal details, the first release
   will be probably submitted to the IPMC in the upcoming days.

How has the project developed since the last report?

After the publication of LMF 2.6.0, the base code had been imported on
February 19th. Since that, the team has been working hard to implement
all necessary refactoring and, in parallel, some bug fixing; which in
total means almost 200 issues already registered at Jira (70%
resolved, the rest mostly planned tasks/features).

Open Climate Workbench

Apache Open Climate Workbench (Incubating) is an effort to develop
software that performs climate model evaluation using model outputs
from a variety of different sources (the Earth System Grid Federation,
the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment, the U.S. National
Climate Assessment and the North American Regional Climate Change
Assessment Program) and temporal/spatial scales with remote sensing
data from NASA, NOAA and other agencies. The toolkit includes
capabilities for regridding, metrics computation and visualization.

Open Climate Workbench has been incubating since 2013-02-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop an Apache community for Open Climate Workbench and
     connect to other relevant Apache efforts (Tika, Hadoop, SIS,
     OODT)
  2. Make an initial release.
  3. Add new contributors to the project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

We're up to 79% (22) of the initial project members having ICLAs on
file and accounts. We've got 21% more (6) people still who have yet to
submit their ICLA.  Chris Douglas and Chris Mattmann have reached out
to Chris Jack and Bruce Hewitson and are working on getting those 2
ICLAs so we can process their accounts.

How has the project developed since the last report?

INFRA-5874 is pretty much done, the big thing we're waiting on now is
the SVN import of the RCMES codebase. The SGA is on file as of
Thursday March 14, 2013, so we're ready to go there. Infra needed a
checksum file and evidence that we have an SGA to do the import, so we
provided that information on INFRA-5966, so should be loaded into SVN
any day now.

There was some limited discussion about others with the Climate name
in their software -- after discussion with Shane, this was deemed not
a problem.

Once we get the code base into SVN, all of the RCMES folks who have
been working on the project at JPL will conduct all development at
Apache.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

Apache Isis graduated from the incubator in Oct 2012.  This is the first
of our quarterly reports (as required we provided monthly reports in the
three months post-graduation).


Project Description:

Apache Isis is a framework to enable the creation of software using
domain-driven design principles, being an implementation of the naked
objects architectural pattern


Community / Development:

Mailing list activity has been steady.  We have had a few new correspondents
on our users mailing list.

We have also had a third party start development on a new integration with
Isis.  Although this component (the DHTMLX viewer [1]) cannot be integrated
with Isis due to licensing restrictions, it is heartening to have such a
substantial new piece of work being undertaken.

We are hoping that the third party dev team will start to contribute into 
Isis "proper", and introduce them to the "Apache way" of developing
software.

Releases:

In January we made a further release of Isis [2].  This consisted of our
core module, 2 components, and 1 archetype:

* Isis Core 1.1.0,
* Isis Shiro Security 1.1.0
* Isis Wicket Viewer 1.1.0
* Quickstart (Wicket/Restful/JDO/Shiro) archetype 1.0.2 released.

We expect to put out a new release in the next quarter.


Project Branding:

Compliant as of previous report; no changes.


Issues:

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Julien Nioche]

Apache Nutch is an open source web-search software project. Stemming from
Apache Lucene, it now builds on Apache Solr adding web-specifics, such as
a crawler, a link-graph database and parsing support handled by Apache Tika
for HTML and an array of other document formats.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

There have been no new releases since the last report but quite a few
improvements and issues fixed on both trunk and the 2.x branches, in 
particular (NUTCH-1047) Pluggable indexing backends, which is a major
improvement and gives more flexibility to the indexing. The parsing of
robots.txt has been delegated to the Crawler Commons project.

Work has been done on improving the WIKI pages and limiting their access 
as we were getting loads of spam.

There is one issue planned for GSOC 2013 [NUTCH-841].

COMMUNITY

The traffic on the user and dev mailing lists has kept a relatively high
level in the last quarter.

No less than 3 new Committers / PMC Members have joined Nutch since 
the previous report (Tejas Patil / Kiran Chitturi / Lufeng). 

Chris Mattmann is actively teaching Nutch in his CSCI 572 Search Engines
and Information Retrieval class [http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci572/] 
at USC this semester (Spring 2013) and includes an assignment that uses
Nutch to crawl the FBI Vault dataset for students to explore and
experiment with.

The CommonCrawl project are planning to test-drive Nutch for a future 
iteration of their dataset.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Tammo van Lessen]

# Apache ODE

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services,
sending and receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error
recovery as described by your process definition. It supports both long
and short living process executions to orchestrate all the services that
are part of your application.

## Status

This was a rather quiet development period, but we found some time to
continue the refactoring of ODE's Jacob component. We moved to Git and
separated ODE and JaCOb into two git repositories. We still have some
development items on our agenda, e.g. the OModel refactoring,
backporting features from our experimental branch. An ODE 1.3.6 release
is still planned and in the works.

## Release

No release to report in this quarter.

## Development

Some patches have been applied to trunk and the upcoming 1.3.6 release
branch. We did some refactoring to JaCOb, could make the code a bit more
clean using Java Generics and implemented a first version of an
alternative serialization approach using Jackson.

## Community

Sathwik Bantwal Premakumar is now a committer and committed a some of his
patches.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Andrea Pescetti]

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

Issues for Board Awareness

The project had a long policy discussion on veto powers and code
reverts: the discussion was difficult also due to uncertainties about
the Apache policy, now clarified after an articulated discussion on the
members list; this will reduce the risk of similar discussions to
happen again in future. This remained an isolated incident.

Community Development/Outreach Progress
---------------------------------------

The project added a new committer, Samer Mansour.

Blog posts calling for new development, documentation, QA, design
volunteers have proved successful, with many new people contacting the
mailing lists and some providing sustained contributions to the
discussions and activities. Orientation modules for new volunteers were
made available, to simplify introduction of new volunteers.

Apache OpenOffice participated in FOSDEM 2013 in Brussels, with a
booth for two days and a dedicated track (devroom) for a full day of
technical talks, and in ApacheCon NA in Portland, with presentations
and meetings.

The OpenOffice Wiki, running on MediaWiki, was very unstable. It has
been fresh installed on a new vm and updated to the latest release
under the guidance of Infra, and is now stable, documented and
maintained.

A new documentation effort for an end-users manual under the ALv2
license was started on the OpenOffice Wiki.

A new project logo is currently being selected for version 4.0.

A small team of volunteers was created to take care of the LAMP virtual
machines used for the OpenOffice Wiki, the OpenOffice Forum and an
ASF-wide new Pootle server for software translations. The Apache
Infrastructure team is providing guidance and support. The OpenOffice
infrastructure needs have been discussed with Infra to allow proper
planning and budgeting.

Community support forums remain popular with users. The mailing lists
for user support, localization, QA and marketing are quite active. As
Apache OpenOffice is a client product, we continue to investigate ways
to direct users to appropriate support venues. The developer list,
ooo-dev, remains very active.

Product/Project Development Progress
------------------------------------

The project released an update to version 3.4.1 in late January,
to include 8 new language translations made available by volunteers.

The next OpenOffice release will be labeled 4.0. Plans are to release
in June, 2013.

New ports, languages and other distribution channels are expected. The
new release in June will be provided in many more native languages. New
volunteers have come forth to assist with this effort. Build work has
started for reinstating OpenOffice into Linux repositories, currently
Fedora at this time.

The source tree has been cleaned of non en-US messages (these are
now kept in external files) allowing normal translation of these parts.

A new localization process, eventually leading to a more efficient
translation workflow and a massive cleanup of tools and intermediate
formats, is being implemented. The toolset is independent of OpenOffice
and can be easily adopted by other projects especially in combination
with the new translate/Pootle server.

Most of the work towards version 4.0 is being done in branches, with
integration to trunk expected to begin soon. Buildbots and QA tests
cover both trunk and branches, to guarantee optimal coverage.

Work is beginning on a Strategic Plan for the project. The plan will
likely be sub-divided into various components: Web/Wiki, User Support,
Documentation, Project: General, Project: Writer, Project: Calc,
Project:Base, etc. We anticipate this will be a rather lengthy process
involving both volunteers and our end users.

environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since the last report.

--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

One of our more quiet periods.  Focus continues on more frequent releases
and driving stability into the codebase.  TomEE 1.5.2 and OpenEJB 4.5.2
were released early April.  Work has started on releasing a beta of the
current trunk, 1.6.0.  The 1.5.2 work has been focused on stability, as
mentioned.  The coming 1.6.0 has a number of key performance improvements
that show big payoff on smaller and slower systems like the Raspberry PI.
There is intention of passing the Java EE 6 Web Profile TCK on the
Raspberry PI and announcing that in the 1.6.0 release, when that is ready.
This may depend on our licensee status.

User list traffic spiked up again, March was the second highest month of
all time.  Contribution to the documentation via the anonymous CMS remains
constant.  A modest total of 7 contributions came in in the last quarter,
which may seem small, but was completely unheard of with Confluence.  It's
great to see this continue.  We've see 2 or 3 "I want to contribute"
posts, which is also wonderful and more than normal.  The codebase is a
big larger now and harder to get into, but fingers crossed we can pull at
least one of them into the project.

Several ATS or ATS related presentations were given at ACNA-13. Thanks
to the conference organizers, and our presenters! We had several ATS
Hackathon / Bar Camp events, with participants from all over the world.
All in all, it was a great event for the community.

There is renewed activity among our committers, with a large number
of commits and Jira tickets resolved in the last few months. Overall
activity is up about 20% compared to the last 12 months average.

It is exciting to see the increased commercial use of Apache Traffic
Server. For some examples of who are using ATS, see

    http://trafficserver.apache.org/users.html

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic,
component oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Missed the March 2013 report due to flu
- Released Wicket 6.4.0, 6.5.0, 6.6.0
- Did not release Wicket 6.7.0
- Andrea del Bene created a Wicket guide
- Solved security issue CVE-2012-5636 - Apache Wicket XSS
  vulnerability
- No new committers or members were added in this period

Releases

Our monthly schedule of releasing is really working like a charm. It
is really something other projects should consider adopting. We have
seen an increase in downloads of our projects (when looking at the
Maven Central statistics-we assume most downloads are coming through
Maven users) since we adopted our monthly schedule since releasing
Wicket 6.0.0 on 5 september 2012.

Estimate downloads from Maven Central for all jar files in the group 
org.apache.wicket:

2012-04/2012-08: slight increase from 60k to 70k 
2012-09: 80k
2012-10: 90k
2012-11: 110k
2012-12: 90k
2013-01: 100k

The vote to release 6.7.0 was cancelled due to a bug in our code that
would prevent Wicket projects from working properly on Windows(r)
systems. Almost immediately when the vote was stalled, the release
manager got hit by a "mild" flu virus, taking him out for 2 weeks.
Work also got the better part of him, only to find the next release
date being quite close. So it was decided to skip one month and build
the release on our schedule. The vote for 6.7.0 is currently
proceeding.

Andrea del Bene has created a free Wicket book "Wicket Guide" that is
available through google code [1]. This book is a really great
asset to our community and we are very grateful for Andrea's work.
