    D. Secretary [Craig]

       In June, 109 iclas, five cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

       I’d like to remind all PMC chairs that to help secretary help you to
       file requests for new committer ids, votes should be summarized with a
       [RESULT] [VOTE] message.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       ApacheCon Europe will be held in Seville, November 14th through
       18th, 2016.

       We have started to more actively promote the CFP internally.
       With a great deal of help from Melissa we have contacted the
       user and dev list for every project and encouraged them to
       submit talks about their project. I'm sure you've seen at least
       one of these messages.

       Registration for ApacheCon Europe is still moving very slowly:

        Apache: Big Data    6
        ApacheCon       7

       Meanwhile, the paper proposals are starting to come in:

        Apache: Big Data    42
        ApacheCon       35

       Still to do is more promotion outside of the ASF, to related
       projects, and continued promotion of registration for the
       event. 
       
       Soon we'll start promoting ApacheCon North America as
       well, as soon as the website is up.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]


# Strategic Planning

As more projects express interest in trademarks and more uses thereof (in
certifications, services, transfers to or from third parties, etc.) the
variety of kinds of questions coming to trademarks@ continues to grow.  While
we have basic documentation, it's clear that a solid understanding of how open
source trademarks work in the software vendor world is still lacking among
most PMCs and Members.  

Long term, finding much better ways to provide better branding and trademark
support to our projects will be critical, both for our many big data projects
(due to the extremely competitive market and pressures from for-profit
vendors) and for the Foundation's reputation as a vendor-neutral and
independently led home for project communities.  In my mind, this is our
second most important issue to solve, after the question of hiring sufficient
operational and infrastructure staff to ensure that our core services are
managed appropriately.

# Operations

Summer vacation and home contractors have slowed response times.  A number of
other project and Branding Committee members are providing some feedback and
thoughtful commentary on some issues, but it's still very spotty.  In
particular, one project with past issues has been providing some very
thoughtful and helpful comments and questions, which is great progress.

# Registrations

Cloudera has assigned the IMPALA mark with a number of international
registrations and applications to the ASF for the podling's use.

Another open source foundation has denied our request to use the trademark for
one of their projects recently forked to an Apache project.  While this is one
of the rare cases where it could be appropriate to transfer the trademark -
they have stopped development of the project and it's an amicable fork - we
will abide by their request (and I'll ensure the PMC does so).

Our ACCUMULO and TAJO registrations in the US have completed, and our TAJO
application was published in the USPTO Gazette, the final step to being
completed.

Our assumed applications for a recently graduated podling are being opposed,
and we're working with counsel on the most effective way to secure sufficient
registration(s) for our purposes.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities continue normally.

The main challenge and focus these weeks is the renewals for Google and
Hortonworks. Jim already sent an email to Google and I reached out to
Hortonworks to find out who replaced our contact, David (ex-VP Marketing) who
left the company. Hopefully by the time of the board meeting we would have
made more progress.

On the issue of questionable bronze sponsorship we did receive more requests
for sponsorship. Two seemed valid and well aligned with our values and were
accepted. A third one was clearly just a desire to 'buy' a link referral from
the ASF site and was declined. We continue to keep an eye on incoming
requests, but I see no need for a change at this point.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

As reported last month, we began, and successfully completed new 
contract negotiations with the contractors this month. 

We are still suffering staff shortage and that continues to deleteriously
affect many things. 

Infrastructure has seen some notable problems. A intermittent Jira outage
affected a large number of users. The folks at Atlassian assisted us in
diagnosing the problem and moving forward. 

Additionally one of our VMware hosts has an ailing storage array. While work
was underway to evacuate all of the hosts, this storage malaise has
exacerbated the situation.

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Bruno Kinoshita (kinow@) has joined the "SPARQL Maintenance (EXISTS)"
Community Group and ASF has signed the community contributor agreement.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

There has been an ongoing discussion regarding the usage of Github repos as
the "official" source of ASF project codebases (source code), and the
requirements, conditions, issues and concerns there-of.

Speaking as the VP of Legal Affairs, I am quite happy with how this is handled
via the MATT "experiment", but there is concern that this is not sufficient
(ie: projects are not quite satisfied with it and would prefer the unfiltered
and unencumbered full Github process) as well as the "costs" of supporting
this effort as it relates to Infra- structure resources.

We have also been made aware of an external patent troll case which is related
to one of our projects; The PMC has been contacted
but, as of this date, no response has been forth-coming. I plan to bug them
again this week.

At present there are no issues requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Currently Apache allocates CVE names from a pool of names given to us
by Red Hat, with Red Hat being the offical Candidate Naming Authority
(CNA).  We approached Mitre some years ago with a view to becoming our
own CNA so we get our own blocks of names.  We've kickstarted this
process again and hope to conclude it by the next report.

Stats for June 2016:

14 CVEs issued to projects (some may not be public yet).

e-mails to security@

8      Phishing/spam/proxy/attacks point to site "powered by Apache" or
        Confused user due to Android licenses

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Summary
The project is active and there are no Board-level issues at this time.
We have made one new release since the previous report and have
not added any committers/PMC members.

Releases
Version 1.7.2 was released on 6/20/2016.

Activity
The number of subscribers to the user and dev lists has increased
slightly and mailing list / commit activity is up slightly over the
previous quarter.

In the past 3 months, there have been 211 commits to the master branch
from 13 authors, 4 of whom are not yet committers.

Version 1.7.2 has been released and we are wrapping up a handful of
issues for the 1.8.0 release. After 1.8.0 is released, we may make a
1.6.6 bugfix release before retiring the 1.6 branch.

Around 15 people attended an Accumulo meetup in San Jose, where
Josh Elser spoke about features that have been completed for 1.8.0
and Bill Slacum discussed how to build resilient applications on
Accumulo.

Registration and a call for speakers are now open for the Apache
Accumulo Summit in October 2016 (http://accumulosummit.com).

Community
Michael Wall was added as a committer and PMC member on 4/11/2016.
No new committers or PMC members have been added since the last
report.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

Arrow is a columnar in-memory analytics layer designed to accelerate big data.
It houses a set of canonical in-memory representations of flat and
hierarchical data along with multiple language-bindings for structure
manipulation. It also provides IPC and common algorithm implementations.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Awareness continues to increase with the community having done presentations
  at various meetups as well as the following conferences: Pydata Paris, Hadoop
  Summit Ireland, Hadoop Summit San Jose and Berlin Buzzwords.
- The CPP work has made good progress.
- The cross-project work with Parquet has seen substantial work (both in the 
  Parquet project and the Arrow project). This should be a great first example 
  proof-of-concept integration showing the benefits of in-memory columnar 
  layer.
- There has been substantial progress on development of for the IPC / memory
  sharing.
- Java development has slowed some but appears to be picking up again. 
- A new independent project called Feather is using Arrow as a format for
  writing to disk. This has also increased engagement with Arrow itself and we 
  have a number excited communities including R & Python (and the Julia 
  community experimenting).

## Health report:
 
- We've seen good discussion and development activity since the last report. 
- We need to get to a first release.
- Prior to doing so, the community is working on rudimentary integration tests
  between Java and C++ and more formal format specification.
- More work can be done to make the project approachable to newly interested
  parties by creating additional documentation and quickstart. A sample 
  application will also help. 

## PMC changes: 

- Currently 17 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months. 
- Last PMC addition was Abdel Hakim Deneche on Tue Jan 20 2016 

## Committer base changes:

Attachment H: Report from the Apache AsterixDB Project  [Till Westmann]

Description:

Apache AsterixDB is a scalable big data management system (BDMS) that
provides storage, management, and query capabilities for large collections
of semi-structured data.

Activity:

- The general state of the project (and the report) are largely unchanged
  from last month. Development and discussions are active, the community is
  healthy and engaged.
- The move of infra resources is done - some incubator cleanup is still
  outstanding.
- First mention of Hyracks now is "Apache Hyracks" and information about
  Hyracks is now easier to reach by following the link to the ASTERIX
  publications at UC Irvine (which contain the ICDE 2011 paper on Hyracks).
- Kaveen Rodrigo's GSoC project has passed the mid-term evaluation and is
  progressing further.

Issues:

- There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

PMC/Committership changes:

There have been no changes since graduation. The last committer/PPMC member
added was Michael Blow on 2016-03-28.

Releases:

AsterixDB graduated from the Incubator on April 20, 2016. The last releases
were on February 26, 2016: AsterixDB 0.8.8-incubating and Hyracks
0.2.17-incubating.

 - Discussion on the dev list agreed to a goal of a release every quarter,
   and one PMC member has volunteered to be release manager for 1.8.2.
 - JavaScript implementation added RPC support
 - Close to a spec and implementation standardizing a single-message format
   for uses like Apache Kafka payloads.

## Health report:

 - Avro is healthier than last month
 - Contributor engagement is still a goal we need to work toward, with
   only a few committers actively reviewing patches. Regular releases help,
   but we can make it easier for both committers and contributors by adding
   time-saving tools like continuous integration.

## PMC changes:

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Deepal Jayasinghe]

## Description

   The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance
   of software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components (both Java and C stacks as well as Axis1).

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   However, board requested to report on many inactive sub-projects as stated in previous report,
   we had a discussion regarding moving some of the inactive projects to Attic and also had a vote regarding the same [1].
   During the discussion [2] three individuals (Rafael Bronzeri, Giorgio Zoppi and Sendil Rajendhran)
   came forward to contribute to the project and now we have given them the opportunity and watching the progress. 
   Now, we have granted Rafael Axis committer access and he contributes to Axis C.


## Activity:
  - A new PMC member/committer was added.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 62 PMC/Commiters members.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Julian Hyde]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and
planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-module within Calcite, and provides a framework for
building local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Since March
2016, Avatica has an independent release schedule.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and
its Avatica sub-project, and since the last report there has been one
release of each.

Our strategy, in Avatica, of creating a language-agnostic wire
protocol is paying off: 3 new Avatica clients have been added in
ASL-but-not-ASF projects (in Go, .NET and Python).  They are intended
for Apache Phoenix Query Server but can be re-used for other
back-ends.

Interest in streaming SQL continues to grow. We are starting to work
with Apache Beam (incubating) and Apache Apex, and continue to work
with Apache Flink, Apache Samza and Apache Storm.

Adapters for Druid and Elasticsearch have been contributed.

Talks at ApacheCon BigData (Vancouver), Hadoop Summit (Dublin and San
Jose), Kafka Summit (San Francisco), XLDB (Palo Alto), Hortonworks
User Group (Herndon, Virginia); and a combined talk with Apache
Phoenix at Hadoop Summit (San Jose). Topics include streaming SQL,
Avatica, and integration with Apache Phoenix.

## Health report:

Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both
Calcite and Avatica. Our change, last quarter, to notify the dev list
each time a JIRA was created seems to be an improvement.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 14 PMC members (no additions since last report)
- Last PMC addition was Josh Elser on Wed Feb 17 2016

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 16 committers (one addition since last report)
- Michael Mior was added on Sun Apr 03 2016

## Releases:

- 1.8.0 was released on Mon Jun 13 2016
- avatica-1.8.0 was released on Fri Jun 03 2016


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Alexander Broekhuis]

## Description:
 -  OSGi framework implementation in C.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - A lot small and not so small changes where applied concerning
Coverity, a static code analyser service, reports. This should help in
dormant bugs and security issues
 - A big and backwards incompatible change was made to Celix API. This
was done to clarify the API and prevent bugs.


## Health report:
 - Number of commits on the project is healty considering it's size.
 - The project needs to make a new release. This is long overdue.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Alexander Broekhuis on Wed Jul 16 2014

## Committer base changes:

## Releases:

 - Last release was 1.0.0-incubating on Tue Feb 25 2014
 - Still working on the celix-2.0.0 release. Although very close to a
release, some backward incompatible changes (which would require a
major version bump) where introduces leading to some delay.

## Mailing list activity:

 - The activity on the mailing list has gone up, which is a good sign.

 - dev@celix.apache.org:
    - 58 subscribers (up 3 in the last 3 months):
    - 29 emails sent to list (18 in previous quarter)

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description: 
   Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running
   MapReduce and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop. 
   
## Issues: 
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
   There has been the normal bug fixing work after our most recent release
   in May, along with some new work to explore using Apache Kafka as a data
   source in Crunch pipelines that should make a good foundation for our
   next major release.
   
## Health report: 
   Things are generally good: the core library does what it was designed to
   reasonably well, bugs are reported and addressed in a timely manner, and
   we have some new and interesting development avenues to explore in leveraging
   Crunch as a way of doing simplified stream processing without requiring the
   deployment of more heavyweight frameworks like Apache Storm or Apache Spark's
   streaming engine.

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o DdlUtils : a small, easy-to-use component for working with
              Database Definition (DDL) files.
 o Derby    : a relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
              testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
              persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

1) One Google Summer of Code student is actively working on Derby development
this summer, and has successfully passed the Google mid-term evaluation.

2) A change to the Jenkins Content Security Policy (see INFRA-11746) briefly
caused some website issues for Derby; it was successfully resolved with
the help of the Infra team (thanks!).

3) After our April, 2016 report, we received feedback from the board:

  mt: Has the community considered merging some of the lower activity
      mailing lists? It might help foster cross-component interest /
      involvement.

The DB PMC discussed this feedback (see private@db archives for June,
2016). Since the DB project is an "umbrella" project comprised of
several related, but mostly independent, sub-projects, the consensus
was that trying to share mailing lists across the different sub-projects
would be undesirable. Consolidating lists within the Derby sub-project
was also discussed on the derby-user mailing list, and again the consensus
was that the Derby user community would prefer to keep the current
mailing list structure.

Some of the DB sub-projects are much more active than others. For example,
the Derby, JDO, and Torque projects remain quite active, while the DDLUtils
sub-project is not active at all.

It seems that the bottom line, for now, is that there is not much
cross-component interest/involvement, but it is not clear that structural
changes such as merging the mailing lists would succeed in stimulating
such activity, because the sub-projects are, fundamentally, independent.

Further suggestions from the board are certainly welcome, of course!

## Health report:

Activity in the Apache DB community this quarter was low, but steady.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 43 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Matthew Adams on Sun Jan 19 2014

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 42 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
   BUT, an election is underway at this time for a new committer.

## Releases:

 - Last release was Derby-10.12.1.1 on Sun Oct 11 2015

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Alan Cabrera]

Apache Geronimo is a JEE6 certified open source server runtime that integrates
the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes that meet 
the needs of enterprise developers and system administrators.
   
## Issues: 
- We are concerned with the lack of community activity
- The inability to obtain a AL2.0 compatible JEE TCK pins Geronimo to JEE6
- CI/TCK setup has fallen into disrepair

## Next Steps - prepare for possible breakup and shuttering or downsizing:
- bring in any PMC members of sibling projects in Geronimo's JEE6 universe
- inventory any required interactions between individual specs
- inventory outstanding bugs in JEE6 specs and assess the amount of work 
  required
- inventory what are the outstanding security issues and assess the amount of 
  work required  (will likely need to remove distributions until fixes can be 
        put into place)
- inventory CI setup and assess the amount of work required
- inventory TCK setup and assess the amount of work required
   
## Activity: 
 - No releases
 - Patch to JavaMail 1.4 needs to pass TCK before it can be *officially* 
   released. (it is likely to be published as an alpha release, as was done in
         past)
 - Some have expressed an interest in JEE configuration - overlap w/ Tamaya 
   podling.  (too early to tell if this effort will come to fruition)
   
## Health report: 
- Last quarter was a very light quarter for Apache Geronimo.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Christopher Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

YARN timeline server v2 (YARN-2928) merged. Container queuing and
resource-aware scheduling made progress.

HDFS intra-datanode rebalancing (HDFS-1312) merged. Object storage (Ozone)
and the native client made progress. Design of an async FileSystem API and
an implementation in HDFS started in JIRA.

HADOOP integrations with cloud storage were particularly active this
quarter. The S3A client received significant updates from a diverse set of
community members. Clients for the Aliyun Object Store Service (OSS) and
Microsoft Azure Data Lake Store (ADLS) also posted proposals and prototypes.

MAPREDUCE was updated to work with the next generation of the YARN timeline
service.

The Yetus project has greatly improved CI and regression testing,
particularly across branches. Given the Hadoop project's intent to cut
releases from trunk again, Yetus's support for feature branches is
particularly helpful.

RELEASES

Releases have been blocked on HADOOP-12893, bringing the NOTICE and LICENSE
files up to date. It is recently resolved.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Andrew Purtell]

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of Hadoop
Common and Hadoop HDFS.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

Despite my personal concerns about available community bandwidth for
maintaining several code lines, we are holding steady with three
released code lines (0.98, 1.1, and 1.2) plus development activity on
the next minor increment (1.3), the parent of the 1.x release series
(branch-1) and the project trunk (master, aka 2.0). We have one
committer allocated as release manager for each code line to
supervise (except branch-1). Committers are largely maintaining the
discipline of committing changes first to master then back through all
active branches according to our documented source and binary change
compatibility policy. An exception is 0.98. For this "long term
stable" code line the branch RM has volunteered responsibility for
porting back all desired changes committed to later code lines.

We made two releases from our 0.98 code line: 0.98.19 was released
on April 28, 2016; and 0.98.20 was released on June 12, 2016.

We made one release from our 1.1 code line: 1.1.5 was released on
May 12, 2016.

We made one release from our 1.2 code line: 1.2.1 was released on
April 5, 2016.

Work to complete the first release from our 1.3 code line is ongoing
and should be completed soon. The 1.3 code line will be managed by
our newest PMC member, Mikhail Antonov. Once 1.3.0 is released I
expect we will have a discussion on dropping active maintenance of an
older code line to compensate.

ACTIVITY

Mikhail Antonov was added to the PMC on May 23, 2016.

We added two committers over this reporting interval. Apekshit (Appy)
Sharma joined us on June 3, 2016 and Jingcheng Du joined us on
June 16, 2016.

HBaseCon, the yearly conference for the HBase community, took place
on Tuesday, May 24, 2016 at The Village on Market Street in San
Francisco, and was attended by several hundred members of our user
and developer communities.

STATS

We have seen another uptick in subscribers to our user list.

The flux of JIRA tickets is similar to the last reporting period.

52 committers
28 PMC
1064 subscribers to the dev list (down 1 in the last 3 months)
2356 subscribers to the user list (up 20 in the last 3 months)
587 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

Incubator PMC report for July 2016

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 58 podlings currently undergoing incubation.  We have one
podling planning to graduate this month and added four podlings to the
roster.  June was a busy month, adding two IPMC member, and completing
twelve releases, in addition to other activities.

  - 2016-06-30 Apache Kudu (incubating) 0.9.1

* IP Clearance

  - N/A

* Legal / Trademarks

  - An audit was conducted of podling websites to see how far off they are
    compared to the Incubator's branding guide.  Eleven podlings were found to
    be in complete violation and requests to correct have been issued.  Most
    have already corrected the issue.
  - Justin has provided a summary of building NOTICE and LICENSE files in the
    form of a screencast for podlings to use as reference.

* Infrastructure

  - There are open questions around the usage of GitHub issues for issue
    tracking, it is unclear if it is a valid tool to use.

* Miscellaneous

  - A vote was started to retire the CMDA podling.  It was later canceled,
    giving them another three months to try to work through community issues.
    Public mailing list participation has increased as a part of this result.
  - Discussions are resuming to retire the OpenAz podling, as only one of the
    three volunteers who stepped up to resume has availability to work on the
    podling.
  - Batchee missed getting a report in. We will follow up in the next IPMC 
    report.

Airflow

Airflow is a workflow automation and scheduling system that can be used to
author and manage data pipelines.

Airflow has been incubating since 2016-03-31.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Getting an Apache release out.
  2. Podling name search has to happen.
  3. Verify distribution rights

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We've done a lot of work on distribution rights (3), but we need to wrap
  it up.

  We've been pushing out our release due to stability concerns and the need
  for a testing framework

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Since our last podling report 1 month ago, we grew our contributors from
    148 to 160.
  - In June 2016 we had 56 commits.
  - We organized a meet up at WePay. We also had one before at Airbnb.
  - We had several committers meetings.
  - 1 new committer. 2 offers were given but 1 was declined.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Migrated all files to contain Apache 2.0 license headers.
  - Replaced charting library that was non-Apache 2.0 compliant (a large
    effort).
  - Release Airflow incubator website, and added appropriate branding and
    disclaimers.

exists and produces releases since around 2001.

Most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Discuss the project's graduation on the general list.
  2. Fill blanks left on the status page.
  3. Reaching a bigger community that will contribute code to the
     project, though it remains to be seen if it's required before
     graduation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There were no changes

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Establish an Apache website for Gossip that makes it easy for new
     users and contributors to get started.
  2. Facilitate discussions and build the protocol specification and
     implementation
  3. Produce a usable release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have had activity in the community from two people who have engaged
  in working on smaller tasks. We are discussion electing them as project
  committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have created and resolved a number of tickets: 7 created, 3 resolved.

HAWQ

Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop native SQL query engine that combines the key
technological advantages of MPP database with the scalability and
convenience of Hadoop. HAWQ reads data from and writes data to HDFS
natively.  HAWQ delivers industry-leading performance and linear
scalability. It provides users the tools to confidently and successfully
interact with petabyte range data sets. HAWQ provides users with a complete,
standards compliant SQL interface.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce our first Apache Release
  2. Expand the community, by adding new contributors and focusing on making
     sure that there's a much more robust level of conversations and
     discussions happening around roadmaps and feature development on the
     public dev mailing list
  3. Infrastructure migration: create Jenkins projects that build HAWQ
     binary, source tarballs, and run feature tests including at least
     installcheck-good tests for each commit (HAWQ-127).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Everything seems to be smooth, nothing urgent at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. we have seen significant increase of communication and collaboration
     across the whole community from last several weeks. The community
     becomes more open for discussion around the roadmap, various features
     that committers are working on, and infrastructure enhancements for the
     project.
  2. One meetup: Zeppelin meets MADlib & HAWQ
     (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8V10IukBes&list=PL62pIycqXx-Qf6EXu5FDxUgXW23BHOtcQ&index=6)
  3. The PPMC was made aware of an erroneous use of Apache HAWQ (incubating)
     trademark by a vendor doing research with an older, eponymous Pivotal
     product. The PPMC is working with a vendor and ASF's VP of Branding to
     resolve the issue.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. The first release candidate has been proposed and it is under the
     voting process on the dev mailing list
  2. New features added include snappy compression for AO tables, HAWQ
     register feature for registering data into HAWQ native tables
  3. The build system has been simplified a lot by making some components as
     optional (for example, pl/r, orca et al)
  4. The community is consolidating the testing frameworks including
     installcheck tests and gtest into gtest based framework.
  5. Including the incubating disclaimer on Apache HAWQ website based on the
     podling branding guidelines

Milagro

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.  Bring regular day-to-day activity to Apache resources.
  2.  Make a first Apache release.
  3.  Attract community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The project has resources outside Apache, including a prospective main
  documentation website milagro.io.  This is not branded as Apache, but is
  considered to be owned by Milagro.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Conference presentations from key team members, including at
  ApacheCon/Vancouver and forthcoming in Tokyo, seek to build awareness
  among Apache and open source communities.

  There appears also to be recent new community interest around the
  pre-Apache project at Github.  This should probably be redirected to
  Apache, but we need to check.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Several existing repos formerly developed by Miracl at Github have been
  imported to Apache, and are mirrored to Github.  These were packaged to be
  near release-ready prior to import, and we are looking to review readiness
  for a release.

  The majority of work that has taken place at Apache has been the
  development of a Milagro web site, and project documentation at
  milagro.io.  Code development appears to have continued at github,
  apparently due to confusion.  This was discovered just today, so we plan
  to follow up tomorrow.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

## Description: 

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

Since the last report we have made two small bug fix releases, v1.12.1 [1] 
and v1.12.2 [2] and one major release v1.13.0 [3].

(As reported last quarter), a couple of conference have now taken place.
The outputs of one of these - an all-day workshop - is available has been
provided on github [4].

A comment was also made against last quarter's report regarding the slow 
speed of loading up the screencasts page [5]; this has now been reworked and
now loads much faster.

## Health report: 

Project activity (#mails, tickets, commits etc) are all healthy.

The main development activity (for 1.13.0) has been removing technical debt
and simplifying the code base, with a long-term view of leveraging more of
the JEE platform (eg CDI) and moving to Java 8 as the minimum requirement 
around the time that Java 9 is released (mid next year).  The rationale is 
that the simpler the codebase, the more likely it will encourage 
contributions.

That said, we have - with others - been tracking Oracle's apparent lack of 
"enthusiasm" for JEE this year, prompting discussions on the dev list about 
maybe switching to using SpringBoot as a base platform.  For now, we await 
Oracle's promised announcements re: JEE at JavaOne in Sept.

## Mailing list activity: 
   
  Compared to last quarter when new subscriptions was flat, the number of
  mailing list subscribers has now resumed its upward trend.  The new
  screencasts page [5] and a twitter campaign related to that may be part of
  the explanation.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We have continued to receive contributions from various community sources,
including several vendors that are developing and contributing providers for
their offerings. It is encouraging that we've found them to be very open to
discussing design decisions; some of these discussions have also resulted in
small additions to the jclouds core, which thus also continues to evolve.

We've had some new contributions adding support for the OneAndOne provider,
recently added support for Blackblaze B2 storage and expect to have an Azure
ARM provider completed shortly. The plan is to then release jclouds 2.0.

== Community ==

Activity on the user and development lists has remained pretty stable.
Questions continue to be answered in a reasonable amount of time, and we have
been able to encourage users to (with some guidance) open pull requests for
their desired changes themselves.

There were two jclouds presentations at
ApacheCon NA. Unfortunately, we weren't able this time to meet representatives
from downstream users such as Apache Brooklyn or Apache Stratos, as they
weren't attending. We find these kinds of meetings, which we have conducted at
past ApacheCon EU events, to be very useful in understanding the needs of
those projects and helping us plan our roadmap.

We have one student working on a GSoC project, which looks likely to be
completed on time.

There are currently 11 PMC members and 23 committers.
Last committer: 2016-02-05 (Reijhanniel Jearl Campos)
Last PMC member: 2015-09-20 (Zack Shoylev)
 
== Community Objectives ==

Our immediate aim is to wrap up work on the Azure ARM provider in preparation
for a subsequent jclouds 2.0 release. More generally, we continue to try to
encourage and supervise, where necessary, new contributors to grow the
committer base.

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 1.9.2, took place on 2016-01-16.

As discussed above, we are aiming to release jclouds 2.0 shortly. Depending on
the time required, we are considering an interim jclouds 1.9.3 release to
address issues resolved since 1.9.2 for users.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data
applications in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards for RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The project has had a routine quarter after the release of Jena 3.1.0 in May.

The amount of activity is highly dependent on contributor time.
(There are no directly salaried developers.)

## Health report:

The drop in dev@ email can be attributed to the fact the release
happened at the beginning of the reporting period.  The last cycle was
busier because of getting the release together and issues coming out of
the woodwork followed by a quiet period.

Activity: 

  The main focus of development this quarter has been facilitating the
  integration of Clownfish with host languages by simplifying the build system
  and improving how common test code is built and run.  Some architectural
  debt that accumulated during early development of Clownfish has been paid
  down, happily.

Health report: 

  The community remains steady -- there have been no significant changes in
  the state of the project this quarter.  The project continues to be
  developed primarily by two main contributors, with occasional activity from
  other longtime participants.

  There are currently 14 committers and 12 PMC members.  The last committer

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Hervé Boutemy]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

* Issues

* Activity

  * Early access releases for Apache Maven 3.4.0 have been created in order
    to get feedback from the community. Based on the first feedback we've
    decided to revert a couple changes due to negative impact.
    We're investigating if these changes should be considered bugfixes or
    new features and how to control their impact.

  * First plugins and components with Java9 support have been released.

  * After 2 years, Hervé Boutemy resigned from chair, as normal rotation
    decided by the PMC a few years ago. Robert Scholte was candidate and
    was chosen by the PMC: a board resolution appointing Robert as chair
    of the Maven PMC is in the agenda.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute
resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling
fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and
run effectively.

## General ##

The project and the ecosystem around it continues to be healthy. There
are no board issues at this time.

## Releases (since last board report) ##

 * Apache Mesos 0.27.3 (2016-06-12)
 * Apache Mesos 1.0.0  (in progress)

## Activity ##

The project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features,
reviews and releases. The mailing list and IRC channel are also very
much active with healthy discussions. We have also added a new slack
team http://mesos.slack.com to reach wider audience.

MesosCon Denver was a great success. The keynotes, presentations and
events were all well received. The talks have been uploaded to
YouTube.

Mesos 1.0-RC1 was announced during MesosCon. The RC has gone through
rigorous testing for the past few weeks and a new RC2 has been cut on
2016/08/06 based on the feedback. Note that we are providing extended
time for voting since this is a major release. Can anyone from ASF
comms team help us in promoting the 1.0 release? Please ping
benh@apache.org if this is possible!

In addition to the aforementioned Slack team, we are actively
undertaking steps to improve community participation. Cleaning up
stale reviews, tracking contributor affiliations (to measure
diversity) and doing demos during community syncs are just a few
examples of this effort.

## New PMC/Committers ##

Anand Mazumdar was voted in as committer and PMC on 2016/06/09.
Joseph Wu was voted in as committer and PMC 2016/06/09.

We've identified couple more people that are close to become
committers and are actively working to nominate them.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
 - Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process
 and distribute data.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - First RC for MiNiFi which is a subproject of Apache NiFi is being 
 reviewed and voted upon.  It will be Apache MiNiFi 0.0.1.
 - Second RC for Apache NiFi 0.7.0 is being prepared for a vote.  
 The first RC was cancelled due to licensing concerns and a couple blockers
 found by community members during testing.
 - Apache NiFi 1.0.0 is nearing RC stage.  Looks like it could happen in a
 couple of weeks but significant effort remains to pull that release 
 together.
 - Numerous meetups and conference presentations featuring Apache NiFi and 
 its collaborative role with other Apache technologies have occurred in the 
 past few months. Social media commentary and Q&A for NiFi on various 
 channels (twitter, stackoverflow) has increased considerably.
 - We have created a new issues mailing list for automated updates from 
 Github and JIRA so that we can keep the signal to noise level on the dev
 list higher.

## Health report:
 - Activity on mailing lists, JIRA, Git remains strong.
 - During the last review cycle we have new committers and PMC progression.
 - The pipeline of committers working toward PMC status remains strong and 
 the community documented how to progress to PMC https://s.apache.org/Ogm7
 - However, we are not without risk. Supporting both the 0.x and 1.x lines 
 is taxing. We've documented the support plan https://s.apache.org/I9Rf but 
 as it is early we need to closely review this to ensure it is working.
 - The rate of PR production to PR review and disposition means we have a 
 growing trail of PRs.  We need to focus on this in the coming quarter.
 - The rate of JIRA creation to JIRA disposition means we have a growing 
 number of JIRAs.  We need to focus on this in the coming quarter.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Tammo van Lessen]

## Description: 
   Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web services 
   orchestration using flexible process definitions. 

## Issues: 
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
 - Although we've been working on the next release for some reporting
   periods already, we decided to open the release again and add two
   new features: a) a new standalone distribution, based on an embedded
   TomEE and b) to incorporate the new angular based console app, which
   still needs some love but is already way better than the old one.
   That's why we're delaying the release again.

## Health Report:
  - ODE is very mature and stable, however the interest in BPEL has decreased
    significantly. Thus ODE's development is currently pretty much in 
    maintenance mode. We're ironing out technical debt and making sure
    that our codebase campground is clean, supporting our users with answers
    and fixes. 

## PMC changes: 
  
  I'm stepping down as PMC chair due to time constraints and because I think
  some fresh energy cannot harm. With Sathwik we have found a very engaged and
  committed PMC member to take this role.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description: 
Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for databases,
relational as well as non-relational. For relational databases, OpenJPA is
compliant to the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0.
OpenJPA runs in stand-alone JSE as well as  containers e.g JavaEE,
Tomcat, Spring or OSGi.   

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
Still no news on the EE7 TCK issue which prevents us
from verifying compatibility with JPA-2.1.

## Activity: 
Activity did grow a bit. 
We discussed how to proceed with JPA-2.1 but did not yet find time to polish the 
work done in the jpa-2.1 feature branch.
After we cleaned up the trunk docs some community members do a great job 
bringing back the docs for the older OpenJPA versions (went broken somehow).

## Health report: 
We managed to get Francesco as a new committer. 
New bugs are handled in waves as we mostly focus on bringing our docs and 
infrastructure back to a good quality right now.

## PMC changes: 

- Currently 14 PMC members.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Jörn Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference
resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text
processing services.

Development
------------------
The development team stayed active over the last three month
and the activity increased.

Anastasija Mensikova was accepted in GSOC 2016 and is working on
a new sentiment analysis component for OpenNLP. Her work will
soon be merged into opennlp-tools.

Community
---------------
The community stayed active with the usual amount of traffic on the user
mailing list and contributed a couple of patches to fix bugs.

Rodrigo Agerri was added to the PMC on Jul 09 2015

Chris Mattmann was added as a committer on Jul 07 2016.

Releases
------------
The last release OpenNLP 1.6.0 was released on Jul 09 2015.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Dennis E. Hamilton]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity
suite.  There are six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). With limited support for other formats,
OpenOffice ships for several platforms and in dozens of
languages.

STATUS 
======

Limitations of capacity and coordination of the project's moving parts are
ongoing concerns.


ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS
==========================

Concerns for Board attention are in the Issues section, below.  


RELEASES
========

There is no Apache OpenOffice release in this quarter.  It has been 8 months
since the last release and a backlog of maintenance and feature updates
is accumulating.

Complete Release History
  2015-10-28 4.1.2
  2014-08-21 4.1.1
  2014-04-29 4.1
  2013-10-01 4.0.1
  2013-07-17 4
  2013-01-30 3.4.1 refresh (8 more languages)
  2012-08-21 3.4.1 incubating
  2012-05-08 3.4   incubating

PMC/COMMITTERS
==============

The recognition and invitation of potential PMC members has slowed.
There are 27 current PMC members.  Complete history is available in 
PDF at http://s.apache.org/vji .

   The last preceding PMC addition was on 2016-03-05

   2016-06-08 Oliver-Rainer Wittmann (orw) retired
       The last preceding retirement was on 2016-01-28
               
In this quarter, 87% of the 199 (down from Q1 540) private@ posts 
were by PMC members.  Of those posts, 89% were by 7 members (relatively
unchanged) and 11 did not post at all (a decline).

Committers
----------

There are 139 committers as of 2016-06-30.  22 have registered PGP keys.
The recognition and invitation of potential committers has flattened out.

       Last previous committer addition was on 2016-04-22

   2016-06-08 Oliver-Rainer Wittmann withdrew
       Last previous committer withdrawal was on 2016-01-28
       
ACTIVITY
========

Moving parts of the Apache OpenOffice project span three inter-connected
layers. 

 * Development, Release Engineering, and Deployment
   - Development and release engineering
   - Deployment and take-up
   - Branding
     and internationalization, QA, and documentation
  
 * Project Community Lists and Archives
   development topics, user-facing information, user reports,
   trouble-shooting, and feedback
  
 * Public Project-Community Interfaces
   tying together development, users, and support areas:
   - Bugzilla and issue tracking
   - Wiki and Documentation
   web site (two flavors), and Community Forums
   
Development and Release Engineering
-----------------------------------

Separate source-only release of UNO Tools for independent usage has stalled
with inability to obtain enough binding votes for a release candidate.

Addition of feature updates along with maintenance for a release 4.2.0 has
stalled without preparation of any release candidates as of 2016-06-30.

Activity to upgrade the build system stalled on difficulties with obtaining
efficient Windows builds.

A documented walkthrough of the Windows build process still needs review
since the previous report.

Deployment and Take-Up 
----------------------

For the eight months since release of AOO 4.1.2 through 2016-06-30, 
there are 29 million downloads, averaging about 850,000 per week and now
down to about 600,000 as we enter North American Summer in the last week.  
Platform take-up is relatively constant:

   87.5% for Windows,
    7.8% for Macintosh, and
    4.7% for all other distributions
    
In the same time span, release 4.1.1 had 26.2 million downloads.
    
US destinations have the greatest number of downloads by nationality,
representing but 15% of the total.  English language localization
is chosen for 41% of recent downloads, with 11 languages in the top
92%: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Polish,
Portuguese, Chinese and Dutch in decreasing order.  The remaining 8% 
includes 27 additional languages and the SDK.  Details are in the PDF at
https://s.apache.org/2fwg

SourceForge serving of downloads has continued with its much-improved
usability and up-time.


Branding
--------

The project is still not making any changes involving the new feather logo
and powered-by graphics.  This is not a priority.

There is typically one request for use of the marks each month.

The counterfeit OpenOffice of an anonymous imposter has finally been removed
from the application store where it was offered.

There is typically one monthly report of a suspected trademark misuse (or 
confusion about selling of Apache OpenOffice).  

Community Lists and Archives 
----------------------------

Every mailing list has decreased in average monthly activity from 2016 Q1
to 2016 Q2.  Some mailing lists have insignificant traffic.  Because of
Northern Hemisphere Summer, it is too soon to know how much the year-over-
year decline in activity has continued.

The complete compilation of the data is in PDF at
<https://s.apache.org/OHfh>.  The list is in decreasing order by 2015 
activity.

  general-ja@     3     2     0     0    0

Bugzilla and Issue Tracking
---------------------------

The rate of new bugzilla issues is steadily decreasing since 2013, the first
full year of the Apache OpenOffice Top-Level Project.  The rate at which
issues remain unresolved over all that time is stubbornly in excess of 40%.
The complete tabulation is in the PDF at http://s.apache.org/YFT 
Qualitative analysis at <http://s.apache.org/SNg> applies.

Wiki and Documentation
----------------------

The documentation effort initiated in 2013 is stalled.

New volunteers arrive periodically although concerted, sustained effort is
absent.  

Along with significant outdated material on the MediaWiki, changes in the
product are not accompanied by corresponding user documentation.


ISSUES
======

Continued identification of risks and issues of capacity and capability is
brought to public lists for discussion on the state of the project in the
community.  

The limited supply of expert contributors with the capacity, capability, and
availability for sustaining the project is reported.

Overall
-------

The arrival of newcomers is at a slow trickle.  Arrivals on the developer, QA,
and docs lists seek assignments and mentoring.  The newcomers appear eager
though lacking project and product knowledge. The project has negligible
capacity to support them at that level.

Release Engineering
-------------------

Providing a faster maintenance-release cadence to push out important 
fixes still has no support.

The buildbot for Windows binaries has failed continually for almost a
full year (since 2015-07-28).  There is no buildbot for OS X.  The project
fears risk of regressions from changes that are developed and successfully
applied for Linux and FreeBSD, the primary tools of the few active developers.

The project also risks inability to prepare release candidates and then 
provide adequate binding votes for candidates that might be achieved.

Branding
--------

Investigation of inappropriate use of Apache brands for OpenOffice occurs
when brought to the attention of the PMC.  It is also easy to conduct
internet searches and discover a frightening number of likely trademark
misuse cases.  Try an Internet search for "Open Office."  Or just search for
the same on ebay.com or ebay.co.uk.  E.g., 
http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Open+Office

The PMC is overwhelmed by this onslaught.  There is insufficient capacity
and comfort at working through this situation.

We need to develop better templates for engaging producers of products that
invite confusion with Apache OpenOffice.  We need to find ways to pursue such
cases that do not overwhelm the capacity of the Project Management Committee
to manage.  We also need to simplify the engagement of trademarks@, especially
where distributors of third-party software impose friction in the acceptance 
of trademark violation complaints.

That looks like a full-time job and the volunteer cycles are not available.

Server Support
--------------

The Apache OpenOffice PMC is obligated to provide software installation,
maintenance, and administration of unique services spun up on behalf
of the project.  This includes the Community Forums, the MediaWiki, and
build slaves for Windows and flavors of Linux.  It would apply
to a build slave for OS X if one were added to the list.

That's a rare skill among those to whom work and support of Apache OpenOffice
appeals.  We appear to lack enough expertise and capacity to handle the
obligations for tending to these infrastructure-hosted services.  

We require assistance in finding a way to arrive at a satisfactory 
arrangement that the PMC has the ability to support.

- We released Spark 1.6.2 on June 26th, with bug fixes for the 1.6
  branch of the project (https://s.apache.org/spark-1.6.2).

Trademarks:

- The PMC is engaging with several third parties that are using Spark
  in product names, branding, etc.

- The PMC has been working on a page about trademark guidelines to include
  on the Spark website (https://s.apache.org/PaXo). It would be great to get
  feedback on this (several board members said it was a good idea to create
  such a page after we suggested it in our last report).

- To make the project's association with the ASF clearer in news articles
  and corporate materials, we have updated its logo to include "Apache":
  https://s.apache.org/Jf7J. This change is live on the website, JIRA, etc.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
 Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation
 uses to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 STeVe is currently in a sort of hiatus. We have >= 3 PMC members awake,
 but development has been stalled due to lack of spare cycles to devote
 on the project. As we get closer to next ASF Members Meeting, we expect
 development to pick up the pace again. If not, we'll be sure to notify
 the board, but we are not expecting this to become a problem. We are
 not aware of any outstanding vulnerabilities or anything critical in
 the software.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Rich Bowen on Mon Apr 20 2015 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 9 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Pierre Smits at Tue Dec 15 2015 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - No releases yet.
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
   Mailing list activity seems tied to the members meeting, going
   up when we get close to a new meeting, and then dying out afterwards.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made six release in the last quarter.
* Struts 2.3.20.3 - Struts 2.3 security fix release (2016-04-21)
* Struts 2.3.24.3 - Struts 2.3 security fix release (2016-04-21)
* Struts 2.3.28.1 - Struts 2.3 security fix release (2016-04-21)
* Struts 2.5 - first full GA release new Struts 2.5 development line
(2016-05-11)
* Struts 2.3.29 - full GA release including bug fixes, feature
enhancements and security fixes (2016-06-17)
* Struts 2.5.1 - full GA release including bug fixes, feature
enhancements and security fixes (2016-06-18)

The reporting period marked a rather busy quarter. The team was pleased
to successfully prepare and release the first GA version of the new
Struts 2.5 development line. Struts 2.5 includes new features,
consolidations and dependency upgrades along with dropping support for
already deprecated APIs and framework parts and significantly improved
performance. It is considered a milestone release towards Struts 3,
which is supposed to include major new features as well as breaking
changes. We have received a lot of positive feedback on the new
development line from the community so far.

Besides that, we had to deal with various security issue reports. The
valid issues, including some of critical severity, lead to timely
security fix releases. The communication and issue management went very
well, including valuable advices from the Apache Security Team [1].

Our fellow Struts PMC member Johannes Geppert gave a talk on combining
Apache Struts with Angular JS for building modern web applications at
ApacheCon NA, Vancouver.

No new committer or PMC member was added in the last quarter. The last
committership addition was on 2015-10-23 (Aleksandr Mashchenko). The
last PMC membership addition was on 2016-02-28 (Greg Huber).

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Thrift Project  [Jake Farrell]

Apache Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

Project Status
---------
The Apache Thrift community has seen a drop in activity this quarter due to
issues with our CI pipeline and the ability for us to quickly test new
contributions. Our backlog was spread across multiple systems and we had
multiple ways a new code contribution could be submitted with multiple CI
systems all testing different things and having their own set of problems.

The Apache Thrift community discussed what was occurring on the dev@ list and
the consensus was made to create a single work flow which would involve moving
fully over to Github for all code contributions, stopping use of the ASF
Jenkins for CI and using Travis and AppVeyor to meet our needs. We now have
this new single work flow in place and are seeing successful green builds on
master again for new contributions.

We are now discussing how to best go back through the backlog and test
previously contributed patches in the new work flow while we continue working
to improve our test speed and coverage. 

With the new work flow in place and successful builds from our CI we
are planning to cut our 0.10.0 release candidate before the end of July.

=== Apache Tika Status Report : July 2016 ===

What is Tika?
=========================
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from, a
growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognised by IANA and other standards bodies.

Issues
=========================
There are no issues that need the boards attention.

Releases

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
 Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
 (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).


## Activity:
 It was reported last month that TinkerPop had still not completely transferred
 from incubator infrastructure. Since that time, Apache Infrastructure has 
 completed the transfer and TinkerPop is now fully on TLP infrastructure.

 As alluded to in the previous report, two releases (3.1.3 and 3.2.1) are expected 
 to be up for vote by the community during the week of July 18th. Major 
 development continues to focus on opening TinkerPop to non-JVM programming
 languages through the concept of Gremlin Language Variants[1]. TinkerPop is 
 currently focused on Python as the first of these languages to support. 

## Issues:
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
 - 3.1.2 (April 8, 2016)
 - 3.2.0 (April 8, 2016)

## PMC/Committer:

 - Last PMC addition was Dylan Millikin - May 2016
 - Last committer addition was Michael Pollmeier - April 2016

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

## Description:
 Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
 and Varnish in functionality and features. What makes ATS unique across the
 landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on extensibility (plugins), HTTP
 protocol conformity and performance. ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs
 in the world, delivering a significant portion of all internet traffic. 

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - We held our Spring Summit in Vancouver, just before the ApacheCon
   conference. In a packed room, we shared and discussed use cases of ATS,
   complex problems and solutions, and some future directions. Emails and
   Jira's were created where we agreed on concrete proposals (such as the
   updated release schedules).

 - At ApacheCon, several ATS related presentations were made during the
   conferences.

 - We have decided to skip one releaes this release year, bringing us down to
   only 3 planned releases. Details on the planned releases is available at

     https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Release+Management

 - We have migrated to the new MATT system succesfully, and we are seeing a
   stready stream of contributions on the Github pull requests. Not only from
   current committers, but also from new contributors. We have had two minor
   issues with the synchronization, both of which were automatically detected
   by MATT, and subsequently quickly resolved by Infra.

 - In addition, we've added support for our Jenkins CI to also allow for
   builds on two platforms (Linux and FreeBSD) of all Github PRs. This has
   helped us tremedeusly in code reviews as well as quality, avoding
   committing changes that would otherwise break the CI builds.

 - Committers from the ATS community are participating in the upcoming HTTP
   Workshop in Stockholm, in July.

## Health report:
 - ATS v6.2.0 is currently in RC3 release, and we're aiming for a final
   release in July. v7.0.0 is now scheduled for mid-october (pushed out by ~1
   month).

 - Activity on mailing lists is normal. However, the numbers below are
   somewhat skewed due to the Github integration. This has been addressed
   (thanks infra!) and we expect the number of emails to dev@ to return to
   normal for the next report.

 - It's still early to say, but our migration to Github and the eco-system
   around Github Pull Requests seems to have a postive impact on community
   participation. We are seeing roughly a 20% increase in contributors
   compared to previous report. This is very positive, and we hope this will
   also lead to new committers being added in the upcoming months and year.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Sagara Gunathunga]

Web Services Report for July 2016

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML based Web 
Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and 
others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.   
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.  However, user questions 
are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixes, and there are at least 3 independent 
PMC members around making sure the project can continue to produce releases as needed.   

Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of the art, we don’t 
expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new committers, etc...

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)
