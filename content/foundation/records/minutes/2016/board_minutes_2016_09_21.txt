 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       This month saw the continued discussion of officer roles as noted in
       the August minutes. While further discussion continues around these
       roles, one clear outcome has emerged, with Ross informing the board of
       the appointment of Greg Stein as an Infrastructure Administrator.

       As a result, Greg has notified the board and membership of his intent
       to resign his post as Director, Vice Chairman and VP Subversion.

       Greg has served on the board continuously for more than 15 years,
       including several years as Chairman and later as Vice Chairman. We are
       incredibly thankful for his service to the Foundation in these roles.
       While we will miss his presence as a member of the board, we look
       forward to his new role within the Foundation. Thanks Greg!

    B. President [Ross]

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ======================

       Our VP TAC has been fully absent throughout the whole application
       period and for most of the period prior to this. I've appointed
       Melissa Warnkin as interim VP while we establish the reason for the
       current VPs absence (he has been seen in other areas, but is
       unresponsive on all TAC related issues). Gavin, our previous VP has
       assisted where he can in his capacity as an infra team member, but we
       should not be taxing the infra team with maintenance of the TAC webapp
       (unless we agree to make it a core service, which is not something I
       am proposing). Melissa has driven the process forward, with a largely
       new team, and although it is very tight, expects to complete
       preparations on time. In order to do this she has moved to a manual
       process. 

       The number of applications is reasonably high in comparison to
       previous years. Given the circumstances the team, and Melissa in
       particular, have done an excellent job.

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       No report is available ahead of the meeting, so these are the items I
       am aware of.

       The team have interviewed a significant number of people for the infra
       team. I believe that we will have made offers to at least one, though
       do not have confirmation of that at this time.

       I've confirmed with David that he would like to complete his
       resignation once infra staff are appointed. A replacement for VP Infra
       has not yet been confirmed but candidates have made themselves known,
       with concerns about the workload. Now we have moved on the Infra
       Administrator position (below) I will work on making a VP Infra
       appointment.

       We have had long and varied discussions about the need to increase
       paid support for operational aspects of the foundation. We have not
       yet reached a consensus position on the spectrum between “throw more
       volunteers at it” to “move it all under paid staff”. However, there is
       growing consensus that the growth of the foundation must be correctly
       managed. While the community aspects of our projects remain healthy
       and volunteers are perfectly capable of ensuring our projects continue
       to operate under The Apache Way, the story is different for operations
       aspects of the organization.

       To this end I will appoint Greg Stein as a part-time, paid,
       Infrastructure Administrator. This will move many of the operational
       responsibilities of the VP Infra role to paid staff.

       The high level responsibilities of for this role are:

       - high-level direction/priorities (including being the point of
       contact for the broader ASF community with respect to self-serve)
       - budgeting and contract management
       - a single point of contact for our hired professional staff 
       - assist Foundation exec officers with defining strategy/policy
       - executing against such policies
       - other responsibilities as required

       You will note a conspicuous absence of hands on infra work in this
       list of responsibilities. This role is designed to empower our
       existing staff through career development opportunities. This role is
       explicitly designed to remove the overhead of staff management from a
       volunteer VP. We will still have a VP of Infra, who will be a
       volunteer and will be responsible to the President and thus the board
       for the health of our infrastructure, Our VP will cover both core and
       non-core services. Our paid staff/contractors will focus entirely on
       core services and thus it is expected that day to day management of
       the core services will be fully delegated to the infra administrator
       and the existing infra contractors. This enables the VP to focus on
       the self-help aspects of the role. The Infra Administrator will act as
       the communications channel between community and staff.

       Brand Management
       ================ 
       VP Brand reports an ever growing and complex workload. Attempts to
       recruit volunteer help have been minimally successful and our legal
       support is limited on existing budgets.

       I request that the board consider reporting mechanisms that will
       assist in raising awareness of the branding policies and the self-help
       approach we are trying to take with brand management. I am not
       suggesting requiring a formal report with respect to branding issues,
       but unfortunately I have not been able to come up with a suitable
       proposal approach. Suggestions welcome.

       Fundraising
       ========= 
       The team still have the option of reverting to the original "no follow" rules for Bronze sponsors and have begun vetting sponsors more closely. This months report presents some interesting reading on why our current VP feels it is important to provide equality in our treatment of bronze
       sponsors when compared to higher level sponsors. I think the reasoning
       is solid and fully support this position. The short version is that we
       are here for the public good and should seek to have equality in all
       aspects of the foundation regardless of size and budget available.

       VP Brand and VP Marketing have been collaborating on a number of
       initiatives to assist with fundraising efforts. See the full report
       for details of these early stage activities.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


       Clarification: The old "no follow" rules (denying a clickable
       link to Bronze sponsors) have not been put into place. The
       Fundraising team are looking at how to avoid the appearance of
       "SEO for Sale" for sponsors.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       No report was submitted.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Work continues on cleaning up the records to make sure that all
       committers have ICLAs on file and that records match.

       Work continues under the auspices of the Whimsy project on the new
       tool to process incoming documents.

       In August, 72 iclas, four cclas, and one grant were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]
        
        The CFP for ApacheCon Seville has now closed, and we are in
        the review period. We are scheduled to send speaker
        notifications on the 26th of this month.

        There have been 173 talks submitted for Apache Big Data, and
        175 for ApacheCon Europe.

        We are using a new system for reviewing talks. Rather than
        asking reviewers to assign a numerical value to each talk, we
        are using a tool called "Papers Please", which asks the
        reviewer to choose between talks based on which talk they
        believe a target audience would attend. Whereas the old the
        old method tended to give us ratings of 4 out of 5 on almost
        everything, this method appears to give a better understanding
        of what talks people actually want to see. Additionally,
        reviewers are given the talk abstract and title, but not
        information about the speaker. This has been shown, in other
        conferences, to increase diversity of speakers, introduce more
        new speakers, and reduce the "popularity contest" nature of
        talk selection.

        We have one keynote lined up, and are looking for others. If
        you have one in mind, please speak up.
    
        ApacheCon North America is scheduled for May 15-19 at the
        Intercontinental in Miami.

        There has been some discussion on the operations@apache.org
        list regarding crafting policy about when third party events
        can (and can not) be scheduled, in order to prevent
        conflicting with ApacheCon and other Apache project's events.
        While we have a contract that states that we can't hold other
        events called 'ApacheCon' within a particular geographic and
        time window around existing events named 'ApacheCon', we do
        not have a written policy around other events that use Apache
        trademarks.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Interesting and complex questions continue on trademarks@ apace.  The growth
of both projects/podlings, the major vendors that use them (and sometimes
abuse them) continues to outstrip our small amount of volunteer energy
available to properly address them.

The trend is clear that we are not able to provide the level of brand
management expertise to all Apache projects that is asked for.  Separately,
it's clear from spot checks that some projects are not doing as thorough a job
of branding or trademark enforcement as we would expect to maintain the
expected Apache-style long-term independent community governance with new and
diverse contributors.

A number of attempts over the past two years to draw in new skilled volunteers
has resulted in but one volunteer with the consistency, experience, and
levelheaded-ness to be a regular advisor or driver of branding issues. 
Similarly, it appears that we are over capacity of our legal counsel given our
limited budget and our monthly discount fee agreement, even only accounting
for the most basic of PMC-requested services.

Mark Thomas has started work on improving our event branding policy,
especially with respect to ensuring that Apache branded events don't unduly
conflict with our own ApacheCon conferences.

Interesting trademarks@ discussions this month:

- Are favicons part of a project brand? In general, yes they are.
- Several merchandising requests, both permissions and to buy.
- Numerous discussions about Apache Spark, OpenOffice, and OFBiz marks. 
- Offer to sell us a projectname.nyc domain name, refused.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities continue normally.

This past cycle was a more eventful one.

There were a number of discussions regarding the future of Fundraising. I did
not provide feedback yet, but I plan to do so.

We continue to get requests for Bronze sponsorship which raised concerns in
the past. As I mentioned in previous reports we continue to monitor the
situation. The President asked for clarification regarding what exactly this
means, what kind of changes we envision and what would trigger them. There are
a number of changes we did implement and others we could implement such as
reverting to 'nofollow' links for Bronze. What we did was starting to ask
potential Bronze sponsors in a nice way about their story and the motivation
to sponsor the ASF. In all the cases we accepted the sponsors seemed aware of
what the ASF is doing and didn't seem a decision based on SEO stats. Another
change was delaying the response to figure out, again, what motivates the
potential bronze sponsor. For the trigger part of the question, the trigger
would be a disproportionate amount of, say, questionable Bronze sponsors
relative to the total number of Bronze sponsors. It is indeed subjective, but
one objective metric is the number of concerns raised by the board and members
who monitor the fundraising activities. As I mentioned in the past, it is my
strong belief that sponsors should receive equal treatment and the ASF is
also, if not more importantly, for the 'small guys' and by that in no way do I
mean endorsing any commercial activities, but as we like being associated to
the Microsoft, Google, IBMs of the world (list not meant to be discriminatory
to other sponsors), we are considered by some 'small guys' as rock starts and
they want to be associated with us and our values. I think it is only natural
that we see more online services, but in time I hope to see hospitals, grocery
stores and a range of other business supporting us. We actually had non techie
(kinda) sponsors like Accor and Budget Direct for a long time. For more
questions and clarifications I assume more of the discussion will continue on
the mailing list and we'll include summaries in the monthly reports.

One of the main focuses is outstanding renewals. On one renewal [1] an ASF
member promised to get me in touch with the responsible person in his
organization. Tom Pappas and I scheduled a chat next Fri to walk through the
outstanding renewals and come up with a plan.

I had a few conversations with Sally during the past month, which was a great
thing and I believe we should coordinate more between Fundraising and
Marketing. 

One initiative suggested by Sally who introduced me to the CEO of Hopsie was
to use the Hopsie platform to follow up with sponsors and donors (probably of
larger amounts, exact amount tbd). After a few chats, Hopsie created a free
account for the ASF for 6 months, enough time for us to determine if the
platform benefits us or not. This initiative is related to the document Bill
Rowe sent, which contains a few valuable ideas.

The second initiative discussed with Sally is to start a series of articles
that promote ASF projects and briefly touch on success stories from the
industry. The initiative would be sponsored by the VP Fundraising who would
take the role of liaising with PMCs and sponsors to create and curate content,
while Marketing would be in charge of editing, approving and publishing the
content. The idea was well received by a few ASF members I spoke with and a
couple of sponsors. If no objection we intend to start executing this in the
next cycle. We intend this to be bi-monthly and we want to prepare some
content in advance.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget, with no outstanding invoices due
at this time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally Khudairi is
working on the ASF Quarterly Report (Q1 FY2017), which will be issued
at the end of September. She has been working with Hadrian Zbarcea
regarding several Fundraising items, and has coordinated the
onboarding of 27 PMCs to new analytics services by Snoot (will likely
open the service to all PMCs before the end of September). She
continues to counsel several vendors involved with various Apache
projects with publicity, outreach, and branding requirements, however,
a small handful of organizations appear to be repeat offenders,
presumably acting under the guise/mode of "ask forgiveness than
permission", yet are actually doing neither.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe: 

- 22 August 2016 --Announcing Apache® CloudStack™ v4.9


IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 110 weekly summaries published to date. 33 items were Tweeted on
@TheASF. No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for
more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: in spite of much of the world being on holiday
over the past month, we have been rather busy with media-related
activities. We responded to 9 media queries. The ASF received 675
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 911. Media coverage of
Apache projects yielded 2,871 press hits vs. last month's 4,337.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst queries and are in
the process of fact-checking a Forrester report on Cloud standards.
Apache was mentioned in 27 reports by Gartner, 8 reports by Forrester,
17 reports by 451 Research, and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is working with Sharan Foga and Melissa
Warnkin on preparations for the ASF booth at ApacheCon Europe. Once
again, Sally will be holding media/analyst training at ApacheCon
Europe --the first time in 7 years. Analyst Fintan Ryan of RedMonk
will be conducting the media training briefings.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally declined a
European conference partnership opportunity (forwarded via Rich
Bowen), due to the required $100K participation fee. No other
conference-related activities at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 34 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

In August the Apache Security Team became an official Mitre Candidate
Naming Authority (CNA).  Previously we were giving blocks of CVE names
to use by Red Hat on request.  Now we have our own block of CVE names
direct from Mitre and are known as the official source when anyone
asks for a CVE name for any non-public vulnerability in any ASF
project.  (This change has minimal process or operational impact at
this time, it also was never obvious where the block came from or the
relationship with Red Hat, so we don't intend any public-visible
commentary about this change).

Stats for August 2016:

11 CVEs issued to projects (some may not be public yet).

Attachment B: Report from the Apache Allura Project  [Dave Brondsema]

## Description:

Apache Allura is an open source implementation of a software forge, a web site
that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, wiki pages,
blogs, and more for any number of individual projects.

## Issues:

- No issues needing board attention.

## Activity:

- Made a 1.5.0 release
- GSOC program completed with good contributions, and results published on our
website

## Health report:

Last board report we had this comment:
mt: Looking at the archives, activity seems to have dropped off
significantly around Feb/Mar 2016. Is there a particular reason
for this drop-off? Does the PMC think it is temporary or
permanent?

There have been shifts in active project members, we have less developers who
do Allura development as a significant portion of their day job. We do have
new committers too though. And some communication ended up on IRC or on merge
requests moreso than on the dev@ list, which also affected list archive
stats.  (We have filed a feature ticket to be able to have Allura merge
request comments go to a mailing list)

Overall I think Allura is doing ok, since we are adding new committers and
making releases, but the development pace has slowed a little bit, and it
would be good to continue to grow our community.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Deepal Jayasinghe]

## Description

  The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
  software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary
  components (both Java and C stacks as well as Axis1).

## Issues:

 - Axis PMC received Apache Axis2 Vulnerability [VR-436], after evaluating the
   report we realized the claim is about an optional module which can be
   disable via Axis2 to configuration file (axis2.xml).  In addition,
   recommendation for that module is only for debugging and not for production
   use.
 - In previous meeting board requested to report on many inactive sub-projects
   and we have moved Axis1 project to Attic.
 - Regarding other inactive project (i.e., Axis2 C and its sub projects) we
   had a discussion regarding moving some of the inactive projects to Attic
   and also had a vote regarding the same [1].  During the discussion [2]
   three individuals (Rafael Bronzeri, Giorgio Zoppi and Sendil Rajendhran)
   came forward to contribute to the project and now we have given them the
   opportunity and watching the progress.  Unfortunately we do not see enough
   progress and if no progress is made, we will try to move Axis2 C projects
   (and its sub-projects) to Attic as well.

## Activity:

 - A new PMC member/committer was added.

## PMC/Committer changes:

 - Currently 62 PMC/Commiters members.
 - Rafael Bronzeri was added as a PMC member/Committer in June 2016.

## Releases:

 - Axis2 Java Project and Sub-projects - May 30, 2016.
 - Axis2 C Project and Sub-projects -  Apr 2009

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Olaf Flebbe]

## Description:

Apache Bigtop is a software related to a system for integration,
packaging, deployment and validation of a big data management
software distribution based on Apache Hadoop.

## Issues:

None

## Releases:

1.1.0 was released on Fri Jan 29 2016

## Activitiy

Activity has been stalled a bit because almost all Committer and PMC seem
to have little time to spend on Apache Bigtop.

A discussion started how to add new committers to keep suggested enhancements
reviewed, which are still flowing in.

The discussion ended by inviting a new committer, who proposed the Juju charms
integration in the first place. Luckily he accepted a few days ago.

We are monitoring if additional actions are required.

## PMC changes:

- Last PMC addition was Nate D'Amico on Fri Jan 22 2016

## Committer base changes:

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing
   
Issues
======

The threat of moving the project to the attic is ongoing but some progress
has been made after an emailed plea for more contributors sent to the dev
email list. A summary of the discussion is provided below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 15 PMC members on the project with the last additions
in January 2014.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

Community & Development
=======================

As discussed in the last report there are currently not considered to be
enough PMC members with the necessary skills to continue the project.
Since then an email was sent to the dev list as encouraged by the board
and after this there have been 27 emails to the list that discuss interest
in the project or otherwise represent some attempt to make progress. Of
these there are some responses from GSoC students who might be able to
make a quick transition to be on the PMC.

Areas of progress include restoring the main issue tracker to working
order after it became non-responsive and one potential contributor is
looking at updating the version of Trac upon which Bloodhound is based.

With these discussions ongoing it is probably prudent to take some further
time to encourage the new potential committers to translate interest in
involvement into contributions.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matt Benson]

## Apache BVal Report September 2016 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
the foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases; last BVal release (v1.1.1) was released February 2016.

### Activity ###
Some activity in JIRA and on developer list this quarter. The specification
process for Bean Validation v2.0 proceeds; this will inevitably trigger a
round of future activity for us to make a compliant release.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.
Last PMC member added Q4 2013
Last committer added Q3 2013

Last quarter the board asked whether BV 2.0 might afford opportunities to
identify and onboard new personnel to the project. That is possible but
probably not especially likely; the PMC would be happy to consider
suggestions to enhance the vitality of the project. However, because BVal is
incorporated into Apache TomEE and Apache Geronimo, it is to be expected that
one or both of these projects might provide manpower when necessary to ensure
the availability of a compliant and compatibly-licensed implementation of the
Bean Validation specification.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Jonathan Ellis]

## Description:

 - This report is was created in response to a request from Mark Thomas on
   behalf of the ASF board. This request listed 10 specific action items to be
   undertaken by the PMC including the creation of this report outside of the
   project's normal reporting cycle. The content of the original email has
   been added to the PMC's svn repository and was used as a checklist [0] to
   organize PMC efforts in addressing these action items.

 - This report includes a "Board Requested Actions" section which provides a
   summary of said actions followed by specific activity undertaken by the PMC
   for each.

## Board Requested Actions

  An email was sent on by Nate McCall on behalf of the PMC to Christian Hasker
  (identified by Jonathan Ellis for the DataStax point of contact) requesting
  that they be addressed. Christian replied twice indicating that they were
  taking immediate action and to later update on progress. A correspondence
  email [1] has been uploaded.

- Review project controlled web properties for clear separation between
  DataStax and Cassandra

  The remaining references to DataStax on the project's web properties
  are under the Documentation section and take one of two forms:

  - links to contextually relevant blog posts under datastax.com
  - references to client driver projects

- Review release artifacts and documentation for clear separation between
  DataStax and Cassandra

  The project's downloads page lists ASF Debian packages as official binaries.
  Binaries managed by DataStax have been moved towards the bottom stating
  explicitly that they are not endorsed.

- Identify a process for ongoing monitoring of the projects marks

  The PMC has not yet discussed a process for monitoring the projects marks.

- Ensure the Cassandra Summit follows the ASF guidelines for events

  Jake Luciani reached out to the organizers on behalf of the PMC and uploaded
  correspondence emails [2] with conference organizer who addressed/documented
  the points raised. The document includes email threads of ASF channels used
  for trademark and cfp requests.

- Replacement for Jonathan after stepping down as chair

  The following three PMC members were nominated: Eric Evans, Jake Luciani,
  Nate McCall.

  Nate McCall was voted as successor and was put forward to the board.

- Review DataStax's "Cassandra MVP" program for a clear separation between
  DataStax and Cassandra

  A review of current DataStax content for the MVP program (including this
  year's Cassandra Summit) shows the primary wording is now "DataStax MVP for
  Apache Cassandra." There are, however, two older community-contributed posts
  on the Planet Cassandra property that use the phrase "DataStax Cassandra
  MVP."

- Stop using non-ASF, non-archived back channels for discussion

  The project is now using ASFBot for logging the #cassandra-dev [3] IRC
  conversations.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Cayenne Project  [Andrus Adamchik]


## Description:
Apache Cayenne is a Java persistence framework. It takes a distinct
approach to object persistence and provides an ORM runtime, remote
persistence services, and a GUI mapping/modeling tool.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
There were no releases on the stable (3.1) or alpha (4.0) branches this
past reporting period.  Most effort was directed to 4.0 development
(expecially Remote Object Persistence - ROP) and bug fixes, environmental
updates (such as fixing build failures), and mailing list support.

## Health report:
Cayenne is still under active development and mailing list activity
indicates we have an active and stable community, although with a
summer vacation lull.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

## Description:
  Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
  (Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in Java,
  Python, PHP, .NET, Objective-C, and JavaScript (and possibly other
  languages).

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
  - We are currently voting on the OpenCMIS 1.0.0 (Java) release.
    We have cleaned up the code, removed outdated source code,
    fixed small bugs, and added little features.
    We are now streamlining the release process.
  - PortCMIS (.NET) and cmislib (Python) received a few bug fixes and
    small new features.
  - Apart from this, there is not much activity.

## Health report:
  - The CMIS standard hasn't changed and the libraries are mature now.
    There is no major code development expected.

## PMC changes:

  - Currently 35 PMC members.
  - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment O: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Will Stevens]

## Description: 
   Apache CloudStack (ACS) is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud 
   orchestration platform.  ACS manages many types of hypervisors, storage 
   and networking devices.
   
## Issues: 
 - The PMC currently has a Jira ticket open [1] with Infra to have the Github 
   mirror `apache/cloudstack` moved to `apachecloudstack/cloudstack`.
   This initiative was approved in May 2016 and all my attempts to move
   this activity forward have been unsuccessful.  This is a priority 
   issue for our project and we need it addressed ASAP with a clear path
   forward.
   
## Activity: 
 - The 4.9.0 and 4.8.1 versions have been released after a bit of a slow
   spring.
 - The release schedule has had quite a bit of work and we have a proposal
   for the release schedule in the works right now [2].  We hope to have a
   more predictable release schedule going forward, so this is a good first
   step.
 - The community/users have been requesting a project feature roadmap, so we
   have started work on it [3].
   
## Health report: 
   The project is healthy.  The mailing list has been active other than a
   small lull while the branches were frozen for stabilizing and releasing
   4.9.0.  In addition to the normal continued development of the project, we
   have been looking into better support the users of the project and
   increase adoption.  Two items which users / potential users have brought
   up as deficiencies is the lack of an LTS release and the lack of a project
   feature roadmap.  We are working to address both of these issues to better
   position the project to potential users.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 42 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Rafael Weingärtner on Sun Apr 24 2016 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 109 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Simon Weller at Tue Apr 26 2016 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - 4.9.0 was released on Fri Aug 12 2016 
 - 4.8.1 was released on Mon Aug 15 2016 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - We had a drop in mailing list participation due to the master branch being
   frozen for an extended period as we got the details of the massive 4.9.0
   release stabilized and shipped.  The mailing list activity picked up to
   its normal rate as soon as the branches were unfrozen.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2012-07-06

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2012-07-06

General status:
  The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14

  Since then there have been some changes, but it will need someone to
  initiate the release process.

  There has not been anyone with sustained activity to be considered as a
  potential new committer/PMC member. However there are some people
  on the dev list that resurface occasionally, so they could be encouraged.
  There are also some regulars on the users list that could be encouraged.

  There was some activity on the users mail list. Two major topics, which did
  have users helping each other, and one PMC member assisting. 

  There was only a little activity on the dev mail list.

  About ten PMC members were present during the quarter. This confirms
  that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to potentially
  be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors. However it
  is a little worrying that no-one responded to this draft report.

  The Cocoon chair has been absent and not attending his duties in a timely
  manner since the beginning of the year. I take the consequences and will
  step down to leave room for someone that can attend the project as it
  should be.

Progress of the project:
  A committer added some features to 2.1 regarding XMLResourceBundles
  and i18n.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description: 

The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java components.

The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
Apache and without. Any ASF committer can commit to Apache Commons.

The last report was on June 7 2016.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues that requires the boards attention this quarter.
   
## Activity: 
 - The project is active with 4 releases this reporting period. One new 
 component being is being readied for release (Commons RNG) and another
 component is still in limbo (Commons Math.) after having been forked.
 Commons RDF is slowly making its way through the incubator. 

 - Apache Commons Crypto has seen it first release: 1.0.0.

 - The Commons community has decided to bring forth and maintain a new 
 component, Commons RNG, out of the larger Commons Math code base, which is 
 has seen no activity in the last quarter. The future of Commons Math is 
 still uncertain and being discussed from time to time. There are several 
 proposals for fostering new communities in place of the dwindling 
 Commons Math one, but that those are in limbo because no consensus 
 has been reached yet.
   
## Health report: 
 - Most components in Commons are mature, but are still actively 
 maintained (4 releases). The dev list is active. JIRA is active. Speed of 
 responses to users is reasonable in most cases. We have 4 new committers,
 and Commons is still open to any Apache Committer.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

The iOS and Android platforms had minor and patch releases while the Windows
platform only had patch (bug fix) releases. 

Android released minor version 5.2.0 which removed auto-setting of the
versionCode in projects that was causing problems with generating APKs for
different versions of Android. iOS released minor version 4.2.0 which added
support for node.js version 6.x.

We didn't have a plugins release this quarter.
   
## Health report: 

The (northern hemisphere) summer vacation period has significantly impacted
contributions, also a big block of active contributors (that are all employed
from one vendor) have slowed down their active work on the project.

We also added a status page to show all the continous integration (AppVeyor,
Travis CI) statuses of all our repos in Github, providing a quick glance at
project health. The status page is at http://cordova.github.io/cordova-status/
which shows the status of all our 60+ repos.

We also have a CI server that does periodic builds of all the repos at
http://cordova-ci.cloudapp.net:8080/view/Periodic%20builds/

We are also providing nightly builds of all the major platforms, and the CLI:
https://builds.apache.org/job/cordova-nightly/ and documented here:
http://cordova.apache.org/contribute/nightly_builds.html

We are currently working on getting stats on Github Pull Request activity. The
loss of active contributors is impacting this, and we have a huge backlog, and
we have no active way of measuring this on a daily or weekly basis so we don't
know how we are progressing on this currently. Some work has been done on
this: https://github.com/cordova/cordova-pull-request-stats

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Falcon Project  [Srikanth Sundarrajan]

ABOUT
Falcon is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop
designed for data motion, coordination of data pipelines,
lifecycle management, and data discovery. Falcon enables end
consumers to quickly onboard their data and its associated
processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters. 

ISSUES
There are no issues that require board's attention at this time. 

STATUS
After a bit of delay, the much awaited Falcon 0.10 release was
made in August, with support for data import/export, cluster updates,
support for Apache Spark, server side recipe support and many more.
Besides, few critical issues reported in 0.9 were fixed as well.

Few of the older developers have been less active in recent times, so
the activity levels in general have come down a notch compared to the 
past. However the project continues to attract newer contributors. We
also had a talk on Falcon at the recently concluded Fifth Elephant
Conference in Bangalore (https://s.apache.org/fifth-elephant-falcon).
We also had another talk on Falcon during this period at the GIDS 
summit. (https://s.apache.org/gids-falcon).

The community is very actively discussing about baselining our API
and entity definition schema and move towards a 1.0 release. This 
should allow our users to develop against 1.0 interfaces without any
risk of any syntactic or behavioral incompatibiltiies. We are hoping 
to bring this out as our next release in the next 3-4 months.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex FalconJX 0.6.0 was released on 4/3/16. Voting underway for Apache
Flex FlexJS/FalconJX 0.7.0.

-Apache Flex SDK 4.15.0 was released on 1/9/16.
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.2 was released on 11/16/15.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was released on 6/23/15.


ACTIVITY The past three months saw the creation of the first FlexJS job!
FlexJS is the next generation of Flex that provides application developers
with a highly productive framework and tool chain for developing web apps,
mobile apps and desktop apps.  Traditional Flex applications require Adobe
Flash/AIR runtimes (or tools to pre-compile them to Android/IOS).  FlexJS
applications output HTML/JS/CSS and can even be used to create Apache Cordova
applications.  FlexJS continues to be the main focus of development.  The new
job was created by the employer of a current committer and both are now
contributing to FlexJS as part of their
$dayjob.  Another committer-candidate has appeared as well, making significant
contributions in the compiler, a place most folks don't like to go.  A release
vote is underway for our 0.7.0 release that includes Maven artifacts for the
first time, which was the highest voted JIRA wish for Flex.

COMMUNITY
-Yishaw Weiss was added as a committer.  Another vote on another candidate is
in progress.
-No new PMC members this quarter.
-Last PMC addition was Josh Tynjala on Wed Sep 16 2015. We will probably
promote a few new committers this quarter as we now have new committers that
are more active.

-Latest analytics include over 1000 hits per day on the website during the
work week (less on weekends).
-There were more than 11,000 installs of Apache Flex 4.15.0 since its release
in January.
-More than 100,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.  Tour De Flex
is a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex applications.

TRADEMARKS
-A company is promoting a software product called Flex that appears to be
related to themes/styles for website visuals. Despite several attempts to
contact them, they have not responded. In June, we asked Trademarks@ for
advice on next steps.  We have not heard back from Trademarks.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine.  Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Hadoop, Kafka, HBase,
Cassandra.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The Flink community started working together with the Apache Bahir
    community.  Some of the streaming connectors from Flink are now maintained
    under the Bahir umbrella. This allows for faster independent release
    cycles and more lightweight processes to add new connectors.

    We discussed as an alternative to create an independent subproject of
    Flink, but the community favored to work with Bahir. The Bahir community
    was very open to the idea and it looks like both committers and
    contributors are quite happy with the result.

  - The second edition of the "Flink Forward" conference took place in Berlin
    from September 12th to 14th. It featured a series of talks about use
    cases, applications, and in-depth technical discussions, as well as a
    training session. About 350 people attended.

    A good amount of Flink committers were at the conference as well and
    participated with talks and discussions about various aspects of the
    system.

  - The community adopted the "Improvement Proposal" concept from the Kafka
    community, under the name "FLIP" = "Flink Improvement Proposal", and uses
    the Wiki for that.

    Improvement proposals are proposed major changes with thorough design
    docs. Once discussed and approved (via mailing list), they are usually
    broken down into JIRA issues which are linked.

    We found that this complements JIRA and the mailing lists, because (1)
    there is one place where interested users and contributors can find an
    overview of all major additions/changes that have been proposed and are
    pending, and (2) the Wiki document sums up the final conceptual designs
    nicely while JIRA tracks the implementation aspects.

  - In the previous quarter, the Flink community introduces the concept of
    "shepherds".  Shepherds are experts/trackers of components, but have no
    authoritative power.

    The concept seems to not have discouraged anyone to look across component
    boundaries, and occasionally, it has helped for threads to be picked up.
    Overall, however, it has not been picked up as much as hoped for. Maybe it
    will be picked up better over time (it might simply take a while until
    everybody intuitively adopts such able concept). For now, it does not seem
    to have any downsides.

COMMUNITY

There was no new PMC addition since the last report.
The latest PMC addition was July 2nd, 2015 (Maximilian Michels)

Tzu-Li (Gordon) Tai was added as a committer on August, 26th, 2016.

Flink currently has 24 committers and 16 PMC members.

RELEASES

The following releases were made since the last board report:
   
 - 1.1.0 was released on August, 4th, 2016 
 - 1.1.1 was released on August, 10th, 2016 
 - 1.1.2 was released on September, 5th, 2016 
   
ACTIVITY ON JIRA / MAILING LISTS

Development speed is fast, we are seeing more thorough use of
JIRA, more fine grained issues, more discussion.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Some low activity on migrating to a new VM and Gump is back on
MacOS X. Gump seems to create useful results for the few projects
that use it.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The Linux VM we use for our main installation vmgump is scheduled to
get replaced as its host Eirene is about to be decommissioned. Work
hasn't really started on it but is expected to be completed during the
next quarter. As a result the Gump installation will get puppetized
which will make creating future installations easier, should there
ever be a need for them.

After a longish hibernation Gump is back on adam.apache.org thanks to
Sander Temme's work. We know adam is on the list of hosts to get
decommissioned as well but are happy to see it provide results that
may be useful while it lasts.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 61 podlings currently undergoing incubation -- an all-time high.

* Community

  No IPMC roster changes this month.

* New Podlings

  - Annotator
  - AriaTosca

* Graduations

  None this month.

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  August:

  - 2016-08-01 Apache Pony Mail 0.9.incubating
  - 2016-08-02 Apache Mnemonic 0.2.0-incubating
  - 2016-08-03 Apache Eagle 0.3.0-incubating
  - 2016-08-09 Apache Datafu (incubating) 1.3.1
  - 2016-08-10 Apache Gearpump 0.8.1-incubating
  - 2016-08-20 Apache Ranger (incubating) 0.6.1
  - 2016-08-22 Apache Metron 0.2.0BETA-incubating
  - 2016-08-22 Apache Beam 0.2.0-incubating
  - 2016-08-24 Apache CarbonData 0.1.0-incubating
  - 2016-08-29 Apache Pirk 0.1.0-incubating

* IP Clearance

  None this month.

* Legal / Trademarks

  - The Fluo podling grappled with how to handle the fluo.io domain, io.fluo
    Maven group ID, and the fluo-io GitHub organization.  Existing high
    profile domains which contain our trademarks (accumulosummit.com,
    stratahadoopworld.com, search.maven.org, etc.) had contributed to
    misunderstandings about to what extent Fluo could have a two-pole
    presence split across fluo.apache.org and a fluo.io entity outside Apache
    control.  Members of the IPMC made it clear that Fluo's graduation would
    be contingent on resolving this issue.

  - The Guacamole podling received guidance on how to integrate with Docker:
    either participate in the Infra-supported offering
    (<hub.docker.com/r/apache>), or treat Docker as a downstream distribution
    channel and create a customized offering in compliance with
    release/branding/incubation/etc policies.

* Miscellaneous

  - The OpenAZ podling has retired.

  - The recurring discussion as to whether the Incubator is too full came
    back for another installment.  Mentoring for healthy podlings seems to
    scale well, but other aspects such as release checking and cleaning up
    after troubled podlings present more difficulty.

* Credits

Edgent

  Apache Edgent is a programming model and micro-kernel style runtime that
  can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
  local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming from
  equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of all kinds
  (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in conjunction with
  centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides efficient and timely
  analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the center to the edge.

  Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
     around Edgent project
  2. Set up new build system, allowing us to remove code dependencies from
     our repository
  3. Create the first Apache release of Edgent

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Significant progress has been made on a new build system, using  Gradle.
  One of the goals is to remove third party code, so we can work toward a
  release.

  The community has been active and participating in voting.  Heavy commit
  activity, but light Jira activity, recently as the name change was
  implemented in the code, documentation and web site.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  According to JIRA, the project has added the following:

  * June: 29 new issues; 22 issues resolved.
  * July: 20 new issues; 15 issues resolved.
  * August: 7 new issues; 7 issues resolved.

  August activity was largely build and renaming activities, tracked under a
  few Jira issues.

  The name for the project was changed from Apache Quarks to Apache Edgent.
  The new name went through a suitable name search and was approved.  The
  infrastructure, code and documentation changes have been completed.

  A logo was voted on and chosen, and a wiki was set up for the Edgent
  community.

Date of last release:

  We have not created an Apache release as of yet.  We need to complete build
  changes and licensing work to create a release.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  In May, we added two new committers and PPMC members, Kathy Saunders and
  Queenie Ma.

Fineract

Fineract is an open source system for core banking as a platform.

Fineract has been incubating since 2015-12-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Getting a first release out – we are still inhibited by Hibernate issues
     which are more deeply rooted than we realized.
  2. Moving the community from the Mifos infrastructure to the Apache
     infrastructure – most discussions are taking place out of public view.
  3. Resolving the questions around introduction of a rework of the original
     code – in particular repository/infrastructure/release questions which
     result from the microservice architecture.


Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The person who creates and submits the board reports will cease to perform
  this task until the code rework is ready to be introduced to the community.
  It is possible that this will endanger the board reports.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Several prospective new committers have recently joined the Mifos community
  through Google Summer of Code and as new partners that we are working to
  add as committers to the Apache Fineract.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have tried and failed to produce an apache release again.  A release was
  produced by the mifos community outside of apache and announced on the
  apache fineract user list.

  The release included work intended to move us closer to apache policies.
  In particular, the removal of Hibernate annotations from the code uncovered
  a circular dependency in the data structure which was not caught in
  testing.  Two production systems from early adopters are out-of-service
  today.

  * The dev@htrace mailing list continues to see new comers which is great.
  * Although a GSoC-related project was not successfully completed, the
    Apache Kudu and Apache HTrace communities have made contact. This is
    part of the drive to have more projects integrate Apache HTrace.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * A discussion thread is currently ongoing to release HTrace 4.2. This
    will include over 40 issues addressed and may even be our last incubating

log4cxx2

Logging for C++. N.B. This is a reboot of the Log4cxx podling which
previously graduated.

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create a release
  2. Activate some community
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There was a discussion in the first quarter of the year to move the
  project to attic unless it is able to release in the next few months. No
  release happened since then.

  There was a discussion about some kind of "maintenance mode" where releases
  and community growth doesn't matter much. As that mode doesn't exist, it
  has been suggested to release, graduate from incubator and just live along
  other logging projects and in a comparable state like log4cxx.

  Currently it seems that there's only one official project member with
  commit access left answering mails. Even though that member and some
  contributors worked on being able to create a release in the past, contrary
  to expectations that project member didn't find the time to deal with a
  release as necessary.

  It seems most likely that if a release doesn't happen until the next report
  is due, it won't at all anymore. At least not by that one left member.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  One new contributor took quite some time to look and fix the release
  process.  Two support mails from users, no new project members.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Robert Middleton took quite some time to look at the build and release
  process on Windows and Linux in the last two months and came to the
  conclusion that the current Maven based process for both seems broken.
  He provided a shell based alternative for the release and CMAKE build
  starting points, which hasn't been merged into or tested by the project
  yet.

    One mentor active within in the past month. There is a single active

    is proving problematic for the contributor involved.  There is some
    discussion about moving to the attic and this seems appropriate

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Ate Douma:
  
    As indicated in the report, the activity and community of the project
    has dwindled down to practically zero.  As a consequence I've now raised
    the question on the dev list if better to retire the project. Unless
    this triggers some serious activity and interest from the community, I
    expect an actual vote to retire before the next board report.

Tamaya

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

   John D. Ament:
   
     The project continues to struggle.  I'm not sure its recoverable as an
     ASF project at this time.  May make sense to reboot in an external
     resource, e.g. GitHub, build a true community, and then come back.

--------------------
Taverna

Taverna is a domain-independent suite of tools used to design and execute
data-driven workflows.

Taverna has been incubating since 2014-10-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Project maturity evaluation and graduation
  2. Complete IP/license review of unreleased repositories
  3. Further engaging user/devops community

  Preparing to graduate.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The community is moving towards graduation, by preparing a
  Graduation Maturity Assessment
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAVERNADEV/2016-03+Taverna+Graduation+Maturity+Assessment

  While we wished we could have released all of Taverna's git repositories
  through the Incubator before graduating, we realize that with limited
  developer time, getting all of them to a cleanly releasable state
  could remove focus from development of the core repositories.

  As we an important point of Incubator releases is to ensure the project
  understands the ASF release process, including release review and voting,
  IP management and licensing compatibility; as well as accepting
  contributions. We believe we have gained that after 3 release votes
  https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/taverna/source/
  and 7 GSOC/student contributors.

  We have however identified the need for a License Review of the remaining
  git repositories that have not yet been formally released through the
  Apache Incubator (e.g. to ensure ASF file headers), which we are now
  completing:
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAVERNADEV/2016-09+License+review

  We might consider not including all of these repositories as we move
  towards graduation - we already have an alternative home
  https://github.com/taverna-extras for dormant extensions.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have seen an upsurge in activity with
  two successful GSOC projects as well as several
  new plugins from other students. Some of them have shown interest
  in continued contributions, which we must take into account
  for proposing new committers.

  This have admittedly taken some focus from the committers
  from the incubator graduation path - so we're now
  putting effort back into finishing our License Review.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Andy Seaborne:

    The Taverna podling is hindered by a lack of active mentors (myself
    included) - the project has appealled to general@ on a couple of
    occasions

    3 of the 4 active contributors are from one institution and contribution
    is related to EU project commitments.  The codebase is large and has a
    long history.  One option is to identify a "core" and move out the rest
    until such time as they are sustainable.  More active PMC/commiters
    would be a big boost.

    The comment from the last report applies:

      Drew Farris (shepherd):

        Little mentor activity on the mailing lists, could use another
        active mentor. Healthy activity in the community.

and a Spark cluster. As a Jupyter Notebook extension, it provides the user
with a preconfigured environment for interacting with Spark using Scala,
Python, R or SQL.

Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Resolve LGPL dependency: Great news! The team has just merged a PR and
     removed the LGPL license in favor of MPL
     (https://github.com/zeromq/jeromq/pull/358)
  2. Make a release: 0.1.x branch should be ready for release. Master has
     moved to start support for Spark 2.0
  3. Grow a diverse community: We should put some emphasis on growing the
     community and making it diverse (the rule is at least three independent
     contributors) We have 1 major independent contributor (mariusvniekerk)
     and at least 2 minor ones
     (https://github.com/apache/incubator-toree/graphs/contributors)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  TOREE-262 - Progress on removal of LGPL dependency - Awaiting MPL release
  of JeroMQ. Will update branches to remove caveats re: LGPL once the JeroMQ
  release is available.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Active communication in mailing list and gitter with early adopters
  2. Still working on transitioning users from Spark Kernel project into
     Toree. Making significant progress here.
  3. More external contributions being made. Community member
     2mariusvniekerk key in porting Toree to work on Spark 2.0. Sitting on
     PR 56. Working with committer to finish up some details and will merge
     when ready. This is a significant contribution.

Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication.
It can be used like email, chat, or a document.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Growing community
  2. Improving code base.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - We have ongoing community discussion about how to bring in new developers
    to ensure sustainability of the project.

  A votation session has been scheduled (Sept 28th) to decide if Wave's fork
  Swellrt is brought/merged into Wave. This would bring SwellRT active
  developers into Wave and it could facilitate use of Wave by new developers
  thanks to a new API, removing GWT legacy code.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Made some code improvements

  Upayavira:

    Once more Wave is on the brink of retirement. However, this time, an
    offer has been made of code from SwellRT, which is a fork of Wave itself,
    and a concall has been scheduled for interested parties to discuss
    whether it is a go-er. It is my (limited) understanding that many of the
    complexity issues in the Wave code that have prevented community
    development have been resolved in SwellRT. I will watch to see where this
    goes, if anywhere.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

Report from the Apache Jackrabbit committee [Michael Dürig]

## Description: 
   The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
   implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
   (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
   repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
   maintained. 
   Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
   hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
   Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
   foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding  
   content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
   implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
   is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
   We received the following question from the board in response to 
   our last report:
 
     "is Oak sufficiently different to warrant its own new project? 
     Remember, we discourage umbrella projects. If Oak is simply a 
     "product" then as gs states please say so and identify it."
   
   Oak is well within the scope of the Jackrabbit PMC. Technically it
   strives for fresh solutions to the initial requirements taking into
   account new challenges from the technology landscape. To that 
   respect it can be seen as an evolution of the initial content 
   repository. At some point we expect Oak to replace the previous 
   implementation. The exact process is yet to be defined. 
   The same pattern is also observed in the community: while most 
   activity is currently on Oak, it is largely the same set of people
   also taking care of the Jackrabbit content repository. There is 
   currently no clear sub-community with diverging activities or 
   interests that would warrant splitting the project. 
      
## Activity: 
   Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
   maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are 
   continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

   Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
   the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
   driven by dependencies from Oak. 

## Health report: 
   The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic
   on all mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective
   component / sub-project. 
   Commit activity is moderate to high as there is substantial new
   work being done in certain areas. 
   The oak-dev list is seeing a broad variety of topics being 
   discussed.

==Board Question==
"mt: An explanation for the long gap between releases would be helpful."

As mentioned in many previous board reports the Lucene.Net community has
struggled to consistently maintain strong community involvement. We had
several quarters of good progress followed by zero progress. As of this
moment, we are making great progress and our community appears to be much more
vibrate than in the past when we had on going progress.

Nuget package downloads:
* Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 357,422 (up from 308,623)
* Lucene.Net.Contrib 3.0.3: 95,087 (up from 83,361)
* Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial: 10,574 (up from 9,734)
* Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial.NTS: 1,999 (up from 1,841)

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

## Description: 
Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project
   
## Issues: 
there are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity:
 - created a new mailing list ("notifications") for Jira change notifications
   that were previously going to the dev list, making it less readable
 - created a new mailing list ("security") to discuss security related topics
   that were previously discussed in the "private" list: in this way it will
   be easier to keep any design discussion out of the private list
 - created a new HipChat room, open to everyone, for casual conversations, for
   collaboration, mentoring or just to generally hang out
- completed the switch of the build system of OFBiz from Ant to Gradle; a key
   driver of the change was to remove external jar files from the source
   repository; in upcoming releases Gradle will automatically resolve
   dependencies and download the required jars
 - several new features, improvements and bug fixes have been contributed and
   integrated into the official code base
 - the activity in the official blog and Twitter accounts is steady with a
   monthly blog post and frequent tweets
 - the community has voted for a new project logo (that reflects now that
   OFBiz is a registered trademark)
 - the OFBiz project has requested to use the new Snoot analytics tool;
   interestingly, a recent Snoot factoid [*] shows that OFBiz mimics the
   average focus of all the ASF projects in terms of bugs/issues, code
   commits, dev discussions and interactions with users
 - a series of presentation proposals for ApacheCon EU 2016 have been
   submitted; several OFBiz community members are planning to attend the
   upcoming ApacheCon in Seville and to meet each other

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description:

Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.

## Olingo Status

Currently Olingo has no issues that would require board attention.  The Olingo
PMC decided to postpone the planned V4 release to a later date. This was done
due to the large amount of effort it takes to implement the remaining OData V4
features. The 4.3.0 release is planned for this week instead of the end of
June.

In the V2 code line we provided a 2.0.7 patch release as planned. There are no
new features planned here.

Traffic on the mailing list and our JIRA has been constant compared to the
last report and the number of contributions stayed the same. They mostly
consist of small bug fixes for specific issues.

There has been a large contribution which has not yet been looked at. It
consists of a JPA OData producer. I expect this will be picked up and
discussed on the dev mailing list after the 4.3.0 release.

Questions from last report:

mh: Are any of the new contributors filing JIRAs prospective committers?

There are no constant contributions from one individual. Also most patches do
not include at least one test as we specified in our "contribute" tutorial on
the Olingo website. We will continue to monitor the situation and if some
contributors appear more than once we will certainly invite them if they are
interested.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Tom Barber]

DESCRIPTION

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

- Last release was 1.0 on Wed Jun 29 2016

We resolved 0 issues for this release.

We finally reached a point in the platform lifecycle which made sense to
release Apache OODT as 1.0. This was done both to signify the stability of
what we had but also allow us to prepare for major changes coming in the next
major release cycle to modernise the platform and extend what was already in
place. These changes will be API breaking and as such we wanted to signify
this in the release versioning.

COMMUNITY

Latest committers and PMC members
Radu Maonle(radumanole) on 11th Oct 2015 as committer and PMC member

Last committer and PMC member added on 6th October 2015.

Mailing list activity has been pretty much static in terms of period on
period volume and Jira has been quiet.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

HEALTH REPORT

The project activity is pretty quiet, but there are still on going efforts in
place to help drive wider adoption. This includes a new website, greater
connectivity with other data platforms and adding some much desired features
to the core platform. As mentioned above, now that we have released 1.0 we
will be turning our attention to the new features. Although development is
quiet, we have a fully functioning and responsive PMC and community.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Jörn Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference
resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced
text
processing services.

Development
------------------
The development team stayed active over the last two month
and the activity in commits decreased slightly due to our git
migration.

The OpenNLP GSOC 2016 project will be merged soon into opennlp-tools
and afterwards the process to draft the next release will be started.

Community
---------------
The community stayed active with the usual amount of traffic on the use
mailing list and contributed a couple of patches to fix bugs.

Rodrigo Agerri was added to the PMC on Jul 09 2015

Anastasija Mensikova was added as a committer on Jul 20 2016.

Releases
------------
The last release OpenNLP 1.6.0 was released on Jul 09 2015.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Dennis E. Hamilton]

     This is an abbreviated interim report to focus on concerns for
     which monthly updates have been requested by the Board.
     The next complete report will be for the October Board Meeting.
     
STATUS
======

Limitations of capacity and coordination of the project's moving parts
are ongoing concerns.

ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS
==========================

Concerns for Board Attentions are on the following topics:

     Development Capacity
     Handling of Security
     Trademarks
     Governance

Development Capacity
--------------------
  
     2016-08-30 4.1.2-patch1 hotfix released
     2016-08-02 4.1.2-patch1 source released
     2015-10-28 4.1.2 released
     2014-08-21 4.1.1 released
   
A drive to produce Maintenance Release 4.1.3 is now underway.  The release
will provide full binary distributions for all platforms.  It will not
introduce features that involve GUI changes, documentation requirements,
or significant new localization.  It is a constrained release to demonstrate
rapid production of maintenance releases.  

Upon release of 4.1.3, maintenance release 4.1.4 will follow, tentatively
targeted for release this year.

To expand development capacity and capability of the project, a recruit-
ment effort has been initiated, with notification on the Downloads page. 
New mailing list recruitment@openoffice.apache.org, established on 
2016-09-06, is for new volunteers to have a quieter on-ramp than the dev@
list.  

Since the beginning of August, there have been a dozen requests from new
contributors.  These are for QA, documentation, localization, and 
development.  The new developers do not know the AOO code base.  All require
some degree of mentoring.

In addition, there are five returning contributors, including one with
significant OpenOffice development, security, and release-deployment
experience.


Handling of Security
--------------------

The public distribution of Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2 on 2015-10-28 included 
mitigations for five vulnerabilities.  One of these had been disclosed on
2015-04-25 with a workaround but no update.  For the five 4.1.2 mitigations, 
the average number of days from report to update was 146.  The longest was 
247 days and the shortest was 86 days.

On 2016-07-21, there was disclosure and an OpenOffice advisory for 
CVE-2016-1513, a vulnerability reported on 2015-10-20, 275 days earlier.
A source patch and hotfix binary were made available subsequently.  As of
Wednesday, 2016-09-14, 330 days after the initial report, the mitigation
has not appeared in a full binary distribution.

The release of 4.1.3 with full binaries will include the mitigation of
CVE-2016-1513.  Release 4.1.3 and subsequent work toward a 4.1.4 maintenance
release begins a drive to have timely resolution of security defects become
a sustainable activity for the still-strained developer resources.  

Recent progress in handling security reports is owed to two developers
who have stepped into working on these reports in the last few weeks.  There
is also cooperation with the [OfficeSecurity] team around identifying and
treating vulnerabilities in common.  This should keep pace with the 
establishment of expedited maintenance releases.

Trademarks
----------

The previously-asked question of how trademarks should be handled in the event
of OpenOffice retirement or pivoting remains open.

Meanwhile, the PMC is able to respond to simple request for permissions to
use the marks on print and video materials.  There is no pro-active handling
of identified infringements in misleading product offerings and in web sites
and domain names.  

The PMC lacks the capacity and capability to be diligent against the 
onslaught of Apache OpenOffice marks abuse.  


Governance
----------

The current Chair is resigning after serving more than the promised one year.
Request for nominations for the next proposed Chair ended on September 14, 
with PMC Member Marcus Lange the only nominee.  The [VOTE] to recommend
Marcus to the Board is underway.

One highly-active, long-term PMC member has resigned.  The project is 
still being held together by around a half-dozen active individuals.  The
incorporation of new and returning enthusiasts will depend on how the current
help-wanted recruiting drive plays out.

On September 1, this Chair introduced the dev@ list topic,
"[DISCUSS] What Would OpenOffice Retirement Involve? (long)", expressing 
concerns about the limited capacity and capability being unsurmountable as 
a practical matter.

In the midst of the external attention, and the extensive discussion on that
thread, a returnee offered a new topic the next day,
"What would OpenOffice NON-retirement involve?"

The NON-retirement discussion has been energetic and ended up focusing on the
current help-wanted/recruitment effort and the drive to achieve rapid
building, release candidacy, and deployment of full releases with binaries.

At the same time, the [DISCUSS] on prospects of retirement and its 
orchestration is deemed illegitimate and denied, with only non-retirement
actions underway.  That is the extent of consideration for retirement and/or
pivoting the project.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description: 
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specification which is defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0) and CDI-1.1
 and CDI-1.2 (MR) specifications (JSR-346).
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 Activity is really fine. 
 We just did a release and are actively contributing to the upcoming
 CDI-2.0 specification.  
   
## Health report: 
 The project is a container library which is stable and actively
 used and maintained. Due to the fact that most users are using
 OWB as part of another project (e.g. TomEE) we get much feedback
 in ‚indirect‘ ways. 
 We are well staffed but are still actively looking for new 
 contributors.

## Mailing list activity: 

 Activity is up a bit. But please note that those ups/downs
 are totally fine as we fix issues and push new features in 'bulk'.  
 The last quarter was a rather active one.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Description: 
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
   usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
   robustness of the Java platform.
 
Issues: 
   There are no board-level issues at this time.
 
Activity: 
   Activity has been down this quarter (see stats below).  But we should
   be ready for a new release this coming quarter.
   
Health report: 
   The ongoing issue is lack of activity in the project.  While we still
   have enough PMC members to do a vote currently, and some users still
   using the product, new development is very slow and there doesn't
   seem to be much of a market for the product anymore.  Attempts to
   attract cross-pollinization with other Apache projects have not been
   very successful.

PMC changes: 
 - Currently 4 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
 - Last PMC addition was Niclas Hedhman on Wed Jan 13 2016.
   
Committer base changes: 
 - Currently 5 active (that is, not emeritus) committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months.
 - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago.
 
Releases: 
 - Last release was 2.0.4 on Mon May 19 2014 
   
Mailing list activity: 
   As evidenced by these figures, activity has been down this quarter.
   Actually in comparison to the quarter before that, it was even slower.
 
 - dev@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 62 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months)
    - 23 emails sent to list (31 in previous quarter, 55 the quarter before) 
   
 - user@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 175 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months)
    - 11 emails sent to list (22 in previous quarter, 28 the quarter before) 

JIRA activity: 
   But as evidenced by these figures, there is still some development
   going on, and bugs are getting addressed (albeit slowly).

 - 1 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 5 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months 
   
-----------------------------------------
Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Jeff Trawick]

## Short version of report:

  No releases, modest activity, effort to add to our roster, effort to
  select a new PMC chair underway

## Description:

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
  software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
  to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
  which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
  the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
  since 2007.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
 - Expect a proposed resolution soon for changing the PMC chair

## Activity:
 - Commit activity has been low.
 - Mailing list activity has been low.
 - Thirteen unique, non-accidental bugs were opened during the reporting
   period, and two had followup (closure or discussion).

## Health report:
 - This is a mature project, and most of its development activity is
   driven by the needs of the same small number of applications that have
   used it for many years.  The project members are more than able to
   meet the requirements that arise from that use.
 - The needs of the small number of other users are not met very well;
   bug reports languish and mailing list posters may not receive timely
   responses.  The amount of help provided is probably not sufficient
   to serve as encouragement to potential new users of APR.

## PMC/Committer changes:

 - Currently 66 committers and 39 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months, but we expect to send
   an invitation shortly after the board notification time has elapsed
 - Last PMC addition was Yann Ylavic on Wed May 13 2015
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months; an invitation was
   sent during the quarter but was declined
 - Last committer addition was Brian Havard on Wed May 04 2016

## Releases:

 - No releases in this quarter
 - APR 1.5.2, released April 29, 2015
 - APR-util 1.5.4, released September 22, 2014
 - APR-iconv 1.2.1, released November 26, 2007

## Mailing list activity:

 - dev@apr.apache.org:
    - 356 subscribers
    - 40 emails sent to list (31 in previous quarter)

 - commits@apr.apache.org:
    - 75 subscribers
    - 46 emails sent to list (38 in previous quarter)

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Portals Project  [David Sean Taylor]

Apache Portals exists to promote the use of open source portal technology. We
intend to build freely available and interoperable portal software in order to
promote the use of this technology. With the Pluto project, we provide a
reference implementation for the Java portlet standard. The Jetspeed project is
a full feature enterprise open source portal. The Portals Applications project
is dedicated to providing robust, full-featured, commercial-quality, and freely
available portlet applications.

## Activity:

Apache Portals released 0 releases since the last report.

Apache Portals Pluto team is actively implementing Pluto 3.0 to support to the
Portlet Spec 3.0
We are planning on announcing the Portlet Spec 3.0 at JavaOne
We are actively working on the TCK and Reference implementation and nearing
completion.

## Mailing list activity:

Not much activity. I would like to get the spec team to discuss more on the
Pluto dev list, but all discussions are, by habit, done on the Java community
specification mailing list

## Issues:

We have no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Issues

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

## Activity

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

During the las period we have provided the users with new maintenance releases
(5.5.4, 6.0.4) and new updates 5.6.1 and 6.1.2 from the development branches.
We have also released 3 new OSGi bundle sets.

We have also released the next preview release of ServiceMix 7 (7.0.0.M2). Due
to the lower activity during the last period the final release has been
delayed and we plan to finalize it in this period. We are currently working on
upgrades of the dependencies and fixing issues reported by users for the
release 7.0.0.M2.

In the next period we plan to focus on ServiceMix 6 and ServiceMix 7, but we
also expect to provide the maintenance releases for ServiceMix, as long new
dependencies will be available.


## Health report

Due to summer vacation the activity of the community (mailing lists, JIRA,
releases) has been a bit slower than during the last period.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to board for September 2016

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

The status of the project is basically unchanged from the last report, where
it was described as healthy for a mature project that is not in rapid
development. That said, there are some areas of concern that are raised in the
issues section below.

Issues raised in last report:

The problems with access to the “mass-check” infrastructure have been
resolved. There are now multiple people with root access to the machines that
are still being used, and others have been identified as having been
decommissioned. The issue with “zones2 deprecation” turned out to be already
resolved once we understood what the mention of it referred to and the details
of the VM resource that infra has made available to us.

Issues:

Support for the mass-check facility is still a concern. That is a facility
that we provide for people to upload statistics processed from their curated
spam and ham streams. When we receive sufficient volume we are able to use it
to update SpamAssassin’s rule system to tune it to the ever-changing tactics
of spammers. The previous Chair was a SPOF of processing requests for access
to upload to the mass-check system. With his sudden and unexpected absence
that was not immediately filled, there is a backlog in processing those
requests. The mass-check system is operational, but would function better with
a higher volume of quality input. What is most immediately needed is
documentation of the procedures and ensuring that multiple members of the PMC
are responsible for the necessary tasks.

There was an issue with a disruptive member of the SpamAssassin users mailing
list that resulted in the member being banned from the list. This is a
difficult problem that did not result in a consensus among the members of the
PMC. Some of the factors that are involved are: 1) One person was clearly at
the root of the problem, but several other people ended up violating the ASF
Code of Conduct after getting into flame wars with him. That makes it more
difficult to justify banning just one person even if that would be enough to
calm everything down. 2) The facilities provided by the ezmlm mailing list
software are not up to the task of handling moderation in these circumstances.
The only choices are to allow someone full access to the mailing list or to
ban their email address from both sending and receiving. It would have been a
lot easier to achieve a compromise with this person if he could have been put
into moderation where his posts could be manually allowed through, only
blocking his periodic slips. 3) The user’s email address was banned. He soon
returned with a different email address. It was obvious that it was the same
person, he made basically no attempt to hide it, and a number of people posted
to the mailing list to point out that he was the same person who had just been
banned. However, he has so far not repeated the behavior that got him banned.
It does not seem right to at this point escalate to an arms race just to try
to show that we are in charge and that our bans must not be circumvented.

Infra:

It was pointed out to us that the spamassassin.org domain is hosted on non-ASF
name servers, and that perhaps it should be moved. We opened a ticket with
infra and got a response, but let the ticket lapse. Our current hosting is
stable and redundant. Now that we have learned from infra what will be
involved we can pursue it some time in the future when some member of the PMC
has sufficient time and interest.

Releases:

Last quarter’s report stated the intention to produce a 3.4.2 release. We have
not yet formally started a release cycle (naming a release manager, a
schedule, etc.) but have made some progress on identifying and closing bugs on
the 3.4.2 branch. It may be possible to get the release out this year.

Committer/PMC changes:

Joe Quinn (jquinn) joined the PMC three months ago.
Bill Cole (billcole) was added as committer two and a half months ago.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description: 
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

   
## Activity: 
 - Release cadence has increased for maintenance/bugfix releases in the
   1.0.x, 0.10.x, and 0.9.x version lines.
 - Progress continues toward making a 1.1.0 release.
 - The developer community is discussing dropping support for 0.9.x versions.
 - Activity on migrating from Clojure to Java (what we are tentatively 
   calling version 2.0) has picked up.
 - There are two active VOTEs underway for accepting code donations: SQE 
   (Streaming Query Engine) from JW Player, and JMS integration from P. 
   Taylor Goetz.
 - We have changed our GitHub integration options so pull request activity
   is published to the JIRA work log to reduce the number of duplicate
   messages sent to the dev@ mailing list. We also now direct JIRA activity
   to issues@ so the community has finer-grained control over the messages
   they wish to receive.
   
## Health report: 
 - There has been a slight decrease in the number of PMC members voting on 
   release candidates and a corresponding increase in the amount of time it
   takes to close a release VOTE. This is possibly a side effect of the 
   increased number of releases being made. The PMC will monitor the 
   situation and push to add more PMC members if necessary.
 - We continue to see new developers show up and contribute. During the 
   discussion around accpeting the JW Player code donation it was clear a
   number of SQE developers are eager to participate in the Storm community.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 31 PMC members. 
 - Satish Duggana was added to the PMC on Tue Aug 02 2016 
   
## Committer base changes:

 - 1.0.2 was released on Tue Aug 09 2016 
 - 0.10.2 was released on Mon Sep 12 2016 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - Activity on the user@ mailing list has died down after a spike attributed
   to the 1.0 and subsequent maintenance releases.
 - Activity on the dev@ list is expected to drop sharply in reponse to
   moving GitHub notifications to the JIRA work log, and moving JIRA
   notifications to issues@.
   
 - dev@storm.apache.org:  
    - 542 subscribers (up 9 in the last 3 months):

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Mick Semb Wever]

## Description:
 Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for Java
applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify
the development of user interfaces.

## Activity:
 Apache Tiles remains an stable but low traffic project. This quarter two
releases were cut with three PMC involved. Otherwise there is two responsible
and responsive PMC ready to help users and discuss development ideas.

 Both user and dev mailing lists saw increased traffic over the
previous quarter, although most of this is attributed to the releases.
The majority of activity still happens on non-apache sites like the
StackExchange forums. StackExchange sees a few questions and answers each
day or two.

## Health report:
 There are currently two responsive PMC, other PMC help out with votes
when needed.  Everyone is aware of the how little momentum the project has,
but it does not feel abandoned by members, nor not in use by the public.
Further effort is still required to increase health to the project.

## Issues
 The board agreed last report the importance of making a release to test
whether the project has three involved PMC. That has been done and proven.

## Releases:
 Two releases were made this quarter. Apache Tiles AutoTag-1.2 and
Apache Tiles-3.0.7

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

The project as decided to release Apache TomEE 7 as final despite
issues around lack of TCK access.  After a series of votes the Apache
TomEE 7.0.0 was released at the end of May.  Community feedback has
been on the whole positive, though some still stay on 1.7.x hoping for
some possibility for a certified TomEE 7.  There have now been 5
releases in the 7.x stream, the project having released three
milestones previously and a patch release 7.0.1 on June 27th one month
following the release.

Work on a new website has been ongoing passively in the background.
This is aimed to replace the perl/svn/markdown system Joe Schaefer
wrote and will likely get some attention now that 7.x is out.  A new
security vulnerability was filed in May following our release of the
fix for ZDI-15-638.  A supporting video was supplied demonstrating the
issue, but did however also show the reporter changed their
configuration to explicitly allow the attack — disabling the
out-of-box restrictions that prevent ZDI-15-638 from working.  The
project sees no action is needed and has notified security@.

The project still has room for improvement on attracting new
committers.  Interest people do show up, however general theme is lack
of time to properly mentor contributors in what is usually their first
open source project.

Last release was 7.0.1 on 2016-06-27.  7.0.0 was released on
2016-05-29.  Last committer was added November 2015.  Last PMC
addition, 4 new members on 2015-08-11.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description: 
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - Work has continued to complete the VCL 2.5 release. A member of the
   community submitted a patch to add Active Directory support [1] in April
   2015. We decided to include this in the release because it will be a
   useful feature to many. Including this feature also may help encourage
   contributions like this as we work to strengthen the community. Much of
   the recent development has been to incorporate this into trunk.
 - Some members of the community have been discussing the possibility of
   adding Apache Guacamole support. [2]
 - Another member may be contributing some advanced networking features. [3]
   
## Health report: 
 - Activity is up since our last report. This is a positive sign. Much of
   the activity has been related to preparing the release, but there has
   also been activity from new community members and some from people not
   directly working on the release. I think the health has been slowly
   improving.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Report from the Apache Wicket project [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented server-side web
application framework.

A relative quiet quarter: a security issue in commons-fileupload permeated
through Wicket 1.5-7.x (older releases are no longer supported). Releases were
created. Our first developer preview of Wicket 8 was released (M1), containing
Java 8 goodness for Wicket application developers.

## Noteworthy items:

- Currently 30/29 Committers/PMC members. 
- Last committer/PMC addition was François Meillet on Mon Jun 29 2015
- Work on Wicket 8 is in progress, we released a milestone release (8.0-M1)
- Security issues were found, resolved and new releases made: CVE-2016-3092 
  & CVE-2013-2186
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Releases this quarter

We have issued the following releases: 8.0.0-M1, 7.4.0, 6.24.0 and 1.5.16.

## New committers/PMC members

We haven't seen many new contributors to the project, we will keep an eye out
for new folks to join, but we don't expect a huge influx given the state of
server-side Java web frameworks in general. On a side note, we have welcomed
back a contributor who became active again.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Sean Busbey]

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and
release processes for software projects.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD'S ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

None since last report. Last release was version 0.3.0 on May 22nd 2016.

Volunteer bandwidth for release managing is expected in mid-to-late September.

ACTIVITY

No new PMC addition in the last three months.

Last PMC addition was Kengo Seki on February 28th 2016.

No new committer additions in the last three months.

Last committer addition was Marco Zühlke on May 23rd 2016.

In the last three months the project has had an increase in
contributions from new folks and a slight down turn in code from
established committers as a part of normal cyclical volunteer
attention. We remain reliant on a small pool of our volunteers for the
majority of contribution reviews, but the PMC continues to look for
potential new committers.

Members of the HBase, Hadoop, and Kudu communities worked towards
transitioning build tooling they each maintained to track API
compatibility changes in Java projects to a common component in Yetus.
After expending a fair bit of effort, the work had to be abandoned in
favor of per-project tooling due to licensing restrictions on its
dependencies; contributors did not know of a non-GPL alternative to
the base tools for comparing API changes.

Mailing list traffic remains low, with an uptick in September. The
community remains responsive to discussion requests and filed issues,
so we're not concerned.

STATS

- Currently 7 PMC members
- Currently 8 committers
- dev list has 41 subscribers (up 5 in the last 3 months)
- 38 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 38 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Zest Project  [Niclas Hedhman]

Apache Zest is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented
Programming for domain-centric application development.
     
Activity:

  Summer is always a bit slow in our community, and this year was no
  exception.  But both the beginning and end of this quarter has seen
  substantial (by our measure) activity; discussions, Jiras and commits are
  all up from previous quarter.

  The big chunk of work that constitutes our next release (incompatible by
  choice) has taken longer than desirable, but we hope to get that one out by
  end of the year.

  In June, a pre-Apache contributor resurfaced, provided a couple of patches

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Junqueira]

## Description: 

 - Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It enables
distributed systems to implement a variety of primitives and mechanisms that
are critical for such systems to function, e.g., distributed locks, master
election, group membership, and configuration.
   
## Issues: 

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 

 - For the last period, there are two points to highlight:
   * We have had two releases, one for the 3.4 branch and another for
     the 3.5. Releases of the 3.5 branch are still alpha, and the community
     has been working hard to resolve the issues pending to make it stable
     (GA).
   * Traffic on the dev list and number of commits has increases significantly
     compared to the last period. Traffic on the dev list has increased by
     roughly 70% while the traffic on the commit list has increased by over
     5x.  Interestingly, the number of subscribers to the dev list has dropped
     by 10 subscribers, which we attribute to natural churn.  
## Health report: 

 - The activity of the mailing list had dropped in the previous reporting
   periods, but it has picked up again from the current numbers. We did some
   effort to bring in new contributors by mentoring interested developers
   (e.g., developers who showed interest on the mailing list, developers we’ve
   met offline, meetups) and reached out to former contributors to help with
   closure on outstanding issues.
 - We have some potential committers coming, and we are considering offering
   committership to such contributors after the next upcoming release: 3.5.3.
   Their contributions have been strong so far. 
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 11 PMC members. 
 - Chris Nauroth was added to the PMC on Sun Aug 07 2016 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 19 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Chris Nauroth at Wed Sep 09 2015 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - 3.4.9 was released on Sat Sep 03 2016 
 - 3.5.2 was released on Thu Jul 21 2016 
   
## Mailing list activity:  
   
 - dev@zookeeper.apache.org:  
    - 499 subscribers (down -10 in the last 3 months): 
    - 3285 emails sent to list (1917 in previous quarter) 
   
 - user@zookeeper.apache.org:  
    - 1178 subscribers (up 7 in the last 3 months): 
    - 282 emails sent to list (267 in previous quarter) 
   
 - The dev list traffic increased quite substantially from the previous period
   due to our efforts to increase the development activity. Interestingly, the
   number of subscribers dropped slightly, which we attribute to natural churn
   (e.g., people move on to a different project). The traffic of the user list
   has increased slightly, but not as much compared to the increase of the dev
   list. We have been getting the same rate of questions compared to the last
   period.

## JIRA activity: 
   
 - 129 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 50 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months
