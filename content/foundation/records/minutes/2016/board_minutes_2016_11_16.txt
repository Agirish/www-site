 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Having been on holidays most of the month, I have nothing to report
       other than being a long way behind on email.

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall
       =======

       We don't have an approved budget; we haven't been routinely reviewing
       budget vs actuals, expenses (and possibly income) is running ahead of
       plan, and we have at least two areas where an increase in budget may be
       warranted.

       I've been working with the Treasurer and Virtual to improve reporting
       on actuals.  I seek guidance from the board on the overall shape of
       what the FY 2017 budget should look like; I will then work with owners
       of individual line items to produce an updated draft budget for the
       board to approve.

       I've met (via phone, Skype, and Google Talk) with each of the people
       who own monthly reports (though not individually with Rich who
       understandably is busy at this moment); based on these discussions my
       initial priorities are: budget, brand, fundraising, then EA/TAC.

       I have a request for the board: my preference is that the primary
       vehicle for board feedback on operations be via the monthly
       teleconferences and review of progress on action items.  When things
       come up at other times, I'd prefer that such items be added to the
       agenda for the next board meeting unless there is a specific reason why
       it needs to be resolved urgently before that time.

       For personal reasons, I am not able to travel to Seville this month.  I
       thank Ross for preparing draft slides and Jim for giving the
       presentation in my absence.

       I'm maintaining a file for tracking purposes:

       https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/President/STATUS

       Executive Assistant
       ===================

       This role was originally envisioned to be responsible for a number of
       different foundation tasks; at the present time TAC is taking up a
       large portion of time.  I'm not interceding at the current time, but I
       do plan to revisit what the ideal allocation of time to each task
       should be with Melissa in the quiet time between conferences.

       Brand Management
       ================

       This area is considerably running over both the draft budget and last
       years actuals.  I urgently seek guidance from the board as to whether
       the budget should be revised or brand management should change how it
       is currently operating.  Please see the brand management report for
       additional information on where money has been sent and on the outlook.

       Less urgently, but something I would like feedback on in the upcoming
       months: what is the role the board would like to see brand management
       perform for the foundation?  We clearly have comprehensive brand
       management procedures.  While we have some PMCs that are following
       these procedures, we have other PMCs that are behaving as if they are
       unaware of those procedures.  We even have PMCs that are clearly aware
       of the procedures, have provided no actionable feedback on those
       procedures, but aren't closely following them.

       A concrete example: this month you proposed that PMCs SHALL restrict
       their discussions of trademark enforcement actions to private mailing
       lists.

       Is this destined to be another requirement that many PMCs will continue
       to be unaware of and others will chose not to follow?  If so, does it
       make sense to continue to produce such requirements?

       A second concrete example: Brand Management and PMCs are grappling with
       what would be a reasonable division of labor with respect to trademark
       enforcement.  This thread with Hadoop is illustrative:
       https://s.apache.org/yEY6

       Accordingly, Shane an Mark have begun exploring how to better track
       resolutions of potential infringements; being better organized should
       enable us to move from anecdotal discussions which may ultimately
       reduced down to internal miscommunication issues to actual data on what
       steps were or were not taken and how long it takes to resolve an issue.

       Perhaps the big picture that will emerge is that the Brand Management
       team will periodically do a scan for egregious violations and hand them
       off (via JIRA) to the PMCs to resolve by making use of the software
       wizard/assistants that we produce for this purpose, augmented by Brand
       Management as a resource to provide advice and as an interface to
       resources like DLAPiper.

       Fundraising
       ===========

       While income isn't received on any sort of predictable schedule, we
       seem to be running well above last years income received by this time,
       and I believe that we have enough months data for that to be
       representative.

       As we expect expenditures to continue to grow over the upcoming years,
       it is prudent to plan for changes that could be made that wouldn't
       compromise who we are as a foundation.  As an example, increased
       recognition may be possible, but anything that involves control or
       setting of direction is off the table.

       This likely will result in Fundraising having a line item in the
       budget, whether it be for ASF travel to current or potential sponsors
       (or alternatively to conferences where such are present) or for staff.
       A concrete example of the latter has been posted to operations@:
       https://s.apache.org/7Sgf

       There also is an expectation that charitable foundations that receive
       donations acknowledge receipt for tax purposes.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Sally and her team handle an amazing amount of absurdity on a
       continuing basis.  This team is also vital to both Brand Management and
       Fundraising.  Despite this, flow of information regarding sponsor
       changes, incubator activities, branding challenges, and executive
       officer changes is haphazard.  An example of something that should be
       automatic and routine: https://s.apache.org/OH3o.  This needs to be
       fixed.

       One item of expense that has come up that is not covered by the current
       budget: Snoot development costs from Quenda in producing graphics
       included in our annual report.  I intend to include that expense in
       upcoming draft budget and the board can decide whether or not that is
       something that the ASF should cover.  Meanwhile, Sally has approved one
       month as a part of the M&P budget.

       It is coming up on the time to start preparation for the next annual
       report.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       David indicated that he would like to continue, and in response I
       indicated that I have no plans to replace him.  As I am aware that he
       is not fully in control of his availability, and in particular may be
       unavailable for days without prior notice, I've asked Greg to draft a
       resolution converting his position to an officer's position so that we
       have continuous coverage.  I trust that Greg and David can work
       together and adjust dynamically to changes in availability without my
       involvement.  This is also not intended as a net increase in demand on
       Greg's time.

       The good news is that the hiring to backfill contractors that were
       hired away is complete.  The bad news is that Infrastructure is another
       area that is likely to go over budget for FY 2017.  It is my
       recommendation that it be allowed to do so.

       I've asked the infrastructure team to include two items in their
       monthly reports: progress on "GitHub as master" until that item reaches
       conclusion one way or another, and items that will lead to a reduction
       in the average cost per project over time.  The latter is intended to
       be an ongoing effort, and likely will start with a focus on
       measurement, proceed to the development of plans, and ultimately a
       report on progress.  This replaces and subsumes a prior direction to
       focus on "self service", which may turn out to be one of several
       approaches used to reduce costs.

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ===========================

       At this time, I am changing Melissa's role from acting TAC chair to
       being the TAC chair.

       Melissa is transitioning to her new role.  At the moment, she is mostly
       following in the footsteps of her predecessor; the hope is that for
       Miami she adjusts things to suit what works best for her.  As an
       example, it might be better to move from a UK based travel agent to
       either a US based travel agent or directly booking flights.

       The application TAC uses for applications is undocumented and
       unmaintained; this needs to be corrected.

       Conference Committee
       ====================

       I've only touched bases briefly with Rich on this item; he is
       understandably focused on Seville at the moment.  I plan to delve more
       deeply into this in the time between conferences.

       Rich is developing a playbook for ApacheCon:
       https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/ApacheCon/playbook.md

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


       DLA Piper is no longer supplying legal resources pro bono,
       which came as a surprise to some directors. We use them for
       occasional legal advice and managing our trademark registrations
       and docket. They charge a discounted hourly rate capped at
       $5K per month exclusive of trademark registration fees. Other
       firms would probably charge more. The board is comfortable
       with continuing to pay DLA Piper for their services at the
       current rate.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       As requested going forward I will include not only data for the current month
       but also an overview actuals vs budget both for the current month as well as
       year-to-date. Since we still don't have a budget for FY2017 the FY17 "budget"
       is based on the 2016 actuals.

       In October we have been operating with a small net income vs a projected loss.
       YTD we have been operating with a significant smaller loss then projected so we
       still are in a very comfortable financial situation.

       There is an ongoing effort to get a spending policy for credit card holders in
       place which has been delayed due to my dayjob duties.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The new Whimsy Secretary Mail tool is working well even in light of
       the record number of documents received in a single month.

       In October, 137 iclas, 10 cclas, and one grant were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Truth is I've been enjoying the total freedom from day to day
       activities. I've assisted a little in the transition to Sam as the new
       President, but for the most part Sam has simply moved forwards.

       As agreed with Sam I will pick up the areas that are "just working"
       and provide oversight there so that Sam can focus on the areas that
       need attention. Given Sam's indication that he feels the areas needing
       focus are Brand and Fundraising this means I will be "on call" for
       Marketing and Publicity, Infrastructure, Conferences and TAC. Each of
       these areas has paid support and thus the overhead here is expected to
       be manageable.

       I will monitor those lists and be available to our officers in those
       roles should the need arise.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Interim VP, TAC Report:

‚Ä¢	Busy month working on the final details and distributing that information to
the TACers
‚Ä¢	Working on a solution for an online schedule so the TACers can pick the
sessions they wish to attend/chair. Having it online is more efficient than
working off of paper copies, and by doing so, everyone at any given time knows
who is the session host of what session. This is important in the event of
schedule clashes/missing session host/etc. so that we can get a new host
assigned immediately.
‚Ä¢	Setup a HipChat channel for onsite communication
‚Ä¢	In addition to the TAC session host responsibilities, the recipients will
also be responsible for setting up the digital audio recordings in each room
every morning and retrieving them at the end of the day
‚Ä¢	Preliminary numbers show we are under budget


EA Report:

Most of the month was spent on TAC

ApacheCon:

‚Ä¢	Recently discovered that the booth is only up for two days ‚Äì Tuesday and
Wednesday
‚Ä¢	Travel, hotel, and registration completed for the new Infra hires


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUE FOR THE BOARD: Budget overrun.

* OTHER OPERATIONS: Very busy; more issues arise than we have volunteers able
  to provide useful answers.

* BUDGET

Brand is currently overspending compared to the last board-approved annual
budget, both in the short term, and for the foreseeable future given known and
likely requests from projects and podlings.

There are two factors that have almost completely hidden the true cost of
brand from us before quite recently, meaning that most expectations in the
past of what we get vs. what we pay were unrealistic:

1- Originally, counsel provided essentially all services pro bono, only
passing on actual registration application fees.  In mid-2015, counsel move us
to a new retainer which charges for services at a discount rate, and generally
ensures a flat cap of $5K per month for legal services to limit our budget
exposure.  Note that this also seems to limit the rate at which some work is
accomplished as well.

2- Due to a billing error, 5 months of past bills were never sent until just
this month.  Thus we have an additional $18k due this month for services
rendered in the past; however once this is covered future bills should be much
more even.

To provide services that projects and podlings are asking for, an estimated
monthly run rate is $6K/month.  This accounts for $5K of services from primary
counsel monthly, plus the occasional registration application fees; plus the
rare fees from outside counsel where primary counsel aren't able to directly
represent us.

* OPERATIONS

Along with the extra discussions spilling over about two major projects the
board has shown concern over in the recent past, a wide variety of questions
continues to come into trademarks@ from both our projects and outside parties.
Providing timely, polite, and correct answers or guidance to all requests is
no longer something sustainable with volunteers.

While some of these questions are mostly answered by existing documentation,
it's clear that the documentation isn't widely known.  Separately, many of
these questions are not covered by documentation, and we don't always have
volunteers who can provide consistent, clear, and appropriate answers.  Unlike
with code checkins, providing an incorrect answer sometimes results in bad
results that *cannot* easily be corrected.

To ensure at least our "how to deal with an infringement" documentation is
usable, we are working on an experiment with the Hadoop PMC to have them use
the docs (and ask questions/suggest improvements) to start contacting some of
the existing misuses of their brand.

* CONFERENCES

I will be presenting at ApacheCon Seville on three topics:

- Improving your Apache Project's Image and Brand
- Practical Trademark Law For FOSS Projects
- Successfully Profiting From Apache Projects And Brands

All slides will be posted on our resources page after the conference:

https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/resources

* LICENSES / REGISTRATIONS

Still finalizing conference branding contract, will be signed as soon as it
reflects our current v1.3 Event branding policy.

Registration applications are in process per request from Hadoop, Hive,
Bigtop, and Tez PMCs in the US and Tomcat PMC for international jurisdictions.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities are getting back to normal. No issues require the board
attention.

We continued to get new sponsors at bronze and silver level. On the bronze
sponsor topic, I started contacting all current bronze sponsors and inform
them of the change in policy. I expect the whole process being completed
before the end of November and all links restored to 'nofollow'.

As Sam mentioned in his report, with the growth of the Fundation as a whole,
there is more work in all operational areas, including Fundraising. While it
is way below the levels required by, say, Trademarks, it's still significant
and I anticipate the need for some budget to be set aside for Fundraising as
well.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget. No payments are due at this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues work with
Fundraising, Brand Management, and peripherally with the Apache
Incubator. She has been working with incoming ASF President Sam Ruby
on various Operations-related issues, and has created a detailed call
for a new logo for the Apache Incubator (awaiting the PMC to announce
as of 7 October). At the request of Rich Bowen, she is also exploring
channels/options for internal communications.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement wa issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe: 

- 12 October 2016 --The Apache OpenOffice Project Announces Apache¬Æ
OpenOffice‚Ñ¢ v4.1.3


IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 6 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 121 weekly summaries published to date. 62 items were Tweeted on
@TheASF. No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel.
Sally continues to tweet for the Apache Incubator account.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for
more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 11 media queries, plus two
dedicated requests for high-res graphics of 23 Apache projects in
total for industry-specific reports. The ASF received 1,172 press
clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,997. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 4,553 press hits vs. last month's 4,882. Our clipping
service contract has been confirmed through December 2017.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 1 analyst query. Apache was
mentioned in 39 reports by Gartner (6 Magic Quadrants), 13 reports by
Forrester, 22 reports by 451 Research, and 11 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is leading media/analyst training at
ApacheCon, with Fintan Ryan of RedMonk conducting the analyst
briefings. She is also coordinating 5 interviews and was tasked with
managing on-site Apache Big Data + ApacheCon press activities by the
conference producer's PR team team 2 business days before the event.
As this activity is the responsibilty of the conference producer and
not the ASF, Sally has addressed this with Rich Bowen.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: No formal
conference-related activities planned at this time, however, Sally is
working with Melissa Warnkin and Sharan Foga on an overall inventory
of ASF promotional products that can be used across various events.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 30 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Additions to Infrastructure
===========================
Sebastian Bazley (sebb, apmail karma)
Freddy Barboza (fbarboza)
Chris Thistlethwaite (christ)
Christofer Dutz (cdutz)

In addition to the above karma grant; our two new staff members are ramping up. 
(Freddy Barboza and Chris Thistlethwaite) Expect forthcoming blog posts from 
our three recent hires on the infra blog. 



Operations Action Items
=======================

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Ensuring we have gathered enough information to begin the Gitbox
  experiments.
- Making sure the new wiki instance is running smoothly
- Introducing new staffers to the infrastructure
- Networking/F2F meetings at ApacheCon Europe
- Further work on rebranding our new web site

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Stand up a service for mirroring repositories and events from GitHub
- Mailing list system switchover is expected to happen in the coming
  months. We are aware of a few outstanding mail-search requests that we
  have concluded could be solved out-of-the-box by this.
- VMs on Eirene, Nyx and Erebus to be moved in readiness for their
  decommissioning
- Deprecate eos (currently only running mail-archives, wiki was moved)
- Work on weaving podlings into LDAP
- Further explore identity management proposals


General Activity
================
- moin wiki (wiki.apache.org) was moved to a new, faster box and
  inactive accounts were pruned to greatly increase responsiveness.
- More package consolidation and updates on the Jenkins platform
- Fixed issues with the buildbot configuration scanner not working
  as intended.
- Stood up buildbot and jenkins setup for publishing web sites via git.
- Moved more VMs from vCenter to new cloud locations.
- gitbox (stage two of our github experiment) has been stood up as an
  actual machine, with some services working already. We expect to be
  able to start mirroring and gathering push logs in the coming month.
- In conjunction with gitbox, reworked the overall design of our
  writeable git repository web interface (and received positive
  feedback).
- Reworked policy for new git repositories so that new repositories are
  automatically mirrored and have github integrations enabled by
  default.
- Worked on a new web site for infrastructure. Some components can be
  used for projects wishing to switch to a git-based automated workflow.
- Added and fixed a bunch of jenkins build nodes.
- Debugged and (hopefully??) fixed some issues with our pubsub systems
- Consolidation, general sanity checks and harmonization of Jenkins
  builds.


Ticket Response and Resolution Targets
======================================
  Stats for the current reporting cycle can be found at
  https://status.apache.org/sla/jira/?cycle=2016-11
  The tentative goal of having 90% of all tickets fully resolved in time
  is still being used. We are hoping that the onboarding of new staff
  will help greatly improve these stats.


Uptime Statistics
=================
  Uptime this month was mostly affected by the moin wiki, which we have
  now moved. We expect next month to have a much better uptime than this
  month (99.79%)
  
  For detailed statistics, see http://status.apache.org/sla/


Github as Master
================
Sam asked us to report on this process. To date, we've finished our
discussion with Legal Affairs to ascertain the framework that things
have to operate in.

Additionally, we've started discussions on private@ about the ASF-side
of that work. You can see the documentation from that discussion:
  https://pad.apache.org/p/gitbox

We have an instance running in AWS (the "gitbox") to run the above.

Finally, we've identified an initial project to subject to the
experiment.


'Costs per project' Project
===========================
Sam has asked to focus on looking at ways to reduce the straight 
linear expansion of costs for each additional project that we add. 
To date, this remains a bit of a thought experiment on both how to 
measure the costs in a more granular way than we do now. Currently 
the data that we have shows a correlation between increase in 
requests for service, bandwidth, etc. This correlation has led to 
our existing planning/staffing models, but there remains much to be
done on this front. 

The goals for next month is to figure out our what specific points 
we need to be measuring, and ideally looking backwards to validate
what the actual rate per project is in terms of consumption. 

The goal for Q1 is to break that down, and figure out what the 
constraints of the current onboarding and ongoing operations are.

Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Summary: ApacheCon Seville has a modest turnout, and I've started to turn my
attention to making Miami a much more successful event. In particular,
we (I) need to do a better job of communicating to our internal
audience what's coming, and how to get involved.

As we speak, ApacheCon is in process. Several of us are attending the call
together here in Seville. We have 550 attendees at the two events, of
which 136 registered as committers. This tells me that we are not
doing an adequate job of communicating about the event with our
project communities -- something I intend to rectify for ApacheCon
North America in May.

Sponsorship this year has been disappointing, and here, too, I have
heard frequently this week from people who said that they would have
sponsored if they had known about it earlier. It appears that our
internal communication needs a great deal of improvement in the coming
six months.

ApacheCon North America (And Apache: Big Data) will be held in Miami, May
16-18th, 2017, at the InterContinental Miami. The websites for these events
are now up, at
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america and
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-north-america
respectively.

I am working on the Apache Events page, at http://apache.org/events , in an
attempt to make it more engaging to the community, and encourage communities
to more effectively publicize their events, from the meetup scale all the way
up to major conferences.

I've refreshed http://apachecon.com/ to make it much clearer what the
most important things are, and move distractions to sub-pages.

I am working on an ApacheCon playbook -
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/ApacheCon/playbook.md
to ensure that tasks don't get dropped in future events, as well as to
make it easier for people to know where they can be of help, without
getting in the way of the event producer. It is also hoped that this
will assist other events that our project communities put on. This
playbook will be forked, so to speak, for each event, to act as a
checklist to ensure that everything gets done.

We had a meeting with Linux Foundation, the conference produder, on
Tuesday morning at ApacheCon in Seville. Present were Sally Khudairi,
Sharan Foga, Jillian Hall (LF), Angela Brown (LF), Shane Curcuru,
David Nalley, Nick Burch, and myself - Rich Bowen. Many issues were
discussed, primarily focused on the events in 2017.

ApacheCon and Apache: Big Data will be held overlapping in Miami -
that is, both events will run Tuesday through Thursday, May 14-16.
This saves money on space, and also increases the event population on
any given day, which makes sponsors happier, as well as giving
attendees a greater chance of interacting with other members of the
community. Attendees who register for one event receive a
complimentary pass to the other event. This is done primarily for
tracking purposes - to see which event people are primarily interested
in.

Monday will be available for projects to have developer summits.
Information about this will go out to various Foundation-wide mailing
lists in the next 2 weeks, once we know how many of these events we
have space for.

The focus/theme of the event will be innovation. Projects in the
incubator, or recently graduated, will be particularly encouraged to
bring their content to the event. More established projects will, of
course, also be welcomed, but are encouraged to consider the project
summit route as a possible alternative.

Tighter communication will be established between LF and ASF for the
coming six months, so that fewer things are dropped on the marketing
side of things. On my side, I'll be attempting to include a broader
team into the process. While I will remain the primary point of
contact, I will be more proactively delegating tasks out to a wider
group. I encourage people who are passionate about ApacheCon to
contact me to offer their time to this endeavor.

Ideas were pitched including using Foundation funds to help committers
or PMC members to attend who might not otherwise be able to do so.
These ideas are still very nascent, and will be fleshed out more on
the comdev mailing list before being brought as a proposal to the
board.

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

During the last month, 2 items of note were discussed and resolved.
First was the categorization of the JSON "Don't Be Evil" license
and the other was related to the NetBeans Incubation Proposal.
Regarding the former, it was decided that the JSON license,
not, by definition, being an "open source license" (since it is
not approved by OSI) is, in fact, CatX. Regarding the latter,
the difference between hard and soft depedencies were further
clarified.

No issues requiring board attention.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

The team is still trying to followup on issues reported via security@
to projects that do not seem to have been dealt with.  While in many
cases this leads to action (or formally closing an issue), there are
still some without action which we will raise to the board in due
course.  We're hoping to find better automated methods of tracking and
reporting on these.

Stats for October 2016:

2 CVEs issued to projects (some may not be public yet).

e-mails to security@

15    Phishing/spam/proxy/attacks point to site "powered by Apache" or
      Confused user due to "Apache" mentioned in OSS licenses
1     Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
2     Support question

1     Direct Vulnerability report to security@apache.org

1     [site]

7     Vulnerabilities reported to projects

Attachment B: Report from the Apache Ambari Project  [Yusaku Sako]

## Description:
 - Apache Ambari simplifies provisioning, managing, and monitoring of Apache
   Hadoop clusters.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Since the last board report in August 2016, the community pushed two
   releases: 2.4.0 and 2.4.1.
   2.4.0 was a significant release involving resolution of more than 2200
   JIRAs from 90+ contributors.  2.4.1 was a stability release with a few
   dozen critical fixes.

   Jayush Luniya (PMC member/committer) gave a talk titled
   "Streamline Hadoop DevOps with Apache Ambari" at Hadoop Summit Tokyo on
   Oct 27, 2016.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Mat√®rne]

## Description: 

Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools. 
It consists of 4 main projects:
 - Ant - core and libraries (AntLibs)
 - Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
 - IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
 - EasyAnt - Ant and Ivy toolbox to support build processes

## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

 - The main development activity is on support of Java9 in Ant Core. Actually
   we focus on <javac> and the new Java module system (Jigsaw).
   Work is ongoing.
 - Most of the development is done by the actual committer base, so there aren't
   any new committers on the horizon.
 - Small changes are coming in over Github.

## Health report:

 - While gathering the information for the report we had a look at the project
   health. While discussing the consensus is that we can't support IvyDE and
   EasyAnt any more and having difficulties in maintaining Ivy.
    - For Ivy we hope to activate new, reactivate old committers and get a new
      release manager with git knowledge.
    - IvyDE is useful for some users but requires more work than we could spent.
      We tend to move this to the attic, but there wasnt a formal vote yet.
    - EasyAnt never got that impact and the community. We never got a real
      release out, so moving that to the attic is maybe the next step.
      But again: there wasn't a formal vote yet.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

BookKeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance logging service.
It has been used as a fundamental service to build high available and
replicated services in companies like Twitter, 
Yahoo and Salesforce. It is also the log segment store for Apache 
DistributedLog (incubating).
  
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time 
  
## Activity: 
The mailing list activity has dropped and we attribute it to the split
attention between Apache BookKeeper and the incubating project Apache
DistributedLog. They are closely related given that DistributedLog uses
BookKeeper as a building block for storing logs. Despite the drop of mailing
list activity, there has been good discussion around upcoming features and
improvements to the project. 

The community started organizing bi-weekly calls where everyone is invited to
join. The goal is not to make decisions outside the mailing list and jira, but
instead to have a better understanding of current proposals and problems that
users of the project are facing. The community is also organizing a meetup
that will happen in November.
  
## Health report: 
The community is making good progress. We have been having healthy discussions
around issues and features and there are a few contributors on track to
become.

We haven't had a release in a while and we are targeting one for December
2016.

## Releases: 
  
- Last release was 4.4.0 on Mon, 16 May 2016

## Mailing list activity: 
  
The number of subscribers has been going up slightly. The drop in the traffic
of the dev list we attribute to the split attention between the two related
projects we mention above. 
  
- dev@bookkeeper.apache.org:  
   - 77 subscribers (up 4 in the last 3 months): 
   - 276 emails sent to list (512 in previous quarter)

managing cloud applications through autonomic blueprints.

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 
- Development continues with a regular turnover of pull requests
 submitted and merged.

## Health report: 
- The project continues with a similar level of activity that we have seen
 recently. There is a regular turnover of pull requests and commits, and JIRA
 tickets, showing that development is at a healthy pace and that users are
 feeding back their problems and feature suggestions.

## PMC changes: 

- Currently 11 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
- Last PMC addition was Jean-Baptiste Onofr√© and Olivier Lamy, who

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including 
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and 
tools. We wanted something that‚Äôs simple and intuitive to use, so we 
only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest. But 
also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with a 
language that‚Äôs a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be 
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
## Activity: 
Over the last 6 months, we have resolved most of the open bugs.
We have released 1.5 on  Friday, September 23rd with better support 
for Java 8 and Scala 2.11 and are looking to release 1.5.1 by the 
end of the year.
## Health report: 
The activity is slow, with 2 active committers.
The activity on the mailing lists is better than last quarter, with 
a few discussions on the user list.
 
We do see that the project is used at large. For example, the latest 
version has been downloaded over 7000 times, one month after its 
official release.
 
We have started discussing on the dev list how to improve participation, 
and have detailed several items for the next release 
to engage better our users.
## PMC changes:  
- Currently 7 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
- Last PMC addition was Peter Donald on Tue Oct 15 2013 
## Committer base changes:

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description: 
The past couple of months have been difficult for us. For posterity, the
August [0] and September[1] board agendas provide details of changes
affecting the project and subsequent PMC efforts to address board requested
action items. We will continue to work constructively with the board on the
points therein. 

With that said, we would like to express not only our optimism (more below)
but our thanks to those within the ASF who have spent substantial amounts of
time to help us get moving in the right direction. Of particular note have
been the ongoing efforts Mark Thomas and Jake Farrell. Without them, it would
have been much more difficult to deduce what to do next and how to go about
doing it. For everyone else, a large thank you as well. If nothing else, it's
clear we all care very deeply about having successful open source software
projects. 
   
## Issues: 

A long-time vendor who has been a large benefactor of the project through
contribution of resources, has re-focused said resources to more internal
efforts[2]. While many of their staff are still involved in day-to-day
activities, it has left something of a hole for the PMC to fill in terms of
handling day-to-day resourcing of issues. 

Discussions are ongoing on how best to do this, but we remain optimistic that
the size, diversity and skill of the community are enough that we will find
solutions. 

## Release Activity: 
Apache Cassandra has had the following releases:
- 2.1.16 was released on Mon Oct 10 2016 
- 2.2.8 was released on Wed Sep 28 2016 
- 3.8 was released on Thu Sep 29 2016 
- 3.9 was released on Thu Sep 29 2016 

We have recently moved trunk up to 4.0 and are currently discussing a roadmap
for such on the development mailing list. 

Note: 3.10 and 3.0.10 were scheduled to be released, but were voted down due
to a regression bug discovered by the community. 
   
## Health report: 

From the past several weeks of mailing list and social media activity, one
can draw the following conclusions regarding the health of Cassandra:
- our large, diverse community of users care deeply about the project and are
  not afraid to very publicly ask hard questions
- the board cares deeply about our project as can be seen by amount of effort
  expended in handling not only Cassandra but the larger issues brought about
  by the point above
- the PMC wants very much to do the right thing and is doing its best to
  constructively move forward

In short, we do not lack for passion at any level of the project. It is
therefore our game to lose and we intend to put our best efforts in over the
next quarter. 
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 21 PMC members. 
 - There are two new PMC members: 
    - Sankalp Kohli was added to the PMC on Mon Oct 24 2016 
    - Michael Shuler was added to the PMC on Thu Sep 22 2016 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 38 committers. 
 - There are three new commmitters: 
    - Dikang Gu was added as a committer on Fri Nov 04 2016 
    - Sankalp Kohli was added as a committer on Tue Oct 25 2016
    - Branimir Lambov was voted in and accepted, we are awaiting ICLA
      submission 
   
## Mailing list activity: 

Activity on both dev and user mail lists have increased substantially over
last quarter. We have no direct quantitative information as to why, but
anecdotally it appears that we have knowledgeable users appearing more
often to answer other users's questions. 

 - dev@cassandra.apache.org:  
    - 1582 subscribers (down -3 in the last 3 months): 
    - 709 emails sent to list (452 in previous quarter) 
    - Though not as high and some is resulting to larger political
      discussions, we still have over 60% growth in traffic.
   
 - user@cassandra.apache.org:  
    - 3109 subscribers (down -6 in the last 3 months): 
    - 1597 emails sent to list (901 in previous quarter) 
    - Mail list activity has increased over 50% from the last quarter.
      
## JIRA activity: 

As discussed above in Issues we would like the number of resolved issues
to be higher, but over 75% is not a bad place to be and we are actively
working on getting more community involvement. 
   
 - 480 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 372 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months 

## Trademark Enforcement

Three requests were sent out regarding our trademarks, all of which were
immediately complied with by the recipients:
- Clarified appropriate use of trademark and guidelines for a third party
  vendor providing backports of Apache Cassandra patches to a custom long
term release version [3]
- Use of trademark in project name [4]
- Use of trademark in project name [5]

## 'dtest' Project Contribution

DataStax recently offered to donate the dtest distributed testing suite to
the project [6],[7]. This was voted on in the dev mailing list and passed
[8]. Filing the appropriate forms with the Incubator folks for review will be
done shortly.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Clerezza Project  [Hasan Hasan]

DESCRIPTION
Apache Clerezza is an OSGi-based modular application and a set of components 
(bundles) for building RESTFul Semantic Web applications and services.
 
ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASE
Latest release was partial-release-201604 created on May 13, 2016.

ACTIVITY
To ease developers in contributing to Clerezza code base, and thus as a step
to attract new committers, Clerezza codes are reduced to core components in 
the master branch while moving the rest to a legacy branch in the git 
repository.

COMMUNITY
Latest change was addition of a new committer and PMC member on 16.08.2013.
To gain new committers, an email has been sent to dev@clerezza.apache.org.
Currently, there are nine PMC members in the project, where four of them
are also ASF members. That should be sufficient to be a community.

INFRASTRUCTURE
To allow easier update of Clerezza Website, the use of Apache CMS has been
suggested.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich St√§rk]

## Description: 
The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects
  
## Issues: 
No issues require board attention at the moment.
  
## Activity: 
Google Summer of Code 2016 has ended and Google will be invoiced shortly.
Although we applied the rules for ranking and accepting students stricter this
year we still saw only 35 of the 49 projects succeeding. 6 students failed at
midterm evaluation, another 7 failed during the final evaluations. The reasons
for failure are numerous with lack of skills, other commitments and students
simply disappearing being the most frequent. We will now discuss how to better
mitigate the risks of students failing for 2017.

We briefly discussed participating in Google Code-In, a project with goals
similar to GSoC where high school students would work on small tasks given out
by participating organizations. Concerns about the program's organization
agreement and the indemnification rules in particular in the end prevented us
from applying. Since a similar agreement is being used for GSoC we will submit
the agreement to V.P. Legal for advice on whether it is ok to sign for GSoC
2017.

Sharan Foga has written an extensive update on the encouraging diversity
efforts spearheaded by her which can be found at https://s.apache.org/n097

In the past few months ComDev has operated without a clear strategy with GSoC
and pointing random people into the right direction being the main tasks. An
effort has been started to get a strategy/roadmap into place.

## PMC changes: 
The PMC currently features 22 members. The last addition has been Sharan Foga
on 2016-11-15.

## Releases: 
None.
  
## Mailing list activity: 
A lot of discussion around guiding newcomers, ApacheCon and general
community-related discussions are happening on dev@. Subscriber count is up in
the past months, number of messages slightly down which is probably just usual
fluctuation.

GSoC-related discussions are happening on mentors@ with number of messages
fluctuating with GSoC phase.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------ 
Since the last report, email and commit activity continues to move along
slowly.  There has been not much other activity on the release side.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Community
--------- 
In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join as PMC and Commiter. 


Releases
-------- 
Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016 
Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014 
Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

  initiate the release process.

  No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

  There was some activity on the dev mail list. One PMC member continued
  development of the new "fleece" skin and related issues, and enquiries
  about integrating external components. Two other PMC members assisted with
  suggestions.

  Four PMC members were present during the quarter.

  At this report, no other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  The presence of some during the quarter, indicates that there should be
  sufficient people hanging around for us to potentially be able to make 
  a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Activity: Low
  3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues published:
  None.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description: 
  
Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers‚Äô
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

## Issues: 

Still on the agenda: further work on the release process, to improve 
automation while respecting the Apache guidelines.

The community is impatient for new releases, so we need to line up our ducks 
to be able to give a fresh cut to our community, as well as allowing them to
try the new features of Groovy 2.5.
  
## Activity: 

Thanks to our new committer, there's lots of energy and discussions around the
development of the new parser for Groovy, covering the Java 8 syntax features,
and discussing additional elements.
 
This quarter, 160 commits were contributed from 26 contributors including 19
non-committer contributers, 13 of which were new.

The number of tickets open and closed has significantly augmented, but we 
are closing at least as many as are being opened.

The user mailing-list seems to have slowed down a little, but the dev list has
seen a nice increase, likely thanks to the renewed activity around the 
new parser.

On the more social aspects, the @ApacheGroovy Twitter account is close to 
reach its 2k followers (1995 at the time of this writing). 
The LinkedIn Groovy user group reaches 4717 members. Groovy is still in the
top 20 of the TIOBE index, with rank 18. The previous 
month, the site indicated both Groovy and Go to have seen the biggest 
increase the past year.

A Slack channel for the Groovy ecosystem has been created by the community 
and has over 400 members.

The Groovy community will gather soon at the G3 Summit conference dedicated 
to the Groovy ecosystem, in Florida, at the end of the month.

## Health report: 
 
The project is healthy, and we're happy to have Daniel Sun join our ranks as 
new committer to the team. 

The downloads are still going strong, as we have now surpassed the 2 million
downloads per month. From January to October included, we are now at over 18 
million downloads for this year (compared to 12.7M in 2015).

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Chris Mattmann:

    I'm worried still about this podling. Discussion seemed to still happen
    offlist and to be summarized to the list, instead of actively involving
    others in the community. Also, it says the website has been drafted -
    where is it? Where are the corresponding JIRA issues? Where are the public
    discussions about the site.  The podling is/was on a short leash since the
    [DISCUSS] Retirement vote. I'd say give it one more month, and would
    appreciate others chiming in here. The other thing I'd say is that there
    is definitely mentor attrition here. I don't think we have enough active
    mentors reinforcing and sending the message (myself included) day to day.
    It's definitely more reactive now than proactive. The podling could use
    some help in that area.

Guacamole

Guacamole is an enterprise-grade, protocol-agnostic, remote desktop gateway.
Combined with cloud hosting, Guacamole provides an excellent alternative to
traditional desktops. Guacamole aims to make cloud-hosted desktop access
preferable to traditional, local access.

Guacamole has been incubating since 2016-02-10.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. **Making the first Guacamole release under the Apache Incubator**
  2. Encouraging community participation and contribution
  3. Accepting additional committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  It is clear that the continuing lack of a release is a major obstacle to
  community development, especially given outstanding pull requests which
  cannot be merged due to pre-release code freeze.

  We believe that the source and documentation are finally up-to-date with
  respect to Apache and the Incubator, and that we are ready to move forward
  with the procedures surrounding the release. Any assistance in navigating
  our first release would be greatly appreciated.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community participation has remained roughly the same as last report. Mailing
  list participation is active but unchanged. Since last report, we have
  received an additional 3 pull requests, and have engaged the contributors for
  code review. Code looks good, and response to feedback has been professional,
  but merge is blocked until we can get the first release out of the way.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  All outstanding issues which were aimed at the project's first release
  (0.9.10-incubating) have been completed, as have all bugs discovered during
  testing. We have made preparatory changes to the project website with the
  release in mind.

  The project's old SourceForge forums have finally been closed, replaced by
  the mailing lists. The forums have been left in read-only mode for the sake
  of reference, with a stickied announcement notifying users of the move.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Apache Slider community/PPMC has voted to move portions of Slider into
     Apache Hadoop YARN as modules. It is possible that the remaining pieces
     will be moved at a later point in time or become obsolete or evolve to
     work closely with YARN. Slider PPMC will decide what makes the most
     sense as we progress through this exciting time.
  2. Getting more external users
  3. Growth of a diverse set of developers/committers/PMC members is also
     crucial towards the final state of Slider

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The Apache Hadoop YARN community/PMC and Apache Slider community/PPMC had
  decided to move portions of Slider into YARN, to make fast and significant
  progress on: YARN-4692 - [Umbrella] Simplified and first-class support for
  services in YARN. As a result, the Slider Core module (including Application
  Master, Client and Java unit tests) has been rolled into an Apache Hadoop
  YARN feature branch as a hadoop-yarn-slider-core module.  This effort is
  being captured in: YARN-5079 : Native YARN framework layer for services. All
  the migrations are happening in a branch (namely yarn-native-services)
  created of off Hadoop trunk. As a result of this, we are already seeing
  interest in the Hadoop committers/PMC, who have started to contribute and
  submit patches to Slider.

  In order to support existing users of Slider, and to provide seamless
  migration, there will be sufficient overlap between the time when a stable
  state of long running services support is available in some future version
  of YARN and the time till an independent Slider release is available. The
  community/PPMC will also determine the future state of Slider as we navigate
  through these changes.

  The discussions on the Slider and YARN community DLs can be viewed here -

  https://s.apache.org/0hoh
  https://s.apache.org/MncV

  For the benefit of those who would like to use Slider Core from the Hadoop
  codebase, but continue to use classic Slider Agent and legacy app-packages,
  a new branch (yarn-native-services) has been created in classic Slider repo.
  This branch retains only the Agent (python) code and the App Packages. It
  adds Slider Core module as a Hadoop dependency. This allows users to consume
  the latest of Slider Core.  Future classic Slider releases can be made
  purely off of this branch.

  Additionally an effort is being made to create an agent-less provider for
  legacy app-packages, which could help users to completely migrate to Hadoop
  codebase for creating long-running services with Slider. Expectation from
  app-package owners would be to make minor modification of their packages.
  Primary changes would be to shed the dependency on python Agent code,
  effectively making packages much simpler than what they look like today in
  classic Slider.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There has been fewer bug fixes on the classic Slider side as most of the
  focus has been on developing features on native YARN services in the Hadoop
  codebase. Work continues on support for complex services (assemblies) and
  agent-less applications in Slider. The efforts on Slider Core will continue
  in the new services branch created in YARN. Few key features which were
  merged to classic Slider as well were - SLIDER-875 - Ability to create an
  Uber application package with capability to deploy and manage as a single
  business app, and SLIDER-1107 - Generate app configuration files in AM.
  Several issues identified by Coverity scans were resolved as well.
  Additionally few patches were contributed by the community fixing functional
  and performance issues. Slider community plans to ship a release in the next
  quarter with all these features and bug fixes.

Tamaya

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Extend Community
  2. Improve Documentation and release base components
  3. Graduate als TLP in 2017 after next releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  After our next releases and improving our homepage we'd like to graduate as
  a TLP in 2017.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have increasing feedback of use cases to be covered and also a few bug
  reports, so Tamaya is used by developers and companies.  Additionally we are
  doing regular bi-weekly hangouts and have defined a well defined roadmap to
  release and restructure our project.  Apart from that we gathered feedback
  from JavaOne 2016: official Configuration JSR proposal and Anatole had a
  talk there.

  The conflicts that arose in the past seem to be solved as some of the
  mentors and early committers have left the project. Since we've established
  our hangouts we have the feeling of beeing more connect and able to work
  towards a common goal.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Apart from the main project we established new repositories to hold
  extensions and sandbox modules. In order to get rid of the problematic
  webpage generation we decided to start from scratch.

  In addition to making the API more smooth, we try to keep the base
  repository/project as lean as possible and prepare a next release.  Due to
  various technical issues (infrastructure behaves differently from local
  builds and checkouts) we did not meet our deadline on getting a release out
  by the end of October.

--------------------
Unomi is a reference implementation of the OASIS Context Server specification
currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical Committee. It
provides a high-performance user profile and event tracking server.

Unomi has been incubating since 2015-10-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continued releases, and updated dependencies
  2. Grow up user and contributor communities, seeing more contribution/PR

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are still targeting the development of the user community.  For that, we
  discussed about improving and polishing the website. Today, it's obvious
  that it's not easy to understand what Unomi can do and actually does.  The
  purpose is to give more use cases and introduction on the mailing list.
  Some small improvements have been performed in that way.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The second Apache Unomi 1.1.0-incubating has been released.

  We updated key dependencies and provided new features in addition of the bug
  fixes. We also fixed the LGPL issue in the binary distribution.  The Unomi
  rules and conditions engine has been improved as well.

Date of last release:

  2016-10-03

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

    I am going to humbly request being removed as a mentor for this podling. I
    haven't had a chance to send it to the list but I don't have the bandwidth
    to actively provide oversight here.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3)
specification for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout.
Scout is an implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries
1.0 (JAXR).

jUDDI
- All mailing lists have had very Low traffic this quarter.
- 3.3.3 Released Sept 12, 2016, maintenance and bug fixes.

Scout
- No release this period, no development took place.
- Very low volume of JAXR related questions on the mailing list.

Last PMC addition and new committer April 3, 2013 (Alex O'Ree)

Last Release jUDDI-3.3.3, Sept 12, 2016

There are no issues that require the boards attention at this time.

Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in all 
likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

# Description
The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache
Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all
REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.

# Issues
None

# Status
The Apache Knox team has just wrapped up the 0.10.0 release with a number of
contributions from the community. We missed our target for the release by over
a month. This was due to activity in the community, discussion in how to go
about testing certain contributions to determine whether goals were actually
met, etc. We've begun using wiki as a means to describe Knox Improvement
Proposals (KIPs). These are "one-pagers" that capture a particular vision for
improvement in certain areas. They should help illustrate the roadmap for the
related feature areas and map those visions to JIRAs. This helps give focus to
the releases and should also help contributors see how active JIRAs map into
the roadmap and vision.

# Releases
* 0.10.0: 2016-11-07 Added PAM support, LDAP paging, Websocket support and
 fixed a number of bugs - through ~25 commits.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Ralph Goers]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to application logging.

Currently there are no issues which require the board's attention.

- Community

Log4j 2 remains an active project. The overall community is healthy 
and friendly.

Log4cxx is still active in the Incubator. They have been sporadic
discussions regarding performing a release but little real progress
has been made. 
 
In general, all subprojects are still healthy although none has grown 
since the last report.


- Project Branding Requirements

All components except Chainsaw meet the branding requirements.
We will fix the Chainsaw branding with the next release.

- Last three community changes

 * Mikael St√•ldal joined as a PMC Member on June 20 2016
 * Ralph Goers was voted to be the next Chair on Nov 01 2015
 * Mikael St√•ldal joined as a Committer on Sep 17 2015

- Releases
 * Log4j 2.7 (Oct 1, 2016)

- Subproject summaries

Log4j 2: Active. Significant work has been done to reduce or eliminate 
the number of objects Log4j creates and in documenting how to use
Log4j in a "garbage free" manner. Quite a few bug fixes in the last 2
releases.

Discussions have been held on the developer list regarding how large the
Log4j 2 project has gotten, the need to have some of the builds target
newer Java versions, and some new components. In support of that new
git repositories have been created for log4j-audit, log4j-plugins, 
log4j-scala, and log4j-tools.

The number of emails on the developer mailing list has increased by about 
25% in the last 3 months.

Log4net: Active with 2 releases within the last year and a significant 
uptick in activity on the dev and user lists  

Log4cxx: Prgoress seems to have stalled in the incubator. They have made 
no progress towards a release. However, the email lists still show some
activity.

Log4php: No activity this quarter.

Chainsaw: No activity this quarter.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security
policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.5 release on
August 18, 2016.  The next major release is scheduled for December 31, 2016.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Furkan Kamaci on September 7, 2016.
The last PMC member was Rafa Haro, voted in on August 31, 2015.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been light this quarter.  Issues reported have been
mainly garden-variety bugs.  We've had several feature requests but few
contributions.  Dev list comments for this period have also been light, with
occasional user questions.  I am unaware of any mailing list question that
has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014. Apache Oltu Oauth2 module
version 1.0.2 was released June 20th 2016. Apache Oltu Parent v4 was released
June 20th 2016.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard. A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014 and some minor
releases are going out regularly for bug fixing. Updated modules contained bug
fixing were released June 20th 2016 . At the moment we are working on JSON Web
Encryption support ( OLTU-80 - Implement JWE support for JWT IN PROGRESS ).  
In a recent mail thread in private@ some important things have been pointed
out: The last few months it has been awfully quiet (this might also be due the
fact the OAuth spec is stable). But not only, since we have some patches
laying around for a while The release has not been finished. It seems some of
the artifacts are not synched correctly in https://www.apache.org/dist/oltu
The builds keep failing 
One of the outcome was that embracing the Apache way of having new blood from
time to time we are going to rotate the VP for the project.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description: 
- Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
  formats

## Issues: 
- there are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
- The 3.15 release required some time to stabilize, however the 
  additional effort in regression testing hopefully will maninfest
  in lower numbers of newly introduced bugs in the library.

  There is constant activity in multiple areas, mostly bugfixes, 
  cryptography enhancements and enhanced support for reading VBA macro 
  contents.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache REEF Project  [Markus Weimer]

## Description: 
  Apache REEF (Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework) is a  library for 
  developing portable applications for cluster resource managers such as 
  Apache Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos.

## Activity: 
 - REEF 0.15.1 was released during the reporting period. (Pending)
 - Lots of work towards REEF.NET on Linux
 - Significant enhacements to the Iterative MapReduce layer to support fault
   tolerant machine learning algorithms. 
   
## Health report: 
  Overall, the community is healthy: there is a constant flow of bug reports,
  fixes and discussions. That said, we have not seen new people show up on the
  dev list during the reporting period. This is something we will have to 
  discuss in the community.

## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 21 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Andrew Chung on Tue Nov 17 2015

## Description:

- Apache River software provides a standards-compliant JINI service.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Wrapped up River-3.0.0, released this quarter.
- Continued discussion of River's future direction.

## Health report:

- The ongoing future directions discussion has progressed from high level
strategy to discussion of specific features and use-cases.

- Two PMC members resigned during the quarter, a concern because at this point
there is no stream of incoming developers to provide new committers and PMC
members. Attracting new developers will be difficult until the future
direction is firmed up and made visible.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Bryan Thompson on Sun Aug 30 2015

## Mailing list activity:

- The increased activity level in the dev@ mailing list is due to the
combination of completing a release and the future direction discussion.

- dev@river.apache.org:
   - 94 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
   - 128 emails sent to list (74 in previous quarter)

- user@river.apache.org:

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Roller Project  [Dave Johnson]


## Description: 

Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based blog server that works
well on Tomcat and MySQL, and is known to run on other Java servers
and relational databases. The ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org runs on
Roller 5.0.3 Tomcat and MySQL.
   
## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

  - The core Roller community is small and with low activity levels.
  - Roller website was switched over from Apache CMS to Git PubSub with JBake
  - There is ongoing work to create a modernized UI using Bootstrap with Struts,
   but it slowed since our last report.

## Health report:

 - Community is made-up of part-time volunteers with limited time to devote to
   Roller.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 5 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Kohei Nozaki on Sun Dec 06 2015 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 10 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Kohei Nozaki at Mon Mar 09 2015 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 5.1.2 on Tue Mar 24 2015 
   
## Mailing list activity: 

  Subscriber counts could be taken to mean there is still good interest in
  Apache Roller. The low email counts reflec the low level of development
  and user-support activity.
 
  - dev@roller.apache.org:  
    - 158 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months): 
    - 7 emails sent to list (2 in previous quarter) 
   
 - user@roller.apache.org:  
    - 287 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 5 emails sent to list (1 in previous quarter) 
   
   
## JIRA activity: 
   
 - 3 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 1 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description: 
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - The project team discussed the merits of a new major release for the Java
   project, namely so that we can introduce Java 7/8 features in the code
   (current release requires JDK 6). A consensus was reached that this would
   be a good idea, and so the master branch has been updated to 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.

   Apart from this, a handful of user bugs were reported, some of which have
   been fixed at this point. A new minor release of the Java library will
   probably happen over the next quarter to include these fixes.
   
## Health report: 
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC. Right now there are no obvious potential new committers for the
   project.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 6 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Marc Giger on Wed Apr 03 2013 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 16 committers. 
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report. 
 - Last committer addition was Marc Giger in July 2012
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was Apache Santuario XML Security for Java 2.0.7 on Fri Jun 
   17 2016 
   
## JIRA activity: 
   
 - 8 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 4 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Bert Huijben]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library
   built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the
   default client library of Apache Subversion and Apache OpenOffice.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   We released Apache Serf 1.3.9 after testing the release process and
   scripting on a private release. It was good to see some outside
   suggestions on how to improve our release process and especially
   how we should announce releases within the Apache foundation.

## Health report: 
   Activity is at a normal, fairly quiet level.

   The serf project's activity is quite related to that of Subversion
   and with that projects recent affairs we slowed more than expected.

## PMC & Committer changes: 
   Currently 11 PMC members and 12 committers. Our last new committer was
   added on Wed Sep 02 2015.

## Releases:
   Apache Serf 1.3.9 was released on Thu Sep 01 2016

   trunk (1.4.x): Still stabilizing towards a new release. Slow ongoing
   development.

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   Normal activity. A bit more activity around the release of 1.3.9.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AY: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:
Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The
SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and enables the
creation of metadata objects which comply with the model of
international standards. The SIS referencing module enable the
construction of geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing such
as axis, projection and coordinate reference system definitions, along
with the associated operations which enable the mathematical conversion
of coordinates between different systems of reference.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Review and integration of contributors work:
  - The Google Summer of Code project has been completed [1]. The
    student (Hao) worked in collaboration with the Vietnamese space
    agency, which provided the data.
      * Her work on LANDSAT and GeoTIFF metadata has been integrated.
      * Her work on MODIS and the Catalog Services for the Web (CSW) has
        not yet been integrated (pending review) but this integration is
        planned [2].
  - R√©mi Mar√©chal is continuing Hao's work on GeoTIFF [3].
  - Johann Sorel's work on the GPX format [4] (currently in the SIS
    development branch) is under refactoring for closer integration with
    the ISO 19115 metadata model and SIS DataStore model.

Implementation of standards:
  - JSR-363 (Units of Measurement API) got its final approbation by the
    JCP and is now an official standard [5]. This new standard replaces
    JSR-275. A JSR-363 implementation has been developed in SIS.
  - Above replacement implies an API change not only in SIS, but also in
    the GeoAPI 3.0.0 standard on which SIS depends. A GeoAPI 3.0.1-RC1
    release candidate has been prepared and is currently submitted for
    vote in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) [6]. The JSR-363
    implementation that we did allowed us to verify that the new GeoAPI
    standard works before submission to OGC

Meetings:
  - An Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) meeting happened in September.
    Reports of previous meetings were used to be posted on the SIS
    mailing list, but are now posted on geospatial@apache.org instead in
    an attempt to encourage cross-projects collaboration.
  - SIS will have a presentation at the ApacheCon in Sevilla. It will be
    part of the geospatial track, created for the second time (after
    ApacheCon in Vancouver) with the help of OGC.

Presence on the web:
  - Fixed errors on the Wikipedia page about Well-Known Text (WKT)
    format and added Apache SIS in the list of libraries that support
    that format [7].
  - Apache SIS is cited in a W3C draft paper about Spatial Data on the
    Web Best Practices [8].
  * The GeoAPI 3.0.1 standard candidate cites Apache SIS as a "proof of
    concept" implementation.


## Health report:
Development continued at an average pace of 45 commits per month. For
the last quarter, 97% of those commits were by the same committer. But
we saw a slight increase of activity from two other committers (Johann
Sorel and R√©mi Mar√©chal) lately, and I expect their contribution to
increase slowly as SIS development shifts from low level to higher level
topics. Google Summer of Code, ApacheCon and extensive javadoc are some
efforts for increasing the developer base; we plan to continue those
efforts.

JIRA activity is low because of a tendency to write a single ticket for
large topic (e.g. a single SIS-334 task for the whole JSR-363
implementation effort):

  - 5 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
  - 5 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Number of downloads from Maven central repository has been multiplied by
4 in the last 12 months (about 14000 last month).

## PMC changes:
  - Currently 19 PMC members.
  - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
  - Last PMC addition was Marc Le Bihan on Wed Dec 10 2014
  - No new PMC candidate in sight yet

## Committer base changes:
  - Currently 21 committers.
  - No new committers added in the last 3 months
  - Last committer addition was Johann Sorel at Thu Mar 31 2016
  - No new committer candidate in sight for now

## Releases:
  - Last release was 0.7 on Fri May 27 2016
  - Current tendency is about 8 months between releases

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It 
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. 

Project status: 

- The community released Apache Spark 2.0.1 on October 3rd, 2016 as the
  first patch release for the 2.x branch. We also released Spark 1.6.3 on
  November 7th to continue patching the 1.x branch, and started voting on
  release candidates for Spark 2.0.2 with more patches to 2.x.

- The Spark Summit Europe conference ran in Brussels on Oct 25-27 with
  around 1000 attendees, including presentations on new use cases at
  Microsoft and Facebook.

- There've been several discussions on the dev list about making the
  development process easier to follow and giving feedback to contributors
  faster. One concrete thing we'd like to implement is a process to post
  "improvement proposals" scoping a new feature before detailed design
  begins, so that developers can solicit feedback from users earlier, and
  users can easily see the project's high-level roadmap in one place. The
  most recent writeup on this is at https://s.apache.org/ndAX and seems to
  be welcomed by contributors who've used a similar process in other ASF
  projects. Other things that contributors are working on are creating a
  template for design documents and cleaning up JIRA.

Trademarks:

- We are continuing engagement with various organizations.

Latest releases:

Nov 07, 2016: Spark 1.6.3
Oct 03, 2016: Spark 2.0.1
July 26, 2016: Spark 2.0.0
June 25, 2016: Spark 1.6.2
May 26, 2016: Spark 2.0.0-preview

Committers and PMC: 

The last committer was added on Sept 29th, 2016 (Xiao Li).

The last PMC members were added on Feb 15th, 2016
(Joseph Bradley, Sean Owen and Yin Huai).

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

The project finally managed to invite two new PMC members. One of these
two new members, Rafa Haro, also managed to cut a release after more than
two years without a major release.

From the technical side the project is doing okay now. The release helps
people to use Stanbol in a stable manner. However, the ongoing development
is rather slow and no plans were made until now for future releases.

The project chair started a discussion about electing a new chair who is
much more involved in the daily business of Stanbol. Since the current
chair has less time for Stanbol (the missed reports is a clear indication),
it may be good to handover to someone else. However, it is not the intention
to just drop the job but to drive the discussion for a new chair.


Subscribers on the dev list: 227

Last new committer was
  Cristian Petroaca on May 7th, 2015

Last new PMC member were
  Cristian Petroaca on July 28th, 2016
  Rafa Haro on July 28th, 2016
  
Last stack release was:

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Stratos Project  [Lakmal Warusawithana]

## Description: 
   Apache Stratos is a highly-extensible Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) 
   framework that helps run Apache Tomcat, PHP, and MySQL applications and can 
   be extended to support many more environments on all major cloud 
   infrastructures.  
   
## Issues: 
 - It seems no one active in the project. I started thread in PMC about moving 
   to attic. No one replied. I am not sure what can do for going forward. 
   
## Activity: 
 - No any coding activity
 - One user query
 - One user (who were GSOC student) said interesting to contribute to project.
   But no reply from PMC or Committers
 - No any other discussions

## Health report: 
 Answers for board auctions raised at last board meeting. 
 Q: How many of the 45 are in that "very few" count?
 A: 7 Committers
 Q: How many of the 45 will every commit again, since, iirc, 
    WSO2 has dropped any activity related to Stratos?
 A: 10 - 15 Committers. All them are WSO2 employees.

 One suggestion was promoting who ever vote for last release as committers. We
 have not tried that. But my concern is without current committers support it
 is very hard new comers to get used to the code base.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Evgeny Kotkov]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  A hackathon hosted by elego was held in Berlin during October 10th-14th,
  with approximately 8 developers attending.  The discussion was mostly
  focused around a new developed feature, the interactive tree conflict
  resolver, and a lot of progress occurred on its development.

  During this quarter, there is an increase in the dev@ mailing list
  activity (353 messages, as opposed to 188 in the previous quarter), and
  a slight increase in the number of commits.  Our users@ mailing list
  is active as well, and receives about 100 messages per month from users
  and the community members assisting them.

  There has been a conflict on the ground of inviting a new PMC member,
  and unfortunately one of the existing PMC members has resigned from
  the Subversion PMC.  The community is now working through several
  discussions that should help to avoid similar situations in the
  future.  These discussions happen on our private mailing list.

  Last PMC addition was in December 2015 (James McCoy).
  Last committer addition was November 2015 (James McCoy).

* Releases

  Our last 1.8.16 and 1.9.4 releases were made on April 28, 2016.

  The work toward 1.10.x is progressing, with no specific release date
  planned.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiricc√≤]

## Description:

Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in
enterprise environments.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

This quarter has been busy with final 2.0.0 release and related announcement
on the ASF blog. For the occasion, The New Stack published an interview with
V.P. Apache Syncope: https://s.apache.org/x18F

The new major release 2.0.0 incorporated some relevant contributions received
via Github, including SYNCOPE-808 which was successfully completed as part of
GSoC 2016. A pull request for SYNCOPE-809, which instead did not complete for
GSoC 2016, is currently under work.

About the Syncope PoC with infra, we are still on hold waiting for the
availability of a "playground zone" - see INFRA-10931 for details. It has been
quite a while now without any feedback or ETA, it might be the case to
consider retiring the proposal.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Turbine Project  [Thomas Vandahl]

Apache Turbine Project Board Report, November 2016

Apache Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java
developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you to
personalize the web sites and to use user logins to restrict access to parts
of your application.

Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the base
of many other projects.

Status

The Turbine project has had again some increased activity in the last quarter.
We could even resurrect a former committer.

In response to the feedback of the board regarding the last report: 

We don't currently have prospects of new committers or PMC members. However we
believe that our small community is healthy enough to provide the necessary
oversight. We are striving to attract new users by providing a good example of
a Turbine application as a Maven Archetype.

The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.

Community changes

No new committers were voted in since the last board report.

The last change to the committer base was the addition of Georg Kallidis
(2012/09/19).

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

The last change to the PMC was the addition of Georg Kallidis (2013/09/30).

Turbine core project

We are in the process of migrating old applications to the new Turbine
framework. It turns out that a number of bugs have to be fixed, mostly in
supporting Fulcrum components. Also the new security model showed some
weaknesses which need to be addressed.

The Maven Archetype for a Hello-World-application is being prepared. We found
some issues with it, so the vote was cancelled.

The last released version was Turbine 4.0-M2 (2015/12/22).

Fulcrum component project

Some changes to the Fulcrum Intake component to support Java8

The last released component was Fulcrum Yaafi 1.0.7 (2015/10/09).

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Usergrid Project  [Todd Nine]

## Description: 
 -  Usergrid is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) composed of an integrated
    database (Cassandra), a query engine (Elastic Search), and
    application layer and client tier with SDKs for developers.
   
## Issues: 
 -  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - Unique value implementation has been moved to Akka.  This has increased
   stability significantly.  We're also in the process of implemented
   multi-region via Akka, removing the dependency on AWS for a multi region
   Impl.
   
## Health report: 
 - Usergrid is healthy and the community is growing at a moderate pace.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
 Tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information lookup
 activities

## Issues:
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## GitHub experiment:
 - No issues to report.  Commits are pushed to GitHub and mirrored to
   ASF hardware and push logs are maintained.  Net: while the infrastructure
   is in place to enable pushing to the ASF clone, the Whimsy project is
   defacto operating with GitHub as master.

## Health report:
 - While there remains sufficient oversight, and three active committers,
   there has been no progress this quarter in growing a development community.

## Development:
 - In order to address board agenda lockups during board meetings, synchronous
   server sent events were replaced with an asynchronous and event driven 
   websocket implementation.  Further improvements were made this month to
   catch missing updates which required manual refreshes to see.

 - Replaced secretary workbench with a more maintainable implementation; one
   that also relieves the infrastructure team from debugging and cleaning up
   after a mal-formed email or a wedged svn working copy required attention.
   This change also enabled a number of performance improvements and some
   minor functionality improvements (e.g. more tailored email messages).

## PMC and committer base:
  - Currently 9 committers, all on the PMC.
  - Last addition was Craig L Russell in December of 2015.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release that integrates
Xerces-C.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Oregon State University Capstone has accepted a project to use Xalan.
The project also uses Xerces, the Unicode ICU, and possibly the
xml-commons entity resolver.  Steve Hathaway is the project mentor.
There are three students doing the software integration work.

We are currently integrating the Xerces-C parser patch release into a
Xerces-C patch release.

Most of the communications traffic is via JIRA. Email list activity has been
stagnant for 3 months.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.
