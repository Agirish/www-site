       We again thank Chris Mattmann for his service as Treasurer for close
       to the last 4 years, as he steps down from the role.

    B. President [Ross]

       Apologies for the late report, some personal issues getting in the way
       this month.

       Since we have a new board and you have had time to settle in, it's
       time for some big discussion items. I raise them here and will discuss
       on the board@ list following the meeting.

       1) Budget: While we have plenty of money in the bank we need to think
       hard about the direction the budget is heading. We are potentially
       looking at a large deficit if we hire into an infra lead role as
       planned. We have plenty of money in the bank and this is not a
       short-term concern, however, we need a strategy for bringing us back
       into line within 3 years (we have longer than that in the bank, but I
       like to be cautious). I have indicated some possibilities for
       addressing this below.

       2) Infra lead: due to budgeting concerns I have not yet moved on the
       infra lead hiring. I have discussed with the infra team and they are
       in agreement with buying more time to ensure our path is a sound one.

       3) Hiring a "general manager" - we've discussed this a number of times
       over the years. Recently I stated I did not think now was the time and
       that in fact an infra lead was more important. Upon deeper examination
       I have changed my opinion. I believe we may be better hiring a general
       manager rather than an infra lead. This individual would take on the
       coordination responsibilities of the President and VP Infra as well as
       being responsible for managing a fundraising campaign along with VP
       Fundraising, VP TAC and VP Infra. I have not fully defined this role
       and will work with the board@ list to do so as it clearly has the
       potential to change the culture of the foundation and therefore must
       not be rushed into.

       4) GitHub integration is a waste of resources. I asked each of the
       Infra team how much of our staff time is spent on Git integration. The
       estimates varied from 10-25%, with the average being around 17%. The
       team did not feel this will go down with the completion of the
       MATT/GitHub project, each of them gave examples of further work that
       would be needed before projects were satisfied. My strong
       recommendation is that we remove the blocks preventing our projects
       from self managing GitHub projects as the canonical source control. We
       will mirror on our own servers. The infra team would build an exit
       plan and we would ensure budget was available for that plan. At
       ApacheCon I gave VP Legal a heads up that this would be my
       recommendation to the board and I request that he, along with the
       Directors, give approval for infra to make this happen. In the
       meantime the MATT/GitHub experiment continues, in fact infra a ready
       to expand it if the board would prefer this route.

       Executive Assistant

       Unfortunately Melissa was unable to attend ApacheCon for personal
       reasons. However, she did a great job of coordinating cover for
       herself - big thanks to Sharan Foga for stepping up to do the majority
       of the onsite coordination and booth work. Thanks also to the many
       members and committers who helped at ApacheCon.

       Trademarks

       We saw a large bill come in from our legal firm which went
       significantly over the agreed monthly cap. VP Trademarks has resolved
       the issue.

       VP Trademarks has been working to highlight specific issues within a
       couple of prominent PMCs. One of which is seeing a competing
       registration attempt, which we are objecting to. The outcome of our
       objection here will be an interesting test of our policies and
       enforcements.

       With respect to Budget VP Fundraising is indicating, once again, that
       next years spend will be considerably higher than last years. This is
       supported by the large invoice presented in the last month. As with
       other years only budget for US registrations is being requested, but
       VP Fundraising believes a further request will be needed later in this
       year. I note that this is the same situation as last year, yet we were
       still significantly under budget last year.

       VP Trademarks expresses concern that PMCs are not policing their marks
       sufficiently. In the past there has never been consensus among the
       board with respect to how much we should expect project communities to
       pro-actively (vs. re-actively) enforce trademark policies. Now we have
       a new board this is worth re-visiting. My position remains constant,
       we cannot scale trademark protection through VP Trademarks and so this
       remains the responsibility of the PMC. Unfortunately, in a few cases
       this model is not working.

       Fundraising

       I met with both VPs Fundraising at ApacheCon (Jim only briefly). With
       Hadrian there were two main points of discussion:

       A) Scaling fundraising efforts. I suggested three possible routes 1)
       Empowering Infrastructure to seek its own sponsorship 2) Empowering
       TAC to seek its own sponsorship 3) Bringing in a "General Manager" to
       assist with both Infra and Fundraising. For 1) and 2) we agreed that
       given the right people in those committees there is no reason why they
       could not put together sponsorship opportunities that were independent
       of individual projects.

       B) Hadrian's role as VP Fundraising and how to ensure others are able
       to step up and help in the fundraising activities.

       Marketing

       Annual report is coming up in May. Those responsible for sections
       please liaise with Sally.

       Infrastructure

       I have still not moved on hiring an infra lead (more on this below).
       However, David and I, with the help of the infra team, have
       interviewed to back-fill the infra team. An informal offer has been
       made.

       At ApacheCon I met with all infra staff and VP Infra to discuss
       staffing. All agreed that holding off on hiring an infra lead was
       acceptable as long as we back-filled the team (this is already in
       progress). I also indicated my intention to create a bonus scheme for
       infra team members and to address the fact that many of the team have
       not had a raise for some time. I will revisit this once we have
       discussed the general manager role on board@.

       Code signing will not be discontinued as a result of a renegotiation
       of fees.

       An attack on JIRA resulted in some service limitations for
       non-committers.

       lists.apache.org was launched. The old mail search and archives will
       be retired as a result (existing links will continue to work).

       Performance against our SLAs is down this month due to being
       understaffed, though we are mostly meeting requirements. My thanks go
       to the infra team for working through this.

       TAC

       Nick and I met at ApacheCon to discuss the goal of TAC and how we
       might improve the selection process to meet that goal. TAC will review
       our discussion and act upon it in the coming months. The short version
       is that I believe there is an opportunity for TAC to seek its own
       funding and that it should come up with a model for doing so. Nick
       agreed to work with this and see where we can go. Our initial thinking
       is that we focus on the "public good" aspect of mentoring people into
       the Apache Way through conference activities. However, concrete ideas
       are only just starting to emerge.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


       Chris expressed support for the GitHub recommendation.

       Ross to provide updated budget numbers after the meeting.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]

        The board has identified a replacement Treasurer that we hope to
        appoint during Executive Session. I believe this is the last report
        wearing my Treasurer’s hat. Thanks again.
        
        The last remnants of the WFS account are closed now that a former
        Treasurer helped close out remaining points on a credit card, and
        transfer them into a check form sent to our corporate mailing
        address.
        
        The Treasurer supported delivery of input to the ASF quarterly
        report in coordination with Virtual and with VP, Press & 
        Marketing and the President.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The project to replace missing ICLAs is progressing. No additional
       responses to the request to file replacement ICLAs for existing
       committers have been received. We are now working on tooling to make
       it easier to revoke credentials for committers without proper ICLAs.

       In April, 69 iclas, three cclas, five grants, and 13 membership
       applications were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

    Last week we held ApacheCon North America in Vancouver, BC,
    Canada. The attendance numbers are as follows:

    ABD - 428 total - (398 for just ABD + 30 add-ons from ApacheCon
    attendees)

    ApacheCon - 326 total - (277 just for ApacheCon + 49 add-ons from
    the ABD attendees)

    (That's a total overlap of 79 that attended both events, so the
    audience is largely disjoint.)

    Combined total attendees - 675(!) versus 447 in Austin

    This is a 51% increase from last year!

    Among other highlights of this event:

    * Sally held her Media/Analyst training again, to a full house.
      This was very valuable to all who attended.
    * Keynotes included a very astute analysis by Stephen O'Grady, of
      RedMonk, of the need for our projects to work with one another,
      rather than operating as islands within a loosely-knit
      federation. This presentation is well worth watching. It is on
      the Linux Foundation YouTube channel. I welcome further
      discussion of his ideas on the members@ and dev@community lists.
    * There was a 2-day track of GeoSpatial content, which we will try
      to do again in Spain and more aggressively market as a
      track/subconference/something to the scientific community.
    * ODPi had a keynote in which they spoke about the purpose of
      their organization. Jim Jagielski had a one-on-one panel
      discussion with John Mertic, Director of Program Management for
      ODPi, in which they discussed the concerns of the Foundation
      about ODPi. This recording will be on FeatherCast.org within the
      coming days.
    * All keynotes/plenaries are published to the Linux Foundation
      YouTube channel at
      https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCthvmTSlmIcMH93LIJNe-2w
    * FeatherCast.org is publishing all of the audio from every
      non-plenary session. This will take considerable time, but we
      have a number of volunteers working on this effort. Many thanks
      to those people. This recording was done entirely by volunteer
      effort, using digital recorders owned by the Foundation. The
      full list may be found at
      http://feathercast.apache.org/tag/apacheconna2016/  
      The volunteer effort is being coordinated on the comdev mailing
      list.
    * lists.apache.org was announced in the State of the Feather
      address, as well as being mentioned in other talks, and people
      are starting to use that service.

    At the event, we announced ApacheCon EU 2016, to be held November
    14-18 in Seville (Sevilla) Spain. The websites for that event are
    at http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-europe and
    http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-europe
    Registration and CFP coming very soon. A number 
    of people have already stepped forward offering local expertise and
    on-the-ground support. Please save the date, and mention it if you
    happen to be in conversation with potential sponsors. While it is
    not our job to promote and market the events, anything we can do
    with our contacts is greatly appreciated. There's a recording at
    http://feathercast.apache.org/why-did-you-sponsor-apachebigdata/
    in which a number of our sponsors talk about why they sponsored
    the event, and why everyone else should, too.

    We are considering several locations for ApacheCon NA 2017, which
    will probably be held somewhere in the Eastern United States. I
    expect to have further details on this within the next 2 months.

    It is worth remembering that our contract states a period of 5
    years, with the option to cancel at 3 years if either party is
    dissatisfied. That 3 year period ends with the event in Seville.
    Speaking for myself and the President, and expressing the opinions
    of the majority of conference attendees and sponsors, I recommend
    that we continue with this relationship.

       Ross and others complimented Rich on an ApacheCon well done

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]



## Board Issues (overview, more below):

- DLAPiper submitted bill for $16K+, which will be re-billed at $5K/month
instead; however project-requested expenses are significant.

- Couple of significant cases where PMCs are clearly not effectively policing
or noticing mis-uses of their brand.

## Operations:

Wide variety of questions as well as some good discussions on trademarks@
about a few of the issues.  Still hoping for some substantive comments on the
self-help/reporting guidelines as well as the brand usage guidelines.

http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/templates/
http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/guide

Added Mark Thomas to the Brand Management President's committee.

Spoke and/or led sessions on branding issues and Apache project branding
policies & tips at ApacheCon, Community Leadership Summit, and at OSCON. 
Feedback was positive; it's clear the larger ecosystem of FOSS developers
still needs a lot of education on trademark issues.  Have been requested to
give similar talks at two future conferences.

## Registrations:

After a quiet period, counsel took action on a number of registration
applications, as well as responded on our behalf to several office actions and
other registration issues with our applications as well as two competing
registration applications from a third party.  This was great to move through
some of our backlog of requests; however it also resulted in many hours of
work (which are billed at a discount).

Have a couple more projects requesting registration in US and elsewhere that
are still to be processed.

## Issue - Budgeting:

With the number of projects requesting registrations - both in the US and in
selected international cases - and the number of office actions or other legal
conflicts, counsel presented a $16K bill for the past month.  Our agreement
specifies a monthly limit, however the full (discounted!) amount will still be
carried forward.

Given the interest from projects requesting registration once they understand
the value, I expect proportionally more projects over the next year will be
requesting registrations.  This is hard to predict how quickly it will build,
but will clearly be significantly more expense this coming FY than was
actually spent last FY.  The main drivers are 1) more projects being making
request, and 2) the new fee discount (instead of pro bono) that we have with

## Issue - PMC Policing / Independence:

While the self-help guides and process for policing project marks are much
improved, recent events show that the ability or even apparent interest by
PMCs to actually police their marks varies widely.  The fact that we have a
number of very "hot" projects these days while still seeing a relatively low
number of potential infringement issues coming to trademarks@ tends to point
to the fact that most PMCs aren't as active at reviewing third party use of
their brand(s) as expected.

We have what is becoming a very clear and detailed guide - but not nearly
enough PMCs or committers are actually following it.  Unless we can get
communities engaged in this work, we should expect to see more issues like the
two notable project questions that came up recently.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising continues to operate normally.

This month we got a new Gold sponsor [1], thanks to Greg who made the liaison.
We also got a few Bronze sponsors [2]. The Sponsorship page was update to
reflect a change we implemented last summer. More details were provided on the
mailing list.

Jim and Hadrian attended ApacheCon. I got a few leads that I believe will
result in a few more sponsors joining soon. I know that Rich talked to a few
of the same ones as well, thanks Rich.

I didn't see the Treasurer report, but given this month activity we should be
doing well.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we begin the new fiscal year with no outstanding invoices
due.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally Khudairi is
working on the second ASF Annual Report, which will be issued the end
of May. She has been working with 9 organizations over the past month
regarding proper attribution and process on formal press releases
(from new sponsorship announcements to celebratory project
milestones). Sally led two media/analyst training sessions at
ApacheCon, which were very well received by the participants, and will
be increasing her work with Incubating projects in particular to get
up to speed on Project communications best practices.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe: 

- 25 April 2016 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
Apex™ as a Top-Level Project


IV. Informal Announcements: 6 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 90 weekly summaries published to date. 34 items were Tweeted on
@TheASF. No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel,
however, Rich Bowen has been granted publishing credentials to
showcase presentations from the Apache: Big Data and ApacheCon events.

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for
more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution. 

VI. Media Relations: the number of vendors that Sally is counseling
regarding their involvement with various Apache projects continues to
steadily grow. Over the past month, the ASF received 1,923 press clips
vs. last month's clip count of 662.

VII. Analyst Relations: Special thanks to Stephen O'Grady of RedMonk
who served as our analyst during the trainings, and provided excellent
insight/advice to the Apache community in his ApacheCon keynote.
Apache was mentioned in 24 reports by Gartner, 15 reports by
Forrester, 12 reports by 451 Research, and 13 reports by IDC. Sally is
exploring ways we can deeper our relationships with additional analyst
firms, particularly those who are on our dedicated media/analyst
outreach list but aren't contacting us directly when researching
specific solutions/sectors/technologies.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally will resume work with Melissa Warnkin
next month regarding promotional items needed for Seville.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no formal
activities are taking place at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 44 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Operations Action Items: 
========================   

Staffing
-------------

Our staff is down by roughly 36% currently. That has impacted SLAs, 
particularly those around response times to tickets. 
Staff members have been interviewing a potential new hire. 


Short Term Priorities: 
======================   

Code signing
-------------------

After initial plans to discontinue this service due to high cost. 
we were able to succesfully negotiate a satisfactory contract 
with Symantec. 

Jira Spam
-------------------------

Our Jira service was again under attack this month. Starting on Tuesday
morning sometime and continuing through to Thursday lunchtime. We have
had to yet again restrict the 'jira-users' group from creating and
commenting on issues. Regular contributors/committers to projects are
still able to create and comment on tickets for projects in which they
are named in 'roles' Most committers can not yet create INFRA tickets or
tickets for other projects in which they are not in a role.

The Infra team have banned over 60 IP addresses via fail2ban triggers.
Nearly 2000 Spam tickets were created over multiple projects. Over 160
user accounts were either deleted or disabled.

We have in place automatic ban triggers for more than one account
created using the same IP address in an hour.

At this moment the restrictions are still in place whilst Infra works
out future options.

Modules created for crowd testing (in progress)

MATT/Github
-------------------
Following a sucessful (quiet) month of having both Whimsy and Traffic
Server using the git-dual system, Infrastructure is contemplating adding
more projects to the experiment, in part to test out different aspects
of the experiment that may not be fully utilized by the current
projects, and in part to increase the load on the service to see if
anything breaks when we start hitting rate limits. Infra is at present
considering adding the Beam incubator project to the test, which would
let us experiment with extremely large groups of people (universal
commit bit etc).

lists.apache.org
----------------------
At ApacheCon - we unveiled the new service https://lists.apache.org -
this service is built to replace both mail-archives.apache.org, and
mail-search.apache.org. See more details below. 

Long Range Priorities: 
======================   

Monitoring
---------------

No material updates here due to staffing issues.

Automation
-----------------

No material updates here due to staffing issues.

Technical Debt
-----------------------
We've taken the first major step in retiring mail-search and
mail-archives. The former is particularly important in our paydown of
technical debt as it currently runs on hardware that is 8 years old and
reduces the number of operating systems that we are forced to manage. To
boot, much of the mail-search platform is undocumented and the current
Infra staff have little knowledge on how to operate those services.


General Activity: 
=================   
Staffing issues has made this month a bit more mechanical than normal. 


Uptime Statistics: 
==================

For detailed statistics, see http://status.apache.org/sla/

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Nick Burch]

ApacheCon and Apache Big Data was held last week in Vancouver, and was
arguably our best event yet. We accepted 15 people, plus 4 further who we
supported but the LF paid for, and had 16 attend. (The very compressed
timeline from LF speaker notification to event meant anyone refused a visa
didn't have time to appeal)

Surveys are going out this week, and after that we'll ask for interviews to
populate the TAC Stories <http://www.apache.org/travel/stories/> site.

Final costings aren't in yet, and there's some "fun" reconciliation between us
and the LF (over the speakers we funded for them VS the reg fees and the room
they adopted after visa refusals), but it looks like we're coming in a few k
under the increased budget. We should know that by the next meeting.

Discussions between committee members, and between Nick and Ross, were held in
Vancouver. Notes were taken, and will be circulated to the list just as soon
as they're reformatted into something readable...! Some webapp enhancements
will be needed, and the scheduling app needs tweaking to make loading easier.
In addition, the questions and scoring will want some changes for Seville,
though it may be that post-debate they don't prove too major

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Conor MacNeill]

Apache Ant Status Report - May 2016

Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools. It consists
of 4 main projects:

- Ant core and libraries (Antlibs)
- Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
- IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
- EasyAnt - Ant and Ivy toolbox to support build processes

Since my last report was outside the regular reporting schedule and just one
month ago, there is not a lot new to report apart from a major release of the
core Ant project. This report returns Ant to the regular reporting schedule

o Release Status

Core
Ant 1.9.7 was release on April 12th, 2016

Ivy
Ivy 2.4.0 was released on December 26, 2014 Ivy-DE 2.2.0 was released
on November 22, 2013

EasyAnt
The current release is still from the Incubator 0.9-Incubating.

o Committers and PMC

No new committers or PMC members this year.

Jean-Louis Boudart was added to the PMC on Dec 6th, 2013

Stephen Haberman was made a committer on October 12th, 2015

o Community

Mailing list numbers are relatively stable over the last month. Everything 
is healthy but with low activity.

I expect this will probably be my last report as PMC chair as I will ask the
PMC to nominate a new chair after sending in this report.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Brooklyn Project  [Richard Downer]

## Description:
- Apache Brooklyn Project is a software framework for modeling,
  monitoring and managing cloud applications through autonomic
  blueprints.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- We have completed our first release as a top-level project.
- We have taken on our first GSoC student.
- Development continues with a regular turnover of pull requests
  submitted and merged.

## Health report:
- The project continues with a similar level of activity that we have
  seen recently.
- An unsolicited volunteer for a GSoC project has been an exciting
  advance.
- Unfortunately we do not have any talks at ApacheCon NA, owing to
  the majority of our active community being Europe-based. This would
  have been a good opportunity to spread awareness of the project
  which we were unfortunately unable to take advantage of. However we
  have had representation at ApacheCon Europe for the last two years
  and expect this to continue this year.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Jean-Baptiste Onofré and Olivier Lamy, who
  converted their mentor status to committer/PMC member on graduation.

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 11 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Jean-Baptiste Onofré and Olivier Lamy,
  who converted their mentor status to committer/PMC member on
  graduation.

## Releases:

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]


Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications, 
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages 
and tools.

Our last release (v1.4.25) happened on April 4th, 2016.

Development and community activity remains low, with only a handful of 
emails and Jira updates on average every month (due to low activity, 
activity tend to be "bursty" around releases). Our last committer/PMC 
change happened in October 2013.

As reported in March, I (Alex Boisvert) have been thinking about stepping
down as PMC Chair for the Buildr project.  Following discussion, we have 
determined Peter Donald is the best candidate replacement, being the most 
active & sustained committer for the last few years.   Next step is to 
vote on this and send the board a resolution.

Otherwise, we have no issues that require board attention


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Jonathan Ellis]

Cassandra is a distributed database providing massive scalability,
high performance, and high availability.

Releases:

3.6       13 May 2016 (Expected)
3.0.6     13 May 2016 (Expected)
2.2.6     26 Apr 2016
2.1.14    26 Apr 2016
3.5       13 Apr 2016
3.0.5     11 Apr 2016
3.4       8 Mar 2016
3.0.4     8 Mar 2016

Development:

Cassandra has moved to a monthly release schedule, with even releases
(3.4) including new features, and odd releases (3.5) only bug fixes.

3.4 includes the new SASI feature (SSTable-Attached Secondary Indexes).
Unlike Cassandra's older indexes, SASI are btree-based, allowing range
scans and full-text indexing.

3.6, whose vote is in progress as of this writing, adds support for
much larger partitions, which makes it easier to build Cassandra data
models where the "natural" partitioning would generate millions of
rows per partition.

Community:

The NGCC (Next Generation Cassandra Conference), for Cassandra
committers and contributors, was moved to June to avoid conflict with
ApacheCon NA.  ApacheCon saw five talks on Cassandra from five
different companies, anchoring the NoSQL category.

Cassandra passed MS Access to take the #7 spot on DB-Engines' database
popularity ranking [1].  Of course, the two systems are not remotely
comparable, but this is a positive sign for adoption.

Committers Yuki Morishita and Jake Luciani have experimented with
teaching workshops on contributing to Apache Cassandra at two
different companies in an effort to accellerate the pool of
contributors and committers.  So far, this has resulted in some small
patches from engineers at Yahoo Japan; we hope to see more from them
soon.

Kaide Mu's proposal to add an sstable downgrade tool was accepted for
Google Summer of Code, under mentors Paulo Motta and Yuki Morishita.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2012-07-06

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2012-07-06

General status:
  The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14

  Since then there have been some changes, but it will need someone to
  initiate the release process.

  There has not been anyone with sustained activity to be considered as a
  potential new committer/PMC member. However there are some people on the
  dev list that resurface occasionally, so they could be encouraged. There
  are also some regulars on the users list that could be encouraged.

  There was some activity on the users mail list. Two major topics, which
  did have users helping each other, and one PMC member assisting. A user
  notified about a look-alike Cocoon logo. We followed up on the private
  mail list.

  There was only a little activity on the dev mail list.

  About ten PMC members were present during the quarter. This confirms
  that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to potentially
  be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors. However it
  is a little worrying that no-one responded to this draft report.

  The Cocoon chair seems to be not available for this report.

Progress of the project:
  A committer added some features to 2.1 regarding XMLResourceBundles
  and i18n.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich Stärk]

## Description: 
The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects
  
## Issues: 
No issues require board attention at the moment.
  
## Activity: 
The ASF has been accepted again as an organisation for Google Summer of Code
2016. We received numerous applications from students from which we accepted
49. This year Google made significant changes to their rating and student
management system which required us to come up with new workflows compared to
the old system.

The Community Development Project is now home to the code behind
helpwanted.apache.org. Helpwanted is a system that allows projects to record
areas for contributions and make them easily available to newcomers by
providing a list to browse through by certain criteria or include them as a
widget on their project website. Kudos to Daniel Gruno for yet another great
tool!
  
## PMC changes: 
The PMC currently features 21 members. There were no additions in the past 3
months. The last addition has been Roman Shaposhnik on 2015-08-26.

## Releases: 
None.
  
## Mailing list activity: 
A lot of discussion around guiding newcomers, ApacheCon and general
community-related discussions are happening on dev@ with both subscriber count
and number of messages up in the past months indicating a healthy discourse
and relevance of the list.

GSoC-related discussions are happening on mentors@ with number of messages
fluctuating with GSoC phase.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------
Since the last report, email and commit activity continues to move
along slowly.  There has been not much other activity.

The .12 release is still in limbo.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Community
---------
The last committer was elected in August, 2012. In September 2013
Phil Ottlinger was elected to join the PMC.


Releases
--------
Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was
released in September, 2013.

Community Objectives
--------------------
Release RAT 0.12 
Find more committers

Attachment T: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Thomas Andraschko]

## Description:

   Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
   (Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
   which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
   which are missing in the CDI core spec.

   DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
   Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

   DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like
   Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly,
   Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also on
   simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
   with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.
  
## Issues:

   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity:

   We receive contributions from the community on a regular basis.

   In 1.6.0 we added new concurrency features (@Locked, @Throttled,
   @Futureable) and the ability to add interceptors via @EnableInterceptors
   to CDI producers, which is not available in the CDI specification yet.

   We are currently voting on a new PMC member, a new commiter and plan that
   DeltaSpike 2.0 will target CDI 2.0 / Java EE 8 only. DeltaSpike 1.x will
   continue to support both Java EE 6 and Java EE 7.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Drill Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description: 
- A distributed SQL MPP for Hadoop and NoSQL

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
- Since the last board report, Drill has released versions 1.5 and 1.6. 
- These releases saw a continued focus on stability, reliability and
  performance.
- There have been good discussions on the mailing list around items including
  backwards compatibility, performance improvements and technical debt.
- There has been good initial discussions around key development foci for
  Drill 2.0.
- We've seen a nice uptick in discussions about implementing new workload
  management capabilities. A nice attribute of this is combined discussion 
  that includes both long-time and newer contributors.


## Health report: 
- New user engagement and adoption is on the rise. We've seen new
  interactions from a large number of different users across a wide range of
  use cases. 
- The developer community has seen a small growth in the number of people
  providing new code contributions. 
- The community continues to find new ways to make development and code
  contribution easier. Recently a powerful new unit testing framework should
  allow easier development of unit tests for new contributors.

  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  potential new committer/PMC member.

  No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

  There was some tiny activity on the dev mail list, with one PMC member
  participating: A question was asked by a new developer, and answered with
  encouragement to pursue their proposed solution and to send a patch.

  Two PMC members were present during the quarter.

  At this report, five other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description:
The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory
data model and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting
to column stores, key value stores, document stores and RDBMSs,
and analyzing the data with extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce
support.

datastores for CouchDB and dynamic support for Cache Providers using
JCache respectively. We are looking forward to a good summer.

## Health report:
Activity remains on the dev@ mailing list with user@ being virtually
unused. A number of bugs have been identified over in projects
which consume Gora and fixes have been posted to thw Gora Jira
and committed to master branch. We will be looking at releasing
0.7 fairly soon once the remaining bugs have been ironed out.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description: 

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.
  
## Issues: 

For the previous report, I forgot to bring to the attention of the board the
problems regarding the groovy-lang.org domain name. A first step to improve
the situation is to transfer the domain to the ASF. I've just created a new
INFRA ticket to start the process here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-11843 Cédric will also be opening
up the discussion on the problems we have with our release process and the ASF
infrastructure, which is also related to our problems with the domain name.
  
## Activity: 

After a few months without releases, we managed to release version 2.4.6. It's
not yet the ideal automated process that we would like though, so we still
need to work on that, but we're happy to have been able to 
make our users happy with this new release.

## Health report: 

Our mailing-list have seen more traffic on the users list to interact with 
our users, but the traffic for the development discussion has decreased. But
nothing to worry about, pretty steady numbers.

Since the beginning of the year, Groovy has been in the TIOBE programming
language index in the top 20 most popular languages. This month of May, Groovy
is ranked 17th most popular language.

The @ApacheGroovy twitter account that we had created is now reaching 1475
followers, which is nice for a recent account.

Upcoming Groovy dedicated conferences are lining up:

- GR8Conf Europe in June
- GR8Conf US in July
- G3 Summit in December (new conference)

Guacamole

Guacamole is an enterprise-grade, protocol-agnostic, remote desktop gateway.
Combined with cloud hosting, Guacamole provides an excellent alternative to
traditional desktops. Guacamole aims to make cloud-hosted desktop access
preferable to traditional, local access.

Guacamole has been incubating since 2016-02-10.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Finalizing the move to Apache infrastructure
 2. Making the first Guacamole release under the Apache Incubator
 3. Accepting additional committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 The PPMC has had difficulty fully engaging mentors to finish the
 migration of Apache Guacamole to Apache infrastructure and processes.
 Though the project has successfully moved to Apache-hosted git
 repositories, the processes for importing our existing JIRA issues and
 adding our first non-founding committer (Frode Langelo) were stagnated
 until very recently.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 While our community of users continues to grow, this is mainly the
 established pattern of growth that existed prior to acceptance in the
 Apache Incubator. We are expecting this to change once the Apache
 Guacamole website is up, public announcement of the move to the
 Incubator is made, and users of the old SourceForge forums are
 directed to the mailing lists.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 The project has accepted its first committer outside the original
 founding developers, Frode Langelo, and development has moved onto
 Apache-hosted git repositories. Development of new Apache Guacamole
 website is nearing completion.

Date of last release:

 2015-12-18 (0.9.9, prior to Apache Incubator)

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

 The most recent committer, Frode Langelo, was accepted into the
 project by VOTE on 2016-04-03, with the required ICLA received on
 2016-04-05.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

 Jean-Baptiste Onofre (jbonofre):
 
   Frode's account should be OK now. For the Jira, the difficulty was that
   the project wanted to import existing Jira content. Not sure it's a good
   idea as bunch of users don't exist in the Apache Jira and there's lot of
   "noise". I would recommend to start by creating the highest priority
   tasks and issues in the Apache Jira.

--------------------

iota

Open source system that enables the orchestration of IoT devices.

iota has been incubating since 2016-01-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Transitioning code, website and Jira issues to the Apache repositories.
 2. Continuing iota website and code development using the Apache
   infrastructure.
 3. Building an iota community via a variety of means including presentations
   at series of conferences beginning with ApacheCon followed by 7x24 Spring
   Conference, Data center Dynamics and others throughout the summer. We will
   work with our mentors to find other means of community building.


Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 This project has been slower to start than we anticipated. Why? Based
 on experience in the field with we questioned the scalability of our
 original architecture. We made the difficult decision that we needed a
 more scalable architecture and we on the design of a baseline
 architecture. WE now feel we have a good starting point and with the
 help of the iota community we can move forward with.

Kudu

Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache Hadoop
ecosystem.

Kudu has been incubating since 2015-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Build a more diverse developer and user community
 2. Migrate our web site under apache.org
 3. Continue to make regular Apache releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 The PPMC invited Binglin Chang as a new committer and PPMC member. Binglin
 has continued to increase his involvement and some of his colleagues are
 now becoming more involved as well.

 Since the last report, we had contributions from several new contributors,
 including five new contributors from outside Cloudera (the initial code
 grantor). Of those, two were substantial pieces of new functionality: a
 new sink to ingest data from Apache Flume, and an improved integration
 with Apache Spark. We hope that the authors of these contributions will
 continue to be involved in the community and grow into committers.

 In March, one of our mentors approached the development community with
 some ideas to make the project more approachable for developers. As a
 result of this, we've been working on a few action items:

 1) We started a project blog and have been posting weekly updates on
    development progress as well as more detailed posts on new features or
    project news.  We've heard from community members that this is an easy
    way to track the project without subscribing to high-volume dev lists.

 2) Our dev@ list is currently very noisy with a lot of code review
    comments.  For more casual contributors this can be overwhelming as
    code review is intermingled with higher level project discussions. The
    community discussed the issue and decided to split the code review
    traffic to a new mailing list (currently awaiting infra to create it)

 3) We've started an informal policy of emailing the dev list with a
    heads-up whenever any new larger feature first shows up on gerrit or
    JIRA, to make it easier for people to give input on large items without
    having to see every bug fix or small improvement. For example, whenever
    design discussion starts on a new feature, the contributor sends a
    'heads-up' email to dev@.

 Development activity continues to be healthy. Mailing list traffic for the
 dev list in April and May was similar to the preceding months. Patch
 contribution level is also fairly stable (50-80 commits/month) with lulls
 around releases as people focus on release testing, documentation, etc.

 User mailing list traffic is steadily increasing in quantity and
 diversity: 108 messages in April vs 51 in March, 40 in Feb. April saw 26
 distinct people contribute to the user list discussion vs 15 in Feb.
 Website traffic also indicates growing interest, with April having 30%
 more traffic than Feb.

 In the last two months, Kudu-related talks were delivered in San
 Francisco, San Jose, Beijing, Boston, DC, Detroit, London, and Dublin.
 More talks are scheduled for the upcoming months at ApacheCon Big Data,
 Strata/Hadoop World, Berlin Buzzwords, and various local meetups.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Since the last report, we've accomplished the following milestones:

 - We released Apache Kudu 0.7.1-incubating on 3/9/2016 to fix a few issues
   found in the 0.7.0 release.
 - We released Apache Kudu 0.8.0-incubating on 4/10/2016 with various new
   features and improvements.

Date of last release:

 April 10, 2016: Apache Kudu 0.8.0-incubating

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

 - Binglin Chang was added as a committer and PPMC member on April 4, 2016.

Mnemonic is a Java based non-volatile memory library for in-place structured
data processing and computing.

Mnemonic has been incubating since 2016-03-03. Mnemonic code was moved into
ASF on 3/24.

Various metrics for April are as follows:

 +--------------------------------------------+
 |   Metric                         | counts  |
 +--------------------------------------------+
 | Non Merge Commits                |  16     |

 | Pull Requests merged             |   6     |
 | Pull Requests proposed           |   7     |
 +--------------------------------------------+

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Apache releases: we are preparing 0.1.0 release
 2. Expand and build strong community, keep active dev list discussions,
    adding new contributors
    a. Mnemonic website is up: http://mnemonic.incubator.apache.org/
    b. Mnemonic cwiki is up:
       https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MNEMONIC/Apache+Mnemonic+Ho
         me
 3. Develop new features: We are working in Native computing layer design.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 Everything is on track, nothing urgent at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 1. We completed setting up infrastructure. Both project website and cwiki
    are up running. We are working on adding contents and documentation to
    the sites so new contributors and community members can get better view
    of what this project is and how to get involved.
 2. We realized, unlike other application level projects, library (or API)
    projects traditionally had less contributors until certain amount of
    adopters successfully integrated those libraries. We plan to help some
    integrations, such as HBase, Arrow, etc. after our first official code
    release.
 3. We submitted 2 proposals for Strata Hadoop World NYC.
 4. We will present Mnemonic project in upcoming ApacheCon Big Data
    conference on 5/11.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 We are designing the native computing infrastructure, built native
 computing interface code.

 In preparing first official release:

 1. Defined coding guidelines for the project. Reformatted all code based
    on defined coding style.
 2. Added the checkstyle to automate the checking process.
 3. Formalized the names of annotations, classes and methods.
 4. Removed the dependency of property mnemonic.core.version.
 5. Added a new profile for artifacts releasing and signing.
 6. Added release plugin and configuration for releasing.

Date of last release:

 No release yet, working on 0.1.0 release

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

 No election, since the project is still in early stage of developing.

 1. Increasing community involvement: We are focusing on getting
    information published on the website to aid the acquisition and
    orientation of new contributors, as well increasing the number of
    committers, in order to reduce individual member workload, reduce
    reliance on any particular member, and to increase project velocity.
 2. Merging the source code from AT&T, JP Morgan and Oracle and creating
    POM's. AT&T and JP Morgan source code has been merged and POM's
    created, it needs uploading into the Apache repository.
 3. Get our first release done.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 There have been multiple slowdowns and votes toward retiring the project.
 Though we have a small team and there has been less than ideal community
 involvement, we have recently increased the number of active members and
 are directing focused efforts towards increasing community involvement.

 We will be checking the status next month to determine whether efforts
 contributed by this new group will be sufficient for recovering the
 project.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 There was talk of retiring, but a group of folks have stepped up and
 expressed interest in helping OpenAZ get off the ground. We are working on
 getting those interested folks voted as committers and getting the website
 running. One new committer has actually been voted in (David Ash).

How has the project developed since the last report?

 We have merged in a port of the administrative portion of AT&T's
 contributed code, which was the last remaining piece of that code base.
 More work needs to be done on this front, but it's a major part of the
 code base and this is a good start toward making it happen.

 We have also merged a fix for configuration and policy files, which
 updated class names and removed duplicate xml declarations from policy
 files.

Date of last release:

Quarks

Apache Quarks is a programming model and micro-kernel style runtime that can
be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling local,
real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming from equipment,
vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of all kinds
(for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in conjunction with
centralized analytic systems, Apache Quarks provides efficient and timely
analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the center to the edge.

Quarks has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
    around Quarks project
 2. Create the first Apache release of Quarks
 3. Complete migration of website to host all content at Apache (javadoc is
    still on Github).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 Nothing jumps to mind.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 We have added a new committer and PPMC member, Cazen Lee.  Cazen started
 making valuable contributions almost immediately when Quarks went into
 incubation. The Quarks community is still small, as Quarks has just
 recently incubated, therefore we aim to continue growing our list in the
 near future.


How has the project developed since the last report?

 * According to JIRA, the project has added 59 new issues in April, and 34
   issues have been resolved.
 * On April 13th, the committers hosted an "Introduction to Quarks" webcast
   where they presented a high-level overview of the project and demonstrated
   how to write, monitor and debug Quarks applications.

Date of last release:

 Quarks is still new, so we haven't created an Apache release as of yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

 In April we added a new committer and PPMC member, Cazen Lee.

Quickstep

Quickstep is a high-performance data processing platform based on a core
relational kernel.

Quickstep has been incubating since 2016-03-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Find, nurture, and collaborate with an expanded cadre of contributors
    from different organizations, electing the most dedicated as additional
    committers.
 2. Demonstrate open collaboration and decision making among contributors,
    committers and the PPMC in The Apache Way
 3. Create one or more usable official releases of Apache Quickstep.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 None.

S2Graph

S2Graph is a distributed and scalable OLTP graph database built on Apache
HBase to support fast traversal of extremely large graphs.

S2Graph has been incubating since 2015-11-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Make a release
 2. Attract users and contributors
 3. Foster more and diverse committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

None

How has the community developed since the last report?

 * There has been concerns about s2graph community, and we have decided
   that committers in the same company will avoid face-to-face discussion
   and start out on the dev mailing list. we opened up 11 discussions on
   the dev mailing list afterwards.
 * There are two new contributors, one is working on packaging and other is
   working on bug fix.
 * We will present about Apache S2Graph in apache-big-data-north-america.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 * We started out the discussion on first release plan and project road map.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Getting more external users
 2. Getting more diverse set of developers
 3. Getting more diverse set of committers/PMC

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 We continue to see regular interaction with users who are trying out
 Apache Slider (incubating). Questions range from introductory "I'm
 trying to do $x" to bug reports "I did $a and encountered an issue $b".
 The committers try their best to keep people involved and steer them
 toward contributions. The strong majority of contributions continue to
 come from existing podling members.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 The IP clearance for the Apache Kafka Slider "app-package" process
 was addressed (after discussion on general@i.a.o) and this codebase was
 merged in. This was a great contribution by a few external developers
 and very much appreciated.

 Work continues on "phase 2" of some long-term work to include support
 for running Docker containers in Slider. The intent behind this work is
 that we will make it easier for (prospective) users to build
 applications that can run on Slider. There is a tentative patch on
 SLIDER-906 and some related documentation updates.

 We have agreed upon a next release (0.91) happening in May, but have
 not made any significant progress towards that release yet.

 We had a discussion put forth about the future of Slider by a podling
 member. At the inception of Slider, Apache Hadoop's YARN was not ready
 to support long-lived services "natively". While Slider has been in
 incubation, YARN has continued to grow towards treating these services
 natively, partly as a result of requirements necessary of Slider to
 work. As such, we discussed whether it would make sense to ask the YARN
 project if they would be interesting in combining efforts, moving the
 core of Slider into YARN itself. The Slider community reacted
 positively, noting that YARN is likely a better long-term home for the
 core of Slider; however, there were a few points raised that would need
 to be addressed before any action was actually taken. The mail discussion
 can be found at https://s.apache.org/3ywX

SystemML

SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at
flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid
runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to distributed
computations running on Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

SystemML has been incubating since 2015-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 - Grow SystemML community: increase mailing list activity,
   increase adoption of SystemML for scalable machine learning, encourage
   data scientists to adopt DML and PyDML algorithm scripts, respond to
   user feedback to ensure SystemML meets the requirements of real-world
   situations, write papers, and present talks about SystemML.
 - Continue to produce releases.
 - Increase the diversity of our project's contributors and committers.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 NONE.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 Our mailing list from February through April had 199 messages involving
 topics such as algorithms, DML functionality, usability, and bug fixes. In
 addition, we have had many discussions on our JIRA site and in pull
 request conversations. Fred Reiss presented at Spark Summit East on
 February 17 about SystemML internals. Berthold Reinwald spoke at the Spark
 Technology Center on March 9 about scalable machine learning with
 SystemML. Niketan Pansare spoke on April 28 at Datapalooza in Austin and
 on April 29 at Rice University about declarative machine learning at scale
 with SystemML. Researchers in Germany are working to add Flink as an
 additional SystemML backend. On GitHub, the project has been starred 267
 times and forked 92 times. We have gained two new contributors since
 February 1st.

How has the project developed since the last report?

TinkerPop has been incubating since 2015-01-16.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 The outstanding issues have been addressed.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 Nothing at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 We have 4 new committers: Ketrina Yim, Pieter Martin, Jean-Baptiste Musso,
 and Michael Pollmeier

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Since the last status report, 172 new JIRA issues have been created and
 126 have been resolved.  Open discussions of the project related
 activities and decisions continue on the TinkerPop dev mailing list.  The
 committer count has been growing and various other TinkerPop community
 members have shown an increased amount of participation on tickets and in
 discussion.  Excellent work is being performed by a variety of folks on a
 consistent basis that has resulted in two releases since the last report.

 Over the past few months, work was performed to stand up a new DataStax
 hosted website, Planet TinkerPop.  This raised concerns in the Apache
 community and it was determined that the best course of action was to
 request that Planet TinkerPop be taken down, and some of the
 vendor-neutral TinkerPop content be donated to TinkerPop for usage on the
 TinkerPop incubator site.  Efforts were made to avoid running afoul of
 Apache guidelines prior to the Planet TinkerPop launch, but the PPMC did
 not have a complete understanding of Apache brand management expectations.
 Over the past weeks, the transition of DataStax donated content to the
 TinkerPop site has been completed.  In the process, the PPMC has received
 guidance and clarification from mentors and the wider Apache community.
 We feel that the Apache TinkerPop site is stronger now than ever and will
 continue to serve as a great vendor neutral resource going forward. The
 lessons learned throughout this process will serve the TinkerPop PPMC well
 going forward.

 Since the last status report, 166 new JIRA issues have been created and
 127 have been resolved.  Open discussions of project related activities
 and decisions continue on the TinkerPop dev mailing list.

Date of last release(s):

 * 2016-04-21 - Apache TinkerPop 3.1.2
 * 2016-04-21 - Apache TinkerPop 3.2.0

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Ralph Goers]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to application logging.

Currently there are no issues which require the board's attention.

- Community

Log4j 2 remains an active project. The overall community is healthy 
and friendly.

Log4cxx is still active in the Incubator. They have been sporadic
discussions regarding performing a release but little real progress
has been made. 
 
In general, all subprojects are still healthy although none has grown 
since the last report.


- Project Branding Requirements

All components except Chainsaw meet the branding requirements.
We will fix the Chainsaw branding with the next release.

- Last three community changes

 * Ralph Goers was voted to be the next Chair on Nov 01 2015
 * Mikael Staldal joined as a Committer on Sep 17 2015
 * Matt Sicker joined as PMC Member on Aug 10 2014 

- Releases

 * Log4j 2.5 (Dec 9, 2015)
 * log4net 1.2.15 (Dec 8 2015)
 * Log4net 1.2.14 (Nov 10 2015)

- Subproject summaries

Log4j 2: Active. Significant work has been done to reduce or eliminate 
the number of objects Log4j creates and in documenting how to use
Log4j in a "garbage free" manner. Significant work has been done in 
documenting the performance of Log4j in various scenarios as well as 
comparing the performance of Log4j against other logging frameworks.

The number of emails on the developer mailing list has doubled in the
last 3 months although the number of subscribers has decreased by 5.

A release is expected within the next month.

Log4net: Active with 2 recent releases

Log4cxx: Active in the Incubator. Discussions on how to perform a release 
are still in progress.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security
policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.4 release on
April 23, 2016.  The next major release is scheduled for August 30, 2016.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Tugba Dogan on September 7, 2015.
The last PMC member was Rafa Haro, voted in on August 31, 2015.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been moderate this quarter.  Issues reported have been
mainly garden-variety bugs.  New contributions have been light, with the
notable exception of an OpenNLP transformation connector. Dev list comments
for this period centered around the ManifoldCF 2.4 release in April, with
occasional user questions.  I am unaware of any mailing list question that
has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012 and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.

A quarter with increasing activity, resuming quite some open developments 
towards what should be 3.4.0 sooner than later. The activity in the users 
mailing list continues increasing, with more new people joining there for 
questions and/or issues reports.

The interested on pushing 3.4.0 out has been resumed https://s.apache.org/d5Ob
Presumably, awaiting for some open issue, we should be able to get the new
release out within the next few weeks. That milestone would open the question 
about having an inflection point, where the project can more forward in many 
technical aspects (Java 8, RDF4J, etc).

Recently we have adapted our public images to the new ASF branding, slightly
renovating the project logo, see:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/marmotta/logo/v2/

Supported by the TAC, Sergio represented the project in the ApacheCon North 
America in Vancouver, giving a speech about the GeoSPARQL support. The talk 
took place in the context of the Geospatial track proposed by OGC for the 
Apache Big Data conference.


Subscribers to the projects mailing list:

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

Apache Oltu Oauth2 module version 1.0.1 was released September 24th 2015.

A vote is currently undergoing in order to release Oauth2 module version 1.0.2

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard. A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014 and some minor
releases are going out regularly for bug fixing. A vote is currently
undergoing in order to release OAuth2 module version 1.0.2 . At the moment we
are working on JSON Web Encryption support ( OLTU-80 - Implement JWE support
for JWT In Progress ).  
Users activity is growing slowly but steadily (the user@ mailing list has got
new messages from new users). We have got quite some feedbacks from users
(included patches). Lately we have been fixing a bunch of users reported
issues
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12314420&ver
sion=12334954) hence the new upcoming release.

COMMUNITY

PMC composition has not changed since graduation We have voted one new
committer Jasha Joachimsthal in January 2015  (31/01/2015)

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Qpid Project  [Robbie Gemmell]

Apache Qpid is a project focused on creating software based on the
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), currently providing a
protocol engine library, message brokers written in C++ and Java, a
message router, and client libraries for C++, Java / JMS, .Net,
Python, Perl and Ruby.

# Releases:

- Qpid Proton 0.12.0 was released on 15th February 2016.
- Qpid JMS 0.8.0 was released on 19th February 2016.
- Qpid Java 6.0.1 was released on 25th February 2016.
- Qpid Proton 0.12.1 was released on 23rd March 2016 in order to address
  CVE-2016-2166 (python binding silently ignored request for 'amqps' if
  SSL/TLS was not supported).
- Qpid JMS 0.9.0 was released on 11th April 2016.
- Qpid Proton 0.12.2 was released on 17th April 2016.
- Qpid Java 6.0.2 was released on 18th April 2016.

# Community:

- We merged the proton@qpid.apache.org mailing list traffic back into the
  dev@ and users@ lists then retired proton@. This was done mainly to make
  things simpler to follow and reduce confusion + duplication, and partly
  because the reasons for it originally being created no longer apply.

- The main user and developer mailing lists remain active. Quarterly stats:
 -- users@qpid.apache.org:
    394 subscribers (up 44), 734 emails (440 previous).
 -- dev@qpid.apache.org:
    192 subscribers (up 7), 2891 emails (2020 previous).

- JIRAs are being raised and addressed:
  397 JIRA tickets were created and 311 resolved in the last 3 months.

- Ganesh Murthy was added as a committer on 29th February 2016.

- Lorenz Quack was added to the PMC on 7th March 2016.

# Development:

- The Qpid Dispatch 0.6.0 release process is under way, with alpha/betas and
  an RC having been proposed for testing. A second RC is due this week
  before progressing to a final release vote.

- The release process for Qpid Proton 0.13.0 is getting under way,
  containing various fixes and further work on the C++ reactive API
  bindings. A beta and RCs will be progressed over the next few weeks.

- A 0.10.0 release of the new AMQP 1.0 JMS client with various bug fixes and
  improvements will be made after Proton 0.13.0 is released.

- Development on the Qpid Java broker and AMQP 0-x client continue toward a
  6.1.0 release, with various fixes also being backported towards doing
  a 6.0.3 patch release.

- Work has been done to reorganize the Qpid C++ and Qpid Python code in
  Subversion to better facilitate independent releases. These reorganised
  bits will now be migrated to Git repositories. After Proton 0.13.0 is
  available, new releases of qpid-cpp and qpid-python will be made.

- The website was moved to a Git repository to ease maintenance by improving
  performance when updating the large content set.

# Issues:

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

## Description: 
  Apache REEF (Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework) is a  library for 
  developing portable applications for cluster resource managers such as 
  Apache Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos.  
 
## Issues:

  We noticed a glitch in the transition from podling to tlp: some of our PMC
  members didn't make it to the TLP's PMC. The seems like a clerical error.
  We plan on addressing it by holding a single vote to move them all to the 
  TLP PMC. Please let us know if we should instead hold individual votes. 
  
    
## Activity:
 
 - The team is hard at work producing the next release, our second as a TLP.
   This release will focus on more cleanups of the .NET code as well as 
   crucial bug fixes our users require.
 - We are hosting a Google Summer of Code student.
 - Apache REEF was presented at ApacheCon Big Data.
 - There was a good discussion on the mailing list about sharpening the one-
   sentence description of REEF. The result of that work is found above :)
 - We now have continuous builds and tests for all our code, Java and .NET.
 
## Health report: 
Overall activity on the project is up:

 - We have 4 more subscribers and about 25% more emails on the dev list than
   in the three months prior to this report.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache River Project  [Patricia Shanahan]

## Description: 
 - Apache River software provides a standards-compliant JINI service. 

## Issues: 
 - As discussed under "Health report", the project does have issues to deal
with, but it also has a functioning PMC to deal with them. 

## Activity: 
 - The main activity is preparing for the next release, currently renamed
2.3.0 

## Health report: 
 - One of the active PMC members has resigned (moved to emeritus list). Given
   the small size of the active core, this is a significant blow, triggering
   discussion of the state and future of the project. 

 - The project has technical issues, including age of code, lack of support
   for use in languages other than Java, lack of support for Android, and
   dependence on Java serialization. 

 - Possibly as a result of the technical issues, there may be a tapering off
   of interest in the project, making it hard to attract new committers and
   PMC members. 

 - Future paths that will be considered by the PMC include carrying on as-is,
   making radical changes possibly in the direction of IoT, or going to the
   attic. We intend to complete at least one more release first. 

## PMC changes: 
 - Currently 13 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Greg Trasuk resigned 
 - Last PMC addition was Bryan Thompson on Sun Aug 30 2015 

## Committer base changes: 

 - Currently 13 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Bryan Thompson at Mon Aug 31 2015 

## Releases: 

 - river-jtsk-2.2.3 was released on Sat Feb 20 2016

This report received +1 votes from PMC members Patricia Shanahan, Tom Hobbs,
Peter Firmstone, and Bryan Thompson.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description:
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - The C++ library remains in maintenance mode, but a Ubuntu packager
   provided a preliminary security review that resulted in some changes. The
   PMC is awaiting any further results from a fuzzing exercise that may
   result in more changes. In addition, solution files for Visual Studio 2014
   have been provided and official support for that compiler is forthcoming.

   On the Java side, a user reported concerns about some backwards
   compatibility issues with recent releases. These issues have been
   substantively fixed and Clirr has been integrated into the project build
   cycle to avoid these kinds of problems cropping up again. A release will
   likely take place next quarter to address these issues.

## Health report:
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC. Right now there are no obvious potential new committers for the
   project.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 6 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Marc Giger on Wed Apr 03 2013

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 16 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
 - Last committer addition was Marc Giger in July 2012

## Releases:

 - Last release was Apache XML Security for Java 2.0.6 on Mon Dec 07 2015

## JIRA activity:

 - 4 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Sentry Project  [Sravya Tirukkovalur]

## Description:
Sentry is a highly modular system for providing fine grained role based 
authorization to both data and metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop Cluster.

## Issues:
No issues at this point. Some guidance might be helpful:
1. Sentry had PPMC = committer as a podling. What can we learn from podlings 
who had committer = PPMC, but changed/retained that model post graduation.
2. We have recently voted and added two committers. The vote mentioned only 
committership, a mention of PMC would have been ideal. We are discussing 
next steps among PMCs. Would the board recommend running the vote for PMC?

## Activity: 
Post graduation: Most of the move done except some exceptions which are in 
progress: INFRA-11496, SENTRY-1211

Preparing for 1.7.0 release: Sentry-1110

Conferences / community outreach:
- Hao and Anne are giving a talk at ApacheCon about Generalized Auth model
- Ashish is giving a talk at ApacheCon about Sentry Kafka integration and 
authz in streaming.

Development: Here are the major buckets
- Test improvements especially around time taken to run.
- Kafka: Enable dist, shell
- Solr: Policy file to db
- V2: Enable dist
- User:role
- Import/export improvements
- Bug fixes
- HA improvements

## Health report:
Activity is good, no notable surges or declines.

## PMC changes:
- Currently 31 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Committer base changes:
 - Currently 33 committers
 - 2 committers added in the reporting month ( Just accepted the invite)

## Releases:
Preparing for the 1.7.0 release: Sentry-1110

## Mailing list activity:
Subscribers to private and security increased as new PMCs (post graduation) 
have subscribed. Traffic to commits has been split into commits and issues 
now. No notable surge or decline in activity otherwise.

 - dev@sentry.apache.org:
    - 81 subscribers (up 1 in the last month):
    - 680 emails sent to list (495 in previous quarter)

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Bert Huijben]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library
   built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the
   default client library of Apache Subversion and Apache OpenOffice.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   The project had three very quiet months. Some time was spent on
   testing recently added features. Some users have requested that we
   should improve the api-user targeted documentation.

## Health report: 
   Activity is at a normal, fairly quiet level.

## PMC & Committer changes: 
   Currently 11 PMC members and 12 committers. Our last new committer was
   added on Wed Sep 02 2015. No PMC additions since the PMC started two
   months ago.

## Releases: 
   No ASF releases yet. Last pre-ASF release 2014-10-20

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   Normal activity.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or other relevant
spatial needs. The SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and
enables the creation of metadata objects which comply with the model of
international standards. The SIS referencing module enable the
construction of geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing such
as axis, projection and coordinate reference system definitions, along
with the associated operations which enable the mathematical conversion
of coordinates between different systems of reference.


## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

  * Finished to port all the core parts of "sis-referencing" module. The
    remaining parts to port can be seen as extensions.
  * Trunk is ready for release candidate of Apache SIS 0.7 after we
    resolve where to store a dependency (the EPSG dataset).
  * Commit rights given to one new developer (Johann Sorel). He started
    work on the next steps after "sis-referencing". Johann works in the
    same company than the SIS chair.
  * A Vietnamese student will work this summer in a Google Summer of
    Code project, in collaboration with the Vietnamese space agency
    VNSC. This is part of the effort for expanding the community.
  * We had a presentation at the ApacheConf BigData conference in
    Vancouver as part of the "Geospatial track". Attendance was about
    10~15 people in the room.
  * The "Geospatial track" at ApacheCon was followed by a meeting of
    about 10 peoples doing some geospatial activity in their project.
    There were discussions about how to increase collaboration between
    those projects (e.g. through open standards) and increase awareness
    of geospatial issues (i.e. making a software geospatial-enabled is
    not just adding a latitude and a longitude column in a database).
    This geospatial track and meeting happened thanks to the Open
    Geospatial Consortium representative (Georges Parcivall).
  * No progress on the Apache SIS developer guide.


## Health report:

The project is reported as healthy by the report helper. We are trying
to use GSoC as a way to expand the community, especially toward people
from different organisations.


## PMC changes:

  * Currently 19 PMC members.
  * No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
  * Last PMC addition was Marc Le Bihan on Wed Dec 10 2014.


## Committer base changes:

  * Currently 21 committers.
  * Johann Sorel was added as a committer on Thu Mar 31 2016. 


## Releases:

  * Apache SIS 0.6 has been released in September 2015.
  * Apache SIS 0.7 ready for release candidate after we decide a
    location for EPSG dataset.


## Mailing list activity:

  * dev@sis.apache.org:
      o 62 subscribers (up 5 in the last 3 months):
      o 52 emails sent to list (101 in previous quarter)
  * user@sis.apache.org: 
      o 42 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
      o 1 emails sent to list (1 in previous quarter)

Discussions are happening only on the developer list. There is currently
few technical debate; many emails are just reports on progress. A slight
increase in activity is happening recently with the GSoC student
starting to ask questions.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It 
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. 

Project status: 

- The community is entering the QA phase for Spark 2.0, our second major
 version since joining Apache. There are a large number of additions in
 2.0, including a higher-level streaming API, improved runtime code
 generation for SQL, and improved export for machine learning models.
 We are also using this release to clean up some experimental APIs,
 remove some dependencies, add support for Scala 2.12. The full list
 of changes is available at http://s.apache.org/spark-2.0-features.

- We released Spark 1.6.1 in March, with bug fixes for the 1.6 branch.
 In general, we have seen fast adoption of Spark 1.6, with many
 organizations adding support right away.
 
- For Apache Spark 2.0, the community decided to move some of the lesser
  used data source connectors for Spark Streaming to a separate ASF
  project, which has been proposed as Apache Bahir. We proposed a new
  project in order to maintain ASF governance of these components.
 
- In the past few weeks, there have been several discussions asking
  for more attention to trademark use from this PMC. Some of the main
  issues were:
  - A vendor offering a "technical preview" package of Apache Spark 2.0
    before there was any official PMC release.
  - A vendor claiming to offer "early access" to the project's roadmap.
  - Multiple vendors offering products were one component is labeled
    "Spark", without this component being an ASF release.
  - Corporate pages were the most prominent mention says "Spark"
    instead of "Apache Spark".
  In response to these issues, we will be reviewing all corporate uses
  of "Spark" on the trademarks list in the coming weeks and working to
  clarify the trademark rules on the project website as well as within
  the PMC and committer community.
 
Latest releases:

Mar 9, 2016: Spark 1.6.1
Jan 4, 2016: Spark 1.6.0
Nov 09, 2015: Spark 1.5.2
Oct 02, 2015: Spark 1.5.1

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Stratos Project  [Lakmal Warusawithana]

## Description: 
   Apache Stratos is a highly-extensible Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) 
   framework that helps run Apache Tomcat, PHP, and MySQL applications and can 
   be extended to support many more environments on all major cloud 
   infrastructures.  
   
## Issues: 
 - No issue for last quarter
   
## Activity: 
 - Last 3 months, there was no significant activities in the project. Started initial
   discussion to reface Stratos to align with new industrial technologies. Discussions
   are in the initial stages. Discussed high-level architecture. No any coding done.
   
## Health report: 
 - Since now Stratos does not having any paid contributors, all PMCs/Committers are 
   seems bit busy with their day jobs. They are still settling with their new day jobs.
   But I am expecting PMC/Committers will start some code development soon. But we can't
   expect development speed which previously had. When Strstos 5.0 development starts
   we can expect some new contributors.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  We have seen a bit of slowdown in dev@ and commit activity, which
  has been expected, given the (prior-reported) change in employments
  and the time our developers have available to work on Subversion.
  But with that said, it has not hampered our development. The project
  continues to move forward, with good commit activity and discussion
  occurring on our mailing lists. The project is quite active, and has
  been responsive (see below) to some security issues that have arisen
  over the past few months.
  
  The users@ mailing list remains active, with about 100 messages per
  month from users and our community assisting them.

  Last PMC addition: December 2015.
  Last committer addition: November 2015.
  As a mature project, we are not attracting lots of new people, yet
  (as always) we maintain an open/inviting atmosphere.

* Releases

  On April 28, two releases were made: 1.9.4 and 1.8.16. These were
  primarily to address CVE-2016-2167 and CVE-2016-2168.
  
  The 1.9.x line is our "current stable" release, and 1.8.x is our
  maintenance line receiving security and critical bug fixes.
  
  The community is developing 1.10.x, but has no specific timeline or
  feature set (yet) defined.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiriccò]

## Description:
      Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities
      in enterprise environments.

## Issues:
      There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

      The activity level on dev@ and user@ keeps growing slowly, with new
      subscribers.
      We are still in the process of finalizing 2.0: M2 was released in this
      quarter, M3 will be probably required before 2.0.0.

      About the ongoing work, besides other fixes and improvements, we have
      recently received the contribution of admin console UI translation in
      Russian thanks to Dmitry Berezkin, which we also decided to report as
      contributor in the team list website page. We are keeping an eye on
      Dmitry  to check if his support (about Russian translation, but also
      other aspects) will stay and possibly increment, in order to consider him
      for committership.

      We have been involved for the first time ever in the Google Summer of
      Code, with two projects accepted: we need to take this as an opportunity
      to enlarge our developers community.

      About the Syncope PoC with infra, we are currently on hold waiting for
      the availability of a "playground zone" - see previous board report's
      comments and INFRA-10931 for details.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
 Tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information lookup
 activities

## Issues:
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

  Last month's question as to whether Whimsy reporting should remain
  monthly or go back to quarterly went unanswered; Mark's input was that
  after this month Whimsy should go back to quarterly; Brett kept the
  line indicating that Whimsy is on a monthly schedule in committee-info.txt.

## GitHub experiment:
 - No issues to report

## Activity:
 - Due to persistent networking problems in PNAP; a new vm has been provisioned
   for whimsy.  Cut over to the new VM should happen by the end of the month.
 - Shane noticed that the Whimsy repository didn't have a proper licence
   file in place, a particularly embarrassing oversight given the high
   powered makeup of the PMC.

## Health report:
 - We now have an additional person who has made commits; this time
   to the board agenda tool.  This continues the progress being made
   to build a community around what was once the product of a development
   team of one.

## PMC changes:

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]
The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries.

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release that integrates
Xerces-C.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature product.  There is little development activity other
than patch maintenance.  Most of the activity is in the Xalan-J subproject.
There are some participants reporting on their build and deployment issues.

We are still trying to get more participants to report on their integration
build attempts.  Work is continuing to perform integration builds using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 through 2015.  Some builds were recently
performed for Solaris against the development SVN tree.  Some build
environment patches have yet to be committed to the code base, but are
documented in JIRA.

Most of the communications traffic is via JIRA. Email list activity has been
stagnant for 3 months.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache XML Graphics Project  [Glenn Adams]

## Description:

 - The Apache XML Graphics Project is responsible for software
   intended for the creation & maintenance of the conversion of XML
   formats to graphical output & related software components.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - With the exception of a minor sub-project (fop-pdf-images), the
   primary subprojects (xmlgraphics-commons, batik, and fop) were
   transitioned from an ANT build process to a MAVEN build
   process. This transition is expected to improve build, test, and
   deployment processes, and, in particular, to improve deployments to
   the Maven Central Repository.

 - With the transition to MAVEN, the primary subproject CI
   configurations on Jenkins have been transitioned to use MAVEN. This
   is expected to improve analytics and reporting of build results.

 - Two security related reports were created against the batik project
   in early March. A fix for one was effected in early March and the
   second is presently underway, and should be resolved in the next
   week.

 - A challenge was identified regarding testing of the batik
   subproject.  This project currently uses a non-standard, one-off,
   unmaintained testing framework. It is desired that all batik
   testing be transitioned to JUNIT as is used by the other
   projects. This transition is expected to require a moderately high
   degree of code rewriting. An ancillary problem with the current
   testing is that it performs per-pixel comparison of rendered
   results against reference images. Due to the high degree of
   dependency of this rendering on the JDK implementation, version,
   and local platform, it is likely to require the use of a fair
   number of reference image sets, the management of which will surely
   prove challenging.

## Health:

 - The level of community and developer activity remains at a
   consistent, moderate, level for a relatively mature product.

## PMC:

 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - Simon Steiner was added to the PMC on Tue Jan 19 2016

## Committer:

 - Currently 21 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Matthias Reischenbacher, May 2015

## Releases:

 - XMLGraphics Commons 2.1 was released on Wed Jan 13 2016
 - XMLGraphics FOP 2.1 was released on Wed Jan 13 2016

## Mailing Lists:

 - Slight decrease in number of subscribers.
 - Slight increase in message traffic, except for fop-users@ and
   general@ which showed slight decrease.

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project [Jeff Trawick]

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
  software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
  to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
  which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
  the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
  since 2007.

## Reason for this interim report

  The project did not respond to a vulnerability report from October
  2015 nor did it respond to pings from the security team until this
  week.  The board requested either an out of band report or working with
  the security team on the need to prevent this in the future.  At this
  point in time, the reporter has been contacted and told of the intention
  to improve the code but not to formally mark the issue as a vulnerability,
  and the security team has been made aware of the essence of the rest of
  this report.

## The essence of the problem

  After the reporter's original e-mail there was a small amount of
  discussion, the consensus was that it was not a vulnerability, and there
  was some disagreement on whether certain code should be improved along the
  lines that the reporter suggested, or removed to be more emphatic that APR
  was not promising a certain type of processing in the particular API.

  After one ping from the security team, a flurry of e-mails on the issue
  followed but noone took initiative to propose a summary to send to the
  reporter.  After two more pings from the security team, a PMC member
  proposed a summary to send to the reporter; it was ACKed and sent to
  the reporter cc: security@.  (The summary: not a vulnerability, intention
  to improve the code in the next non-emergency release, contact us again
  if you disagree.)

## Action taken to try to prevent this from happening in the future

  My best guess at the cause of PMC failure is that the lack of severity of
  the issue combined with the fact that a handful of people participated in
  in the e-mail thread led others to believe that the issue was being handled
  -- i.e., most of the PMC did not note the e-mail thread as an issue to
  be concerned with.  Additionally, there was no recognition of the passage
  of time.

  APR had no PMC-level tracking in place to ensure nothing fell through the
  cracks, and no one took enough interest in this particular issue to drive
  it to completion.  I've established a simple tracking mechanism in the APR
  private repository to clearly show the status of outstanding issues.  I
  anticipate that the entire PMC will consider it their shared responsibility
  to ensure that the status of issues is represented there and ignored issues
  raised to the group's attention, even if a relatively small subset is
  working to resolve a particular report.

Attachment BX: Report from the CloudStack Project [Sebastien Goasguen]

## Objective:
   The purpose of this report is to expedite the process of moving the GitHub
   mirror from `apache/cloudstack` to `apachecloudstack/cloudstack` as per the
   details outlined in this report.  We would like to request that the ASF Board
   consider this report and approve the move.  We would also request that the 
   ASF Infra team engage with us and do the actual transfer.

## Description:
   Apache CloudStack (ACS) is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud 
   orchestration platform.  ACS manages many types of hypervisors, storage and 
   networking devices. Due to the infrastructure complexity, testing and
   validating ACS is a time consuming and costly endeavor.  Our community is 
   willing to share the labor and costs associated with building distributed and
   automated testing environments, but we are facing many challenges with the
   available automation integration points.

## Issue:
   Apache CloudStack has been making extensive use of GitHub pull requests and
   they have become integral in the development workflow in our community.  The
   ACS GitHub repository is a mirror of the ASF repository, which is used as the
   source of truth for the project code and only committers can contribute to
   the ASF repository.  Currently the ACS GitHub repository is under the
   `apache` GitHub organization.  Unfortunately, due to the lack of permissions 
   on specific repositories inside a GitHub organization, no changes can be made
   to a single repository without being applied to all repositories under that
   organization.  This has become a problem for our project because we do not 
   have access to features such as being able to Label pull requests or add
   post commit hooks in order to kick off Continuous Integration runs when a
   branch changes, to give a couple examples.

   The ACS PMC has proposed and voted on a resolution to move the ACS GitHub
   mirror out of the `apache` GitHub organization and into the
   `apachecloudstack` GitHub organization.  The commit workflow will not change
   and the ASF git repository will remain the source of truth for the project.
   Both the ASF Infra team and members of the ACS PMC will have ownership rights 
   on the `apachecloudstack` GitHub organization.

   There are many motivating factors for this change, a few of which are briefly
   outlined in the following list:
   - The Release Management of the ACS project has been a daunting task due to
     a highly manual process, with very few hooks for support from the greater
     community or through automation.  The RM task is currently a full time job,
     making it difficult to find individuals willing to step up to the RM role.
     This has had a negative impact on our project because periods of time
     without a RM gives the impression that the project is stagnant.
   - The ability to use GitHub Labels will make a huge difference for our
     project by enabling the greater community to help manage the status of
     different pull requests and let the release manager focus more on the PRs 
     that are ready.
   - Being able to use the GitHub Status features on pull requests will help us
     better integrate the results from distributed CI runs into the workflow.
   - Being able to setup GitHub Hooks such as the `post-commit-hook` will enable
     us to better automate the distributed hardware CI integrations provided by
     different community members, ensuring the code quality is maintained.
   - The ability to close PRs that are no longer relevant without having to
     track down the author to have them do it will help a lot in making sure the
     PRs that are open are valid.

   This is not an exhaustive list, but a few items which will make a huge impact
   on the sustainability of our project.

   In addition to the details outlined above, moving the GitHub `cloudstack`
   repository to the `apachecloudstack` GitHub organization, enables us to
   consolidate all of the different cloudstack related projects into a single
   organization.  This will enable the community to better organize itself and 
   the maintain the other projects or documentation directly related to ACS.

   Here is an incomplete list of projects currently being maintained
   independently which we would like to move into the `apachecloudstack` GitHub
   organization once we have moved the `cloudstack` repository:
   - cloudstack-cloudmonkey
   - cloudstack-www
   - cloudstack-docs
   - cloudstack-docs-install
   - cloudstack-docs-rn
   - cloudstack-docs-admin
   - cloudstack-ec2stack
   - cloudstack-gcsstack

## Progress:
   This initiative has been slowly moving forward over the past few months.
   Here is a breakdown of our current status:
   - All parties are in agreement with the decision to make the move [1][2][3].
   - I have talked to GitHub support about getting the `mirror` setup after the 
     move.  They said that a user who has admin access to both organizations can
     email them after the transfer and they will setup the mirror for us.
   - I have setup the `apachecloudstack` GitHub organization.
   - I have added Sam Ruby, Chris Mattmann and David Nalley (as well as some PMC
     members) as owners of the `apachecloudstack` GitHub organization.

## Next Steps:
   We are now at the final steps to get this done.  Here are the remaining tasks
   in order to move this forward.
   - Get a list of the ASF Infra members who should be added to the
     `apachecloudstack` GitHub organization as owners.
   - Do the transfer of the `cloudstack` GitHub repository from the `apache`
     GitHub organization to the `apachecloudstack` GitHub organization.
   - Contact GitHub support to update the mirror so the repository at
     `apachecloudstack/cloudstack` is a mirror of the source of truth ASF git
     repository.

Please feel free to reach out to us on the private@ mailing list if you have any
questions or to work out any other final logistics.
