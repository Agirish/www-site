 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The focus over the last month has been on preparations for the Annual
       Members Meeting. I'm pleased to report that we have a healthy number
       of nominations for new members, as well as candidates for the board.
       Thanks to those who have helped with the agenda resolutions, and the
       preparation of the new voting tool!

       I am currently working with Sally on a write up for the upcoming
       anniversary of the ASF.

       As this is the last meeting of this particular board, I'd like to
       express much gratitude to all of the directors for the time and
       service they've dedicated to the ASF over the last year.

    B. President [Ross]

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       Infrastructure has consumed most of my time over the last month.

       Tony Stevenson has left our infrastructure ranks as a paid contractor
       but remains as a volunteer. We wish him well in his new role.

       This departure was not unexpected and David had previously
       over-staffed in preparation. However, the team is now understaffed.
       I've commenced an informal search and have a candidate to consider
       (though this candidate did not come from my own search). I'll sync
       with David on how to coordinate filling this role once we have decided
       on the longer term strategy (see below).

       Two projects (that I know of) have requested to join the Git
       experiment. The infrastructure team are not yet confident enough to
       extend this experiment, though good progress is being made. It would
       be useful to have feedback from the board as to whether they see this
       as a priority given the potential community impact.

       The team have defined a JIRA SLA, the (tentative goal) is to have 90%
       of new tickets resolved within the time specified in
       https://status.apache.org/sla/jira/primer.html, current performance
       metrics can be found at https://status.apache.org/sla/jira

       Work has progressed well with respect to restructuring the VP Infra
       role. As discussed last month the current plan is to create a new
       Infrastructure Lead role who will be responsible for the day to day
       operations of the infrastructure team, as discussed on the board@ list
       this month I have added the responsibility to ensure infrastructure
       is, wherever reasonable, responsive to and inclusive of community
       self-serve activities. As a reminder, responsibilities are split as
       follows (delegation is encouraged, this is just where the buck
       stops)...

       President with vendor or staff support
       * Manage infra staff with respect to performance and work environment
       * Negotiate contract renewals with infra contractors/staff
       * Recruit infra staff as needed

       VP Infra with vendor and staff support
       * Approve infra purchasing decisions, including contract negotiation and
         renewal with suppliers
       * Ratify medium- to long-term strategy, along with SLA metrics, for ASF Infra
         services in response to community demands (Critical, Core and Standard
         services)
       * Identify and prioritize community engagement with infrastructure services
         through a clearly defined and document self-service program
       * Set or advise on appropriate ASF policy as requested
       * Enforce ASF Policies
       * Be the voice of the infra team for the ASF President and thus the Board and
         our Members (e.g. board reports)

       Infra Lead (paid, also assists with all items under staff below)
       * Set and manage annual infra budgets
       * Identify suppliers, contract negotiation and renewal
       * Coordinate staff and community input to medium- to long-term strategy, along
         with SLA metrics, for ASF Infra services in response to community demands
         (Critical, Core and Standard services)
       * Identify and prioritize community engagement with infrastructure services
         through a clearly defined and document self-service program
       * Encourage collaboration between projects who are self-managing the
         same/similar services

       Staff/Contractors (including Lead)
       * Implement the defined strategy for ASF Infra (Critical, Core and Standard
         services
       * Track against SLA targets and report at https://status.apache.org/sla
       * Allocate resources (people's time) to ensure tickets are dealt with in a
         timely way in addition to completing assigned project word
       * Balance job assignments and project schedules to ensure the necessary work
         is completed while fun new stuff is progressed
       * Ensure projects are either provided with everything they need as a service,
         or (wherever possible) are provided compute resources to self-host
       * Support community self-service efforts wherever Infra Lead or VP Infra agree
         there is sufficient benefit in doing so
       * Monitor project adherence to appropriate ASF policies (e.g. release
         management, version control, service use), addressing issues of concern and
         escalating to the appropriate officer wherever necessary

       Given the increasing formality and emphasis on performance I recommend
       we create an annual merit reward system and bonus scheme for all infra
       staff and contractors. At present there is little motivation for
       individual contractors to perform "above and beyond" and while I don't
       mean to imply any of our contractors are not performing well I would
       like to reflect our increasing emphasis on SLAs and customer
       satisfaction with a means to reward those who choose to go beyond what
       they are required to do.

       I've spoken with a number of organizations that can assist with the
       items assigned to President. My recommendation is to either 1) extend
       our relationship with Virtual, or 2) hire a lead who is also capable
       of taking on this role. Finding a person suitably qualified for 2) is
       a difficult ask, but it will be a cheaper option. 

       Using virtual will increase our costs by a maximum of $15k per year
       (including recruitment fees, assuming new/replacement one hire per
       year). This would mean that President (potentially delegated to VP
       Infra) will remain responsible for final decisions relating to
       staff/contractors, but the day to day activities informing these
       decisions will be carried out by Virtual under contract.

       We can also use Virtual to assist with contract negotiation (assigned
       to lead) since such skills are not common in people with an operations
       expertise. This would cost around $1,500 per contract negotiation
       should we choose to use these services.

       I have not added a discussion item for this topic, I intend to ask the
       board for approval to take the actions described below. If there is a
       need to discuss these actions I will request that we add a discussion
       item to the agenda during the meeting.

       Recommended actions:

       1) Form a search committee for the Infra lead role 
       2) Spend one month conducting a search and interviewing candidates 
       3) If a candidate capable of taking on the HR role as well as
       operations role is found hire them and delegate all items listed as
       President to that individual, If no such candidate is found but an
       operations lead is found then hire them and extend our agreement with
       Virtual 
       4) Hire appropriate contractors or staff to fill remaining gaps in the infra 
       team

       Note this will increase infra staffing budgets, possibly by a full
       employee plus management fees, since the lead role may become a full
       time role while demands on the existing infra contractors remain at
       the same levels.

       Executive Assistant
       ===============

       EA continues to aid VPs wherever she can. Primary focus this month has
       been TAC with some trademarks and fundraising issues along with the
       regular monthly activities.

       Brand Management
       ===============

       The continued push to have PMCs take ownership of their trademark
       management is going well, though this month an over zealous PMC took
       action without consulting with Trademarks. No harm done, just a little
       wasted time for all involved.

       Fundraising
       =========

       A quiet month for fundraising this month.

       We've identified a number of gaps in our records relating to
       sponsorship renewals. Melissa is working with Virtual to help close
       these gaps.

       Marketing
       ========

       Thank you to everyone providing content for the quarterly report in
       the last month. This was the first month a potential sponsor asked me
       for the latest report ahead of it being published. They informed me
       that they've been monitoring this for three quarters and find the
       information useful.

       All other marketing and publicity activities are "business as usual"

       Travel Assistance
       ==============

       We have a record number of applications this time - 48. This is a
       result of a number of initiatives to raise awareness of our TAC work.
       One such initiative is TAC stories from past recipients:
       http://www.apache.org/travel/stories/

       As a consequence the team would like to request additional budget to
       cover additional attendees. Since ApacheCon is in 2016 we will have an
       underspend of circa $15k in 2015, therefore this request is actually
       for the 2016 budget.

       I've worked with Nick as VP TAC to ensure that any additional TAC
       recipients are selected on a slightly modified criteria. We are still
       using the existing criteria, but selecting others based on how much
       impact the individuals and open source in general are likely to
       benefit from their attendance at ApacheCon. The additional request, in
       addition to the $15k available in 2015, is for a maximum of $15k
       (though the final budget is expected to be closer to $10k). This will
       increase the number of attendees from the currently accepted 9 (using
       available budget) to 15. It is worth noting that if we were to use the
       historic cut-off point in the evaluation we would be accepting 24
       people, in other words, we believe the final selection of recipients
       will see a greater impact on their own engagement in open source and
       thus the open source ecosystem will benefit even more.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        The Treasurer’s Office worked with Virtual to finalize and submit
        our 990 with the CPA. We should be able to post our FY2015 taxes
        online shortly.
        
        The Office is currently working with Virtual to prepare our report
        for the Annual Members meeting coming up.
        
        I would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone as I do not
        plan to stand for Treasurer beyond this Board cycle, whether I am
        elected to serve on the Board or not. I have already worked to
        identify a replacement and I plan on recommending that replacement
        to the next Board. It’s been an honor being the Treasurer for the
        past (almost) 4 years and I appreciate everything I have learned and 
        thank everyone for their positive contributions towards managing the 
        ASF’s finances. Thanks again.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The project to replace missing ICLAs is coming to an end. There are
       now 66 entries in iclas.txt with no ICLA recorded. Half of these have
       no valid forwarding address on file. The next step is for Secretary to
       remove LDAP entries for the committers with no ICLA; and remove
       notinavail entries with no iclas on file. It will be straightforward
       to reinstate privileges for committers who subsequently file ICLAs.

       In February, 90 iclas, two cclas, and one grant were received and
       filed. Two of these were in response to my request to file a missing
       ICLA.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       The schedule has been announced for ApacheCon Core -
       https://s.apache.org/fgNC - and for Apache Big Data -
       https://s.apache.org/rKyd - and registration is open for both
       events. We would like to encourage all projects that have
       content in the events (as well as those that don't) to promote
       the event to their various communities.

       ApacheCon North America will be held in Vancouver, Canada, May
       9-14, 2016, at the Hyatt Regency, Vancouver.

       Projects wishing to have ancillary events (summits, hackathons,
       etc.) at the conference are encouraged to contact me as soon as 
       possible.

       Meanwhile, the Linux Foundation have promised a decision
       regarding ApacheCon Europe by some time this month, so expect
       to hear about that in next month's report.

 8. Discussion Items
 
    A. Self Service and Infrastructure

       An outstanding JIRA issue against the infrastructure "self service"
       application was unilaterally assigned to the Whimsy PMC without
       consultation, and another was initially closed as WONTFIX, triggering a
       larger discussion that ended up on board@.  Included in that discussion
       was a comment by the current VP of Infrastructure that he would be open
       to the infrastructure team "tak(ing) responsibility for Whimsy the
       service", and as a part of that impose a release discipline upon the
       Whimsy PMC.

       Meanwhile, an ASF member legally changed her name.  She and the
       secretary were able to reflect that change in our records and on the
       site without any assistance by paid contractors.  New committers were
       given accounts based on a highly automated process whereby the
       infrastructure staff run scripts that access requests stored as
       structured data in svn.  This data was placed in svn by a tool that was
       originally part of whimsy and essentially jointly owned by the whimsy
       PMC and the infrastructure team.

       This suggests a different division of responsibility:

       1) The infrastructure team (consisting of contractors and volunteers)
          maintain control over master copies of ASF data resources, including
          but not limited to: Subversion, Git, LDAP, and mailing lists.
          Some of these resources may be mirrored (in some cases,
          bidirectionally).

       2) Groups (such as PMCs and the secretarial team) are given access
          control rights to resources that they can manage.  Where this is not
          directly practical for security or other reasons (e.g., the new
          account example above), tools that process authenticated requests
          stored in an open format will be developed and deployed.

       3) Multiple tools ("let a thousand flowers bloom") that make use of
          the access described above may be developed.  One can imagine a
          future where the Perl scripts that PMC chairs use today are phased
          out in favor of Syncope and/or Whimsy.  Or an alternate future where
          a separate VM is provisioned for ssh use by pmc chairs to run these
          scripts.  Decisions made by the infrastructure team to maintain or
          discontinue the current "self serve" (id.apache.org) tool can be
          made either in consultation with, or entirely independent of, those
          made by other PMCs.

       Anti-patterns to watch out for: (1) requiring PMCs to issue JIRA requests
       to select features for their projects, (2) requiring users to use a
       particular user interface to make a request, without providing
       authenticated users access to the underlying data, and (3) tools
       deployed without runbooks or other documentation on how they work.

    Now seems to be an opportune time to discuss how infra can implement
    self-service as a strategy. Sam will work with Ross as infra
    re-tools.

    B. Another month when there appears to have been a number of PMCs that
       didn't report, needed reminders and/or reported late. Not sure of
       the cause, even less sure of the solution. But it seems to be
       an increasing problem...?

       Some stats:
         * https://whimsy.apache.org/board/missing-reports
         * of the 13 missing PMC reports this month; 3 of those PMCs missed
           the previous month (and one of those is heading to the attic);
           additionally 1 was not accepted the previous month
         * 3 PMCs proactively stated that they will be reporting next month

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

ApacheCon and TAC: TAC
* Since the last board report, where TAC only had 14 submitted applications
  and 4 pending, we closed out at 48 applications and 1 pending – a record!  
  Kudos to the TAC Team for the extensive PR coverage and pulling in more
  applications!! This is the highest number of applications to date!!

*Awaiting budget approval from the board for increased budget, but to date
nine acceptance letters have been sent out, and all rejection letters have
been sent out.

*Preparing flight proposals and rooming assignments
*Working on a VERY tight timeline, so everything has to be done very quickly
and efficiently


Quarterly Report
*Melissa completed the missing section from Craig

Fundraising

*There are holes everywhere, we have no accurate records, sponsors are not
getting answers
* Melissa will look at how we can ensure we get clarity on this

Trademarks:
* Tracking of registrations and follow-up items continues


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

A host of personal emergencies and a variety of new, complex issues in the
past month mean that there's a backlog on making improvements to brand how-to
policies and procedures, but looking forward to newfound free time to make
progress shortly.

Created a BRAND private JIRA to track internal tasks and make it easier for
other trademarks committee members to productively review and work on
improvements. 

Unfortunately, a PMC sent a strongly worded infringement letter to a third
party who actually holds a registered trademark to their name locally.  We
were lucky in that this only resulted in the third party having their legal
counsel email us back with a polite "We're not infringing, here's why, please
go away" letter.  I'll need assistance reviewing the existing procedure and
improving it so it's easy to understand when PMCs may directly send
infringement letters, versus when they must work with the Trademarks
Committee. 

A lot of attention was brought to poor third party usage of our HADOOP® name
in places where nary an Apache® can be found.  Dealing with this effectively -
as long experience with some issues with the Hadoop PMC show - requires a much
more detailed naming guideline so that PMCs and third parties alike can have a
specific and dispassionate answer as to how often the Apache must be used
before the project name.  We could use more thoughtful feedback on trademarks@
here.

Several PMC trademark registrations in the US and elsewhere, and a renewal are
outstanding, and will be processed (and billed by our counsel) in the next few
weeks.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========


Finances:
==========


Operations Action Items:
========================


Short Term Priorities:
======================
- Ensuring/monitoring that the dual git repository setup works as intended.
- Provision an isolated test environment (including isolated LDAP) for
  developing/testing services faster than is currently possible, under a
  separate domain (asfplayground.org). We believe this separation will also help
  projects and volunteers work on their ideas, such as the Syncope trial, as
  they can then develop and test without interfering with production systems.
- Looking at deploying Apache Traffic Server to help alleviate the troubled
  BugZilla instances and possibly JIRA.
  

Long Range Priorities:
======================
- Mailing list system switchover is expected to happen in the coming months. We
  are aware of a few outstanding mail-search requests that we have concluded
  could be solved out-of-the-box by this.
- VMs on Eirene, Nyx and Erebus to be moved in readiness for their decommission
- Further explore identity management proposals
- Further explore the MATT experiment (see General Activity)

General Activity:
=================
- Finished the initial design of git-dual.apache.org, intended for distributed
  git repositories (Whimsy experiment). Things have been fully in sync for now.
  Some discoveries and gotchas were made in setting this up, such as split-brain
  issues and canonical source requirements for the setup to sync properly - in
  particular, it seems that the 'origin' setting in each repository must be set
  to GitHub for it to sync properly both ways. There is still the issue of a
  discrepancy between emails for commits pushed to ASF and commits pushed to
  GitHub, but this is being worked on.
- Adding new members to our GitHub organisation has been fully automated and
  tied to LDAP. Any committer setting their githubUsername field through
  id.apache.org will automatically be added as a member of our organisation
  there. We are pleased to say this is/was the final step in fully automating
  the MATT experiment from the committers' side of things. All adding/removing
  of members for github repos is now automated completely, if delayed by a few
  hours due to rate limits (in anticipation of 1000+ repositories, we have
  decided to do slow updates).
- Added JIRA SLA guidelines (as well as a status page on status.apache.org, see
  below)
- We had a bad disk on coeus, our central database server, causing many services
  to be slow while we replaced the disk and resilvered the mirror over the
  weekend.
  

Ticket Response and Resolution Targets:
=======================================
  We have added a new SLA for tickets. We are still tweaking the parameters in
  this SLA, but the preliminary ones have been applied to our new JIRA SLA page,
  where stats for the current reporting cycle can be found at
  https://status.apache.org/sla/jira/?cycle=2016-03
  Tickets created on or after February 23rd are counted towards our new SLA. We
  have a tentative goal of having at least 90% of all tickets fully handled
  (responded to and resolved) in time.
  
  Quick March reporting cycle summary:
    - 178 tickets opened
    - 216 tickets resolved
    - 144 tickets applied towards our SLA (Feb 23rd onwards)
    - Average time till first response: 7 hours
    - Average time till resolution: 17 hours
    - Tickets fully handled in time: 95% (118/124)


Uptime Statistics:
==================
  Nothing out of the ordinary to report here (99.9% across the board). We
  decommissioned the use of minoatur as a web space provider and have moved
  people.apache.org to home.apache.org. This has caused a slight rise in uptime
  for standard services as the old people.apache.org was frequently experiencing
  issues.
  
  BugZilla has seen less abuse than before, possibly because of the measures
  taken previously. We are however exploring utilizing Apache Traffic Server to
  further ensure its future stability.
  
  Once again, the Moin wiki is, as always, experiencing hiccups, caused by the

  cwiki, if they experience slowness in the service.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Nick Burch]

ApacheCon Vancouver
-------------------
Applications closed several days late, after extensions to support late
speaker announcements, and judging has completed. It's going to be a very
tight timeline, but between volunteers and Melissa, we hope it'll still work
fine.

This has been a record event for TAC, I believe our best ever by a fair
margin. In total, we've had 48 Applications! Of those, just under half were
from people speaking in some way, 13 were from students, 26 were from
committers +, 22 were from non committers, and about 10% were from women.

The event dates mean the cost will be met from the 2015-2016 budget, of
which only $15k remains. See the President report for more on our request
for additional funding to cover some additional strong applicants.

As with previous events, details of non-accepted speakers have been passed
to the Linux Foundation, who have a small amount of funding for speakers.
Any accepted that way will be handled by TAC (with us looking after them,
booking flights etc, but also getting them to help!), with the LF paying the
bill.

Budget permitting, we expect a great event from the TAC front.

Changes for next time
---------------------
The big change for Vancouver was the launch of TAC Stories
<http://www.apache.org/travel/stories/>, and the associated related
publicity and targetted messaged. We think this is partly behind the record
applicant numbers.

From our experiences with these publicity changes, we intend to brainstorm
a lot in Vancouver on proposed scoring and question changes. The best ideas
will then be taken back to the list, refined, and taken forward. (The
difference with doing this for publicity, vs previous list-only change
attempts, was dramatic). We'll therefore take the same approach with the
planned scoring and question changes, to try to favour interesting and
impact-ful candidates over those purely ASF-involved, whilst also avoiding
the mis-steps of previous attemps in this area.

We'll also look to capture (find out for past recipients as best we can)
more "impact" data, such as (but not only) people helped who become
committers and members

Committee
---------
No change

Sponsor Relations
-----------------
Anyone talking with sponsors needing an example of where the sponsor cash
made an impact, is strongly suggested to review the TAC Stories and pick one
or two from a suitable background / area to show!

Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

Confirmed with counsel that our bylaws, and our usage and interpretation
regarding majority, are correct and require no change. Specifically,
Section 3.9 of the bylaws tracks the relevant Delaware law (Section 215).
The bylaws take the traditional approach to voting that once you have a
quorum, the action of the members is determined by a vote of the members
present. For example, a "majority" is a majority of votes cast (where
one can ignore Abstain, ie: "more Yes than No"). 2/3rds is handled the
same way. Once we have a quorum, the action *of the quorum* is an action
of the membership.

There are no issues requiring board attention.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom Syndication
Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera is in maintenance mode with minimal development activity. I believe
there are at least three PMC members providing oversight still. This quarter
the main activity was a user getting help with a problem upgrading their
application. Turned out to be an AXIOM bug that was fixed by a new AXIOM
release but the debugging was done in the Abdera JIRA which I think shows
again why retiring projects to the Attic is not ideal. 

The last release was over two years ago, the last commiter / PMC member
addition was Nov 2011.

No board issues.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description: 
Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command 
line tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety
of Web documents.
   
## Issues: 
The community continues to remian quiet with few bugs logged and few fixed.
   
## Activity: 
We have had a handful of users registering bugs some of which have been
fixed but some remain open. The project really needs to move towards another
release to keep some momentum going. We are planning on another GSoC project
this year so fingers crossed that this works out.
   
## Health report: 
Any23 is a very quiet project. The mailing lists are typically very quiet.
The project is still alive as PMC and Committers use the Jira instance
to discuss fixing bugs and improving issues. There is no hiding the fact 
however that the community is not really growing much at all.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 13 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Stephane Corlosquet on Sun Sep 07 2014 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 13 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Stephane Corlosquet at Mon Aug 18 2014 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 1.1 on Tue Oct 28 2014 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
On a positive note, we have more people subscribed to both
user@ and dev@. We would like to see more contributions
however. 
   
 - dev@any23.apache.org:  
    - 35 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months): 
    - 70 emails sent to list (47 in previous quarter) 
   
 - user@any23.apache.org:  
    - 47 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months): 
    - 5 emails sent to list (14 in previous quarter)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description: 
- Arrow is a columnar in-memory analytics layer designed to accelerate big
data. It houses a set of canonical in-memory representations of flat and
hierarchical data along with multiple language-bindings for structure
manipulation. It also provides IPC and common algorithm implementations.   

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
  
## Activity: 

- A number of articles were posted about Arrow in the last month. This has
brought in a large number of interested parties and we've seen nice increase
in community engagement.
- There has been solid ideation and design discussions around IPC, metadata
and shared memory semantics.
- Development of the Python bindings is underway with a number of JIRAs
focused on that component.
- Since people have become aware of the project, we've seen a nice increase in
activity on the mailing list. Within that last month we've gone from 17
subscribers to 263 on the dev list and have seen 136 messages on the list.
  
## Health report: 

- JIRAs are being opened and closed at a solid rate given the freshness of the
project. 
- A number of design discussions have included great feedback and engagement
people outside the initial PMC/committers.
- We've seen several code contributions from first-time contributors.
- The final separation of code from the Drill codebase is up for review and
will likely move forward after the 1.6 Drill release (voting nearly underway).
  
## PMC changes: 
  
- Currently 17 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members since project was established.
  
## Committer base changes:

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Andrew Purtell]

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASES

1.1.0 was released on Fri Jan 29 2016

ACTIVITY

Evans Ye will be presenting "Dockerized Hadoop platform and recent
updates in Apache Bigtop" at Apache Big Data NA 2016[1]

Olaf Flebbe presented "Apache Bigtop" at FOSDEM '16 in the HPC,
Big Data and Data Science Devroom on Jan 31th in Brussels[2]

We have seen an uptick in requests or patches for inclusion of additional
big data components into the Bigtop Stack: Apache Apex (incubating)[3],
Druid[4], Apache Flink[5], Apache HAWQ (incubating)[6], QFS[7],
HiBench[8]. This speaks to others sharing our vision of Bigtop as the
"Debian of Big Data" and indicates continued if not increasing momentum
for the project.

Northwestern University and Boston University have four graduate
students working on Apache Flink packaging for Bigtop, and testing it
deployed on OpenStack.

The Bigtop 1.1.0 release expands the reach of the Bigtop Stack with
ppc64le (POWER8) platform support. We would like to extend this further
to ARM platform support in upcoming releases and would welcome any
contributions in that regard.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]


Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools.

Our last release (v1.4.23) happened on June 12th, 2015.

Development and community activity (mailing lists, bug reports, etc.) remains
relatively low. Our last committer/PMC change happened in October 2013.

I (Alex Boisvert) have been thinking about stepping down as PMC Chair for the
Buildr project.  I just haven't been actively involved in the project in a
while and I don't foresee this changing much in the future.   I initiated a
discussion with other PMC members on our private mailing list.

Otherwise, we have no issues that require board attention

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Sebastien Goasguen]

## Description: 
Apache CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud
orchestration platform. 


## Issues: 
- CloudStack community wants to experiment with a pure GitHub approach to our
  version control and CI.
- We took control of https://github.com/cloudstack which we did not own before
  (Github transferred ownership to members of the PMC).
- The PMC seeks guidance from the board on GitHub integration and would like
  to know what the plan and timeline is (if there is one) on operating an ASF
  project out of GitHub.
- The Whimsy experiment on Github appears totally opaque to us and we don’t
  know what the status or plan is.

## Activity: 
- Large increase of releases with 4 since December due to a new commit workflow
- CloudStack conference Brazil announced for Sept 29-30, no ASF conflicts as
  we know it.
- Citrix CloudPlatform business was sold to Accelerite, this may impact
  CloudStack
- Schuberg Philis as forked CloudStack (interim report sent to board on
  February 16th) (Annex A).
- Increased focus on CI and investigation of solutions outside of ASF infra.

## Health report: 
- Committee Health score: 9.60 (Super Healthy) from reporter.apache.org
- Slight increase of registered participants in all mailing lists
- Slight decrease in number of emails sent on MLs.
- Significant decrease in commits while we searched for a new RM
- Increase in speed of releases as we adopted new workflow

## PMC changes: 

- Currently 41 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
- Last PMC addition was Erik Weber on Wed Nov 18 2015 

## Committer base changes: 

- Currently 108 committers.

Annex A
——————

This interim report was sent to the board on February 16th with no response:

Dear Board,

The CloudStack report is not due until next round of reports, but I wanted to
report two partially related items:

1.  Schuberg-Philis a company where a significant number of CloudStack
committers happens to work has forked CloudStack. The fork has received media
attention [3], hence this interim report to let the board know that we are
indeed well aware of the situation.

A detail account of the company’s reasoning is described in [1].  Their fork
is available on Github at [2].

A fork by a company of an ASF software is a non-issue (there are other
cloudstack forks) and our community is very thankful to Schuberg Philis for
many years of strong support, either through community events (organizing and
sponsoring) or through their indirect commitment via committers who happens to
have a $dayjob at Schuberg.

2.  Through private discussions with committers who happen to have a $dayjob
at SBP, our lack of privileges/control on our github mirror has played *some*
role in this fork and created frustration. ( It is not to say that better
github control would have prevented the fork, but it might have allowed us to
resolve short term issues giving us time to work on longer term ones).

There is a risk that similar frustration grows within our community and that
developers accustomed to working on github decide to work directly on the SBP
fork or their own, thereby fragmenting our community.


Actionable items for the board:

We have not heard any reports on the status of Whimsy’s testing of github but
we would welcome being allowed to join any testing phase or if the boards
sides in favor of operating an ASF project directly on Github, we would
quickly vote in our community to decide on such a move.

Best,

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java components.

The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
Apache and without. Any ASF committer can commit to Apache Commons.

The last report was on December 16 2015.

No issues require board attention at this time.
      
## Activity: 

We had three (3) releases this period (see below).

We are considering adding a new Commons component called Commons Crypto 
currently called Chimera (https://github.com/intel-hadoop/chimera). It is an 
optimized cryptographic library. It provides Java API for both cipher level and 
Java stream level to help developers implement high performance AES 
encryption/decryption with the minimum code and effort.

## Health report: 

 Overall project health is decent to good with 3 releases this period.

 We do not have too much action on the mailing lists but we do see JIRAs and 
 GitHub PRs come regularly in to Commons IO and Commons Lang. These are 
 usually addressed in a timely fashion.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. 

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Current releases have been voted on according to the Apache vote policy. 

We had one major platform release, cordova-osx, which has been revived after a
2.5 year absence and comes with Cordova Platform API support. 

The other releases have been minor patch releases for 5 other platforms. Of
note, cordova-ubuntu had several patch releases after a year of absence,
mainly updates to support newer releases of the ubuntu SDK. cordova-windows
had several patch releases, the major one being support for the Cordova
Platform API. cordova-android had a patch release where it has support for a
new Plugin API. 

cordova-ios had several patch releases - the latest was to fix a serious app
freezing situation, and also to support the new 167x167 icon needed for iPad
support. cordova-browser had a patch release to replace the cordova-serve
implementation with an updated version that uses `express` instead of our own
implementation.

There were also 18 plugin releases, and a major cordova-cli release to 6.0.0,
which includes default plugin pinning, as well as a new template feature. We
also released a significant documentation update that addresses major pain
points in developing for Cordova based on feedback we got from a survey we put
out (where we got 900 responses).

## Health report: 

The month of December was slower because of the holiday period but activity
picked up around the middle of January. Consequently, we had a slight decrease
in the number of releases from last quarter (34 vs 37). For this period, we
managed two overall plugins releases (up from one, from last quarter) when our
goal was to have one plugins release per week, although we had individual
plugin releases as well.

## Mailing list activity: 

The number of subscribers to dev@ has been consistently decreasing (~3% loss
every quarter) but nothing significant. However during this quarter we had a
50% increase of issue@ activity which could be attributed to increased testing
during the holiday period when development at users' companies might have
slowed down, so users could test better.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]


Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex SDK 4.15.0 was released on 1/9/16.

-Apache FlexJS 0.5.0 was released on 11/14/15.
-Apache Flex FalconJX 0.5.0 was released on 11/14/15.
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.2 was released on 11/16/15.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was released on 6/23/15.


ACTIVITY
The past three months saw the release of Apache Flex SDK 4.15.0.  Bug fix
activity continues on even after the release.  There seems to be gradually
increasing interest in FlexJS, a version of Flex that is independent from
the Adobe Flash Platform.  We continue to see new names with new
questions.  Some potential committers are hopefully among them.  Three
members of the PMC are hosting a FlexJS education and training event in
San Francisco on April 4.  One committer is working on distributing FlexJS 
as an NPM module.  Work on Maven integration continues.

3 PMC members had presentations accepted for ApacheCon NA.  The Flex
community tried to coordinate a Client Track for ApacheCon with folks from
the Cordova community, but apparently the Linux Foundation wasn't
interested in having such a track since some presentations were rejected.

A revamp of the flex.a.o website is underway.  It isn't ready for branding
review just yet.

CODE ADOPTION
In the prior report we discussed the adoption of non-ASF code bases that
are already licensed under ALv2.  I think the community will eventually
undertake one or more of the adoptions utilizing advice from the board but
it didn't happen this quarter simply from lack of a volunteer to make it
happen.

COMMUNITY
-Andy Dufilie was added as a committer.
-No new PMC members this quarter.
-Last PMC addition was Josh Tynjala on Wed Sep 16 2015

-A few PMC members were nominated for ASF membership.
-Latest analytics include a little over 1000 hits per day on the
website during the work week (less on weekends).
-There were more than 3000 installs of Apache Flex 4.15.0 since its
release in January.
-Almost 65,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.  Tour De Flex
is a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex applications.

TRADEMARKS
-In the last report, we reported that  a company is promoting a software
product called Flex that appears to be related to themes/styles for
website visuals. Despite several attempts to contact them, they have not
responded.  We will start a thread on trademarks@ shortly to determine the
next steps.
-A trademark issue with a com.br website was handled and closed.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming data
analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine.
Flink's stack contains functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in
Java and Scala and libraries for various use cases.
Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of technology around Apache Hadoop and Apache Kafka.


ISSUES

 - There are no issues that require board attention.


STATUS AND ACTIVITY

 - The recent months where dominated by the efforts to release Flink 1.0, which
   was officially announced by the ASF on March, 8th.
 - The 1.0 release was themed around backwards compatibility, and operational
   features.  A complex event processing library was added as well.
 - A roadmap for the first half of 2016 has been published by the community on
   the mailing lists end of December.
 - Flink seems to get a decent amount of interest, several upcoming conference
   talks (e.g., Strata, Hadoop Summit, Kafka Summit, OSCon, ApacheCon, and
   several Meetups)
 - The latest release (1.0.0) saw slightly fewer contributors (64 people) than
   the previous one (0.10.0 had 79 contributors), because some features and
   contributions were held off / delayed in order to establish the 1.0
   relevant tools (like compatibility checks).


COMMUNITY

 - There was no new PMC addition since the last report.
   The latest PMC addition was July 2nd, 2015 (Maximilian Michels)

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description: 

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

## Issues: 

There are no particular issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

The project is active, as usual.

We released a new version, with 2.4.6, that our users were eagerly awaiting.
We're thinking of cutting a first beta release of the future Groovy 2.5.

But there are still some improvements we want to make to our release process
to simplify the release management, to be able to release more often.

Looking at the "pulse" on Github [1], for the past month (sliding window),
the project received contributions from 17 authors who have pushed 76 commits 
to master and 135 commits to all branches. On master, 133 files have changed 
and there have been 1,708 additions and 575 deletions.

The subscribers to our mailing-lists have increased, even if the activity
seems to be a bit lower this month.

[1] https://github.com/apache/groovy/pulse/monthly

## Health report: 

The project is healthy.

The recently created twitter handle, @ApacheGroovy, 
has increased from 1200 followers to 1345, since last month.

For the third consecutive month, Apache Groovy is listed in the top 20
of the TIOBE programming language index. 
The project is back at the 17th position.

Upcoming dedicated conferences are coming up:
- GR8Days in Poland in March
- Greach in Spain in April
- GR8Conf Europe in June
- GR8Conf US in July
- G3 Summit in December (new conference)

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

No development activity, Gump seems to create useful results for the
few projects that use it.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The projects that use Gump have occasionally modified their respective
configuration files.  No other activity.

=== Mailing-List Statistics ===

general@gump.apache.org:
47 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months) (93 emails sent in the
past 3 months, 80 in the previous cycle)

commits@gump.apache.org:
21 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months) (19 emails sent in the past
3 months, 10 in the previous cycle)

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Ignite Project  [Dmitriy Setrakyan]

## Description:
   The Apache Ignite (TM) In-Memory Data Fabric is a high-performance,
   integrated and distributed in-memory platform for computing and
   transacting on large-scale data sets in real-time, orders of magnitude
   faster than possible with traditional disk-based or flash technologies.

   Apache Ignite (TM) provides many in-memory components to improve
   performance and scalability of user applications, including in-memory
   data grid (distributed caching), in-memory compute grid, in-memory
   streaming, and more.

## Activity:
 - The community has released 1.5.0 final version. 
   The release includes C++ and .NET/C# support, deadlock-free transactions,
   compact binary marshalling protocol, OSGI support, integration with MQTT, 
   Flume, Camel, and Twitter streams, and many other features.

 - The community is working towards version 1.6.0, which will include
   ODBC support, and non-collocated SQL joins, as well as significant
   performance improvements.

 - Based on user requests, and given that one of the main features of Ignite 
   is performance, the community desided to start publishing transparent 
   reproducable performance comparisons to other products, beginning with 
   Hazelcast. The Hazelcast team questioned the validity of the test, and 
   Ignite community worked with Hazelcast on reproducing it. Ignite community 
   is planning to publish performance comparisons with other open source 
   projects, including Apache Cassandra, Infinispan, and Redis. The 
   comparisons will be published on the Ignite website with code and detailed 
   steps to reproduce the numbers on Amazon AWS.

## Health report:
 - Ignite keeps attracting new contributors on the mailing list
 - Ignite chatroom member list cintinously grows

## Issues:
 - There are no outstanding issues.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:

→ Roman Shtykh was added as a committer on Fri Jan 29 2016
→ Currently 27 committers and 24 PMC members.

## Releases:
→ 1.5.0-b1 was released on Mon Dec 07 2015
→ 1.5.0.final was released on Mon Jan 04 2016

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

Incubator PMC report for March 2016

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 52 podlings currently undergoing incubation.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Kathey Marsden
  - Daniel John Debrunner

* New Podlings

  - Guacamole
  - Joshua
  - Quarks

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - Sentry

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  February:

  2016-02-06 Apache Geode 1.0.0-incubating.M1
  2016-02-07 Apache Apex v3.3.0-incubating
  2016-02-11 Apache Wave 0.4.0-incubating
  2016-02-11 Apache SystemML 0.9.0-incubating
  2016-02-11 Apache TinkerPop 3.1.1-incubating
  2016-02-20 Apache Johnzon 0.9.3-incubating
  2016-02-25 Apache Kudu (incubating) 0.7.0
  2016-02-26 Apache AsterixDB 0.8.8-incubating

* IP Clearance

  - No podling related IP Clearances were processed during this time.

* Legal / Trademarks

  - There was substantial discussion on general@incubator about how
    challenging it is to produce compliant LICENSE and NOTICE files.

  - A couple of podlings with runtime LGPL dependencies pledged to remove
    those dependencies before graduation but were permitted to make
    incubating releases in the meantime.  There was uncertainty as to
    whether VP Legal's approval was required; ultimately VP Legal appeared
    on general@incubator and approved the plans.

* Infrastructure

  - The Freemarker podling had a long standing request to use their existing
    domain as the primary domain.  This was approved by Shane Curcuru but
    closed by infra without comment, see INFRA-10787.

  - The Kudu podling is currently running its website as http://getkudu.io.
    The standard webpage of http://kudu.incubator.apache.org does not work.
    An infra ticket has been created to do the conversion INFRA-11407.

* Miscellaneous

  - The Incubator's Retirement Guide has been substantially refreshed, and
    it should now be easier for a Mentor or other volunteer to perform the
    administrative steps to retire a podling.

  - This month saw a large number of mentors resign from podlings.

  - Brooklyn submitted an IP Clearance on the incubator mailing lists.  
    Last that was seen about the incubators role in IP Clearance was that
    it shouldn't be the gatekeeper of top level projects.

  - The current count of 52 podlings is likely the largest the incubator
    has ever seen.

  Great news! The community wrote the report this month! Thank you to
  Lei Pan for pushing forward and I have high hopes over the next few months
  we can light a fire under this project.


--------------------
CommonsRDF

Commons RDF is a set of interfaces and classes for RDF 1.1 concepts and
behaviours.  The commons-rdf-api module defines interfaces and testing
harness.  The commons-rdf-simple module provides a basic reference
implementation to exercise the test harness and clarify API contracts.

CommonsRDF has been incubating since 2015-03-06.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Re-engage and grow the Commons RDF community base
  2. Work with key target communities (initially within Apache) to ensure
     Commons RDF meets potential user requirements and expectations towards
     next versions of the Commons API.
  3. Find lateral target goals that could make the project viable.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  n/a

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Sleeper community in the last months; very few mails and no commits.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Project's development has completely stop in the last months. We expected
  a different engagement from major RDF toolkits. But since that does not
  happen, we have started to discuss options to find a viability for the
  project https://s.apache.org/oxqb

  By the next reporting period we should have something more concrete
  towards the future, or we could think about a possible exit strategy.

--------------------
Fineract

Fineract is an open source system for core banking as a platform.

Fineract has been incubating since 2015-12-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Inform the non-technical part of the existing Mifos.org community of
     the change in project structure
  2. Getting licensing issues figured out for our first release
  3. Replacing dependencies that are not compliant with the license policies

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None, currently.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Since the code was initially pushed over, the community is working on the
  first release.

  In addition to the initial committer new contributors started to work on
  the project.

  There is a technical conference in Amsterdam in the second week of March
  during which some contributors and some community members will be
  introduced to developing under the Apache model.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The initial code is now available and the work to meet the license
  policies has started.

--------------------
Impala

Impala is a high-performance C++ and Java SQL query engine for data stored
in Apache Hadoop-based clusters.

Impala has been incubating since 2015-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Movement of existing JIRA / Git / wiki resources to Apache
     equivalents
  2. Initial release as incubating project.
  3. Community growth

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There have been no additions to the committer or PMC lists since
  incubation began. However, we have seen an uptick in external
  contributions, both through code, and in discussion on the mailing list.
  One contributor has been attempting to port Impala to PPC, and has
  reported some success after asking many questions.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have made some slow progress with our initial infrastructure tasks.
  Code review traffic is now copied to dev@impala.incubator.apache.org,
  which means that developer discussions are now happening on the mailing
  lists.

  We have a number of infrastructure tasks ahead of us which are blocked on
  the current Impala team at Cloudera being very busy with an internal
  release (this is one reason we look forward to a more diverse community!).
  For example:

  1. We would like to move our Git repository to .apache.org in short order,
     but as it stands the existing repo is 10GB large and historically
     contains many binary artifacts that, while acceptably licensed, have no
     useful place in Impala's repository. We need to strip these artifacts
     from the Git history, and then adjust Gerrit to commit to the new
     branch in the new repo. This is not hard but takes some time.
  2. We would also like to move our JIRA tickets from issues.cloudera.org to
     issues.apache.org. Experience in a sister podling has shown that this
     isn't straightforward if we wish to preserve existing release labels,
     user assignments and so on, so requires some time.

  We anticipate having much more time to work on these basic issues after
  the end of February. We look forward to getting Impala into a position
  where it is easier for the larger community to collaborate on these kinds
  of project management issues.

Date of last release:

  None since entering incubation.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

--------------------
Kudu

Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache Hadoop
ecosystem.

Kudu has been incubating since 2015-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Build a more diverse developer and user community
  2. Migrate our web site under apache.org
  3. Continue to make regular Apache releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - In February, we only received one patch from a new contributor (3 total
    from non-committers). We're continuing to focus on building a more
    diverse developer community.

    Although recruiting new contributors to Kudu itself have been slow, we
    had community members report beginnings of a Presto integration, an
    Apache Flume sink, and Rust language bindings. We are considering
    whether it makes sense to develop these things within the Kudu project
    or external locations.

  - Overall development velocity continues to be pretty good: 94 patches
    committed since the last report, representing about 3.5kloc of new code
    and 4kloc of changes.  This is slightly down from last month, as we
    spent a bit more time on managing our first release and fixing bugs
    rather than adding new features.

    Dev list traffic is similar to January (1032 messages vs 1144 in Jan).

  - Community members continue to give public talks about Kudu at various
    conferences and meetups. Talks were delivered at conferences or meetups
    in Tokyo (x2), Sunnyvale, Krakow, San Francisco (x2), and Seattle. More
    are planned for March.

    We are also encouraged that at least two Kudu meetup talks were
    delivered by new members of the community outside the core development
    team. We hope to see the "grassroots community" trend continue.

  - The public Kudu Slack channel continues to be popular. It has grown from
    116 members last month to 150 this month. Discussion between users and
    devs is quite active, with daily participation from a global community
    (USA, China, Poland, Japan, et al). Many users seem to prefer this
    method over the traditional user mailing list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, we've accomplished the following milestones:

  - We successfully migrated our issue tracking to the Apache JIRA. Special
    thanks to Gavin on the infra team and Mike Percy on the Kudu project for
    hard work on this transition.

  - We cleaned up our license documentation and successfully published our
    first official release as an incubating project (0.7.0)!

Date of last release:

  Feb 25, 2016: Apache Kudu 0.7.0-incubating

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  None since initial incubation.

log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create a release
  2. Activate some community
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There's an ongoing discussion to move the project to attic unless it is
  able to release in the next few months.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Not grown. However, the project aims to become a sub project of Apache
  Logging again. Community growth is not much a matter for this podling, as
  long as there are a few active contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  After the discussion about the activity of the project and the success of
  the incubation process, there's currently a member willing to step through
  the release process. The initial plan on incubation anyway was to primary
  apply available patches and release those bug fixes.

  Additionally, there's once more a discussion about the supported build
  platforms, because currently the project heavily focusses on cpptasks,
  which is not maintained and simply doesn't support current versions of all
  formerly supported IDEs anymore.  The current focus is on dropping
  cpptasks and ANT for the build of the software and use autoconf and/or
  cmake instead.

Date of last release:

  2008-04-03 was the last official, pre-incubation 0.10.0

  The Initial Committer list is being revised (see below).

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have identified shortcomings in the Initial Committer list, and adopted
  a fast-track process to add new members, valid for the project's first
  three months (until March 20th).  We have welcomed our first genuinely new
  committer and are inviting another.  Initial committers are familiarising
  with Apache.

Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together
on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both
Hadoop and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the Myriad user base.
  2. Expand the contributor community.
  3. Release Myriad 0.2.0 in April/May, with focus on multitenancy,
     security, and oversubscription.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Mailing list traffic went into a holiday lull after the 0.1.0 release.
    Should pick up again as we plan the 0.2.0 release.
    http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-myriad-dev/
  - Our biweekly community syncs still get 6-12 participants, including new
    participants from Accenture. See minutes at: http://s.apache.org/8kF
  - Freenode #myriad IRC channel has been mostly quiet since the 0.1.0
    release, except for an occasional user question or discussion around a
    community sync. Chatter should pick up again leading up to the 0.2.0
    release, and moreso after we get a few more users. Archived by ASFBot
    at: http://wilderness.apache.org/channels/#logs-#myriad
  - Website and wiki were updated with the 0.1.0 release.
    http://myriad.incubator.apache.org
  - Presented at DockerConEU. Submitted talks for ApacheCon, MesosCon,
    Hadoop Summit, Container World.

  Andy:: It would be good to have a second active mentor in addition to Dan.
  Chris: I have to retire as a Taverna mentor. That said - what's stopping
  Taverna from being ready to graduate? If it's just mentor activity then
  consider graduating. The community looks active, looks like it's releasing,
  looks like involved in GSoC, etc.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

## Description: 
 Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project
   
## Issues: 
 there are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity:
 - new features, improvements and bug fixes have been contributed
 and integrated into the official code base
 - the community is active and friendly: there are discussions in the mailing
 lists, community days (days in which contributors virtually meet and
 work together at resolving as many tickets as possible) and activity
 in Jira and Confluence
 - the community is trying to define a roadmap for the refactoring
 of the framework following an evolutionary step-by-step approach;
 the framework represents a large portion of the OFBiz codebase and
 some parts of it are rather old and may benefit from a renewal/upgrade;
 since the framework is used by several applications, the
 community is trying to find a way to minimize the impact on them
 - the activity in the official blog and Twitter accounts is steady
 and we have started to publish some videos on our official youtube
 channel
 - also this year the OFBiz project will be represented at ApacheCon:
 in fact some OFBiz related presentations have been accepted
 - we have some pending CVEs that we have partially addressed and we
 are trying to finalize as soon as possible; for this reason we have
 delayed our release dates but we are trying to complete this work in
 the next few weeks
 - finally, the sad news that shook our community:
 on 1st January 2016, OFBiz Committer, former PMC member and friend
 Adrian Crum passed away. Adrian joined the OFBiz project
 during the incubation phase and in 2007 was invited to
 become a committer. Later that year Adrian joined the
 OFBiz PMC and participated until June 2014. Over the years
 Adrian contributed around 5,000 postings to the mailing lists,
 over 2,300 issues and comments to issues and over 2,000 commits.
 The project has setup a memorial page for the community to
 share their stories, and experiences of Adrian and the community
 has also decided to dedicate our next OFBiz release to him.

## Health report:
 the project seems to be in an healthy phase: medium traffic in the
 mailing lists, good and friendly communication and collaboration; the
 committers group is slowly growing; we are behind of our schedule on
 releases because we are slowly progressing at making our system more
 secure in its default configuration (once completed, this work will
 address the CVEs reported)

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

=== General ===
## Description: 
   Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open 
   Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of 
   OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is 
   the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC. 

## Olingo Status
   
Currently Olingo has no issues that would require board attention. 
Based on the new release process the community provided the first minor release
with version 4.1.0 on December 21st, 2016. The next minor V4 release is 
scheduled to be released at the end of march.
Additionally we provided a new patch release for the OData V2 code line on 
January 29th, 2016.

Most of the work in the Olingo community is done in the OData V4 code line. We 
saw an increasing number of JIRA issues form users of the library that also 
contribute bug fixes in the form of patches. The number of questions on the
user mailing list seems to be constant with a mix of new and already known
users.  All in all the project is healthy but would certainly benefit from
more regular contributors.

An initiative towards an easier API on the basis of JPA annotations was 
discussed by users on the users mailing list but did not lead to any 
contributions. As an experiment a repository was created at GitHub for easier 
access from non Apache committers. The idea was to give the users a repository 
they can work in without having to go through Apache processes in the beginning.
 
The eventual goal would  have been to integrate the GitHub code into the Olingo 
project once a certain maturity has been achieved. If there are any updates in
this direction I will include them within the next board report.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Tom Barber]

DESCRIPTION

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

- Last release was 0.12 on Feb 19th 2016

We resolved 4 issues for this release.

0.12 was a out of band release for OODT initially the scope was an emergency
patch for an API issue, but in preparing for the release we also addressed 3
major issues relating to the the Solr integration for OODT. 

We have decided to switch to a rough quarterly release schedule to help keep
the code active and make sure that commits that get pushed to the project get
released in a timely manner, which will give contributors more confidence
about when their patches will end up in the stable codebase.

February was a busy month on the mailing list with a number of new users
showing up and triggering the Solr patches and general questions about OODT
usage.

The project is specific in its design but we have been working on advertising 
to a larger crowd for less scientific based data management to draw a larger 
audience and userbase. 

At ApacheCon we have 1 presentation and 2 tutorials scheduled for Apache OODT
which we hope will drive awareness to wider audiences.

As ever it would be nice to see fresh blood on the project helping to increase
the development effort on the platform, but the software itself is stable and
well used.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Jörn Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference
resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text
processing services.

Development
------------------
The development team stayed active but with less activity. A language
model component was added and a few smaller bugs were fixed.
At the current pace we will probably finish the next minor
release before the next board report.

Community
---------------
The community stayed active with the usual amount of traffic on the user
mailing list and contributed a couple of patches to fix bugs.

Rodrigo Agerri was added to the PMC on Jul 09 2015

Mondher Bouazizi and Anthony Beylerian were added as a committer on
Fri Sep 04 2015.

Releases
------------
The last release OpenNLP 1.6.0 was released on Jul 09 2015.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description: 
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specification which is defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0) and CDI-1.1
 and CDI-1.2 (MR) specifications (JSR-346). 

## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 
 Activity is fine. We did start with CDI-2.0 and are actively fixing and 
 enhancing the existing mainline.
 A few OWB committers are actively contributing to the ALv2 licensed
 CDI-2.0 specification. We also already incorporated a few of those 
 changes to the existing mainline (if changes are API compatible).

## Health report: 
 The project is a container library which is stable and actively 
 used and maintained. Due to the fact that most users are using 
 OWB as part of another project (e.g. TomEE) we get much feedback 
 in ‚indirect‘ ways.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe M. Chiasson]

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since 2014-12.

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

Following Steve Hay's release of mod_perl 2.0.9, there has been an increase
in interest and activity.

Major Linux distros were quick at picking it up as well, so it should be
making its way to a lot of users.


--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites that can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

Apache-Test 1.39 was released on Apr 21, 2015

No new Apache-Test releases since 2015-11.

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Apache-SizeLimit 0.97 was released on Apr 02, 2012

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since 2015-11.

--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Apache-Bootstrap 0.07 was released on Jul 13, 2009

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since 2015-11.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Apache-Reload 0.13 was released on May 09, 2015

No new Apache-Reloase releases since 2015-11.

-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

Apache-DBI 1.12 was released on June 12nd, 2013

No new Apache-DBI releases since 2015-11.

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
fixes are applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

The 2.0.9 release has caused some more healthy activity, and development
is continuing.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, with a bump in activity
following the 2.0.9 RCs and the final release.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened since the last report.

The PMC has currently 11 members

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Description: 
  Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
  applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
  features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
  Java platform.
 
Issues: 
  - I do not think there are any board-level issues with Pivot at this time.
  - We may need to have a discussion about moving to the Attic *soon*, but
    not right now.
 
Activity: 
  Since our last report there has been a downtick in mailing list activity
  but not to historic lows, but there has been a slight uptick in the
  meta-activity around the project:
  - I have volunteered to possibly be a mentor for GSOC in conjunction
    with Airavata.
  - An emeritus PMC member has rejoined to help with votes and
    administrative issues.
  - Several new users have shown up.
  - We are close to a new release with only one (known) issue to resolve. 
  - Rich Bowen published the podcast he did with me last year at the
    feathercast.apache.org site.
   
Health report: 
 - I would say the project is borderline at the moment, but no worse than
   last report (in fact, maybe a bit better).
 - With the final death blow to Java applets coming in September with the
   release of Java 9, the traditional market for Pivot will shrink
   dramatically.
 - I am still trying to work within the ASF and elsewhere to move
   into new areas.  This is an ongoing effort.
 - But, even with some new users, there are no new candidates for
   committership or PMC membership, which remains a big issue.
   
PMC changes: 
 - Currently 4 PMC members. 
 - Niclas Hedhman was added back to the PMC on Wed Jan 13 2016.
   
Committer base changes: 
 - Currently 9 committers, of whom 2 are currently active.
 - No changes to the committer base since last report. 
 - Last committer addition Piotr Kołaczkowski (pkolaczk) was in
   May 2012.
   
Releases: 
 - Last release was 2.0.4 on Mon May 19 2014.
   
Mailing list activity: 
 - We have several new mailing list subscribers corresponding to the
   new users, although activity has been slower this last quarter.
 
 - dev@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 61 subscribers (up 3 in the last 3 months)
    - 55 emails sent to list (77 in previous quarter) 
 
 - user@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 175 subscribers (up 3 in the last 3 months) 
    - 28 emails sent to list (43 in previous quarter) 
 
JIRA activity: 
 - JIRA activity is a bit slow, but at least one critical Java 8
   issue was resolved, meaning the 2.0.5 release is closer now.
 - 5 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months.
 - 2 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Jeff Trawick]

## Short version of report:

  No releases, no committee/committer changes, modest other activity
  (Same summary as for the December 2015 report)

## Description:

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
  software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
  to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
  which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
  the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
  since 2007.

## Activity:
 - Commit activity has been modest, though much higher than in the previous
   two quarters even discounting copyright changes.  This brought some small
   features and compatibility with a newer OpenSSL version.
 - Mailing list activity has been relatively low.
 - Six unique bugs were opened during the reporting period, and eight had
   followup (closure or discussion).

## Health report:
 - This is a mature project, and most of its development activity is
   driven by the needs of the same small number of applications that have
   used it for many years.  The project members are more than able to
   meet the requirements that arise from that use.
 - The needs of the small number of other users are not met very well;
   bug reports languish and mailing list posters may not receive timely
   responses.  The amount of help provided is probably not sufficient
   to serve as encouragement to potential new users of APR.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:

 - Currently 65 committers and 39 LDAP committee group members.
 - No new LDAP committee group members added in the last 3 months
 - Last LDAP committee group addition was Yann Ylavic at Wed May 13 2015
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Christophe Jaillet at Sat Mar 14 2015

## Releases:

 - No releases in this quarter
 - APR 1.5.2, released April 29, 2015
 - APR-util 1.5.4, released September 22, 2014
 - APR-iconv 1.2.1, released November 26, 2007

## Mailing list activity:

 - dev@apr.apache.org:
    - 360 subscribers
    - 86 emails sent to list (103 in previous quarter)

 - commits@apr.apache.org:
    - 74 subscribers
    - 59 emails sent to list (9 in previous quarter)

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
==============
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow over the year
change, but is picking up again now that we're planning to do new releases.
We had also some new contributions.

We have focused on providing users with latest and greatest technology and
worked on upgrade of Apache Karaf, ActiveMQ, Camel and CXF versions.

During the last period the last maintenance version 5.4.3 has been released.
We have decided to stop further development on the branch 5.4.x. We have also
released the stable releases 5.5.2, 5.5.3 and 6.0.2 and the new release 5.6.0
from the development branch. During this period 4 sets of OSGi bundles and new
Specs has been released too.

We have focused on the development of ServiceMix 7 and released the first
preview of 7.0.0 which is based on Karaf 4.0.0 and includes numerous new
features. We are working now towards a 7.0.0 release. We are fixing first
issues reported by users for the preview release. In the new period we are
going to focus on the further development and stability of ServiceMix 7 to be
able to provide the community the first stable release.

We do plan to keep our release schedule going with the 5.5.x, 5.6.x, 6.0.x and
6.1.x releases. We plan to keep a steady release schedule and keep up with new
fix releases of our dependency projects.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- We released the 1.2.4 bugfix/point release on July 7th.

Community & Project:

- 2.x work has slowed as of late.  The hope is to resume significant work when
  possible.  Cleanup needs to occur before final release candidates can go out.

- It was a priority since the last board report to move to Git.  This has been
  completed.

- Project is mostly stable and in maintenance/bugfix mode until a 2.0 release
  can be made.  No significant feature development is planned on 1.x.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Mick Semb Wever]

## Description:
 Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for Java applications.
Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify the development of user
interfaces.

## Activity:
 Activity in the Tiles community remains slow, slowing down further from last
quarter. Questions and issues are still generally addressed quickly. Otherwise
the majority of traffic remains on StackExchange and within the Spring
community.

## Health report:
 The Apache Tiles project has dropped to the "urgent action required!" health
status. The significant issues with the health status are the low traffic on
the mailing lists, the lack of a release (despite one being promised), and no
new committers over the past two years. The few active members are aware of
the state of the project and most of our attention goes toward keeping a
stable project still communicating with users and developers that have
questions.  Little time goes toward trying to increase the project's momentum.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
 No releases were made this quarter.

## Mailing list activity:
 Mailing list activity has been quiet this quarter.

 - users@tiles.apache.org:
    - 148 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):
    - 8 emails sent to list (14 in previous quarter)

 - dev@tiles.apache.org:

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache UIMA Project  [Marshall Schor]

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Dates:
15 Feb 2016  (new)        last release - Apache UIMA RUTA 2.4.0
                                        (Rules Text Language and workbench)
12 Mar 2013  (no change)  last PMC addition
24 Jul 2015  (no change)  last Committer addition
          
Releases:
  15 Feb 2016 Apache UIMA RUTA 2.4.0 - this was a large-ish collection of new
              features and bug fixes
              
Other Activity:

The experimental UIMA Version 3 core has advanced to having all but 3 of the
core test cases running. Next phase will involve compatibility testing and
building bridges from the current to the new version, a potentially non-trivial
task.

UIMA Ruta (Rules Text Language and workbench) and DUCC continue to be very
active.  Work is also underway to do a release of UIMA-AS to upgrade several
of the components within it.  One component, ActiveMQ, was identified as
having security issues, and the upgrade will resolve those.  

We began work with Mark Thomas (of Apache) on two initiatives - code signing,
and looking at the results of the SRC CLR scanning for code vulnerabilities -
this is currently ongoing work.

A Committer and PMC member, Richard Eckart de Castilho, gave an Apache UIMA
lightning talk at the Apache Software Foundation Roadshow event in
Karlsruhe, Germany.  http://jug-karlsruhe.de/content/apache-software-foundation/

We managed with help from various sources within Apache to guess the owner of
the Twitter account named Apache UIMA, and also managed to reclaim that account;
this was done without invoking trademark infringement claims.
it is now under control of Apache UIMA PMC members, and will be used to
tweet Apache UIMA significant events.

Community:

The community continues to be moderately active.
 
Issues:
No Board level issues at this time.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description: 
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Committers are trying to wrap up bug fixes and a few new features to be able
  to get VCL 2.5 out in the next several weeks
- As discussed in the Health Report section, we are seeking ideas from the
  community on how to get more people involved in the project [1][2].

## Health report:

Project activity has been down over the last year. We have created a thread
[1][2] on our user and dev lists to address this issue. Some ideas on why
activity has been down that are discussed in the thread are lack of
documentation on using and contributing to VCL, lack of vision on where VCL is
headed, and lack of exposure to new people. I encourage the board and ASF
members to review this thread. Any comments or suggestions sent to any of our
lists is extremely welcome.

## PMC changes: 

- Currently 7 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
- Last PMC addition was Aaron Coburn on Tue Jun 19 2012 

## Committer base changes: 

- Currently 8 committers.

## Releases: 

- Last release was 2.4.2 on Thu Apr 16 2015
- We are hopeful to get VCL 2.5 out in the next several weeks.

## Mailing list activity:

Our user list traffic is down. This was noted in our last report [3] and the
trend hasn't changed yet. We hope to improve things through the ideas expressed
in ﻿[1][2].

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Ross Gardler]

1) GitHub experiment has now fully started - bi-directional synchronization
   between an ASF hosted and a GitHub hosted repository is now working,
   thanks to the work of Daniel Gruno.  This provides the potential for a
   tangible question as to how to evaluate the ongoing GitHub experiment:  
   if/when the Infrastructure team decides to recommend that allowing other
   projects to make use of this set up, the experiment was a success.  Should
   the infrastructure team decide to recommend that this set-up is no longer
   supported, the experiment is a failure.

2) Manual intervention by the infrastructure team has still proven to be
   required to add new committers to the repository.  Each month we seem
   to get a little closer to making this unnecessary.  There are hopeful
   signs that next month we will have reached this target.

3) Whimsy has moved over to a new Ubuntu 14.04 VM, complete with automatic
   deployment and status monitoring.  The fact that the status monitoring is
   pushing too much information to the mailing list is a known problem, and
   needs resolution.  Much of the work of the past month has been focused on
   'puppetizing' the remaining tools.

4) A lot of time and effort has gone into improving the documentation of how
   to get either individual tools or even the entire whimsy site up and running
   on a developers machine.

5) Additional work was done to address stability issues in the board agenda
   tool.  This is ongoing.

6) The Whimsy roster tool can now be used by PMC chairs to update PMC
   membership and committer lists for their projects.  And by committers to
   update their Spam Assassin score.  While the latter may seem odd, it was a
   direct result of an infrastructure contractor unilaterally reassigning an
   INFRA JIRA to Whimsy without consultation.  See associated discussion item.

7) The Whimsy PMC gets periodic requests from the incubator team that
   curiously seem to die down quickly.    :-(

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Report from the Apache Wicket project [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework.

## Noteworthy items:
  
- Currently 30/29 Committers/PMC members. 
- Last committer/PMC addition was François Meillet on Mon Jun 29 2015 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
- Mailinglist traffic is up over the previous quarter
- Martijn Dashorst was interviewed by InfoQ about the Wicket 7.2 release
- A couple CVE's were handled and fixes were released
- Work on Wicket 8 is in progress

## CVE's

CVE-2015-5347 XSS vulnerability was resolved in Wicket 1.5.15, 6.22.0 and
7.2.0.

CVE-2015-7520 XSS vulnerability was resolved in Wicket 1.5.15, 6.22.0 and
7.2.0

## Releases this quarter

We have issued the following releases: 7.2.0, 6.22.0 and 1.5.15.

## State of the project

As server-side web frameworks mature, we don't expect a big uptake in adoption
of Wicket (or any other server-side framework for that matter). The current
base of users for Wicket seem stable, if slightly declining. 

The PMC has been able to mitigate attrition by adding new members to the
project and will continue to do so whenever new potentials arrive. We keep on
the lookout for new candidates.

Apart from bringing in new fresh development resources, the biggest difficulty
currently is to properly weigh new functionality provided by new community
members with the original vision of the project and keeping it maintainable
with a small crew.

Development for Wicket 8 is slow, albeit ongoing.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]

Dear Board,

Please find below the board report for Apache Wink project.

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of
REST style web services. The core server runtime is based on the
JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client
runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side
runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Community:
The Wink project has a mature project with small community which is 
currently not very active. Although I believe Wink is a mature project 
with active users, the overall PMC has been alive but not active, and 
on the last time I ask, they were starting to contemplate  a move
to attic. Although they have expressed that willingness, nothing have
been done on that direction and the community seems to still be taking
care of the current code, as we just receive a security patch on the past
couple weeks. Maybe I could try a new release (1.4.1) with the recent
security fix to see if we would generate any community traction.

Last svn activity shows a security fix provided by a user the past week
(03/2016)

Releases:
* Last release was Apache Wink 1.4.0 which was released on September 15, 2013

Committers or PMC changes:
* Voted Gerhard Petracek was added as a Wink committer in August 2013.

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

There has been no development activity on Xerces-J since early
December 2015. We still need volunteers to help push out a new
release.

Mailing list traffic has been very low; only 8 posts on the j-dev
and j-users lists since the beginning of December 2015. It appears
the community has shifted over time to using stackoverflow.com for
asking questions related to Xerces instead of using the Apache
mailing lists.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

Xerces-C 3.1.3 was released on February 17th to address a security
vulnerability. It also contains other fixes that were made last
year.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 70+ posts on the c-dev
and c-users lists since the beginning of December 2015.

The latest release is Xerces-C 3.1.3 (February 17th, 2016).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

No activity over the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in February 2015 (Xerces-C)
and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

No new PMC members in the last four months. The last two additions
to the PMC were in May 2010.

Three committers committed changes to SVN in the last quarter.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Sean Busbey]

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and release
processes for software projects.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD'S ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

Version 0.1.0 was released on December 13th 2015.
Version 0.2.0 was released on March 7th 2016.

ACTIVITY

Kengo Seki was added to the PMC on February 28th 2016.

No new committers in the last three months.

Last new committer was Kengo Seki on December 01, 2015.

The community has just finished laying some process groundwork to make
on-boarding new release managers easier. This culminated in our second release.
This release should be sufficiently stable for us to concentrate more on
evangelism beyond the handful of projects that brought the current contributors
to Yetus in the first place.

Our Allen Wittenauer has talks on Yetus scheduled for ApacheCon Core as well as
ApacheCon BigData. We believe this will be the largest audience the project has
been presented to.

Mailing list traffic remains low, but responsive.

Description
Apache Zest is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented
Programming for domain-centric application development.
