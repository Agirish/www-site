 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The focus of the board over August have been the issues Ross
       highlights in the President's report, and covered in the discussion
       items.

       Other than that, several directors have been assisting a small number
       of projects working through community issues.

    B. President [Ross]

       For personal reasons I have mostly been absent from my role for a few
       months now. As a result I have asked the board to consider whether it
       is the best thing for the ASF to have me continue as President. I have
       reassured the board that I am ramping back up, and indeed during the
       last couple of weeks I feel I have almost fully returned, however, my
       absence has led me to consider the role in some detail. Below is the
       edited text of a couple of emails I sent privately to the board a week
       before this meeting. It prompted some discussion and has resulted in a
       discussion item on this months agenda.

       I have had to take personal time recently. I’ve found it
       impossible to get motivated to come back until now. During my personal
       time I’ve done a great deal of thinking and I’ve come to the
       conclusion that things here need to change. Either me or the
       foundation.

       The foundation is growing faster than our operations abilities to
       manage the foundation.

       I’ve proposed many different models to address this and taken many
       positive steps towards  fixing individual pieces (as have many VPs
       that have come and gone over the years). My focus, as a fully
       committed ASF Member, has always been to preserve the independence of
       the foundation. Unfortunately, I have been knocked back at every step.
       Sometimes because the proposal is seen as too broad (i.e. hire
       someone), sometimes because volunteers are burned out by the overhead
       of change management.

       The argument against radical change is usually that we will not crash
       and burn if things just tick along with the occasional blip. This is
       true, but it is a very short sighted view.

       What will happen is that we will slowly rot if we don’t address these
       things. Volunteers will continue to burn out. The foundation will
       continue to grow. We will become increasingly unbalanced and our
       ability to manage the operations of the foundation will eventually be
       crushed.

       I’ve failed to come up with an acceptable solution for the board,
       therefore the board, with me, needs to come up with an alternative.

       I realize that the best alternative may be a new Prez. Perhaps my lack
       of motivation is now part of the problem (this is certainly true for
       the last few months). I want to be clear that I am happy to tender my
       resignation at an agreed time, I'm also happy to stay on, but with the
       understanding that radical change, in some form, is needed. I’m not
       laying down an ultimatum, nor am I threatening. I want to work with
       the board to ensure the ASF remains healthy in the long term.

       My recommendation remains that we must hire someone, or some org, to
       take responsibility for the operations of the foundation, under the
       leadership of volunteer VPs and a Prez. That being said, I know there
       is no consensus around this. I know there is significant objection.
       But when we try to discuss this it focuses more about "the title" than
       "the role and responsibilities", or more about "what might happen if
       we do" than "what might happen if we don't". That is discussion often
       feels more about restating history than looking at the future.

       I'm not saying I'm right. I'm saying I don't feel the open discussion
       has been had. This report is intended to provoke that discussion.

       I stand by those words and now make them public. I undertake to work
       with the current directors to find the best solution. This is not an
       easy thing to do. If there were a quick fix we would have implemented
       it already. Fortunately, the foundation is in good shape and my
       concern is about ensuring the foundation can maintain this good shape
       for many years to come. At this time our financial situation is
       extremely solid. Our communities grow yearly. Our operations are,
       though creaking, mostly effective. However, whilst well managed our
       budget deficit is growing year on year and, unless we see significant
       increases in income, that deficit will continue to grow - especially
       as we look to further invest in infrastructure. 

       There is no need for alarm. We have many years of reserve, but we
       cannot operate long term on a plan that depends on a reserve. As the
       current President I feel we need to take the long view and we are now
       at a point where my long term recommendations may not be sufficiently
       aligned with that of the board. 

       EA
       == EA has recently, at my request, taken over full responsibility for
       the coordination of the TAC process for ApacheCon. This is because our
       VP TAC appears to be otherwise engaged. The good news is that since
       taking on this responsibility TAC has mostly come back on track with
       plenty of ne volunteers. One area of difficulty is in updating the
       website and questions app. Melissa has reached out to Infra for help
       on this. Though with the arrival of new volunteer it is hoped that
       someone will take on this responsibility.

       Melissa is working with Sharan to organize our ApacheCon EU booth
       activities. Sharan covered for Melissa in NA last time around and has
       since stepped up to help more broadly. As a resident of the EU this
       reduces travel time and expense.

       Brand Management
       ===============

       A busy time recently. VP Brand Management is struggling to stay on
       top, though the decentralization of brand management to PMCs continues
       to pay dividends.

       I will observe, however, that this decentralization, can only be
       harmed when community concerns are brought to the trademark list (an
       element of operations) and used to influence a trademark registration
       request, coupled with voluntary donations to cover costs. These two
       things should be kept separate. Having trademarks assigned to the ASF
       gives the foundation more influence over community players who are not
       yet managing trademarks as effectively as we would like. VP Brands
       report contains similar comments.

       Fundraising
       =========

       Thanks to Jim who has resigned as one of our two VPs. At this time I
       do not intend to replace Jim, but again invite all directors to help
       with both finding new sponsors and engaging with existing sponsors

       The usual activity around fundraising with the difficulty in
       contacting one sponsor due for renewal clearly illustrating the need
       for an ongoing engagement with our sponsors.

       VP Fundraising again raises concerns about the potential for sponsors
       at the Bronze level seeing sponsorship as "buying a link" rather than
       sponsoring the foundation. On this occasion a new sponsor raised some
       concerns. I continue to defer to VP Fundraising to set policy, but I
       have enquired as to what needs to happen before this is considered a
       problem. My concern is that one sponsor expressing a concern may be
       many more not taking the time to make the observation.

       Marketing and Publicity
       ==================

       Business as usual with the normal press and analyst engagements.

       Sally has also been working with Melissa and Sharan to explore
       community partnerships at ApacheCon.

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       We are finally moving on our search for infrastructure team members.
       Our continued "in the loop" search continued to only attract
       applicants that were outside of our price range. However, with a new
       and very broad outreach we are now being "flooded" with applications.
       My thanks go to David who is working with the Infra team to work
       through these proposals. 

       The team have hit a major milestone with the puppetization of the
       Jenkins and BuildBot services. The next major project is to migrate
       Jira from aging hardware.

       The Git experiment has little to report, which is a "good thing" as it
       means it is working reasonably well. The team continue to expand the
       work. This is an item I want to push forward once our team is fully
       resourced. As previously asserted I believe allowing projects to use
       the GitHub as a canonical repository (with appropriate safeguards as
       discussed) is an important part of the reduction of operations
       overhead.

       TAC
       ===

       Around 10 months ago we discussed reviewing the TAC questions to
       ensure they met the goals of the foundation with respect to community
       development. While there have been some tweaks to the questions this
       work has not yet been carried out. Mostly due to a lack of volunteer
       energy to drive this difficult task.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


       There will be a discussion on many of these points in the
       Discussion section of the board meeting.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operations continue as normal. We are operating with a slight deficit
       but our cash reserves are still healthy. Treasurer still needs to find
       out a suitable way to make use of our bitcoin wallet, no progress has
       been made there.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

    We are entering the last month of the CFP for ApacheCon Europe, so
    this is when we expect to see some talks actually coming in. Once
    we have a schedule, we will start promoting the event more.
    However, we have already seem significantly more
    Twitter/Facebook/G+ activity around the event than we have seen
    around the last few events, which is a good early sign.

    Registration
    ApacheCon Europe        14
    Apache: Big Data Europe 15

    CFPs
    ApacheCon Europe        48

       The Board expressed continuing concern that the PMC was not
       acting independently and that one company had undue influence
       over the project.

       PMC representatives acknowleged the Board's concerns and asked
       for clarity from the Board in the form of explicit actions
       that the PMC should be taking to improve the situation.

       It was suggested that a representative from the board could
       meet with senior company management to relate the board's
       concerns directly.
       
       It was agreed that the project should report again next month.

       A special report was presented verbally by Dennis Hamilton
       during the board concall. Below are notes on that report:

           Dennis:
              lots of activity on security and developer lists
              issued an advisory on a security issue
              will release a hot fix early next week
              general ability to respond: taking too long and no
                solution for quick releases for all platforms binaries
              there is pushback on releasing patch releases for stable
                platforms
              don’t know if there can be consensus on releasing
                security patches
              steep learning curve for new volunteers
              down to about 6 people who are experts in the code base

           Jim:
              Board feedback was given to PMC
              Discussion morphed into a build platform issue
              Will continue to monitor and stimulate discussion over
                the long term plan for the project

           Dennis:
             Some discussion has spilled over to the dev list.

           Mark:
             Currently lurking on private list
             Response to security issues is not adequate

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Executive VP responsibilities

    B. Status of Infrastructure Lead

    C. Paid support for other areas and impact on fundraising

    Please refer to this month's President's report for background
    information for this discussion.

    A. Executive VP responsibilities

    Can we increase responsibilities of EVP role?

    Jim: seems Rich’s heart is in ApacheCon so it makes more sense to
    have someone to take more of Ross’s responsibilities and have Rich
    focus on conferences

    Ross: While Rich is focused on conferences, he has been very
    involved in other issues. Biggest concern is workload, and need
    people who can step up.

    Chris: Maybe it’s time to create a VP, Conferences role

    Ross: But we want to move away from the ApacheCon model to
    project-focused conferences

    Rich: One concern is the relationship between conferences and brands

    Marvin: Is there an issue with reporting relationships for
    contractors?

    Ross: There should not be confusion. The buck stops at the VP; the
    President (or EVP) is only there to unblock issues

    Jim: Foresees EVP getting more involved in sponsors and fundraising,
    hiring infra

    @Ross: Prepare a proposal for VP, Conferences

    @Jim: Prepare a proposal for EVP role

    B. Status of Infrastructure Lead

    Ross: Operations vs. Infra: should not have both paid management
    positions

    Tom: focus now is on back filling staff that we have lost

    Brett: What does infra look like going forward?

    Chris: What happened to the Infra Lead Search Committee? Didn’t go
    anywhere.

    Ross: The Infra Lead didn’t get much traction. We’re looking now at
    Infra Lead as specifically technical. We need to hire senior
    technical infrastructure staff

    Chris: Adding more infrastructure doesn’t make sense without
    strategy for solving the VP Infra position

    Ross: We are backfilling contractors but still intend to hire
    technical infra lead. Still have a problem with liaison between
    infra and projects

    Marvin: Pleased with efforts to staff infra

    Chris: Also pleased with backfilling progress

    @Chris: Kick off discussion on @members for VP Infra

    @Brett: Make sure discussion progresses in time for next board
    meeting

    C. Paid support for other areas and impact on fundraising

    Brett: Do we have a model for infra going forward?

    Chris: I just don't feel that as an ASF member or community member
    that I know exactly what the direction is for infra, and strategy,
    etc.

    Ross: There are proposals on the table that are being discussed. But
    they are not formal enough to vote on at the moment.

    Jim: Maybe we can prioritize based on immediate need (e.g. TAC is
    time sensitive)

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

TAC:

Despite repeated emails to VP, TAC over the past month and a half, I am not
receiving responses. I spoke w/Ross about this in July; Ross sent an email to
Nick on July 14th – no response.

Meanwhile:
•	I created a DRAFT timeline for ACEU16 and sent to the TAC team (~July 14th)
to review/edit/modify/etc. – no response.
•	TAC has received a few emails advising of tac applications submitted
(they’re not full applications – just a name and answer to the first
question). Again, despite several emails to Nick inquiring about this, I still
have not received a response.
•	TAC was supposed to be reviewing/revising the application questions based on
feedback received from past participants and with speaking with folks at
ACNA16 and OSCON. – Despite repeated emails re this and if it’s being done, I
have heard nothing.
•	Main page on http://apache.org/travel/ still reflects all the info for
ApacheCon Vancouver – despite my emails re this.
•	There is no obvious info on the website for ACEU 16 (since it still has info
for ACNA16)…the only way to get any info on ACEU 16 is to click on the “online
application” – from there, it pulls up info for Seville. Which, oddly enough,
I see the dates have now changed… “Time is very tight for this event, so
applications will open on Aug. 14, 2016 and will end on Sept. 30, 2016 - to
give enough time for travel arrangements to be made. Notifications will be
sent out by Oct. 5, 2016.” …. Last I knew, the applications were due to open
on July 23rd??!! But then again, what do I know since no one has responded to
my (repeated) inquiries.?!!?

ApacheCon:

* Collaborating with Sally and Sharan re preparations for the ASF booth at
  ACEU.

Operations:

* Following up on the past-due invoice received for the Directors and Officers
  insurance (payment already sent – advised CSC of this). 

Fundraising and  Trademarks:
*Continuous monitoring of both 

Misc:
*Handled misc requests for Apache stickers


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Complex questions and heated discussion threads continue to pour through
trademarks@ from a variety of PMCs and outside parties alike.  Even accounting
for the slowdown of responses during many recent summer vacations, the trend
of notable issues requiring thoughtful and knowledgeable responses continues
to grow faster than the number of volunteers providing regular and productive
assistance. 

A PMC with a popular project is requesting international registrations in
European Union, Japan, and India for their project name, and have supplied a
detailed and well-thought-out rationale for the expense and effort for the
additional registrations (a US application is in process already).  Notably, a
company working in this space has volunteered to help cover the legal costs of
the registration in a way that properly respects our fundraising policies.

While there are outstanding issues relating to the PMC's work on policing
third party uses of their brand, I support the additional registrations and
hope to work with operations@ on an appropriate way to secure greater rights
for the ASF while minimizing our actual expenses.  Unfortunately the
discussion on the PMC's progress became more heated and widespread than I
thought would be productive.

Several trademark policy improvements are being proposed to better clarify
allowable third party uses, in response to both existing projects as well as
an incubating project's questions about ability to allow the project donor to
continue using the brand.  The policy for incoming names will be clarified to
ensure it's clear that when donating a software product brand or trademark, it
must be fully donated to the ASF, and the original donor does not retain any
special rights.  For cases where the original donor still has questions, the
best advice will be for the podling to choose a new, unique name that the ASF
can fully own.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities continue normally.

The main focus this month was closing two sponsor renewals [1].

Jim resigned as VP fundraising and that led to discussions about the role of
VP Fundraising. I suspect the discussions will continue as there were a few
proposals in the past about how to structure the fundraising work.

Another discussion thread was triggeres by a new sponsor. After an initial
offer to sponsor he came back with a comment regarding concerns of their board
of being associated with questionable businesses via our Thanks page, due to a
few, let's say atypical, new bronze sponsors. After answering his concerns he
decided to move forward and become an ASF sponsor. I am convinced such
discussions will continue to pop up, as I said in previous reports, we
continue to monitor the situation. Like Jim mentioned, it is a frustrating
situation that was completely avoidable. For now it's not getting worse so
there is no decision or recommendation for change yet.

Hadrian is in vacation with spotty access to email and won't attend this
month's board meeting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget, with no outstanding invoices due
at this time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally Khudairi has
secured Sharan Foga to officially assist with the ASF booth at select
events, particularly those in Europe. Sally continues to counsel an
increasing number of vendors involved with various Apache projects
(both incubating and TLPs) with outreach and branding requirements.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

Kudu™ as a Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 106 weekly summaries published to date. 17 items were Tweeted on
@TheASF. No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel.

V. Future Announcements: one announcement is in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing
to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success
stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more
information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 11 media queries. Over the past
month, the ASF received 911 press clips vs. last month's clip count of
1,318. Our new reporting on media coverage of Apache projects yielded
4,337 press hits vs. last month's 4,813.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst queries. Apache was
mentioned in 48 reports by Gartner, 4 reports by Forrester, 18 reports
by 451 Research, and 6 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: through Sharan's ComDev contacts, Sally has
been acting as introductory liaison to ApacheCon + Apache: Big Data
producers, the Linux Foundation, for possible community partnerships.
Sally has also connected Sharan with Melissa Warnkin on preparations
for the ASF booth at ApacheCon Europe.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally is following
up on a possible partnership for a conference in Europe, via Rich
Bowen.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 35 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Short (and tardy) report this month. 

Hiring
--------- 

We saw the blog post announcing the open position get reposted to 
several remote working job boards and have had a decent response in 
terms of resumes showing up. We made a first pass over approximately 1/3 of
the incoming resumes as of this writing and hope to finish that first pass by
end of week. We've seen a number of promising resumes show up and hope to be
able to move forward with them. Hopefully we'll have material updates to
provide to this in the coming week. 

General activity
-------------------

Ongoing work on Jenkins and Buildbot slaves has finally coalesced into being
completely managed via puppet. This is a huge milestone as these are
relatively complex configurations and because of the number of machines it
involves. It's also gotten some critical acclaim[1]. This should make it much
easier for folks to get additional build dependencies installed in a more
self-service manner (simple pull request against the repo compared to filing a
ticket and having that done by infra) 

Work is in preparation for migrating our Jira instance off of our existing
hardware. The current hardware is approximately 6 years old, and our instance
has grown so much that the underlying database infrastructure on separate
machines is starting to become a constraint. 

Growing on our blocky (infrastructure-wide IP bans for violation of rules
against one or many hosts) we've added a dashboard to both manage the rules
and blocked IPs. 

Github experiment
-----------------------

Nothing material to report. Things seem to be largely 'just working' 
We are working on adding an incubator project to the github experiment - we
expect this will push the limits of the project as there are literally
thousands of incubator committers, so it should be an interesting threshold to
pass and gauge our ability to cover them.

   into "dev" (developer discussions), "reviews" (code review requests), and
   "issues" (JIRA notifications).
   This split has been positive; it cut down unnecessary noise coming from
   automated notifications on "dev" so that developers can easily find emails
   pertaining to actual development-related questions/discussions.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Conor MacNeill]

Apache Ant Status Report - August 2016

Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools. It consists
of 4 main projects:

- Ant - core and libraries (Antlibs)
- Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
- IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
- EasyAnt - Ant and Ivy toolbox to support build processes

The main development activity is on support of Java9 in Ant Core. This includes
support of Java modules in <junit>.

While working on Java9 support we had several discussions with the Java
development team because of discovered bugs/changes in the JDK
(e.g. changed behaviour of DateFormat.SHORT used in <touch> or
invisibility of tool classes Ant uses for <rmic>, <javac> and <javah>).

Work is ongoing.

o Release Status

Core
Ant 1.9.7 was release on April 12th, 2016

Ivy
Ivy 2.4.0 was released on December 26, 2014 Ivy-DE 2.2.0 was released
on November 22, 2013

EasyAnt
The current release is still from the Incubator 0.9-Incubating.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Henri Yandell]

The Attic is where projects slumber when their communities fade away.

Continuum has moved to the Attic.
Bloodhound and Etch are in the process of moving to the Attic. 
The Axis PMC have asked for assistance in moving Axis v1 to the Attic. 

Activity is low. The Attic could use some energy towards generating advice 
on how to keep out of the Attic, some more energy on the mundane 
clean up work, and energy on encouraging energy.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Alex Boisvert]


Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages
and tools.

Our last release (v1.4.25) happened on April 4th, 2016.

Development and community activity remains low, with only a handful of
emails and Jira updates on average every month (due to low activity,
activity tend to be "bursty" around releases). Our last committer/PMC
change happened in October 2013.

As reported previously, I (Alex Boisvert) have decided to step down as
PMC Chair for the Buildr project.  Following the recent vote
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5b3b645bd4bda001c4b9f749efea7e18aa41efa4342e0bfad45416fc@%3Cprivate.buildr.apache.org%3E),
Antoine Toulme should become our next PMC Chair.  I will send a resolution
for the Board to approve/reject.

Otherwise, we have no issues that require board attention

the past months, number of messages slightly down (~ 8%) which is probably
just usual fluctuation.

GSoC-related discussions are happening on mentors@ with number of messages
fluctuating with GSoC phase.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

 Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------ 
Since the last report, email and commit activity continues to move along
slowly.  There has been not much other activity.

The .12 release was finally done in June

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Community
--------- 
The last committer was elected in August, 2012. In September 2013 Phil
Ottlinger was elected to join the PMC. There was recently a discussion about
adding a new committer/pmc member. The vote just needs to be started.


Releases
-------- 
Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016 
Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014 
Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description: Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.  

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:
- Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile. 
- DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider
component of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

##Releases
- 3.0.10 was released on August 8, 2016
- 3.1.7 was released on  August 8, 2016

## Activity: 

This quarter was primarily spent fixing bugs for 3.1.7 and getting that
stabilized.  3.1.7 also introduced better spring-boot support which has been
asked for by several users.   We received several contributions toward that
goal and we are hoping the contributions from those individuals will continue
in hopes of getting a new committer or two from it.

Fediz 1.3.1 is under vote now with some minor fixes as well as upgrading to
CXF 3.1.7.   1.2.3 should be released soon as well.

DOSGi 2.0 is being worked on with hopes of releasing it by the end of the
quarter.   The major change here is the split with the "abstract API's" moving
to Apache Aries and the CXF DOSGi being an implementation of the API's based
on CXF.


## PMC changes:

- Currently 22 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Andriy Redko on Tue Sep 09 2014

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 37 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Francesco Chicchiricco at Mon Nov 30 2015

It has been a while since the last committer addition.  We're hoping some of
the new spring-boot contributions can lead to a new committer.  In general,
however, CXF is a mature project implementing mature specs.

  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09
  None on the horizon.

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.
  Since then there have been some changes, but it will need someone to
  initiate the release process.

  No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

  There was some activity on the dev mail list, with two PMC members
  participating: One committer commenced an additional skin based on the
  Bootstrap framework. Another committer assisted a little. I am surprised that
  there was not any other comment.

  Two PMC members were present during the quarter.

  At this report, four other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Activity: Low
  3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues published:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  Initial Bootstrap-based skin.

  Improved documentation to link to the new lists.apache.org interface.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model 
and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores, 
key value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data 
with extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce support.
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
Gora development has mainly involved GSoC efforts with two projects
this year. This is the fourth or fifth year Gora has participated in
GSoC and the work is going very well. Othe aspects of the community
have been reasonably quiet however we are very close to a release now.
In recent months we have added a number of modules to the codebase
from external contributors. 
   
## Health report:
There are ideas to present some of the community work at the forthcoming
ApacheCon EU. An update on Gora was presented a while back at the 
NASA JPL Open Developer Meetup in Pasadena, CA, U.S.A

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description:

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

## Issues:

The groovy-lang.org has been transferred to the Apache Software Foundation.
We still have the dichotomy between the groovy-lang.org website,
and groovy.apache.org which is still pointing at groovy-lang.org.

## Activity:

We made a new release on June 7th, with version 2.4.7.

We're still investigating how to make more automatic releases,
some experiments have started in this area,
during the Gradle Summit conference.

This quarter, we got 22 contributors to the codebase,
including 15 non-committers, 6 of which were new.

## Health report:

Compared to last year's 12.7M downloads, up until July,
we are already at 12M downloads for the first 7 months of the year
(across both Maven Central and Bintray JCenter).

We have a bit more users (7% increase) on the users list,
but the number of posts has decreased.
The summer period is often a bit less busy, so probably not worrying.
However we have a bit more trafic on the dev list,
indicating more discussions going on, which is good.

Less tickets opened compared to last quarter, but more tickets closed.

In terms of social presence, Groovy is 16th in the TIOBE language index.
The @ApacheGroovy twitter account reached 1758 followers,
compared to last quarter's 1475 (19% increase)

The GR8Conf Europe & US 2016 conferences have taken place,
and the next dedicated event will be the G3 Summit in December.

Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer

CMDA provides web services for multi-aspect physics-based and phenomenon-
oriented climate model performance evaluation and diagnosis through the
comprehensive and synergistic use of multiple observational data, reanalysis
data, and model outputs.

Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer has been incubating since 2015-05-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Enlarge the CMDA community;
 2. Develop stable platform to allow broad contributors to turn in code;
 3. Develop a streamline procedure to allow the entire community to develop
    the CMDA project

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 In this month, the CMDA community focuses on developing the summer school
 program, in order to advocate and distribute CMDA 2.0, to educate more
 students on our latest product, and to attract more people to join our
 community. So far, we have received about 25 graduate students who show
 interest and will come to our summer school to learn CMDA 2.0 product and
 the platform.

 Meanwhile, with the great guidance from our mentors, the CMDA community
 has learned to run the project from various aspects in an Apache way. Many
 community meetings were held to streamline and develop our operation
 regulations. Here we just name a few strategies. Weekly community meetings
 are arranged with pre-distributed meeting agenda. Meeting invites are sent
 to all community members with open access to the weekly meetings. After
 each community meeting, various contributors/groups summarize their to-do
 items on the community mailing list, to welcome all community members'
 input. Community communication always adopts the community mailing list as
 carrier. More committers join the voting group. More committers are
 recommended based on their active performance in the community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 We have successfully encapsulated and deployed CMDA 2.0 onto Amazon cloud
 environment, leveraging docker technology to ensure scalability.
 Provenance engine is also deployed onto Amazon cloud to ensure that we
 gather all provenance during the summer school for further study and
 development of our project after the summer school.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

 * Chris Mattmann - The community has shown progress in addressing a near vote
   to terminate the podling. There were and still are concerns that need to be
   tended to and watched but as a mentor I am pleased by the efforts of Jia,
   Seungwon, and Lei whom I have seen contribute to the discussion. I think we
   should continue to closely evaluate the progress, but I am happy with this
   month.

  * Drew Farris - Three mentors active on the mailing lists. Kudos to Chris to
    the amount of engagement here. After choosing to avoid retirement the
    community is taking concrete steps to increase its engagement with ASF by
    establishing a web presence at Apache, creating committer accounts,
    preparing code for contribution and moving processes to the mailing lists.
    This podling is moving to a monthly reporting cycle for the next three
    months progress can be monitored closely.

Eagle

Apache Eagle (incubating) is an open source analytics solution for identifying
security and performance issues instantly on big data platforms, e.g. Apache
Hadoop, Apache Spark etc. It analyzes data activities, Yarn application,
Hadoop JMX metrics and daemon logs etc., provides state-of-the-art alert
engine to identify security breach, performance issues and shows insights.

Eagle has been incubating since 2015-10-26.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Eagle community is discussing graduation and use Apache maturity
    assessment to measure the gap to graduation. That should be completed,
    see
    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/EAG/Eagle+Podling+Maturity+Ass
      essment

 2. Complete one requirement from self assessment which is to provide a
    well-documented channel to report security issues, along with a
    documented way of responding to them.

 3. Identify other housekeeping before graduation, for example agreement on
    bylaws, PMC composition etc.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 NIL


How has the community developed since the last report?

 - Presented in Apache Con, May 2016
 - Presented in London Stratus + Hadoop, May 2016
 - Presented in San Jose Hadoop Summit, June 2016
 - Presented in DTCC2016 Beijing, China, May 2016
 - Presented in JavaCon, China, May 2016
 - Presented in Hadoop Summit, San Jose, China, June 2016
 - Presented in Data Asset Management Summit, Shanghai, China, July 2016

 Communities showed continuous interest in Apache Eagle project. Some
 company tried to integrate Eagle as part of whole solution and some
 contributed different use case to Eagle platform, for example MapR
 support, Oozie monitoring support etc.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Technically we added more documents for user to easily use Eagle

 Besides Hadoop security monitoring, we have started working on performance
 monitoring design and development based on the requests from community.

 As we may have multiple different use cases running on top of Eagle, a
 design discussion and prototype is conducted to make sure Eagle is a
 framework to host multiple use cases and user will use Eagle to manage
 those use cases.

 Alert engine is going to be decoupled from data processing so that alert
 engine will be multi-tenant and easy to be used by multiple use cases by
 incorporating well-designed metadata.

Fluo

Fluo is a distributed system for incrementally processing large data sets
stored in Accumulo.

Fluo has been incubating since 2016-05-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Attract new contributors
 2. Do a release
 3. Conduct a podling name search

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No

How has the community developed since the last report?

 We have a new contributor to Fluo since the last report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 We completed refactoring of code to use Apache names.  We attempted our
 first release of a parent pom (for both Fluo projects) and it failed on
 the incubator list.  A parent pom is a way to share build configuration
 among multiple projects.  We plan for Fluo and Fluo Recipes to both
 inherit the same parent pom and obtain common config for code formatting,
 findbugs, checkstyle rules, etc.  For this to work the parent pom needs to
 be released before the projects.

 The reason it failed is because members of the IPMC identified the
 following issues :

* Improper linking to pre-Apache releases of Fluo from website.
* Branding and linking issues with fluo.io domain, fluo-io GitHub org and
  projects.  The domain name and github org were used by the project before
  moving to Apache.

 This was really good feedback.  We want to remedy the issues identified
 and eliminate possible confusion around the Apache Fluo brand.  The
 following link identifies discussion of a possible way forward.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

JE: There was a very heavy discussion on branding spurred from the attempted VOTE
    thread. In the end, I believe this was a very positive discussion and resulted
    in fixing many branding issues. I believe most of them were due to the transition
    from an independent Github community to Apache (which included bringing the website).
    The PPMC has been extremely responsive to incubator feedback and I am very happy
    with the level of response they spearheaded (without mentor prodding/coaxing).

 95 in June, and 123 in July. Users do still occasionally post to the old
 SourceForge forums, but are then gently redirected to the mailing lists.

 Excluding project committers, the community has opened 5 pull requests, 2
 of which have been merged.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 The project has finished migrating to Apache infrastructure, including the
 project website. There is one major outstanding task, screen sharing,
 which has been blocking the release but is finally nearing completion.

 Since last report, the project has had roughly 250 commits, about 60% of
 which were directly related to the outstanding task mentioned above.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Apache Slider community/PPMC has voted to move portions of Slider into
    Apache Hadoop YARN as modules. It is possible that the remaining pieces
    will be moved at a later point in time or become obsolete or evolve to
    work closely with YARN. Slider PPMC will decide what makes the most
    sense as we progress through this exciting time.
 2. Getting more external users
 3. Growth of a diverse set of developers/committers/PMC members is also
    crucial towards the final state of Slider

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 The Apache Hadoop YARN community/PMC and Apache Slider community/PPMC has
 decided to move portions of Slider into YARN, to make fast and significant
 progress on: YARN-4692 - [Umbrella] Simplified and first-class support for
 services in YARN. As a result, portions like Slider Core, Application
 Master, Client and Tests will roll into Apache Hadoop YARN as module(s).
 This effort is being captured in: YARN-5079 : Native YARN framework layer
 for services. At this point, a branch has been created in the Hadoop
 codebase, and Slider has been selectively migrated. As a result of this,
 we are already seeing interest in the Hadoop committers/PMC, who have
 started to contribute and submit patches to Slider.

 In order to support existing users of Slider, and to provide seamless
 migration, there will be sufficient overlap between the time when a stable
 state of long running services support is available in some future version
 of YARN and the time till an independent Slider release is available. The
 community/PPMC will also determine the future state of Slider as we
 navigate through these changes.

 The discussions on the Slider and YARN community DLs can be viewed here -

 We released version 0.91.0-incubating in June, 2016 with significant work

with a preconfigured environment for interacting with Spark using Scala,
Python, R or SQL.

Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Resolve LGPL dependency: This is in progress, and hopefully we will
     have the dependency license changed to a license that is compatible
     with AL2.
  2. Make a release: 0.1.x branch should be ready for release. Master has moved to start support for Spark 2.0
  3. Grow a diverse community: We should put some emphasis on growing the
     community and making it diverse (the rule is at least three independent
     contributors)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  TOREE-262 - Progress on removal of LGPL dependency

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Active communication in mailing list and gitter with early adopters
  2. Still working on transitioning users from Spark Kernel project into
     Toree.
  3. More external contributions being made. Community member 2mariusvniekerk
  key in porting Toree to work on Spark 2.0. Sitting on PR 56.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Contrinue working with JeroMQ community to further their transition
     into MPL v2 and away from LGPL. 3 committers to go.
  2. Addressing issues opened by community

Date of last release:

  None since incubation.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No new additions since incubation

Traffic Control

Traffic Control allows you to build a large scale content delivery network
using open source.

Traffic Control has been incubating since 2016-07-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Get set up with all resources (git / mailing lists / JIRA / irc / etc)
 2. Name search / name sign off
 3. Prepare for next release under apache process

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 This is the first report, we are just getting started.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 This is the first report, we are just getting started. ICLAs are done.

Date of last release:

 We released 1.6.0 on 2016-07-29 under the old process, because the release
 process (candidates and votes) had already started before our official
 entry in the incubator. Our next release will be the first release where
 we will follow the Apache incubator process.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Unomi

Unomi is a reference implementation of the OASIS Context Server specification
currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical Committee. It
provides a high-performance user profile and event tracking server.

Unomi has been incubating since 2015-10-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Continued releases, and updated dependencies
 2. Grow up user and contributor communities, seeing more contribution/PR

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 None

How has the community developed since the last report?

 The activity of the dev mailing list smoothly increased, discussing key
 enhancements in the project.

 We are now targeting the development of the user community.  For that, we
 discussed about improving and polishing the website. Today, it's obvious
 that it's not easy to understand what Unomi can do and actually does.  The
 purpose is to give more use cases and introduction on the mailing list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 The first Apache Unomi 1.0.0-incubating has been released.

 We updated key dependencies and implemented couple of new releases in
 addition of the bug fixes.  The purpose is to cut off a new release asap.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security
policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.4 release on
April 23, 2016.  The next major release is scheduled for August 30, 2016.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Tugba Dogan on September 7, 2015.
The last PMC member was Rafa Haro, voted in on August 31, 2015.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been moderate this quarter.  Issues reported have been
mainly garden-variety bugs.  We've had several feature requests but few
contributions.  Dev list comments for this period have also been light, with
occasional user questions.  I am unaware of any mailing list question that
has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

# Marmotta Board Report for August 2016

## Description: 

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012, and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

As the previous, this has not been a very active period either. Most 
of the issues we targeted for 3.4.0 still remain open. So we are discussing 
how to move forward with the release in the next few weeks 
(https://s.apache.org/pzef).

The reduction of frequent contributions from many of the core members
is affecting the project development and support. Therefore we have 
started to look for solutions to grow the community and help in the 
future development. Mark A. Matienzo has been recently added as 
Committer and PMC member (https://s.apache.org/ztE6).

W3C has kicked-off a relevant Community Group for evolving LDP
(https://www.w3.org/community/ldpnext/). The new recent member (Mark)
could represent the project, although goals has not yet been discussed.

## Health report: 

The project was considered feature-complete in 3.3.0. The current release 
cicle (3.4.0) focused on refining and fixing bug, plus incorporation some 
non-core new features. The development (issues, commits, emails) has 
significantly come down in the last months.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - Mark A. Matienzo was added as a PMC member on Wed Aug 03 2016.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache MetaModel Project  [Kasper Sørensen]

## Description:

Providing a common interface for discovery, exploration of metadata
and querying of different types of data sources.

## Issues:

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

 - A new (confluence) wiki is being set up to replace the current
   MoinMoin wiki.
 - A new SPI-based API have been added to MetaModel, making it possible to
   dynamically add new modules. We believe this approach makes integration
   with other projects such as Apache Calcite (and thereby also e.g.
   Apache Drill) much easier (see CALCITE-1304).

## Health report:

 - The 4.x releases occur at a steady pace, growing maturity.
 - The community does not seem to grow very much, but supporters are loyal. It
   is my impression that we lag behind on “marketing” activities to make the
   project more known.
 - The future 5.x release is ambitious in trying to broaden MetaModel’s scope
   by adding a RESTful HTTP API on top of the existing Java API.

## PMC changes:

releases are going out regularly for bug fixing. Updated modules contained bug
fixing were released June 20th 2016 . At the moment we are working on JSON Web
Encryption support (  OLTU-80 - Implement JWE support for JWT In Progress ).
Users activity is growing slowly but steadily (the user@ mailing list has got
new messages from new users). Lately we have been fixing a bunch of users
reported issues hence the new  release.

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

Development on the project has been great since the last report. July and
especially early August have seen very high contributions from a number
of our regular contributors. We haven't seen an increase in new contributors,
but Google Summer of Code brought a good amount of activity to the project with
both Omkar and Ibrahim making great contributions to the project.

The project released v 1.1.0 late in July which provides a number of key
features required of the tool in addition to many quality-of-life
improvements. The team is working hard towards 1.2 and a number of new
features.

Issues for the Board:

used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

Apache-Test 1.39 was released on Apr 21, 2015

No new Apache-Test releases since 2015-11.

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Apache-SizeLimit 0.97 was released on Apr 02, 2012

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since 2015-11.

--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Apache-Bootstrap 0.07 was released on Jul 13, 2009

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since 2015-11.


--- Apache-Reload --

using DBI.

Apache-DBI 1.12 was released on June 12nd, 2013

No new Apache-DBI releases since 2015-11.

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
fixes are applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

The 2.0.9 release has caused some more healthy activity, and development
is continuing.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, with a bump in activity
following the 2.0.9 RCs and the final release.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened since the last report.

The PMC has currently 11 members

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache REEF Project  [Markus Weimer]

## Description: 
 Apache REEF (Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework) is a  library for 
 developing portable applications for cluster resource managers such as 
 Apache Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos.  
  
## Issues: 
 No issues require the board's activity at this time.
  
## Activity: 
- REEF 0.15 was released in the report period. It contains significant
  improvements to REEF.NET
- We've seen a significant uptick in the interest in and work towards a fully
  functional REEF.NET on Linux
- Twitter released their new streaming platform Heron in version 0.14. In this
  version, it can be run on Apache Hadoop YARN via a scheduler implemented in
  REEF.

## Health report: 
 Overall, the community is healthy: We've seen several new people introduce
 themselves on the dev list, and many of them have started contributing
 already.

 Activity has been down a little bit, which seems to be due to the summer
 vacation schedule of our community. This also caused us to slip on the post-
 graduation cleanup of our PMC membership we asked about in the last report.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description:
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - There was one release of the Java library over the last quarter. It fixed
   some backwards compatiblity regressions, a BASE-64 encoding issue as well
   as another couple of minor issues. No other issues have cropped up since
   then, so no release is expected in the next quarter.

## Health report:
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC. Right now there are no obvious potential new committers for the
   project.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 6 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Marc Giger on Wed Apr 03 2013

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 16 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
 - Last committer addition was Marc Giger in July 2012

## Releases:

 - Apache Santuario XML Security for Java 2.0.7 was released on Fri Jun 17
   2016.

## JIRA activity:

 - 9 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 9 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

-----------------------------------------
Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Bert Huijben]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library
   built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the
   default client library of Apache Subversion and Apache OpenOffice.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   The project had another three very quiet months. Some time was
   spent on testing the recently added features, and looking at some user
   reported issues around OpenSSL and Kerberos.

## Health report: 
   Activity is at a normal, fairly quiet level.

   The serf project's activity is quite related to that of Subversion
   and with that projects recent affairs we slowed more than expected.

## PMC & Committer changes: 
   Currently 11 PMC members and 12 committers. Our last new committer was
   added on Wed Sep 02 2015.

## Releases: 
   No ASF releases yet. Last pre-ASF release 2014-10-20. We are trying to
   get both the 1.3.x stable branch and trunk back in a fully releasable
   state.

   1.3.x: This branch was released pre-ASF and making it a full ASF
   release is a bit destabilizing for a release branch, and by that needs
   more review than any previous release. I hope that the delay on 1.4
   (=trunk), will make us release a new 1.3.x within the next few weeks.
   Branko has some OpenSSL work in progress for better OS/X build support

   trunk (1.4.x): This branch had quite a bit of new development before
   switching to the ASF and then later on when we added full HTTP/2 support.
   This code needed some time for testing, which it now had. I think we
   need to review which parts need to be visible in the public api and
   which not. Generating proper doxygen docs from this branch would be
   nice, but I think we should do the comment fixups for that before
   branching.

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   Normal activity.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment BF: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The
SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and enables the
creation of metadata objects which comply with the model of
international standards. The SIS referencing module enable the
construction of geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing such
as axis, projection and coordinate reference system definitions, along
with the associated operations which enable the mathematical conversion
of coordinates between different systems of reference.


## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

Released Apache SIS 0.7 in May. This is the first release that depends
on the EPSG geodetic dataset, which can be redistributed but not under
terms compatible with Apache 2 license. As suggested in LEGAL-183 [1]
and after discussion on the SIS mailing list [2], we deployed the EPSG
geodetic dataset on Maven Central in an "org.apache.sis.non-free"
groupId. This non-free artifact is not included in Apache releases and
users who need its functionalities have to declare the Maven dependency
themselves.

Prepared an Apache SIS 0.7.1 bug-fix release in July [3], but the call
for vote got no reply from someone else than the poster. Acknowledging
that there is apparently no strong demand for a 0.7.1 bug-fix release,
the new proposal [4] is to wait for 0.8 release.

We did some progress on the Apache SIS developer guide [5], especially
in the section about spatial reference systems.

Helping the ncWMS project [6] to migrate their spatial referencing
framework from Geotk to Apache SIS. I hope to do the same for an Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC) toolkit [7] later this year.

Google Summer of Code project is continuing. We hope to start merging
some parts of the work into Apache SIS this week.


## Health report:

The project is reported as healthy by the report helper, but the commits
are still mostly from one person. Another committer (Johann Sorel)
became more active recently and his activity is expected to increase as
future SIS development shifts more toward various storage formats, but
he is from the same company. The Google Summer of Code student is
committing in a repository clone on GitHub.

variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community continues to operate in a healthy fashion, with
  continued activity on the dev@ and user@ mailing lists.

  As a mature project, we are not attracting new developers like we
  did a decade ago (heh) ... but we continue to accomodate all
  newcomers and make it easy for them to contribute and to become part
  of the larger community.
  
  Last PMC addition: December 2015.
  Last committer addition: November 2015.

* Releases

  Last releases were made on April 28, 2016: 1.9.4 and 1.8.16.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiriccò]

## Description:
Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in
enterprise environments.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
The activity level on user@ is still slowly growing, especially with new users
asking directions for milestone releases in preparation of 2.0.0.
The work towards 2.0.0 seems to be fruitful: we are finalizing the new
documentation and improving our Apache Camel-based provisioning features. There
is also an ongoing effort to provide Apache Syncope with identity
recertification capabilities.
The experience with Google Summer of Code is evolving: the Eclipse plugin
(SYNCOPE-809) is doing fine, is expected to be completed according to the
original schedule and is going to be part of the 2.0.0 release; the Netbeans
plugin (SYNCOPE-808), instead, failed the mid-term review but was submitted
anyway as incomplete pull request on GitHub.
About the Syncope PoC with infra, we are currently on hold waiting for the
availability of a "playground zone" - see INFRA-10931 for details.

## Health report:
The overall activity is consistently at good level: discussion on project
features and improvements are coordinated on dev@, contributions are regularly
accepted as pull requests on GitHub.
We have reported a new contributor in the team list website page 
and elected a new committer (Matteo Di Carlo), who accepted.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 9 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Guido Wimmel on Sat Apr 05 2014

 releases outside of incubation. Those releases were voted on positively by
 the community and released the week of July 18th. We released 3.1.3 which
 was largely a maintenance packaging with some minor features and 3.2.1
 which is the recommended version to be on.

 Going forward, we expect to continue to maintain the 3.1.x line of code
 providing bug fixes when needed. New development continues on the 3.2.x
 line and we expect our initial release of Gremlin Language Variants[1] for
 Python to be part of that line, likely 3.2.2.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
 - 3.1.3 (July 18, 2016)
 - 3.2.1 (July 18, 2016)

## PMC/Committer:

 - Last PMC addition was Dylan Millikin - May 2016
 - Last committer addition was Michael Pollmeier - April 2016

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Turbine Project  [Thomas Vandahl]

Apache Turbine Project Board Report, August 2016

Apache Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java
developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you to
personalize the web sites and to use user logins to restrict access to parts
of your application.

Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the base
of many other projects.

Status

The Turbine project has again some increased activity in the last quarter.

The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.

Community changes

No new committers were voted in since the last board report.

The last change to the committer base was the addition of Georg Kallidis
(2012/09/19).

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

The last change to the PMC was the addition of Georg Kallidis (2013/09/30).

Turbine core project

We are in the process of migrating old applications to the new Turbine
framework. It turns out that a number of bugs have to be fixed, mostly in
supporting Fulcrum components. Also the new security model showed some
weaknesses which need to be addressed.

The last released version was Turbine 4.0-M2 (2015/12/22).

Fulcrum component project

Some bigger changes to the Fulcrum Security component. A few bugfixes to
others. A new release of Fulcrum Security Torque will probably require a
Torque 4.1 release first.

The last released component was Fulcrum Yaafi 1.0.7 (2015/10/09).

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release that integrates
Xerces-C.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature product.  There is little development activity other
than patch maintenance.  Most of the activity is in the Xalan-J subproject.
There are some participants reporting on their build and deployment issues.

We are still trying to get more participants to report on their integration
build attempts.  Work is continuing to perform integration builds using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 through 2015.  Some builds were recently 
performed for Solaris against the development SVN tree.  Some build
environment patches have yet to be committed to the code base, but are
documented in JIRA.

We are currently integrating the Xerces-C parser patch release into a
Xerces-C patch release.

Most of the communications traffic is via JIRA. Email list activity has been
stagnant for 3 months.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

We have been making slow progress towards a Xerces-J 2.12.0
release. A new contributor and one of the committers have been
scrubbing through JIRA to help build the release notes.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 100+ posts on the
j-dev and j-users lists since the beginning of June 2016.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

Xerces-C 3.1.4 was released on June 29th to address a security
vulnerability. We have a potential new committer who has been
contributing several patches since the beginning of July.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 85+ posts on the
c-dev and c-users lists since the beginning of June 2016.

The latest release is Xerces-C 3.1.4 (June 29th, 2016).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development
activity over the reporting period.

XML Commons

There are some broken links on the website that were recently
reported. We plan to fix those. Nothing else to report.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in February 2015 (Xerces-C) 
and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

No new PMC members since the last report. The most recent addition
to the PMC was in June 2016.

One committer has committed changes to SVN since June.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache XML Graphics Project  [Glenn Adams]

## Description:

 - The Apache XML Graphics Project is responsible for software
   intended for the creation & maintenance of the conversion of XML
   formats to graphical output & related software components.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - During this reporting period, activity on the three sub-projects
   has been less than in prior periods. The recent conversion to a
   Maven based build project continues to be popularized in the
   community and its use (as opposed to Ant) appears to be increasing.

 - The second of two security related reports created against the
   Batik sub-project was resolved, with the first resolved last period.

## Health:

 - The level of community and developer activity remains at a
   fairly low level for a relatively mature product, albeit one
   with a fair number of outstanding unresolved issues.

   A challenge faced by the project is recruiting more committers to
   assist in resolving the backlog of issues. At present, there are a
   total of 839 open, reopened, and in progress JIRA issues in the
   three sub-projects, distributed as follows:

   XMLGraphicsCommons   18
   Batik               341
   FOP                 480

   There are 3058 previously Resolved and closed issues. So current
   non-resolved, non-closed issues account for a total of 21% of all
   issues ever opened against these sub-projects.

 - The PMC Chair recommends that the PMC undertake an effort to
   recruit more committers. A discussion has been initiated in
   the PMC on the subject of increasing the project's activity
   level, including attracting new committers, improving the
   outstanding issue count, and other activities.

## PMC:

 - No new PMC member during this period.
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - Simon Steiner was added to the PMC on Tue Jan 19 2016

## Committers:

 - No new committer during this period.
 - Currently 21 committers.
 - Last committer addition was Matthias Reischenbacher, May 2015

## Releases:

 - No releases during this period.
 - XMLGraphics Commons 2.1 was released on Wed Jan 13 2016
 - XMLGraphics FOP 2.1 was released on Wed Jan 13 2016

## Mailing Lists:

 - Slight decrease in number of subscribers.  Mail lists show a 26%
   reduction in message traffic from the previous period, down from
   701 to 517.

Attachment BV: Special Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project [Dennis Hamilton]

Although the Board relates its comments to the PMC and asks about the PMC, 
I pointed out that recently, most conversations have been on the AOO security 
list and now the developer (and QA) lists.  In particular, conversations about 
how the project proceeds, what resources it needs/has, and the handling of 
now-disclosed security vulnerabilities are on dev@.  With regard to senior ASF 
members watching the PMC list and being silent, I requested that there be more 
visibility, if only to have the PMC reminded that we are being observed for 
how we are dealing with matters of importance that have been conveyed from the 
Board.  It is important for the PMC and the project to understand that the 
Board is not forgetful.

1. Monthly Reporting.  

Apache OpenOffice will report monthly from now on, although the non-quarterly 
reports will not be comprehensive.  I propose that focus be on the key issues 
where on-going visibility is called for.  I have committed to that as the 
Chair, and my successor would be expected to follow suit.  

Key observations.  Today, there was no opportunity to consult with the PMC, 
so these are clearly my personal observations.  My verbal report was not so 
comprehensive.

2. Handling of Security

In the past 60 days there have been imminent disclosure of an unexploited 
vulnerability (with proof-of-concept), working out of a hotfix approach that 
avoids full-up binary releases, response to disclosure with an advisory and a 
source patch, and, now, readiness of tested hotfixes with end-user procedure 
for general availability.  The project has now taught itself, after much 
to-and-fro, how to accomplish this.  Were there another vulnerability that 
could be remedied in this way, it could be done in much less time.

It remains problematic how to provide emergency releases that put new installs 
into the hands of users.  There is no consensus on the need for doing so 
separate from crunching toward feature releases instead. There is push-back 
against even going through what might be essentially fire drills (with real 
patches) to confirm controlled ways of doing this.  This despite there being 
some pent-up issues that would qualify and could grow to emergencies.  There is 
also significant effort to upgrade the OpenOffice dependencies on external 
resources to use the latest versions for their vulnerability repairs, lest the 
vulnerabilities be exposures to OpenOffice.  No source release nor binary 
distributions reflect these updates.

There are insufficient resources to attend to security analysis and preparation 
of emergency patch/maintenance releases concurrent with focused progress toward 
a feature release.  There is ongoing investigation and discussion on this topic.

3. Trademarks

At the July Board meeting, there was concern about what to do about branding 
and trademarks if it is concluded that the Apache OpenOffice project must 
retire or pivot away from providing end-user distributions. My recommendation, 
today, is that this question cannot be addressed up front.  It is necessary to 
first determine what the stages of any retirement would be and how soft-landing 
of user-facing resources would be accomplished.  Given a practicable scenario, 
it would be appropriate to determine how branding and trademarks can best be 
handled.

4. Existential Questions and the OpenOffice Contingent Future

In partial response to the July Board feedback, there has been a renewed effort 
to seek additional volunteers for work on Apache OpenOffice development.  This 
is done in the face of an aging and disappearing population of developers with 
ready-to-hand subject-matter knowledge of OpenOffice, its code base, and the 
development/deployment methodologies on which it rests.  The learning curve for 
additions to that population is challenging.  There are not resources and 
skills for mentoring and cultivating interested beginners who have the 
necessary persistence.

While worthwhile, and the project is pouring its heart into this, this is not a 
short-term remedy to immediate concerns.

The fundamental reality is that, from a development perspective, the project is 
being held together by about a half-dozen part-time volunteers.
