    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Welcome to the new board, elected by the members last month! I’d like
       to particularly welcome Isabel, Marvin and Mark, each serving as a
       director for the first time.

       Our gratitude goes to the outgoing directors Rich, David and Sam for
       all that they did during their term.

       Everything went well during the meeting. We elected 58 new members,
       and will announce them next month after the final paperwork has been
       received. We also passed a resolution to convert a number of inactive
       members to emeritus status, but would certainly welcome them back again
       in the future! Thanks to the STeVe project for their work on a new
       voting front-end that was used at the meeting.

       I’ve included my report from the Annual Members Meeting below.       

       -----

       It has been another outstanding year for the Apache Software
       Foundation, marked by continued growth and success of our top-level
       project communities, and the steady addition of new top-level
       projects.

       Since the 2015 Annual Members Meeting, we have added 15 new projects:
       Parquet, Orc, Whimsy, NiFi, Lens, Ignite, Usergrid, Serf, Yetus,
       Brooklyn, Calcite, Kylin, Groovy, REEF and Arrow; while 6 existing
       projects have retired to the Attic: Lenya, DirectMemory, Deltacloud,
       Shindig, Onami and Rave. Overall we find ourselves with 171 top-level
       projects, with 45 additional projects under incubation.

       At the last meeting, we easily met quorum after the challenges the
       prior year. This is something we will continue to monitor and address
       through encouraging proxies, and reaching out to inactive members who
       may be considering emeritus status. Nevertheless, with over 200
       members joining it is extremely encouraging to to have such a large
       number of our members participating in the governance of the
       Foundation.

       In 2015, we elected 108 new Members, expanding our representation
       across the various project communities to a total of 603 members as of
       February 20. We also elected a new board, with Shane Curcuru returning
       to the board, and David Nalley joining for the first time. I thank all
       the directors for their service to the Foundation over the last 12
       months!

       The board has functioned well, bringing diverse opinions but making
       clear decisions. The board has balanced discussion of Foundation
       issues with a focus on projects and their reports. We’ve continued to
       improve tooling in several areas, and formed the Whimsy PMC, in
       addition to the existing Steve PMC, to build tools that help the
       Foundation run smoothly.

       We have seen continued success from our operations, as detailed in the
       President’s report, and inline with budget. We have made a transition
       to new staffing arrangements that have increased costs, which will
       need to be addressed in the budget over the next couple of years.

       For the first time, the ASF released an Annual Report, a significant
       effort that helped share specific details of the ASF’s impact with our
       sponsors and the public.

       Thank you to the President, EVP, VPs and the committees they work
       with, many of which expended significant time as volunteers, to keep
       the Foundation ticking day to day. We also thank Chris Mattmann for
       his service as Treasurer, as he prepares to transition the role to a
       new volunteer in the next board year.

       Through these Foundation-level developments, we support the
       communities that make up our top-level projects. I can report that the
       Apache Way continues to show the benefit of community-led development
       throughout our existing projects, and an attractive reason for other
       projects to join through the Incubator.

       I’m pleased that in the last year we have managed to initiate some
       changes that have a potentially significant cultural impact, while
       carefully ensuring that we retain the unique Apache DNA. We have had
       additional projects take advantage of proposing TLPs directly to the
       board where incubation was not deemed necessary. We have also expanded
       support for GitHub use by ASF projects, and began experiments through
       the Whimsy project to assess some of the technical (and later
       cultural) impact.

       One of the Foundation’s strengths is that by building communities, we
       not only build software but also build relationships that extend
       beyond that development. Therefore, we acutely feel the loss of valued
       members of the community. It is with great sadness that we saw the
       passing of Ian Lynch, Nóirín Plunkett, and Adrian Crum in the last
       year. Their memory, and their contributions, will carry on through our
       communities, and our thoughts remain with their families and friends.

       Thank you to the entire ASF community for making it such a wonderful
       place to contribute, and for the privilege it has been to serve as
       Chairman.

    B. President [Ross]

       Executive Assistant continues to keep critical activities moving in
       support of our volunteers. Primary focus in the last month has been
       TAC and ApacheCon.

       Trademarks has seen a few complex issues in the last month. Shane is
       working on documentation to assist PMCs seeking to "self-serve". See
       http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/templates/ and
       http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/guide. Shane is explicitly
       calling for member feedback, in addition to assistance on clarifying
       key point sin the existing policy docs (specifically domain name and
       event branding policies).

       Fundraising, for the last few months we've been reporting that
       fundraising was lagging behind budget, but that this was a result of
       last years budget being averaged across the year, rather than showing
       actual renewal dates. This month we are ahead of budget since a number
       of renewals have now been completed. Moving into next year the budget
       reflects renewal dates rather than an averaged income. The fundraising
       team will be meeting at ApacheCon to discuss additional improvements
       to the overall fundraising activities.

       Marketing and Publicity: Contract renewed with Halo (no increase in
       fees). 

       Infrastructure: We remain understaffed and it seems that the search
       committee has made insufficient progress on advertising for a new lead
       role. I submitted an outline proposal for discussion on 4/1. This
       involves a significant spend on a lead role for infrastructure. One
       member of the committee supported the idea in principle (the current
       VP Infra), one opposed it for lack of detail. Others did not comment,
       awaiting more detail. This was provided on 4/3, resulting in one more
       member of the committee explicitly supporting the proposal. We do not
       yet have consensus and therefore further discussion is required. 

       There are two candidates for backfilling the existing team. I've
       reached out to David to ask if we ought to seek to back-fill while we
       look to a longer term plan as a search committee.

       The board approved the inclusion of 2 new projects in the GitHub
       enablement experiment. This work is ongoing with Sam Ruby stepping up
       to help ensure self-service is addressed within the project. Traffic
       Server has been onboarded and, at the time of writing, no incidents
       have been raised.

       Budget: Budget is behind schedule. First lets roll up the previous
       budget, the forecasted net loss for 2016 was $-160K, with March
       numbers in the estimated deficit is now  $-1.1K.

       For the forthcoming year I provided proposed budget to all VPs on 4/1
       and have received feedback from Marketing, Brand Management,
       Infrastructure and TAC. There are some outstanding items I need to
       address, but we are in good shape except that I've been holding off on
       the final budget while the Infra Lead search committee discuss the
       proposed budget for this role. However, as noted above this is not
       moving as quickly as I would like. Therefore, I have submitted a
       proposed budget without the infrastructure staffing changes included.
       I ask that the board consider this and approve it
       (with necessary modifications), by email, ahead of the next board
       meeting. I will answer questions both in the meeting and by email.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


       Marvin: Are we up against a deadline for replacing VP Infra?

       Ross: No concerns presently.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]

       Wells Fargo is officially closed and the money has been moved to
       our new account at Citizens. In doing so, we have went through the
       following checklist of items to shut down:

       1. Corporate Credit Cards
       2. Direct Pay
       3. Wire Transfer
       4. Lockbox
       5. Safebox

       This has been a lengthy process and to our knowledge the only remaining
       service is a corporate credit card of a former Treasurer that is
       only still open as we are transferring the hefty amount of rewards
       points off of it into some tangible form before shutting it down.
       Virtual is assisting with the process.

       The Treasurer is working with ASF infra to make sure treasurer@ and
       accounting@ are archived, web-accessible (via mail-search) archives.

       Chris Mattmann remains the Treasurer until a new Treasurer can be
       appointed by the Board during Executive Session.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The project to replace missing ICLAs is progressing. 27 entries in
       iclas.txt with no active account and no ICLA on file were removed.
       There were two responses to the request to file replacement ICLAs for
       existing committers, included in the numbers below.

       In March, 84 iclas, five cclas, 4 grants, and 40 membership
       applications were received and filed. As of April 20, all invited
       members from the March member meeting have been accepted as new
       members.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

    With ApacheCon 3 weeks out, I have been spending all of my ASF
    time promoting that event. This has included a series of podcasts
    on feathercast.org promoting our speakers, their talks, their
    projects, and ApacheCon itself.

    Registration numbers follow (as of Monday, April 18):

    Apache: Big Data  336
    ApacheCon 2016: 265
    BarCampApache: 40

    Last month I promised an update on ApacheCon Europe. The update is
    that we're going to have one, but that it will be as lean as
    possible. This means things like not providing an on-site lunch,
    not having an off-site reception, and not doing recordings of
    talks. This is a great opportunity for sponsors to step up to
    cover these things, if desired. However, I have opted to have an
    event under these conditions rather than to not have an event at
    all. We should have some idea of venue soon, and will hopefully be
    able to announce this at ApacheCon in Vancouver.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

ApacheCon and TAC:

TAC:

* After receiving a record-breaking number of applications (48), 19 were
  accepted (this includes the folks that were accepted after the Board agreed
  to increase the budget, as well as the LF-funded folks [3]).  One applicant
  dropped out of the LF-funding due to indecision; we’ve advised the LF re
  this since he is a speaker.

* All flights have been secured and sent to the applicants
* All rooms have been secured and confirmation numbers sent to the applicants
* All visa invitation letters have been sent to the applicants
* I continue to field and respond to the applicants’ queries
* Hotel invoice and flights reimbursement have been submitted to svn and
  accounting@ is doing an out-of-cycle payment for this and the flights –
  thank you, Accounting Team!!

ApacheCon:

* Made hotel reservations, conference registrations, and in one case, made
  flight arrangements for the Infra folks
* Collaborating with the LF personnel re booth logistics, shipping logistics,
  etc.
* Order placed for the giveaways

Fundraising:

* Hope to meet up with the VPs of Fundraising at ACNA’16 to discuss the
  problems w/in the fundraising system

Trademarks:

* Due to my time commitment to TAC, Trademarks have fallen behind on my end,
  but luckily, Shane has been staying on top of the issues.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Several significant brand issues reported this month which unfortunately show
that PMC awareness and capability to deal with trademark problems varies
widely.  In particular, the lack of timely response and thoughtful analysis in
two situations is disappointing, where issues that should have either been
dealt with, or at least attracted attention from the PMC still aren't
resolved.

One of these involved a third party showing clear confusion as to the source
of our software product; instead of contacting the Apache project directly,
they had been contacting another software vendor with questions about our
software.  This specific case is not the real issue; the real issue is
ensuring that PMCs as a whole can consistently and fairly act to police their
brands, especially when PMC members work for the vendors potentially causing
issues.

To help ensure guidelines are sufficiently clear, I'm working on much more
detailed explanations as well as asking for reviews and feedback on
documentation on trademarks@.  In the spirit of self-service, proposed
template(s) for contacting third parties and guidelines for how to properly
refer to Apache project names are now published:

http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/guide  (draft)

I would love to see more Member feedback on these over on trademarks@, as well
as thoughtful and specific suggestions for clarifying the Domain Name and
Event Name branding policies to ensure that PMCs can apply them more easily
and consistently.  To help test these guidelines, I will be using them to
contact a number of companies misusing our Hadoop brand in their software
products shortly.

Met with DLAPiper counsel to ensure they are addressing a number of
outstanding applications and legal questions, including a review of the
OpenOffice PMC's proposed repackaging license

Submitted formal trademark complaints to the Microsoft store in relation to
third party software using our OpenOffice registered trademarks.

At the request of PMCs: Renewed OPENOFFICE.ORG US registration; TOMCAT US
application was finalized; provided responses to USPTO office actions for
FLINK and PDFBOX applications.  Several US and international registrations are
preparing for applications.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising continues with no significant issues or challenges.

As I mentioned in the past reports and shown in Tom's (Virtual) report, most
of the sponsorships get renewed in the spring. As of now we beat the street
estimates and are ahead of the plan in the last month of the fiscal year.

This is due as mentioned in the other report to one payment ahead of a
Platinum sponsor, but is also in spite of loosing a few sponsors this year. I
am now working on being more persistent with companies that indicated that are
considering becoming sponsors so that we avoid loosing some ground next year.
For that Melissa planned to meet with me and Jim in Vancouver next month. I
hope to have a few conversations with Ross as well.

I also have a call scheduled with Tom and Lynsey (Virtual) for Wednesday
(after the Board meeting) to go over the process and see what works well and
what would need improvement.

All in all, this was a good fiscal year for Fundraising and I would like to
thank the many ASF members who helped out.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: as we close out the fiscal year, we remain within budget,
with no outstanding invoices due at this time. The FY2017 Marketing &
Publicity budget was submitted to President Ross Gardler, who has
authorized the contract renewal with HALO Worldwide for ASF's
communication services.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally Khudairi is
beginning to plan the second ASF Annual Report, which will be issued
the last week of May. The tasklist for the ongoing rollout of the new
ASF logo continues to grow; the aim is to complete as much as possible
in time for the upcoming ApacheCon. Sally is also working on
fulfillment of a corporate order for various Apache project stickers,
which will be paid for by the requesting organization.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe: 

- 21 March 2016 --The Apache® Software Foundation announces Apache
PDFBox™ v2.0 

IV. Informal Announcements: 9 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, including a post co-authored by Sally and ASF
Chairman Brett Porter in celebration of the ASF's 17th Anniversary. 22
items were Tweeted on @TheASF. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued,
with a total of 85 weekly summaries published to date. No new videos
have been added to the ASF YouTube channel; we will see if the will be
the opportunity to showcase anything from next month's Apache: Big
Data and ApacheCon events.

V. Future Announcements: one announcement is actively in development,
with two on hold as their respective PMCs are preparing for new
version releases. Projects planning to graduate from the Apache
Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones
and "Did You Know?" success stories are welcome to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least
2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution. 

VI. Media Relations: Sally continues to counsel several vendors
regarding their involvement with various Apache projects. She has
invited ASF Members, Apache Committers, and PMCs to attend the
media/analyst trainings that will be offered free-of-charge during
ApacheCon. Stephen O'Grady of RedMonk will serve as our analyst during
the trainings. As of this writing, the sessions are close to reaching
capacity. Over the past month, the ASF received 662 press clips vs.
last month's clip count of 1,095.

VII. Analyst Relations: Apache was mentioned in 20 reports by Gartner,
13 reports by Forrester, 11 reports by 451 Research, and 17 reports by
IDC. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally continues to help promote ApacheCon and
Apache: Big Data in partnership with the Linux Foundation, and is
working with Melissa Warnkin regarding orders for promotional items. 

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: aside from
advising projects and organizations on providing the proper ASF
attribution, no formal activities are taking place at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 45 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Short Term Priorities:
======================
- Ensuring/monitoring that the dual git repository setup works as
  intended.
- Provision an isolated test environment (including isolated LDAP) for
  developing/testing services faster than is currently possible, under a
  separate domain (asfplayground.org). We believe this separation will
  also help projects and volunteers work on their ideas, such as the
  Syncope trial, as they can then develop and test without interfering
  with production systems.
- Looking at deploying Apache Traffic Server to help alleviate the
  troubled BugZilla instances and possibly JIRA.


Long Range Priorities:
======================
- Mailing list system switchover is expected to happen in the coming
  months. We are aware of a few outstanding mail-search requests that we
  have concluded could be solved out-of-the-box by this.
- VMs on Eirene, Nyx and Erebus to be moved in readiness for their
  decommission
- Further explore identity management proposals


General Activity:
=================
- git-dual has been fully puppetized and is ready for more extensive
  testing.
- Traffic Server has joined the git-dual experiment, so far without
  incident.
- Due to severe abuse, we had to take our European archive server
  offline and make extensive restrictions on our US archive. We also had
  to put the US archive in maintenance mode for a few days in order to
  relocate it to a new machine that can better handle the load (and
  isn't 5 years old).
- Following concerns raised on infrastructure@ about the loss of history
  due to the migration of people.a.o to a new host not including the
  contents of committer's public_html directories, an infrastructure
  volunteer stepped forward to automate the copying of this data. Of the
  original ~500GB, around 80% was inappropriate (RCs, Maven repos,
  nightly builds) and was filtered out. There have been no further
  concerns raised since the copy of the remaining ~110GB was completed.

Ticket Response and Resolution Targets:
=======================================
  Stats for the current reporting cycle can be found at
  https://status.apache.org/sla/jira/?cycle=2016-04
  The tentative goal of having 90% of all tickets fully resolved in time
  is still being used. Compared to March, we have had slightly more
  tickets opened, and the percentage of tickets that hit our SLA is
  lower, as we are essentially 2 full time staffers fewer than we were in
  March.

  Quick April reporting cycle summary:
    - 230 tickets opened
    - 228 tickets resolved
    - 248 tickets applied towards our SLA
    - Average time till first response: 13 hours (up from 6h in Feb-Mar)
    - Average time till resolution: 44 hours (up from 23h in Feb-Mar)
    - Tickets fully handled in time: 90% (204/227)


Uptime Statistics:
==================
  Uptime is not pretty this month, but this is primarily an aesthetic
  issue. The biggest failure here has been keeping LDAP servers in sync,
  as we have a specific LDAP server in PNAP that keeps going 10 minutes
  out of sync with the rest. We are looking into why this happens, but
  so far we have not been able to determine the true cause. Nonetheless,
  this does not mean LDAP has been down or unresponsive, merely out of
  sync on one node.

  As mentioned earlier, we also had to pull the EU archive due to
  massive abuse, primarily from some EC2 instances and other external
  datacenters. We are working with the data centers in question to
  resolve the issue, and have also imposed a new 5GB daily download
  limit per IP on the new archive machine. Preliminary data suggests
  this new limit has reduced the traffic from archive.apache.org by as
  much as 65% (going from around 3TB/day to 1.1TB/day), further
  suggesting that the bulk of traffic from that service is to poorly
  configured VMs or other CI systems that should never have been using
  the archive in the first place. As the machine that hosted the archive
  also hosts the moin wiki and mail archives, we believe that these
  services will now perform better, in lieu of archives.a.o moving.

  For detailed statistics, see http://status.apache.org/sla/

Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

JIRA issues continue to be addressed with support from the
entire team. I have had some emails related to questions about
our iCLAs and CCLAs regarding clarification of intent. Have had
issues related to scheduling for one specific entity
to address their questions and concerns.

No issues requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

A little progress has been made reviewing historical reports. We have now
gone back as far as mid-March 2015. The current intention is to continue
back into 2014 but how far back will be determined by the rate at which
overlooked issues are uncovered.

The security team has been evaluating https://srcclr.com/. While it is an
improvement on similar tools and has enabled a handful of projects to
indentify vulnerable dependencies, it currently lacks the features required
for it to be useful without being overly burdensome at the ASF. These
features are expected to be made available shortly at which point the
security team will re-evaluate.

The security team is currently tracking 72 open issues. Not all of these
have been confirmed as valid and it is likely some will be rejected.

Some TLPs have failed to respond to vulnerability reports and/or
requests from the security team for updates.

Stats for Mar 2016:

15 CVEs issued to projects (some may not be public yet).

Just over 1000 e-mails to security@

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Summary
The project is active and there are no Board-level issues at this time.
We have added one new committer / PMC member and made two new
releases since the previous report. We have had some discussion about
whether the community is stagnating and how we could attract the
interest of new developers.

Releases
Version 1.7.1 was released on 2/26/2016.
Version 1.6.5 was released on 2/17/2016.

Activity
The number of subscribers to the user and dev lists have both increased
slightly and mailing lists remain active.

In the past 3 months, there have been 155 commits to the master branch
from 12 authors, 5 of whom are not yet committers.

Versions 1.7.1 and 1.6.5 have been released and we have not yet begun
planning for the next major release.

The PMC has approved the use of the Apache Accumulo mark for the
next Accumulo Summit, to be held in October 2016.

Community
Michael Wall was added as a committer and PMC member on 4/11/2016.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]

Apache Airavata is a distributed system software framework to manage
simple to composite applications with complex execution and workflow 
patterns on diverse computational resources.  

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 

The community has been active. There are designed floating around for 
a face lift of the website and logo to align with new ASF logo. We 
hope to roll this out by the time of ApacheCon. 

## Health report: 

As with previous years Airavata has attracted around 10 GSoC applications. 
We had enough mentors to mentor all these projects but tried to restrict to 
3 or 4 to pave way for other PMC’s to take advantage of new contributors. 
Following previous years students, we are hoping a fraction of the 
contributors will stick around beyond GSOC and eventually become part 
of the PMC.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 20 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Supun Nakandala on Mon May 18 2015 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 29 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Hasini Gunasinghe at Mon Aug 10 2015 

## Releases: 

The last release of Apache Airavata 0.15 was made in previous quarter. We 
prepared for Airavata 0.16 release this quarter and expecting it to be 
out in the next few weeks. 

- 0.15 was released on Fri Dec 04 2015 

## Mailing list activity: 
The communication on the mailing lists remain high. 
The high increase in dev list communication is largely attributed to GSOC 
student applications.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Conor MacNeill]

My apologies for missing the regular reporting schedule.

Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools. It consists
of 4 main projects:

- Ant core and libraries (Antlibs)
- Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
- IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
- EasyAnt - Ant and Ivy toolbox to support build processes

o Release Status

- Ant 1.9.6 followed on July 3, 2015 and is the current release 
- Ivy 2.4.0 was released on December 26, 2014 
- Ivy-DE 2.2.0 was released on November 22, 2013
- EasyAnt The current release is still from the Incubator 0.9-Incubating.

o Committers and PMC

Jean-Louis Boudart was added to the PMC on Dec 6th, 2013

Stephen Haberman was made a committer on October 12th, 2015

o Community

We have decided to have future Ant releases require Java 8. Ant 1.10.0 
will be the first such release. Any further Ant 1.9.x releases will continue 
to require Java 5. An Ant 1.9.7 is being discussed presently. I would expect
an Ant 1.10.0 tofollow, albeit after some time.

Our addition of a new committer, Stephen Haberman, for improved Ivy response 
has not been that effective. Some of that is due to some difficulties in
getting Stephen’s existing Apache account reactivated as all his old email
addresses are no longer active. For now, we will continue to monitor the Ivy
situation.

Jan Materne ran the reporter tool which I have not used to date but I thought
the mailing list stats were interesting

 - dev@ant.apache.org:
    - 300 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):
    - 90 emails sent to list (51 in previous quarter)

 - ivy-user@ant.apache.org:
    - 365 subscribers (down -2 in the last 3 months):
    - 14 emails sent to list (23 in previous quarter)

 - notifications@ant.apache.org:
    - 63 subscribers (down -3 in the last 3 months):
    - 179 emails sent to list (132 in previous quarter)

 - user@ant.apache.org:
    - 718 subscribers (down -4 in the last 3 months):
    - 30 emails sent to list (17 in previous quarter)

I will have a look at this in future reports to see if there are any obvious
trends which are noteworthy. The project is obviously quiet.

reporter.a.o suggested that maybe hedgehogs took over the project which 
I couldn’t discount.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description: 

Arrow is a columnar in-memory analytics layer designed to accelerate big
data. It houses a set of canonical in-memory representations of flat and
hierarchical data along with multiple language-bindings for structure
manipulation. It also provides IPC and common algorithm implementations.
  
## Issues: 

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity: 

- A number of public presentations have been done about Arrow including at
  Strata SJ, Hadoop Summit Europe and various meetups. Response at each was
  strong and we saw subsequent increased interaction on the mailing list.
- We've seen a great new project Feather, a collaboration between the Python
  and R communities build on top of Arrow to provide an ephemeral cross system
  format that performs faster and has better typing than the traditionally
  used CSV format.
- A number of interested organizations have posted blogs about their interest
  in and support for Arrow.
  
## Health report: 

- We continue to see new community members engage.
- Public discussions and contributions from both committers and casual
  contributors continue to improve the Arrow specification.
- We're working with the incubating Mnemonic community to support alternatives
  to ephemeral memory for storing Arrow vectors. This will likely first appear
  as an optional extension module of the Java api. 
- We're still negotiating the final Arrow switch over in the Drill community.
  The goal is to do it as part of the 2.0 branch to avoid any disruption to
  the active stable branch (master).

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Henri Yandell]

## Description: 
 - The Attic is where projects slumber when their communities fade away.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Onami, Rave and Wookie were all moved to the Attic in this quarter, 
   along with some website fixes. There are no open issues to retire 
   projects currently.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Deepal Jayasinghe]

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

The board should be aware that the Bloodhound PMC is discussing moving
the project to the attic as discussed below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was in fact towards the end of last year:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 15 PMC members on the project with the last additions
in January 2014.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

Community & Development
=======================

Committer activity has remained stubbornly low with very little activity
on the development mailing list.

The continued lack of activity led the PMC to discuss whether there are
enough active members of the PMC who have the time, interest and necessary
skills to keep the project going. At this point, only one member of the
PMC has stated that they would be prepared to continue. Three others have
indicated that they are in favour of moving to the attic.

An alternative suggestion for further development to continue by moving
away from Trac as the basis for the project was raised. This was suggested
to be a radical departure from the work of Bloodhound that, if there was
interest in that direction, it could be done outside of the ASF.

Discussion having died down on the above topic, there will shortly be a
formal vote on the motion to move to the attic which will take place on
the private mailing list.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Julian Hyde]

## Description

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable engine for parsing and
planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

Calcite graduated from the Apache Incubator on October 21, 2015.

Avatica is a sub-module within Calcite, and provides a framework for
building local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Since March
2016, Avatica has an independent release schedule.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Avatica split

 Avatica became an independently released module. Previously the 4
 Avatica artifacts were released as part of Calcite, but now releases
 and release numbers are decoupled from Calcite releases. Avatica has
 its own section of the web site, http://calcite.apache.org/avatica/.

 Our motivation is that other projects (e.g. Apache Phoenix's Query
 Server) depend only on Avatica, and are likely to require
 maintenance releases. Also, Avatica does not depend on Calcite, and
 the perception that it has few dependencies will improve adoption.

 Avatica is still governed by the Calcite PMC, and developed using
 the same git repo and dev list. Communities are diverging slightly,
 but there is still significant overlap.

- A new adapter for Apache Cassandra

- Talks
 * Julian Hyde spoke about Streaming SQL & Calcite at an Apache Samza
   meetup (Mountain View) on Feb 17.
 * Julian Hyde and James Taylor presented a Developer Showcase at
   Strata conference (San Jose) on Mar 30.
 * Upcoming talks at ApacheCon BigData (Vancouver), Hadoop Summit
   (Dublin), Kafka Summit (San Francisco), XLDB (Palo Alto),
   Hortonworks User Group (Herndon, VA).

## Health report:

- Mailing lists are a little above typical levels (585 emails on dev)
- JIRA at typical levels (141 created, 116 closed)
- The community wants to try to keep the volume on the dev list at
 reasonable levels. During this quarter, we decided to post each
 created JIRA case to the dev list in the hope that this would drive
 discussions from dev onto JIRA cases, and thereby reduce dev volume.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 14 PMC members.
- Josh Elser was added to the PMC on Wed Feb 17 2016

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 15 committers.
- Wei (Maryann) Xue was added as a committer on Sun Nov 08 2015

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Micah Whitacre]

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running
MapReduce and Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

Project Status
--------------

The project has been moving at a slightly slower pace to the previous
quarter, with13 new JIRAs being created since the previous board report
with 11 (10 new + 1 old) issues being resolved in that time. The majority of
the work on the project continues to focus on maintenance such as bug
fixes but improvements to the Java 8 Lambda support and HBase efficiencies.

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Community
---------

Community activity slowed but remained steady.
The user mailing list activity has reduced to a question (1 every 3 days).
Over the last reporting period the activity on the developer mailing list
has remained steady (2 per day).

David Whiting was added as a committer on Dec 2nd, 2015.
Josh Wills was re-elected to the PMC Chair on April 10, 2016 and resolution
sent to the board.

Releases
--------

* Apache Crunch 0.13.0 was released August 5, 2015

Attachment R: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, 
JMS or JBI.  There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF: 

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
  WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.
DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider 
  component of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

##Releases
 - 3.0.8 was released on Sun Feb 07 2016 
 - 3.0.9 was released on Sun Mar 27 2016 
 - 3.1.5 was released on Sun Feb 07 2016 
 - 3.1.6 was released on Sun Mar 27 2016 
 - Apache CXF Fediz 1.2.2 was released on Mon Feb 15 2016 
 - Apache CXF Fediz 1.3.0 was released on Tue Mar 29 2016 
 - Apache CXF DOSGi 1.8.0 was released on Mon Apr 4 2016

## Activity:
This quarter was a busy quarter creating a bunch of releases.  In the CXF 
core code, there were a lot of bug fixes and enhancements, many to support
the releases of Fediz and DOSGi.  

Fediz 1.3.0 adds a new OpenId Connect 
based IdP, support for bridging between the WS-Federation and OpenId 
Connect protocols, and support for SAML SSO in the Fediz IdP.   

DOSGi 1.8.0 is a result of splitting the DOSGi 1.7.0 release into two parts:
a) The OSGi specific and implementation independent interfaces and objects. 
These were split out of DOSGi and moved to a new sub-project in Apache Aries.
b) The CXF specific implementation of the above interfaces which is now the 
CXF DOSGi sub-project.

While helping the Security team evaluate the SRCCLR tool, we did find a few
minor dependency updates that were also incorporated in the releases.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Alan Cabrera]

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Christopher Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

YARN development yielded improvements in preemption, hardening of the timeline
server, and a new web UI. Designs for resource-aware scheduling and
long-running services are being shaped in JIRA.

HDFS erasure coding, native client, object store (Ozone), and intra-datanode
rebalancing are significant areas under development.

MapReduce continues to receive bug fixes, but even maintenance has slowed.

Trademark enforcement continues to be a challenge. While most vendors have
engaged quickly and positively, slow (non-)compliance falls off the radar. We
are working with trademarks@ to amortize the costs of engagement with
templates and will track these incidents in the BRAND JIRA as appropriate, to
track followup.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John D. Ament (johndament):

    It seems that the community posted one report, but then a mentor posted
    a largely reworded report.  No evidence of a discussion seems to have
    been done on public mailing lists for either report.

engines.

Concerted has been incubating since 2015-10-14.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Julian Hyde (jhyde):

    No report, despite prodding from Chris, and no activity on lists.
    I think this one's dead.

  Jake Farrell (jfarrell):

    No activity so far in 2016.

  Chris Nauroth (cnauroth):

    There has been no activity on the project for several months, and we

Fineract

Fineract is an open source system for core banking as a platform.

Fineract has been incubating since 2015-12-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finalising the initial release
  2. Improve the communication around the differences between the previous
     MifosX project and the new Fineract project, especially in the MifosX
     community, website etc.
  3. With the first initial release, encourage the community to use the
     proper infastructure (mailing lists, issue tracker) for the ongoing
     collaboration within the community.
  4. Change management towards less 'key-man' dependency on previous
     tech/community leaders from MifosX, more towards community driven
     consensus.
  5. Reduce clutter on mailinglist from JIRA updates etc.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  On the mailinglist there have been discussions around the lack of traffic
  on it. This is part of the switchover from the current MifosX community
  and mailinglists towards the new Fineract lists. At the same time the
  recent meet-up of Mifosx and Fineract devs and people interested in it
  (see community development), has also triggered a lot of offline
  interaction.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  While activity on the mailinglist has been pretty low, we've had a great
  meet-up in Amsterdam where a nice mix of existing MifosX community members
  and a group of new interested people was present. This has boosted
  interest in Fineract.

  We have a high level of interest from new contributors throughout Africa -
  we are working to properly engage them and guide them to the correct
  collaboration channels in our Fineract community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Individual members of the leading partner organizations building solutions
  using the Fineract platform have begun to effectively use the Fineract
  issue tracker to communicate and track the requirements and enhancements
  they're building and contributing to Fineract. These individuals are
  setting a good example that other individuals from our partner community
  should follow.

FreeMarker

FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text output
based on templates. FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class library for
programmers.

FreeMarker has been incubating since 2015-07-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finding more active contributors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There were no changes

How has the project developed since the last report?

  FreeMarker had two public releases: A Release Candidate (so that users can
  test it), and one final release. Apart from the new features and fixes, we
  have adjusted the source code and build process to follow Apache best
  practices more closely, and to be more appealing for contributors
  (switching to Java 5, fixing formatting where it didn't fit the modern
  Java conventions).

  The legal/policy issue with the web site domain (INFRA-10787) was settled,
  and we are using our historical domain again (freemarker.org) until
  graduation.

HAWQ

Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop native SQL query engine that combines the key
technological advantages of MPP database with the scalability and
convenience of Hadoop. HAWQ reads data from and writes data to HDFS
natively.  HAWQ delivers industry-leading performance and linear
scalability. It provides users the tools to confidently and successfully
interact with petabyte range data sets. HAWQ provides users with a complete,
standards compliant SQL interface.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce our first Apache Release
  2. Expand the community, by adding new contributors and focusing on making
     sure that there's a much more robust level of conversations and
     discussions happening around roadmaps and feature development on the
     public dev mailing list
  3. Infrastructure migration: create Jenkins projects that build HAWQ
     binary, source tarballs, and run feature tests including at least
     installcheck-good tests for each commit (HAWQ-127).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Everything seems to be smooth, nothing urgent at this time.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to grow the HTrace community
  2. Continue to explore projects integratiing HTrace
  3. Continue to develop and release stable HTrace incubating artifacts

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

Impala

Impala is a high-performance C++ and Java SQL query engine for data stored
in Apache Hadoop-based clusters.

Impala has been incubating since 2015-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Transition of development workflows to ASF (see
     https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-3221)
  2. Initial release as incubating project.
  3. Community growth

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There have been no additions to the committer or PMC lists since
  incubation began. We continue to see an uptick in external contributions,
  with two patches from new contributors this month. One contributor
  pleasingly reported it was "great to work closely with Impala community".

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have put together a list of tasks required to move development of
  Impala from Cloudera's infrastructure to the ASF. Since Impala was already
  a well-established project before the Incubator proposal, there is perhaps
  more decoupling required than for more nascent projects. The list is at
  https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/IMPALA-3221, and is being actively
  worked on. Note that this doesn't cover the standard podling tasks (like
  name search, etc).

Date of last release:

  None since entering incubation.

iota

Open source system that enables the orchestration of IoT devices.

iota has been incubating since 2016-01-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Overcome current technical difficulties. You might be asking what is
     happening with Apache iota. The initial architecture that we wanted to
     upload was not as scalable as we required it to be. Rather than upload
     an architecture that we wanted to fundamentally change we have been
     developing a new backend architecture and code based that implements a
     significantly more scalable solution using Apache, Spark, Spark
     Streaming and Cassandra. We are still using Python and Django for our
     APIs and authentication (session and token based). Consequently, you
     haven’t seen any activity on the Apache iota site and repository. This
     will be changing soon. Litbit (the contributing company whose business
     runs on iota) has been working around the clock to remake the backend
     using additional Apache components that makes the solution far more
     scalable.
  2. Set up web site and import code. We will be setting up the Apache iota
     website to reflect the new architecture and uploading the initial
     source code as quickly as we can.
  3. Promote Iota to a wider user base / grow the community. We are planning
     to promoting iota at an upcoming keynote being given by Scott Noteboom
     (Litbit's CEO). In addition we will be presenting iota at Apache Con in
     May 2016. Our goal in promoting iota will be to start building a
     community that will contribute to moving iota to it’s first release as
     an Apache incubator project

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John D. Ament (johndament);

    Its a bit concerning to see that the project is starting off in a non-ASF
    way.  Even if the code isn't quite right for donation, may be better to
    start off writing new code in the ASF repos.

  Justin Mclean (jmclean):

    I too have concerns about why they are developing outside of the ASF.
    I've contacted them a few times with a please explain and have assurances
    that this will be fixed. I'd suggest placing the podling on monthly
    reports for a few more months. 

  Drew Farris (drew):

    2 mentors active on the mailing list this month, but little activity as
    the team has not moved development to ASF. Concur with keeping podling on
    monthly reports.

MADlib has been incubating since 2015-09-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to produce regular Apache (incubating) releases.
  2. Expand the community, increase dev list activity and add new
     contributors.
  3. Execute and manage the project according to governance model required

Metron

Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order to
offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis. Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.

Metron has been incubating since 2015-12-06.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards
Graduation.

  - Building a diverse community of developers for Metron
  - Getting security practitioners to provide feedback on requirements
  - Make an Apache release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to
be aware of

  - We are currently trying to produce the first Apache release of Metron

* How has the community developed since the last report

  - We added one additional committer, David Lyle
  - We accepted 2 separate contributions from non-committers interested
    in Metron
  - We saw an uptick in interest from the community on the dev boards which
    corresponds to people trying the product prior to an official release,
    which is a good sign.

* How has the project developed since the last report

  - We closed 20 more Jiras and are in the latest stages of releasing an
    Apache release.
  - We added deployment automation for EC2 so trying out Metron in a
    multi-node environment is even easier
  - We integrated the CI environment that infra set up for us at our request
    so that unit tests and apache rat license checks are run on every pull
    request submitted
  - We added support for indexing enriched sensor capture data into Apache
    Solr indexing as well as Elasticsearch

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Nick Burch (nick):

    Hopefully the new release will generate a little more interest. I'd
    suggest we wait a few more months to see the effect of that, before
    deciding on what to do with the podling (staying in the incubator for
    ever isn't an option!)

Quarks

Apache Quarks is a programming model and micro-kernel style runtime that can
be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling local,
real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming from
equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of all kinds
(for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in conjunction with
centralized analytic systems, Apache Quarks provides efficient and timely
analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the center to the edge.

Quarks has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
     around Quarks project
  2. Create the first Apache release of Quarks
  3. Complete migration of website to host all content at Apache (javadoc is
     still on Github).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Nothing jumps to mind.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The Quarks community is keeping dev-related conversations on the mailing
  list. Because of this, it's allowed for the participation of independent
  contributors in mailing list discussions. Although our list of independent
  contributors is small, Quarks is still very new as an Apache project and
  we aim to actively grow our list in the near future.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * The project has successfully migrated from Github-based development to
    using the Apache git repo, Jira, and the mailing lists.

Date of last release:

  Quarks is still new, so we haven't created an Apache release as of yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No changes from the initial committers.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Become familiar with the release process and have a first release as
     part of the Apache Foundation
  2. Expand the "how to" document to explain the ways new contributors can
     become involved in the project, so we increase the size of the
     community.
  3. Add new committers to the project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

   * We have a Rya "office hour" teleconference every other week. We had
     some technical difficulties with screen sharing, but we had a working
     solution for the last meeting. Users and developers can ask questions,
     receive answers, discuss ideas for future developments. The minutes are
     sent to the dev@ list.
   * We have more PRs from non-committers which are integrated into the
     repository. We expect some of these non-committers to continue to
     submit PRs and become committers.
   * There were several ideas from Rya for Google Summer of Code, and a few
     students expressed interest; one of them submitted a proposal

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Created a quick-start VM for users to try out Rya.
  * Created a website for the project.
  * Resolved a handful of issues that users have encountered.

topic of Apache Isis); all are in June and in the UK (London, Cambridge and 
London again).

## Health report: 

Project activity (#mails, tickets, commits etc) are healthy, with the
v1.12.0 release incorporating substantial new features.

Documentation has been improved; we now generate PDFs of all our user guides
(previously only HTML was available).

In addition a whole new slew of screencasts have been recorded [3], hopefully
will attract new users to the framework.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

PROJECT STATUS

We are preparing for the 2.0 release. Since the last release (1.9.2), activity
has slowed down a bit in terms of code contributions, but we've been
successful at engaging ProfitBricks in the project. They are contributing
resources to create the provider for their new REST API, and have also donated
testing account for jclouds.

We have received several GSoC 2016 proposals, and have a couple of mentors on
the PMC. We're now in the project evaluation phase and are waiting to see if
the proposals are accepted. 

COMMUNITY

Community activity has increased a bit on the dev and user mailing lists, and
we've had several approaches from students interested in working on our
proposed GSoC projects.

Alongside the welcome engagement for ProfitBricks, we've also had a recent
contribution for a new Azure compute provider from the Open Source team at
Microsoft. They have allocated resources to contribute to the project and are
leading the development of an updated provider based on the new Azure ARM
API.

We've also received and merged several pull requests from new contributors.
This is a welcome sign, as the nature of the jclouds codebase can make
first-time contributions quite intimidating at first glance.  In addtion, two
jclouds talks have been accepted for ApacheCon NA, so we will be there and
look forward to engaging with the community and interacting with downstream
projects.
 
There are currently 11 PMC members and 23 committers.
Last committer: 2016-02-05 (Reijhanniel Jearl Campos)
Last PMC member: 2015-09-20 (Zack Shoylev)
 
COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES

* Finally determine the scope and complete the feature set for jclouds 2.0, to
  include completion of support for Azure ARM, as well as promotion of the
  Docker and ProfitBricks REST APIs from jclouds-labs
* Encourage and supervise, where necessary, new contributors to grow the

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

We continue to yo-yo in community involvement. In our December report we saw
an uptick in community involvement, followed by a lull, followed by some very
active community engagement end of march to present.

We are looking at updating Lucene.Net 4.8.0 (which is nearly complete) to
work on .NET Core (to work across various OS's).

== Releases == 

Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012 Working toward 4.8.0

== Statistics == 

Last PMC Member Added, Paul Irwin, October 2013 
Two committers added Jan '15 -Laimonas, Feb '15 - Wyatt

Nuget package downloads: 
Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 278,843 (up from 217,779)
Lucene.Net.Contrib 3.0.3: 75,128 (up from 59,022) 
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial: 9,221 (up from 8,060)
Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial.NTS: 1,749 (up from 1,523)

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

## Description: 

  The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for
  dynamic programming languages.

## Issues:

  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

  Version 0.5.0 of the Lucy search engine library and the Clownfish symbiotic
  object system have both been released.  Clownfish's public surface area has
  been increased substantially, with much greater documentation of both the
  compiler and runtime, and partial/experimental Go and Python bindings.
  Some pernicious portability bugs have also been squashed, restoring the
  cross-platform compatibility of Lucy and Clownfish.

  The gap betwen 0.4.0 and 0.5.0 was uncharacteristically long.  We hope that
  there will be less time before 0.6.0.

## Health report:

  The project continues to be developed actively by two main contributors.
  Though there have not been any new contributors for a while, there are
  several reliable long-standing PMC members who participate occasionally and
  vote on releases.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
  - Currently 12 PMC members. 
  - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
  - Last PMC addition was Timothy Wilkens on Sun Sep 14 2014 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
  - Currently 14 committers. 
  - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
  - Last committer addition was Tim Wilkens at Fri Sep 26 2014 
   
## Releases: 
   
  - 0.4.4 was released on Sat Jan 30 2016 
  - 0.5.0 was released on Thu Mar 03 2016 
   
## Mailing list activity: 

  Development mailing lists (dev, commits, issues) were above average this
  quarter.  The user mailing list was as usual: low traffic, but all
  inquiries answered quickly and thoroughly.
   
## JIRA activity: 

  In the first quarter:

  - 29 JIRA tickets created
  - 30 JIRA tickets closed/resolved

  Previous reports mistakenly excluded Clownfish tickets.

The project and the ecosystem around it continues to be healthy. The
project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features, reviews
and releases. The mailing list and IRC channel are also very much
active with healthy discussions. We've made numerous releases lately
due to an increased release schedule. We are gearing up for a 1.0
release and we plan to cut back on the number of releases after that.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Tammo van Lessen]

## Description: 
  Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web services 
  orchestration using flexible process definitions. 

## Issues: 
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
- Like in the previous reporting period, we've made progress with preparing 
  the next release, migrated some fixes from the development branch to the 
  release branch. We started improving the SQL schema generation and want to
  include it in the next release. We're feature complete with the current 
  release and release preparation is in progress.

## Health Report:
 - ODE is very mature and stable, however the interest in BPEL has decreased
   significantly. Thus ODE's development is currently pretty much in 
   maintenance mode. We're ironing out technical debt and making sure
   that our codebase campground is clean, supporting our users with answers
   and fixes.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Pinaki Poddar]

## Description: 
Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for databases,
relational as well as non-relational. For relational databases, OpenJPA is
compliant to the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0.
OpenJPA runs in stand-alone JSE as well as  containers e.g JavaEE,
Tomcat, Spring or OSGi. 

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
Sadly no news on the EE7 TCK issue which prevents us
from verifying compatility with JPA-2.1.

## Activity: 
Moderate activity. Some community feedback on the users list
and a few internal discussions. We also reworked our page 
build bots and added documentation.
Mark Struberg got appointed as new PMC chair and we like to thank
Pinaki Poddar for his service over the last few years!

## Health report: 
OpenJPA is a 'mature' codebase and many parts are stable and needs
lots of knowledge if you touch them. Thus it's rather hard to
get up and running.
We are openly looking for fresh blood which is open enough to 
take up the challenge while being sensible enough to not trash 
existing functionality.

## PMC changes: 

- Currently 14 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Releases: 

- 2.4.1 was released on Sun Feb 21 2016 

## Mailing list activity: 

Traffic on the mailing lists is low but steady.
We might need to focus on working on fresh bugs which come in.
There are currently more new bugs than we resolve, which is not
a good thing.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OpenMeetings Project  [Maxim Solodovnik]

## Description:

 - Openmeetings provides video conferencing, instant messaging, white board
   , collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using API
   functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming.

## Issues:

 - We were unable to sign our recent releases 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 due to
  Insufficient signing events
  (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-11384)
  Unfortunately there is no ETA when it going to be resolved.

## Activity:

 - We performed 2 releases: 3.1.0, 3.1.1
 - 3.1.0 is big step forward comparing to 3.0.7. 
 - 3.1.1 is security fix release. 
 - 3.1.0 + 3.1.1 were not made public for 3 weeks because of code
   signing issue (INFRA-11384). Finally were released without signing.
 - We are hoping to participate in GSOC2016 this year. Currently reviewing 
   2 proposals

## Health report:

 - I believe project is healthy: additional PMC was recently added,
  constant activity
  in mailing lists, new releases.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Dennis E. Hamilton]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity
suite.  There are six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). With limited support for other formats,
OpenOffice ships for several platforms and in dozens of
languages.


STATUS
======

The project is warming up for its next release, Apache OpenOffice 4.2.0.

There is growing attention to security of dependencies and also ways to
improve release engineering.

Limitations of capacity and coordinating the project's moving parts are
concerns.


ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS
==========================

Concerns and warning signs for Board attention are in the Issues section,
below.

ACTIVITY
========

Moving parts of the Apache OpenOffice project span three inter-connected
layers. 

 * Development, Release Engineering, and Deployment:
   development, testing, internationalization, QA, documentation, deployment,
   and branding
  
 * Project Community Lists and Archives:
   development topics, user-facing information, user reports,
   trouble-shooting, and feedback
  
 * Public Project-Community Interfaces
   tying together development, users, and support areas:
   Bugzilla, wiki (two flavors), web site (two flavors), and Community
   Forums
   
Development and Release Engineering
-----------------------------------

Separate source-only release of UNO Tools for independent usage is 
progressing.

Maintainors of some writing aids (e.g., spelling checkers) provide regular
updates for eventual release inclusion.

Fixes for issues deferred from the 4.1.2 release are now retargeted for
4.2.0.  Issues and fixes are flagged as part of warming-up for 4.2.0.  There
is no projected release date.  SVN preparations for release-candidate 
staging of 4.2.0 have not begun.

Significant change to the build system are staged.  Updates to third-party 
components incorporate their latest security fixes.

A documented walkthrough of the Windows build process needs review.  Changing
the build system requires updated documentation.

Occasional newcomers want to work on the project.  The learning curve is 
still steep, especially for Windows.  It is not unusual for new volunteers 
to disappear after a short time.  

Deployment and Take-Up
----------------------

For the five months since release of AOO 4.1.2 through 2016-03-31, 
there are 19.9 million downloads, roughly 4.0 million per month
at a rate of 800,000 per week.

   87.9% for Windows,
    7.8% for Macintosh, and
    4.3% for all other distributions
    
Although US destinations have the greatest number of downloads by
nationality, that represents only 15% of the total for this
highly-international project.

For comparison, release 4.1.1 binaries had been downloaded 48.1 million times
over the 16 months of that release, roughly 4.3 million monthly at a rate of
1 million per week.

There is new management at SourceForge, the provider of Apache OpenOffice
download mirrors, Extras archives, and third-party extensions and templates
downloads.  There appears to be no impact.  There is serious improvement
how advertising is separated on the download-starting page, reducing
confusion about whether the download has been requested and will start 
without any more clicking.

Branding
--------

Trademark registration/renewal activity, coordinated with trademarks@,
is underway.

The project is not making any changes involving the new feather logo and
powered-by graphics.

There is typically one request for use of the marks each month, including a
request this quarter for display of Apache OpenOffice as a prop in a
French action-adventure television series.

One misuse of Apache OpenOffice marks has been addressed with a publisher
and acceptable remedies are in place.

Major abuse of "OpenOffice" by an anonymous imposter is difficult to thwart.
Effort is continuing with assistance of trademarks@.

Community Lists and Archives
----------------------------

The tabulation below summarizes the average rate of mailing list usage for all
of the public lists since Apache OpenOffice became a top-level project in
November 2012.  The complete compilation of the data is in PDF at
<https://s.apache.org/OHfh>.  The list is in decreasing order by 2015 
activity.

Bugzilla and Issue Tracking
---------------------------

Tabulation of Bugzilla issue growth extends to the end of 2016Q1.  The rate 
of unresolved issues continues to be in excess of 40%.  The complete
tabulation is at <http://s.apache.org/YFT>.  Qualitative analysis at
<http://s.apache.org/SNg> applies.

Wiki and Documentation
----------------------

In 2013Q1, a new documentation effort for an end-users manual was started on
the OpenOffice MediaWiki.  That is the only user-documentation effort. 
Material from an "OpenOffice for Students" was being incorporated.  As 
reported in 2015Q1, documentation efffort stalled.

New volunteers arrive regularly although concerted, sustained effort is
absent.  

There is much outdated material on the MediaWiki and changes in the product
are not accompanied by coordinated documentation.


ISSUES
======

Continued identification of risks and issues of capacity and
capability is brought to public lists for discussion
on the state of the project in the community.  

Overall
-------

Newcomers to the developer, QA, and docs lists seek assignments the project
lacks capacity to provide and mentor.  Newcomers appear eager though lacking
project and product knowledge.

Release Engineering
-------------------

Providing a faster maintenance-release cadence to pick up important 
fixes has no support.

The buildbot for Windows binaries has not been successful since 2015-07-28.
This impairs QA testing and patch testing.  There is risk of regressions from
changes that are developed and successfully applied to Linux and FreeBSD, the
primary tools of the few active developers.

The 4.1.2 release manager is going to work with one or more "interns" to 
cultivate additional committers with experience at producing Apache 
OpenOffice builds for the extensive set of binaries that are produced.  The
4.2.0 release candidates will be the laboratory.  

The project is vulnerable to inability to prepare candidates if release-
engineering capacity deteriorates.

Having enough PMC members to confirm builds from source to cover the different
platform distributions is a concern.  Current CTR commits receive little if
any visible indications of "R".  Requests for review can go unanswered.  One
committer has refused to create Bugzilla issues to account for SVN changes.

Deployment
----------

Proof of concept for digital signing of Windows builds was achieved in 2014.
Signing is not in production. 

Digital signing is crucial.  It allows the platform to verify that the binary
installer is an unmodified authentic build from the project.  It assists 
detection of counterfeits that drop adware and malware.

NEXT STEPS: Explore prospects for changing to signed .msi Windows installers
for 4.2.0 despite the compounding of changes and possible delays for 
a feature release.  Seek ways to accomplish this in controlled steps.

Branding
--------

Investigation of inappropriate use of Apache brands for OpenOffice occurs
when brought to the attention of the PMC.  There are two cases this quarter. 
There are difficulties in going farther.

  1. The distributors of misleading products make it difficult to
     remove offenders that are casually allowed to make misleading offers.
     
  2. The project is not pro-active in finding offenders and requesting
     compliance with Apache brand usage.  In particular, "Open Office" is
     heavily used and search services treat it as a synonym for "OpenOffice."
     There appear to be over 100 AOO download/disc offers that claim the
     need for advertising to support the "product" effort.
     
  3. Where paid advertisements accompany search results, these can have more
     prominence than "Apache OpenOffice" results which otherwise rank highest.
     
  4. When contact is achieved, it can take considerable effort and
     communication to have the producer honor Apache brands.  
     
NEXT STEPS: Find better templates for engaging producers of products that
invite confusion with Apache OpenOffice.  Find ways to pursue such cases that
do not overwhelm the capacity of the Project Management Committee to manage.
Simplify the engagement of trademarks@, especially where distributors of
third-party software impose friction in the acceptance of trademark
violation complaints.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache ORC Project  [Owen O'Malley]

## Description: 
 A high-performance columnar file format for Hadoop workloads.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring the board's attention.
   
## Activity: 
 - After the last board report, it was suggested that we go ahead and make
   a release of the C++ code without waiting for the Java to be separated
   out of Hive. We went ahead and did that and released 1.0.0.
 - We're about to create a first pull request for ORC-1, which is the import
   of the Java code from Hive. We plan to make a 1.1 release soon after the
   code is pulled in to ORC.
   
## Health report: 
 - The project has been relatively quiet. Getting the Java reader and writer
   released will enable projects such as Spark to import a much smaller set
   of dependencies when they use ORC.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Sqoop Project  [Jarek Jarcec Cecho]

Apache Sqoop is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data
between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational
databases. It can be used to import data from external structured
datastores into Hadoop Distributed File System or related systems like
Hive and HBase. Conversely, Sqoop can be used to extract data from
Hadoop and export it to external structured datastores such as relational
databases and enterprise data warehouses.

RELEASES

* The last releases of Apache Sqoop
** Version 1.4.6, released on May 10, 2015 from trunk branch.
** Version 1.99.6, released on May 5, 2015 from the sqoop2 branch.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation uses
to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.
  
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
- Test elections were held in preparation for the annual ASF Members Meeting.
  Feedback from these tests (including some UI and form data parsing bugs)
  were incorporated into the STeVe software.
- The Annual ASF Members Meeting was held and used STeVe as the voting
  platform. On the whole, things went very smooth, with only very few nits.
  Issues such as screen reader friendliness has been taken into consideration
  for future development.
- Several issues were raised about some design decisions in STeVe, and while
  not serious or bad (merely opinions on how it should operate), we do need to
  discuss these characteristics and see if we can provide either a changed
  backend design or alternately optional features for STeVe.

## Health report: 
- STeVe is healthy in the sense that we have >= 3 PMC members active at all
  times. We have also seen an uptick in both tickets being filed as well as
  people volunteering to help out with further development of STeVe. It is my
  sincere hope that these volunteers will stick with us and won't be drive-by
  patch submitters.
  
## PMC changes: 
  
- Currently 7 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
- Last PMC addition was Rich Bowen on Mon Apr 20 2015
- Chris Mattman has chosen to resign from the STeVe PMC. 
  We thank Chris for his contributions and would of course welcome him back, 
  should he wish to rejoin.
  
## Committer base changes: 
  
- Currently 9 committers. 
- No new committers added in the last 3 months 
- Last committer addition was Pierre Smits at Tue Dec 15 2015 
  
## Releases: 
  
- While no releases have been made yet, STeVe has been used for
  several elections. We are hoping to get a release out once the
  dust from the last members meeting settles and the kinks have
  been ironed out.
  
## Mailing list activity: 
  
Activity has been relatively low. There was an uptick in mails to the issues@
list due to JIRA tickets being created as a result of users' experience with
the ASF members meeting. User@ has seen virtually no activity, but that is to
be expected when we don't have an official release yet.
  
- dev@steve.apache.org:  
   - 20 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months): 
   - 19 emails sent to list (47 in previous quarter) 
  
- issues@steve.apache.org:  
   - 12 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months): 
   - 34 emails sent to list (14 in previous quarter) 
  
- user@steve.apache.org:  
   - 13 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months): 
   - 2 emails sent to list (1 in previous quarter) 
  
  
## JIRA activity: 
 JIRA has seen an uptick in issues after the ASF members meeting.
 This is generally a very good sign that people are getting involved.

- 14 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
- 4 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made two release in the last quarter.
* Struts 2.5-BETA-3 - Struts 2.5 beta release (2016-01-22)
* Struts 2.3.28 - full GA release including bug fixes, feature
enhancements and security fixes (2016-03-22)

In the beginning of the reporting period we released Struts 2.5 Beta 3.
Struts 2.5 includes new features, consolidations and dependency upgrades
along with dropping support for already deprecated APIs and framework
parts. It is considered a milestone release towards Struts 3, which is
supposed to include major new features as well as breaking changes.

In the remainder of the last quarter development focus shifted back to
the Struts 2.3 release line, since it became clear that we would need at
least one intermediate release in the stable branch including bug fixes
and feature enhancements before we can move on towards a possible Struts
2.5 GA release. We released three new security
bulletins with the advent of Struts 2.3.28 [1].

No new committer was added in the last quarter. The last committership
addition was on 2015-10-23 (Aleksandr Mashchenko). Greg Huber (ghuber)
accepted our invitation to join the PMC in the last quarter (2016-02-28).

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

   last quarter.  Questions are answered with participation of not only the
   core contributors but also by the community at large. Discussion  focuses
   especially around new features of the 5.4 release, with the occasional
   question about earlier versions. There are also occasional announcements
   concerning third-party libraries developed entirely outside the Tapestry
   team.

   Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

   Plans are underway to determine what changes will be introduced into
   Tapestry 5.5.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

   Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 25 Apr 2014, and
   subsequently been voted into the PMC (2 Mar 2015).

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

   No known issues.

Apache Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and
serialization.

Project Status
---------
The Apache Thrift community continues to see consistent growth with
submissions from new contributors for bug fixes and client library
improvements. There have been a number of stability enhancements to
our C++, Go, Node and Python client libraries. We are close to cutting
our 0.10.0 release candidate and have spent time focusing on getting
our CI pipeline back in order after experiencing a lapse in successful
passing builds.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Dave Meikle]

=== Apache Tika Status Report : April 2016 ===

What is Tika?
=========================
 Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content
detection, analysis, and extraction. It allows a user to understand, and
leverage information from, a growing a list over 1200 different file types
including most of the major types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text,
Images, Video, Code, and science data) as recognised by IANA and other
standards bodies.

Issues
========================= 
There are no issues that need the boards attention.

Releases
========================= 
The 1.12 release of Tika was made in February
2016[1], including various fixes and a new NamedEntityParser using Apache
OpenNLP. A 1.13 release is imminent with work well underway on the 2.X stream.

Community
========================= 
Along with Apache Solr, Tika was part of stack that
powered[1] the analysis of the Panama Papers leak. 

A Twitter account, @ApacheTika, has been setup for the project to help aid
announcements and engage with the community.

The Tika PMC added Bob Paulin as a committer and PMC member in September 2015.

Mailing list activity on dev@ was at 463, 423 and 259 messages in Feb, Mar and
Apr 2016, respectively. user@ was at 85, 10 and 21 messages, during the same
timeframe.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

Work on addressing ZDI-15-638 completed and fixes released for both the TomEE
1.7.x and 7.0.x code lines.  The fix involves a new feature that limits the
classes that can be used in a serialization context.  Documentation for the
fix was contributed by a mix of committers and contributors through the old
perl/svn/markdown system Joe Schaefer wrote.  Some discussion has started
about possibly newer alternatives for accepting documentation contributions,
including github pull requests.

Major initiatives requiring community attention.

Lack of resources remains an issue for the community which needs
improvement. Work on TomEE 7 remains in milestone form primarily due to lack
of Java EE 7 TCK.  Despite the lack of a Java EE 7 TCK, there are users who
do not care about certification and simply need a stable release.  Some
decision will need to be made here as it doesn’t appear likely the community
will ever get a TCK.  Additionally, OpenJPA’s lack of progress affects TomEE
indirectly as it is the default JPA implementation.

The user list, however, continues to be active with most queries resolved
quickly.

User mailing list traffic: 
  - 179 messages / January
  - 129 messages / February
  - 174 messages / March
Average dev mailing list traffic:
  - 35 messages / January
  - 38 messages / February
  - 52 messages / March

Last releases are:
  - 1.7.4 on March 4th
  - 7.0.0.M2 on Feb 28th
  - 7.0.0.M2 on March 6th

Last release was 1.7.4 on 2016-03-04 and 7.0.0-M3 on 2016-03-06.  Last
committer was added November 2015.  Last PMC addition, 4 new members on
2015-08-11.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

## Description:
 Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
 and Varnish in functionality and features.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Planning for the 2016 Spring Summit has begun, and we're finalizing our
   agenda. Details are on

      https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Spring+2016+Summit

 - The ATS project is as of 4/10/2016 enabled to use the Git-Dual system
 provided by Infra! This is very exciting, and we think this will continue
 increasing community participation and growth. It also really simplifies the
 work done by committers dealing with an increase in Pull Requests (we've had
 over 500 github PRs, total).

 Many thanks to the entire Infra team for making this happen! Special thanks
 to Daniel Gruno for for going above and beyond his duty, making the
 migration seemless and painless (so far :).

## Health report:
 - Activity in the community is healthy, with pretty significant increase in
 mailing list activity and community participation. We continue adding new
 committers this quarter  as well.

 - ATS v6.2.0 is being prepared as we speak, and we expect this LTS release to
 be ready for the planned 05/15/2016 release schedule.

 - ATS is becoming recognized as a leader in the HTTP/2 server space, and the
 team developing this is continuing making significant improvements with every
 release.
