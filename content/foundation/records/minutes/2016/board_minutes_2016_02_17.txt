 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Preparation is nearly complete for the Annual Meeting, with notices to
       go out shortly. This year, I've spent some more time writing down the
       process as I go and created a tool to generate the meeting from
       templates to make it easier for future boards.

       I've accepted an offer to join the advisor board for the China OSS
       Promotion Union (COPU), which came after attending the Apache Roadshow
       in Beijing last year. This doesn't entail any relationship with the
       ASF, however I'll certainly share anything relevant that comes from
       it, particularly if we look to participate in future events in the
       region.

    B. President [Ross]

       Made good progress on planning for the loss of VP Infra. See
       discussion item for details.

       Executive Assistant
       ===============

       Most "non-routine" activity this month has been around TAC and
       ApacheCon, with a special focus on raising awareness of the CFP close.
       There was a reasonable amount of trademark follow ups this month.

       Brand Management
       ===============

       Quite a busy month. A number of event requests and a few trademark
       infringements to deal with. Nothing too significant and good progress
       being made in all cases.

       Fundraising
       =========

       Some process improvements now in place. All invoices are up-to-date,
       although it turns out that Virtual were still under the impression
       that one of our previous sponsors who have indicated they are unable
       to renew was still invoiced. I'm not sure how this happened or at what
       point in the process the sponsor was invoiced. Hopefully the process
       improvements will minimize such errors in the future.

       We are currently $64k behind sponsorship income projections for 2016
       (though our overall budget remains in good shape since we have spent
       less than projected as well as received less than projected - current
       "worst case" puts us at -$138k by financial year end against a
       budgeted $161k).

       Marketing and Publicity
       ==================

       It's time for the November 2015-January 2016 quarterly report. All
       those officers who have not yet submitted their report for Sally
       should do so in the next couple of days (it's quick and simple, just
       review your board reports for this period, select the key pieces and
       send to Sally who can add any necessary colour).

       New visual identity is live - I am still shocked at how "easy" this was
       from my perspective, and that of our members. A testament to the
       sensitive handling of a potentially sensitive topic. I believe our
       Membership felt fully involved and as a result is almost unanimous in
       their approval of the new design. Well done Sally (and thanks to
       LucidWorks and HotWax Systems for donating creative services).

       Sally has confirmed a return of her media/analyst trainings at
       ApacheCon. I've already signed up for my much needed update and I
       recommend everyone who is at all interest in such things to sign up
       when Sally announces them within the community
       (two beginner sessions, one for podlings one for TLPs and an advanced
       session will be offered).

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       During the last month I've met 1:1 with all but one of the infra team
       as well as spending time with most of the team as a group. My goal was
       to listen to their recommendations on how to address the replacement
       of David as VP Infra. I've also spoken with a number of potential
       outsource organizations to understand what they can offer. Finally,
       I've reviewed a reasonably complete proposal secured by David.

       The output of all these activities is covered in a discussion item,
       with a more complete proposal to be presented to the board and
       discussed between now and the next board meeting on board@.

       In the interim, David has agreed to stay on for at least another month
       as VP Infra. I have offered to help out where I can (see discussion
       item) and the Infra contractors have all shown willing to continue in
       a (mostly) self-managing way.

       There has been good progress on a number of infra items. Most notably
       projects may now publish apps in the iTunes store. Huge thanks to Mark
       Thomas who has been working on this for multiple years and seen it to
       conclusion. In addition Appveyor CI is now available for projects
       using the GitHub mirror:
       https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/appveyor_ci_now_available_for

       There are a few issues with uptime for core services (critical
       services remain close to 100%). Issues vary from technical debt to
       abuse. Remediation is being planned in all relevant cases.

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ======================

       Not report submitted at the time of writing. Melissa has been updating
       me on status. We are at low levels of applications at present, though
       it is still early in the process. Melissa is working with the TAC team
       to ensure we conduct more outreach.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        An updated engagement letter with the CPA has been prepared
        for the IRS 990. The Treasurer’s office and Virtual will
        submit the signed form to the CPA shortly.
    
        The Treasurer’s Office worked with Virtual and the CPA to
        complete the IRS 990 questionnaire form as part of the taxes
        submission. We are on schedule to deliver and submit the
        990 taxes by March.
    
        The independent audit is also progressing. Virtual has been
        working with the CPA agency to produce an initial draft
        review which was sent to Jim, Ross, and Chris on Feb 2nd.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Continuing the process of making sure that all committers have ICLAs
       on file, the number of discrepancies in the records is dropping but
       many still remain. Of the 64 requests sent out to the email address on
       file, 34 were undeliverable. Seven committers submitted new or found
       ICLAs (included in the totals below). We have begun the process of
       removing access for accounts that have no ICLA on file.

       In January, 91 iclas, three cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        The CFP for ApacheCon closed on the 12th, and we have begun
        the process of reviewing these submissions and forming the
        schedule. Anyone wishing to participate in this process should
        contact me, or the dev@community.apache.org mailing list.

        Our current submission totals are:

        For ApacheCon North America: 152
        For Apache Big Data: 206

        We are also looking for suggestions (and contacts) for
        keynotes for the event. We currently have 2 suggestions, and
        have room for 4 - 5. These, also, should to go to me, or to
        the dev@community mailing list.

        Relevant dates:

        CFP Close: February 12, 2016
        CFP Notifications: February 29, 2016
        Schedule Announced: March 3, 2016

        We do not yet have dates for ApacheCon Europe, but we should
        know within the next 2 months whether we will be doing that
        event this year.

        Huge thanks to Daniel Gruno, as well as to a number of
        volunteers, for their presence at FOSDEM 2016. They gave away
        hundreds of stickers, as well as other swag, and showcased the
        new feather logo. They had many conversations with open source
        enthusiasts, and it was a good time for reengaing with that
        community.

        Apache OpenOffice also shared the table with us, as they have
        a long history of being present at FOSDEM.

        As always, a huge thank you to Melissa for her support of this
        event.

        One conversation at FOSDEM was our difficulty with connecting
        new volunteers with concrete tasks that they can do to get
        involved. Several times a month, people come to the
        dev@community mailing list and ask "How can I get involved?"
        and are generally given vague answers that amount to "Go look
        at the projects and see what they need." From this discussion
        has arisen a new service, Help Wanted -
        https://helpwanted.apache.org/ (Thanks to Daniel Gruno, once
        again) that attempts to bridge this gap. The goal is to
        promote beginner tasks that are a good place for entry into
        our communities. Projects are encouraged to put tasks on there
        that reflect this goal. (ie, please don't just dump your Jira
        ticket list here.) It's also a place for community-level
        tasks, such as our desire to create per-project brochures that
        can be produced on demand for events, meetups, elevator chats,
        and so on.

        I expect to be completely focused on ApacheCon for the coming
        few months.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Over the last few months I've noticed a drastic decrease in the number
       of reports submitted on-time, or at all. What's going on? Are the board
       reminders going out?

       Historical data:
         https://whimsy-test.apache.org/board/missing-reports

       For this month:
         Initial reminders were sent Thu, 28 Jan 2016 11:01:36 +0000
         Final reminders were sent Sat, 13 Feb 2016 04:27:17 +0000

       There was a problem in prior months where getting the chairs email
       addresses from LDAP would fail; Sebb and Sam addressed the LDAP
       reliability problems, and Brett changed the address used for chairs
       to the $availid@apache.org address, avoiding the need for LDAP
       entirely.  This problem is thought to be solved.

       Reminders are still only being sent to PMCs, i.e, not to executive
       officers and additional officers.  They are also still being sent
       via a web interface instead of a cron job.

       These would be excellent tasks for somebody wishing to get more
       involved in the Whimsy project :-).  A draft script for sending
       reminders can be found at http://s.apache.org/GZD.  Deployment info
       is at https://github.com/apache/whimsy/blob/master/DEPLOYMENT.md

    B. Synapse. What happened and relationship with 
       https://github.com/wso2/wso2-synapse
       and what we need to (possibly) watch out for.

       There was a prior discussion of this matter on the trademarks list.
       That discussion seemed to die off after this post:
       http://s.apache.org/cUl
       
    C. Updating VP Infrastructure Role
       After reviewing as many opinions and proposals as possible I have come
       to the conclusion that none of the options for moving the VP Infra
       responsibilities to a third party can be considered "small reversible
       steps". Furthermore, contrary to my initial recommendation to the board
       I am not convinced that any of the outsourcing options currently
       available are optimal for the foundation.
       
       I remain convinced that, at some point in the future, our
       infrastructure operations will require a full time management role.
       However, I do not think that time is now. Below I outline the current
       VP Infra job description (drawn up in consultation with David as VP
       Infra and most of the infrastructure staff). I have classified each
       task as either STAFF, VP or PRESIDENT to indicate where I propose each
       should land. This results in splitting the current VP role three ways:
       paid STAFF (and where possible contractors), PRESIDENT and VP (who
       remains a volunteer VP Infrastructure). Items marked VP/STAFF are
       expected to require significant oversight from the VP but can be
       delegated to STAFF.
       
       The intention is to split the role into "doing" (STAFF), "planning" (VP) 
       and "HR" (PRESIDENT). Note, it is expected that the majority of the 
       PRESIDENT responsibilities can be outsourced to a support organization
       though no negotiations have taken place at this time.
       
       * Set and manage annual infra budgets [VP/STAFF]
       * Approve infra purchasing decisions, including contract
         negotiation and renewal with suppliers [VP/STAFF]
       * Set medium- to long-term strategy for ASF Infra services in
         response to community demands (Critical, Core and Standard
         services) [VP]
       * Implement the defined strategy for ASF Infra (Critical, Core and
         Standard services [STAFF]
       * Define SLA targets [VP]
       * Track against SLA targets and report at https://status.apache.org/sla
         [STAFF]
       * Allocate resources (people's time) to ensure tickets are dealt
         with in a timely way in addition to completing assigned project
         word [STAFF]
       * Balance job assignments and project schedules to ensure the
         necessary work is completed while fun new stuff is progressed
         [STAFF]
       * Ensure projects are either provided with everything they need as
         a service, or (wherever possible) are provided compute resources
         to self-host [STAFF]
       * Encourage collaboration between projects who are self-managing
         the same/similar services [VP/STAFF]
       * Set or advise on appropriate ASF policy as requested [VP]
       * Monitor project adherence to appropriate ASF policies (e.g.
         release management, version control, service use), addressing
         issues of concern and escalating to the appropriate officer
         wherever necessary [STAFF]
       * Be the voice of the community within infra operations [VP]
       * Be the voice of the infra team for the ASF President and thus the
         Board and our Members (e.g. board reports) [VP]
       * Manage infra staff with respect to performance and work
         environment [PRESIDENT]
       * Negotiate contract renewals with infra contractors/staff
         [PRESIDENT]
       * Recruit infra staff as needed [PRESIDENT]

       After initial discussion in this board meeting I will take this proposal
       with appropriate modifications to the board@ list for fine tuning. At
       this point the search of a replacement VP and expansion of Staff duties
       can be commenced.  

    Re: A. Late/missing board reports

    @Brett: Should we add another reminder to tardy projects the Monday
    before the meeting?

    Re: B. Synapse issue

    Jim: there has been a lot of contention between Axis and Synapse and
    it doesn't seem to be resolved in a good way

    Sam: there is a significant trademark issue with wso2-synapse; they
    have forked the project and taken our trademark and the fork does
    not even implement the same API

    Jim: I'm expecting to hear from WSO2 that since synapse has retired
    we want to take the trademark

    Shane: how are the company and project working together?

    Also, cloudstack has been forked; this situation needs to be
    investigated

    Re: C. VP Infra plan

    Sam: Overall, good work; perhaps change the set strategy and define
    SLA to ratify strategy and SLA instead?

    Ross: good change.

    Brett: looks like more responsibility for staff; could we bring up
    someone from infra for leadership role?

    Ross: with current structure it might be risky to promote an
    existing infra contractor; the best option for outsourcing would
    probably cost an extra $100K per year; the good news is that we are
    in a healthy situation with regard to cost

    Brett: we should be sensitive to the effect on staff

    Henri: job description-wise; I would expect to see a ‘travel
    required’ or not

    Ross: I will add this to the job requirements

    Shane: I would like to see us put as much as possible on public web
    site to get feedback from stakeholders and show other organizations
    "how we do things here"

    Ross: the meeting minutes are public

    Shane: but people outside the board meeting attendees won’t see how
    we handled this issue

    Ross: I’m focused on getting it done, not necessarily publishing it;
    feel free to take this discussion to a different venue

    David: good for Ross to take on some personnel management tasks
    interim; there is lots of menial work to do but needs to line up with
    long term goals; I'm looking forward to seeing who gets recruited for the
    new role

    Ross: "self elected" senior team member caused problems in the past;
    what we are looking for is more like a "project lead" than a manager
    for keeping projects on track; I'll take this forward with more
    discussion on board@

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Busier than usual month on trademarks@, but now have the time and organization
- and documentation improvements - to really improve our ability to respond to
basic questions, and to provide guidance and precedents for more complex
questions.

Approved several continuing events; the number of Apache projects with notable
annual conferences using our brands continues to grow strongly.

Hadoop PMC handled a number of details around proper references to their brand
by different vendors nicely.

Working with the AOO PMC to make formal trademark infringement complaints to
the Microsoft Store due to a vendor there misusing our OpenOffice marks.

Counsel is working on our backlog of registration requests; began applications
for TOMCAT internationally, TEZ, CASSANDRA, and MESOS.  KYLIN and SPARK
projects are preparing justifications for their international registrations.
KYLIN PMC also wishes to register their logo.

Awaiting assistance from operations@/treasurer@ to report past brand payments,
we have an additional invoice awaiting approval based on the report.

Shane has started a regular review of selected project homepages and brand
presentation, both as a way to help PMCs understand policies as well as to
suggest improvements for ways to help draw in new contributors.  Will be
posting regular updates on http://communityovercode.com/ throughout the year.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities are continuing normally.

We are up to date with sending all invoices. After a few conversations with
Virtual we setup a reporting system that I believe gives the feedback needed
to fundraising. Based on it we can keep the fundraising@ records up to date
with the authoritative financial records from accounting@. I am in the process
of updating the records and by the board meeting they should be almost, if not
completely, in sync. If other tweaks will be necessary, we'll address them
later.

No new sponsors this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]


I. Budget: we remain within budget, with no outstanding invoices due
at this time thanks to the expeditious payment processing from the
Virtual team.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally Khudairi is
preparing the upcoming ASF Third Quarter report (November 2015-January
2016) which will be published at the end of the month. She
successfully launched the new ASF identity with thanks to LucidWorks
and HotWax Systems for donating creative services, and will continue
to work together on supporting the ongoing rollout. The new identity
was received with great enthusiasm by the community and debuted at
FOSDEM, where the promotional giveaways (pins, pens, "Powered By"
stickers, caps, cups, and t-shirts) created by Daniel Gruno we a
tremendous hit. As the inventory cleared out before the event was
over, we are considering creating a similar package for the upcoming
ApacheCon.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 27 January 2016 -- The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Strong
Momentum; Enters 2016 More Influential, Innovative, Efficient, and
with a New Look

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 20 items were tweeted on @TheASF. 4 Apache News
Round-ups were issued, with a total of 74 weekly summaries published
to date. No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel.

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are currently in
development. Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator
as well as PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did
You Know?" success stories are welcome to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least
2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we've had an uptick in media requests over the
past three weeks, particularly for briefings where members of the
Apache community are serving as industry experts across an array of
topics. The trend of our growing media coverage in Asia continues. The
ASF received 1,692 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's
clip count of 960.

Due to our increased media presence, Sally has decided to reinstate
the media/analyst trainings offered during ApacheCon, and will be
holding two different beginner level sessions (one for podlings in the
Incubator, the other for established TLPs or sub-projects), as well as
an advanced session. She is finalizing details with the Linux
Foundation team and will be announcing details on these opportunities
to the community shortly.

VI-a. Public Relations: Sally has been exploring options for an
ASF-dedicated phone line, and to create a more detailed/visible "help"
page on apache.org, but hasn't progressed on this over the past month.

VII. Analyst Relations: although we have had no formal briefings
during this timeframe, we continue to serve as an ongoing resource for
a small handful of analysts. Apache was mentioned in 20 reports by
Gartner, 5 reports by Forrester, 25 reports by 451 Research, and 13
reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally has been working with the Linux
Foundation team on updating the ApacheCon logo and signage, and has
been helping promote the CFP and Travel Assistance deadlines.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no formal
activities are taking place at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 51 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2017. Although we haven't received
formal notice, it appears that we no longer receive gratis news
release distribution in the UK by Pressat (no new ASF announcements
have been posted on their site as of September 2015).

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
N/A

Operations Action Items:
========================
N/A

Short Term Priorities:
======================
- Setting up a new git repository server at the ASF for testing git r/w
  synchronization viability.
- Provision an isolated test environment (including isolated LDAP) for
  developing/testing services faster than is currently possible, under a
  separate domain (asfplayground.org). We believe this separation will also help
  projects and volunteers work on their ideas, such as the Syncope trial, as
  they can then develop and test without interfering with production systems
- Agreement with Apple has been executed, and projects may now publish
   apps in the iTunes store. Huge thanks to Mark Thomas who has been
   working on this for multiple years and seen it to conclusion. 
- Appveyor CI is now available for projects who make use of a Github
   mirror, see for more details:
   https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/appveyor_ci_now_available_for

Long Range Priorities:
======================
- Mailing list system switchover is expected to happen in the coming months. We
  are aware of a few outstanding mail-search requests that we have concluded
  could be solved out-of-the-box by this.
- VMs on Eirene, Nyx and Erebus to be moved in readiness for their decommission
- Further explore identity management proposals

General Activity:
=================
- Moved the STeVe VM to a new data center in anticipation of the upcoming annual
  members meeting. Benchmarks show it could serve an election with more than
  6,000 voters, so it should be adequate for the upcoming election. 
- The new machine for serving up ASF's end of the ASF->GitHub r/w repositories
  is under work, but has been slowed a bit by some difficulty in integrating
  new hooks as well as difficulty with our current environment setup (see SRPs
  above).  As stated in the SRPs, we have discussed deploying a separate test
  environment that is isolated from our production environment and would allow
  for faster development/testing. The project hinges on three phases: ACL,
  email/webhooks and dual r/w repositories with sync. The ACL has been
  automated now and is working. The email phase has turned up some faults in
  GitHub's way of determining whether a commit is unique (and thus deserves a
  diff email), and thus we are working towards replacing this with a new
  mechanism. This new method however is dependent on getting the 2xr/w repos
  up and running, which in turn depends on rewriting the git hooks we have in
  place for our current setup, and is the cause of the current slow progress.
  We expect to have a basic work flow with new hooks in the coming week, and
  once that is confirmed, we'll attach the Whimsy code to that process.
- Work continues on moving machines from our old VM boxes to our new provider.
- Fixed some issues with buildbot configurations not being applied.
- Lots of JIRA activity: 175 tickets created, 146 resolved
- Fixed spam filtering cluster so that it runs checks correctly and is able to
  catch more legitimate spam. This has already proven very effective.
- 5 machines and two arrays decommisoned and removed from OSUOSL racks.

Uptime Statistics:
==================
The new Whimsy VM has implemented a status page that we have tied into our
monitoring system (PMB). This is still not considered a production environment,
and thus does not count towards our SLA.

This month was a slightly bumpy ride for some services. While the critical
services continued their nice trend of pretty much 100% uptime, some core
services such as people.apache.org have acted very unstable, indicating that we
may need to speed up the decommissioning of this service.

BugZilla has been abused by some external services trying to scrape
everything, causing some downtime. We have implemented a connection rate
limiting module (using mod_lua) for the BZ proxy and this seems to have helped,
albeit not stopped the downtime competely.

The Moin wiki is, as always, experiencing hiccups, caused by the general flaw
in its design. We urge any project still using this to switch to cwiki, if they
experience slowness in the service.

For details statistics, see http://status.apache.org/sla/

Description:
  Apache Brooklyn Project is a software framework for modeling,
  monitoring and managing cloud applications through autonomic
  blueprints.

Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

Activity:
 - Our source code repository reorganisation is complete and we are
   now using multiple repositories for different modules of our project.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------
Since the last report, email and commit activity continues to move
along slowly. The .12 release is still in limbo. Creadur is primarily used by
other Apache projects to help check for conformity to ASF standards. This is
why the project team is primarily comprised of members and committers from
other ASF projects.  The risk of the project foundering is therefore very low.

Community
---------
The last committer was elected in August, 2012. In September 2013
Phil Ottlinger was elected to join the PMC.


Releases
--------
 Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was
released in September, 2013.

Community Objectives
--------------------
Release RAT 0.12
Find more committers

Attachment P: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Thomas Andraschko]

## Description:
   Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
   (Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
   which contains lots of useful tools and helpers

   DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
   Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

   DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like
   Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly,
   Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also on
   simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
   with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description:
The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model
and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores,
key value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data
with extensive Apache Hadoop™ MapReduce support.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Gora has seen a reasonable degree of activity in this last while.
We've seen new members coming to report bugs (which have been fixed),
as well as evidence that Gora is being used in a number of big data
search stacks with some possible module contributions coming our way.
We have only one or two issues before we are ready to release Gora 0.7.
Lewis John McGibbney gave a Gora lightening talk @NASA JPL.
Work is ongoing to build a Gora-backed Log4j2 NoSQL appender.

## Health report:
More or less all of the Gora correspondence happens on dev@. We very
rarely have individual coming to user@. Of the ML traffic on dev@
the overwhelming majority of it is Jira and Github correspondence.
Generally speaking however, if we have new bug reports filed, they
are acted upon in a reasonable timeframe.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description:

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

## Issues:

There are no particular issue requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Still no new release yet since the graduation to TLP this month.
And there’s a growing demand for a new release (2.4.6).
We are still working on automating our process further, as the current
release strategy requires too many manual steps that we fear might lead us
to release sup-optimal versions as some point.

We created a new to spread news and interesting links
about the Apache Groovy project, and at the time of
writing, we’ve just passed the 1000 followers mark.

Last month, we reported on the new Twitter account
(@ApacheGroovy [1]) to spread Groovy-related news.
We reached 1000 followers and are now at over 1200 followers.

## Health report:

Project activity (#mails, tickets, commits etc) are all healthy as the
project is already pretty mature. But releases need to be made more
frequently.

Last month, we entered the TIOBE programming language index
at the 17th position, and for February, we’re ranked 20th.

Upcoming Groovy dedicated conferences are coming up:

- GR8Days in Poland in March (new conference)
- Greach in Spain in April
- GR8Conf Europe in June
- GR8Conf US in July
- G3 Summit in December (new conference)

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 49 podlings currently undergoing incubation.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Greg Trasuk

* New Podlings

  - iota (formerly Tempo)
  - Beam (formerly Dataflow)

* Graduations

  None this month.

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  January:

  - 2016-01-07 Apache Trafodion 1.3.0-incubating
  - 2016-01-08 Apache Slider 0.90.2-incubating
  - 2016-01-13 Apache HTrace 4.0.1-incubating
  - 2016-01-14 Apache Singa 0.2.0
  - 2016-01-17 Apache Malhar v3.3.0-incubating

  - 2016-01-26 Apache Twill 0.7.0-incubating
  - 2016-01-28 Apache FreeMarker 2.3.24-rc01-incubating

  Wave's release candidate finally received its 3rd and 4th IPMC +1 votes,
  nearly three months after it was submitted to general@incubator on
  November 3rd, 2015.

* IP Clearance

  - Thomas Weise, Siyuan Hua, Jean-Baptiste Note, and Datatorrent Inc.
    donated Kafka on YARN (KOYA), an "app-package" built for use with Apache
    Slider (incubating).

* Legal / Trademarks

  More podlings have begun reviewing names prior to entry into the Incubator
  in order to avoid the inconvenience of mid-incubation name change to
  users, developers and Apache Infra.

  - The proposed "Dataflow" podling adopted the name "Beam" because the
    Dataflow brand was not donated -- Google will continue to provide
    "Google Cloud Dataflow".
  - The proposed "Tempo" podling renamed itself "iota", in part to avoid the
    possibility of confusion with a similarly named project.

* Miscellaneous

  - Several podlings experienced difficulties implementing Apache
    requirements for LICENSE and NOTICE.  Draft documentation provided by
    Todd Lipcon was discussed.
  - Some incoming proposals have started adopting the "Additional Interested
    Contributors" section, which allows people to express interest in the
    project while deferring the sensitive subject of commit privileges.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Chris Nauroth (cnauroth):

    Once again, I'll echo concerns about lack of activity and potential
    long-term viability of the project.

  Julian Hyde (jhyde):

    I share Chris's concerns. The project claim that activity is happening
    in private; if so, it would be hugely beneficial to make that activity
    public. Having said that, filing a report on time and appointing a
    committer is activity, and that is appreciated.

--------------------
Kudu

Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache Hadoop
ecosystem.

Kudu has been incubating since 2015-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to move over infrastructure (JIRA, etc) to ASF
  2. Build a more diverse development and user community
  3. Perform releases under the ASF

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - In January, we have received patches from three new contributors.  The
    patches were of varying size (from trivial to quite significant) but
    we're encouraged that new developers are finding the patch submission
    process approachable.

  - Overall >110 patches were committed in January from 11 developers
    representing three organizations. Discounting some large patches which
    replaced our copyright boilerplate, license notices, etc, around
    10-12kloc were changed in January. This is a substantial increase
    compared to December which had only 29 patches, representing less than
    1000 lines of changed code.

    Lines of code are not a primary metric we track, but the above shows
    that the community is getting back into rapid and lively development
    after a lull during the holiday season. This is also evident in the dev
    list traffic (1084 messages so far in January).

  - Community members continue to give public talks about Kudu at various
    conferences and meetups. Talks were delivered at meetups in Atlanta and
    Palo Alto, and more are being scheduled for the coming months.

  - The public Kudu Slack channel has proven fairly popular among both the
    developer and user communities. The group now has 116 members, of which
    ~20 are typically active on an average weekday.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, we've accomplished the following milestones:

  - We set up a workflow and scripting for committers to easily push work
    that has been reviewed on Gerrit into our official ASF repository. We
    are following the best practices established by the AsterixDB podling.

  - We moved over our user and developer discussions to ASF mailing lists
    and discontinued usage of our old Google Groups. Migration of JIRA is an
    ongoing project which we hope to close out this coming month.

  - We set up publicly-accessible precommit builds so that non-Cloudera
    contributors can see automated test results for their contributions.

  - We adjusted our licensing boilerplate and documentation to comply with
    our understanding of ASF policies. We also started to build scripting
    for doing ASF-style source releases. We are planning on doing our first
    release in the incubator in early Feb.

Date of last release:

  None under the ASF. Outside of the ASF, we released 0.6.0 on 11/24/2015.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  None since initial incubation.

log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create a release
  2. Activate some community
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There's an ongoing discussion to move the project to attic unless it is
  able to release in the next few months.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Not grown. However, the project aims to become a sub project of Apache
  Logging again. Community growth is not much a matter for this podling, as
  long as there are a few active contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  After the discussion about the activity of the project and the success of
  the incubation process, there's currently a member willing to step through
  the release process. The initial plan on incubation anyway was to primary
  apply available patches and release those bug fixes.

  Additionally, there's once more a discussion about the supported build
  platforms, because currently the project heavily focusses on cpptasks,
  which is not maintained and simply doesn't support current versions of all
  formerly supported IDEs anymore.  The current focus is on dropping
  cpptasks and ANT for the build of the software and use autoconf and/or
  cmake instead.

offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis. Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.

Metron has been incubating since 12-08-2015

Three most important issues to address in the move towards
Graduation.

  - Building a diverse community of developers for Metron
  - Getting security practitioners to provide feedback on requirements
  - Make an Apache release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of?

  - We are currently trying to produce the first Apache release of Metron
  - We would like to request Apache infrastructure (a Jenkins server) for CI

How has the community developed since the last report

  - We started working on implementing a variety of new features on Metron
  - We did a Meetup in the DC area jointly with Capital One.  We had over 75
    people in attendance with many expressing interest in joining the Metron
    project

How has the project developed since the last report

  - This month we have closed 7 key Jiras and built up scripts for standing
    up an integration and test environment for Metron that anyone in the
    community can take advantage of

Milagro

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.  Import the Software
  2.  Develop the community
  3.  Establish the project's identity

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  n/a

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has voted to invite four further developers to join as
  committers and PPMC members.  Two of these were omissions from the Initial
  Committers list; the others are new.  We are in the process of inviting
  them.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Milagro is still in the very early stages of incubation, and performing
  the mechanical tasks of code movement and infrastructure setup is our
  first priority.

  We have started developing the community on the Apache mailinglists, but
  have yet to move other activities to Apache.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Nick Burch (nick):

    It's a shame that the large amount of private work done can't be
    contributed back to the project, as that could've been a big help.  We
    are seeing activity again, and the work towards a release which could
    help grow interest.  More committers are needed, but no strong
    candidates are currently visible, so outreach work is needed. Despite
    these issues, the project certainly deserves another 3 months to see if
    they can turn the corner.

    performance with fewer resources.
  * [S2GRAPH-7] For the above, common codes such as parsing JSON are moved
    to s2core.
  * [S2GRAPH-14] We generalize the HBase-specific code for adding other
    storages easy.

SystemML

SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at
flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid
runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to
distributed computations running on Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache
Spark.

SystemML has been incubating since 2015-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  - Grow SystemML community: increase mailing list activity,
    increase adoption of SystemML for scalable machine learning, encourage
    data scientists to adopt DML and PyDML algorithm scripts, respond to
    user feedback to ensure SystemML meets the requirements of real-world
    situations, write papers, and present talks about SystemML.
  - Produce a release (in progress).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  NONE. We have resolved our blocking infrastructure issues related to
  project JIRA.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our mailing list in January had 123 messages (7 of which were Jenkins). We
  have had several useful discussions on the mailing list concerning various
  aspects of SystemML. We have had several additional discussions on our
  JIRA site and in our Pull Request conversations. We have received
  usability feedback which includes filing JIRA issues and mailing list
  activity.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Numerous additions have been made to the project, including core
  functionality, usability improvements, and documentation. The project has
  had 96 commits since January 6. In the last 30 days, 126 new issues have
  been reported on our JIRA site and 68 issues have been resolved. We are in
  the process of producing our first Apache release, version 0.9.0.  RC3
  passed the SystemML PMC vote and is currently being voted on by the IPMC.

Tamaya

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make the project known in projects world-wide.
  2. Release more often.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have new people committing to our project and are in good hope
  one or another will join us as an official committer. JUG talks in
  Switzerland showed that the project is widely known and well
  appreciated in the enterprise context.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project's API has proven to work very well. We added
  additional integrations with several key technologies such
  as Spring, OSGI and CDI. We streamlined our build and also
  had discussions on some needed enhancements on the API/SPI.
  We are currently working on the final aspects for getting out
  our next release, which within 2-4 weeks.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John D. Ament (johndament):

    The core committers are very dedicated to the project.  However, there's
    only two of them.  For the project to be sustainable, they need to show
    growth in contributors.

--------------------
TinkerPop

TinkerPop is a graph computing framework written in Java

TinkerPop has been incubating since 2015-01-16.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Add more members to the PPMC.
  2. Add more members to the committer list.
  3. N/A (unless the mentors have ideas?)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Nothing at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have 2 new committers: Dylan Millikin and Ted Wilmes.  Ted Wilmes has
  also joined the PPMC.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last status report, 166 new JIRA issues have been created and127
  have been resolved.  Travis CI has been enabled so all PRs are
  automatically built and tested upon submittal. Open discussions of project
  related activities and decisions continue on the TinkerPop dev mailing
  list.

  We continue to reach out to other Apache projects to discuss integration
  possibilities.  Since the last report, we have had discussions with Apache
  Flink and Apache S2Graph about adding TinkerPop support.

  A number of graph providers have released new versions of their software
  with TinkerPop support.  These include Stardog, Blazegraph, and OrientDB
  (via the community driven, orientdb-gremlin).  This demonstrates a
  continued community interest, and demand for TinkerPop support.

  A tutorials section has been added to the TinkerPop homepage along with a
  number of tutorials targeted at the TinkerPop beginner.  The hope is that
  this will lower the barrier of entry for new folks who are interested in
  the graph space and TinkerPop in particular.

  The following articles/presentations/blogposts were provided about
  TinkerPop from TinkerPop members since the last report:

  * Rodriguez, M.A., "Quantum Walks with Gremlin"
    <http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06278>, Graph Day, January 2016.
  * Mallette, S.P.,  Kuppitz, D., "Titan 1.0 Data Migration"

Date of last release:

  * 2015-11-24

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  * Dylan Millikin - committer (11/4/2015)
  * Ted Wilmes - committer (11/10/2015) PPMC (1/11/2016)

    TinkerPop is making good progress. If they focus on the 2 points above
    relating to growing the community I think they'll be ready to graduate.

  Daniel Gruno (humbedooh):

    +1 to Hadrian's statement. We have been chatting a bit about getting a
    thread going about what remains before graduation.

Unomi

Unomi is a reference implementation of the OASIS Context Server
specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server
Technical Committee. It provides a high-performance user profile and event
tracking server.

Unomi has been incubating since 2015-10-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Improve documentation on the website
  2. Make some incubating releases
  3. Grow the community size and diversity.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We got feedbacks from users and interested people. They are now mostly
  waiting for the 1.0.0-incubating release.  That's our highest priority
  right now.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Our focus was on Unomi 1.0.0-incubating release.  Unfortunately, a couple
  of issues (see next section) blocked the vote.

  We are fixing those issues to submit a take 3 on 1.0.0-incubating release.

Date of last release:

  Unomi 1.0.0-incubating (take 2) has been called to vote, but the vote
  didn't passed due to:

  * the src distribution included binaries
  * the NOTICE file was incomplete

  We were concerned by the NOTICE as it wasn't obvious and not clear (both
  on the licensing howto and on the mailing list).  Following Justin McLean
  advices, we should be able to update the NOTICE (hopefully, this one will
  be complete).  We are now working on 1.0.0-incubating (take 3) release.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Kevin Minder]

# Description
The Knox Gateway is a REST API gateway for securing Hadoop REST APIs at the
perimeter.  We are starting to move into the UI proxy and UI SSO space as well.

# Issues
* This quarter has seen discusson on dev@knox from a single individual
expressing concern reguarding the project's development practices.  See:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/knox-dev/201512.mbox/%3CCAD-Ua_ibfetwjD2Mx1rOhXzc1y0h6b4PaXZThuByuRKp9oh29g@mail.gmail.com%3E

These issues were discussed and as a result the communities existing
CTR vs RTC practices were refined, clarified and the site contribution process
documentation updated.  I believe this was a beneficial discussion.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Ralph Goers]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to application logging.

Currently there are no issues which require the board's attention.

- Community

Log4j 2 remains an active project. The overall community is healthy
and friendly.

Log4cxx is still active in the Incubator. A thread was started on
the incubator mailing list asking for help in getting new mentors.
This resulted in 2 people offering to help. It also digressed into
a discussion about closing down the podling. The podling is actively
discussing how to create a release that doesn't use Java build tools.

In general, all subprojects are still healthy although none has grown
much since the last report.


- Project Branding Requirements

All components except Chainsaw meet the branding requirements.
We will fix the Chainsaw branding with the next release.

- Last three community changes

 * Ralph Goers was voted to be the next Chair on Nov 01 2015
 * Mikael Staldal joined as a Committer on Sep 17 2015
 * Matt Sicker joined as PMC Member on Aug 10 2014

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.3 release on
December 17, 2015.  We have now discontinued planned releases for the 1.x
ManifoldCF platform.  The next major release is scheduled for April 30, 2016.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Tugba Dogan on September 7, 2015.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been light this quarter, except for December.  Most of our
connectors have significant use cases and constituencies and are mature
offerings.  There is a notable cycle of activity seemingly centered on quarter
ends which seems to have become more pronounced.  Dev list
comments for this period centered around the ManifoldCF 2.3 release in December,
and occasional user questions.  I am unaware of any mailing-list question that
has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

Marmotta Board Report for February 2016
=======================================

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012 and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.

Another low activity quarter, with just small developments towards what the
project should release as 3.4.0 in the upcoming weeks. The stability of the
source code is heading the project to get more focused activity out there,
getting quite some interesting contributions to improve the performance.

One the 3.4 milestone, the project already discussed to take bigger steps for
a new release (4.0?), where new fresh things, like Java 8 and Sesame 4, should
come in.

The last developments regarding geospatial querying (GeoSPARQL) have reached
the news with, not only posts at the ASF/OGC blogs, but also at some
third-party media.

We are already trying to find the resources necessary to adapt the project
identity (mainly logo) to the new look recently adopted by The Foundation.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

DESCRIPTION

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications.  OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

Apache Oltu Oauth2 module version 1.0.1 was released September 24th 2015

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard.

A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014 and some minor releases
are going out regularly for bug fixing. The current intention is to extend the
coverage to the JWE (started in OLTU-80)

- Implement JWE support for JWT In Progress ). We completed the "Handling
  Cryptography" process (http://www.apache.org/dev/crypto.html) in
  OLTU-162 - Handling Cryptography within OLTU Release Resolved .

Users activity is growing slowly but steadily (the user@ mailing list has got
new messages from new users). We got quite some feedbacks from users (included
patches).  The answer from Oltu dev seems to be a bit slow though. The overall
coding activity is also slow. The reason might also be the fact the OAuth
specification is stable for a while (being an RFC) hence also the code is
stable. I have sent an email to dev@ in order to encourage people to engage
more on reported bugs. I will report next time with the outcome.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

Project Activity:
Development on the project has been quite good since the last report.
There has been an increase in new contributors helping out with some
sticking around and becoming regular faces. Omkar Reddy recently
joined the project as a committer and PMC member after making
a number of great contributions and bug fixes.

The team pushed out a 1.0.0 release in late September which included
a large number of new features that were integrated since our last
release in January 2015. The team has a rough plan laid out for the
next release (1.1.0) and has been pushing forward towards it. A good
amount of progress has been made on 1.1 with quite a few new features
and bug fixes having already been pushed to the code base. We expect
to have 1.1 pushed out soon given the current progress.

Issues for the Board:
None

When was the last release:
0.5 - 13 January 2015
1.0.0 - 22 September 2015

When was the last committer or PMC member elected:
Omkar Reddy - 20 January 2016

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Pinaki Poddar]

## Description: 
Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for databases,
relational as well as non-relational. For relational databases, OpenJPA is
compliant to the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0.
OpenJPA runs in stand-alone JSE as well as  containers e.g JavaEE,
Tomcat, Spring or OSGi.

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
Besides the always swelling EE7 TCK issue which prevents us 
from verifying comatility with JPA-2.1.

## Activity: 
There is quite some maintenance activity on the 2.x branch which is 
targetting the JPA-2.0 specification. 
JPA-2.1 work is still not taking off as we are still hoping to finally
get the TCK for EE7.
We could go on implementing JPA-2.1 features and ignore all those 
bloody JCP hassles. 
We already have quite a few of those features in place in a branch.

## Health report: 
OpenJPA is a 'mature' codebase and many parts are stable and needs
lots of knowledge if you touch them. Thus it's rather hard to 
get up and running. 
We tried to modernise the structure a bit (moving from Junit3 to 4) 
but that's really just the tip of the iceberg.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications, with an emphasis on standards published jointly
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and International Organization
for Standardization (ISO). Apache SIS 0.6 contains geodetic data
structures for geospatial referencing such as map projection and
coordinate reference system definitions, along with the associated
operations which enable the mathematical conversion of coordinates
between different systems of reference.


## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

About 17,000 lines of code and also 17,000 lines of comment (according
CLOC) ported to SIS since the last report. The main new feature is the
support of the EPSG geodetic dataset, a de-facto standard database of
more than 6000 coordinate reference systems used on Earth (a preliminary
list is at [1]). However we still have to resolve LEGAL-183 in order to
bring those data to users. We are exploring download from a command line
tool.

No significant progress on the developer guide [2] since last report. We
recognize that this documentation is necessary for lowering the entry
barrier, and hope to spend some days on it before the next release.

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) published a blog entry titled "OGC
standards in Apache projects" in December [3]. A journalist published an
article about SIS, Marmotta, Open Climate Workbench and Magellan in
January [4]. An OGC officer plans to come to ApacheCon in Vancouver and
proposes to setup a geospatial track. An Apache SIS talk has been
submitted for that track.

I had informal talk with OGC director about free membership for ASF last
year. There is no new development on this front since I didn't had the
opportunity to attend an OGC meeting since that time. The next
opportunities may be ApacheCon in Vancouver (May) and the next OGC
meeting in Dublin (June).


## Health report:

The project is reported as healthy by the report helper (score of 7.15),
but the number of active developers is still low. The fact that the
"referencing by coordinates" module is almost done (> 70,000 lines of
code) may help, since referencing is usually not the most attractive
topics for new GIS developers. The next parts (e.g. rasters, GUI) may be
more attractive.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

First, appologies for the missed reports. We had to report in December
but missed that plus the January report.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment. However,
the project is in a phase where new/other people should take over the
lead as chairman since the current chairman Fabian Christ has less and
less time to manage the project. Therefore, the project will start to
find a new person for this job.

Additionally, a first suggestion was started to invite new people to
become PMC members and potentially new leaders for the project.

At code level the project is doing fine. The project started to
reorganize a lot of old JIRA issues and tries to focus on the relevant
tasks.

The project did not manage to cut new releases. This is also an issue of
finding new people to become more responsible for the project and start
creating releases.

Bertrand Delacretaz has resigned from the Stanbol PMC on December, 1st 2015

Subscribers on the dev list: 233

Last new committer was
  Cristian Petroaca on May 7th, 2015

No new PMC member was elected since the graduation of Apache Stanbol on
Sep 19th, 2012.

Last stack release was:
  Apache Stanbol 0.12 on Mar 2nd, 2014

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Stratos Project  [Lakmal Warusawithana]

## Description:
   Apache Stratos is a highly-extensible Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
   framework that helps run Apache Tomcat, PHP, and MySQL applications and can
   be extended to support many more environments on all major cloud
   infrastructures.

## Issues:
 - No issue for last quarter

## Activity:
 - Last 3 months, developers are mainly focused on stability of the 4.1.x
   release.  Delivered one bug fixed release. No heavy development happened in
   the last quarter may be due to the holiday season.

## Health report:
 - For last quarter no new committer / PMC member added. I feel people are
   loosing interest in Stratos due to mainly rising of other open source
   projects in same space with bigger backing up. I believed Stratos community
   need to find right place to play with other open source project. Also WSO2
   stopped providing paid contributors to the project. This will affect to
   slow down the project ,because all full time contributors were WSO2
   employees. But PMC is strong enough to take forward the project.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 45 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Pubudu Gunatilaka on Fri Sep 25 2015

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 46 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  Our last PMC addition was in December 2015 (James McCoy)
  Our last committer addition was in November 2015 (James McCoy).

  The community remains active on its mailing lists:
    * almost 800 subscribers to users@ with over 100 messages per month
    * over 300 subscribers to dev@ with over 120 messages per month

  The dev@ activity and a healthy commit rate is encouraging, as we
  have seen a downward trend of paid developers over the past six months.

* Releases

  Apache Subversion 1.9.3 was released on December 14, 2015.
  Apache Subversion 1.8.15 was released on December 14, 2015.

  Development continues on 1.10.x, with about 250 commits per month. No
  target date or feature set has been defined.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiriccò]

## Description:
     Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities
     in enterprise environments.

## Issues:
     There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

     We are seeing an increasing activity level on both user@ and dev@ mailing
     lists, especially related to the first milestone release cut in December
     from 2.0.0, which provides a first essay of several new features.

     The main focus is now set to complete the missing bits for 2.0.0,
     especially about renewed documentation and admin console.

     The PMC has briefly discussed in December about the opportunity to rotate
     the PMC chair; such discussion brought anyway to confirmation of the
     current chair.

     In December we have also started dicussing with Infra about the
     possibility of a PoC for proving the effectiveness of using Syncope for
     ASF corporate identity management but, after an initial interest - which
     led to the creation of a new GIT repository for the purpose - things seem
     to have stalled.

## Committer / PMC changes:

   - Currently 19 committers and 9 LDAP committee group members.
    - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
    - Last PMC addition was Guido Wimmel in April 2014
    - Last committer addition was Giacomo Lamonaco in January 2015

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  We have begun to discuss the process of a change in project lead, as
  Howard Lewis Ship's involvement in the project has markedly
  decreased over the last year or more.

When did the project last make any releases?

  Tapestry 5.4.0 was released on 21 Dec 2015. This was a long, long,
  time in the making.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is slow. Questions are answered
  with participation of not only the core contributors but also by the
  community at large. Discussion focuses especially around new
  features of the 5.4 release. There are also occasional
  announcements concerning third-party libraries developed entirely
  outside the Tapestry team.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  Plans are underway to determine what changes will be introduced into
  Tapestry 5.5.
                                   
When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 25 Apr 2014, and
  subsequently been voted into the PMC (2 Mar 2015).

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Ross Gardler]


1) GitHub experiment appears to have stalled.  In particular, adding a new
   committer (e.g. Brett) still involves manual intervention by the
   infrastructure team; and there still isn't an Apache hosted clone of
   Whimsy.  None of this is affecting whimsy development, but is the reason
   for monthly board reports.

2) Brett and Craig have succeeded pushing changes to GitHub.  Changes continue
   to be automatically deployed, without human intervention.

3) Primarily due to the deadlock and authentication problems experienced with
   the board agenda tool, that tool has been moved over to whimsy-test.  It's
   internal threading model has been converted to processes, and LDAP failover
   and cache expiration logic has been added.  Sebb has been instrumental in
   this effort.  This may ultimately address the problems that Brett saw with
   missing mail addresses in board reminders.

4) Sebb has moved the Apache phone book over to be based on data produced by
   whimsy.

5) Status monitoring is now implemented, and continues to be refined. It has
   already proven to be helpful.

6) As problems with the current secretary mail process seem to not be as
   prevalent this month, and the move to the new mail system by the
   infrastructure team isn't imminent, work on this has slowed in favor of
   other efforts.

7) Initial code has been roughed in for a replacement for the current LDAP
   Perl scripts used to add committers to a PMC and to modify PMC membership.
   This effort may be ultimately be superseded Syncope.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of
REST style web services. The core server runtime is based on the
JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client
runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side
runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Community:
The Wink project has a small community which is not very active. Although
I believe Wink is a mature project with active users, the overall PMC has 
been alive but not active, and is currently starting to contemplate  a move
to attic. 

Last svn activity shows couple website updates in the past week (02/2016)

Releases:
* Last release was Apache Wink 1.4.0 which was released on September 15, 2013

Committers or PMC changes:
* Voted Gerhard Petracek was added as a Wink committer in August 2013.

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Wookie Project  [Scott Wilson]

Apache Wookie develops software related to implementation of the W3C
Widgets family of specifications.

ISSUES
As mentioned in previous reports, activity in the project has declined and is
now at a minimum with some questions from users and implementers but little on
the development side  and also the community has not grown since 2013. The
reasons for this remain the same, in particular the lack of non-proprietary
adoption of the W3C widget specification. As a result we are currently holding
a vote to move Wookie to the Attic.

RELEASES
Wookie 1.0 was released on 24th February 2014.

ACTIVITY
None recently.

COMMUNITY
Our last committer and PMC member added was Steve Lee on 21st February 2013.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]
The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries.

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can upgrade the project to address the newer XPath and XSLT standards.

We are in process of doing integration builds to incorporate the Xerces-C
patches. There continues to be activity on the Xalan-J project.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature product.  There is little development activity other
than patch maintenance.  Most of the activity is in the Xalan-J subproject.
There are some participants reporting on their build and deployment issues.

We are still trying to get more participants to report on their integration
build attempts.  Work is continuing to perform integration builds using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 through 2015.  Some builds were performed for
Solaris.

Most of the communications traffic is via JIRA. Email list activity has been
stagnant for 2 months.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.
