 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The board continues to discuss the possible appointments for officer
       roles, particularly in light of Ross' resignation as President as he
       conveys in the following report.

       On behalf of the board, many thanks to Ross for his service in the
       role over the last 3 years, committing significant time as a volunteer
       to the smooth operation of the Foundation.

    B. President [Ross]

       On 28 September 2016 I notified the board of my resignation, full
       resignation email posted at the end of this report. The summary is
       that it's time for a change, we need new energy and new ideas on the
       operations side of the house and I need to go back to the community
       side of the house. 

       While I gave the board 3 months to find my replacement this may well
       be my last report and therefore I want to take this opportunity to
       thank the current and previous boards for the opportunity to serve as
       the foundations President. It has been an honor and a privilege to
       serve the foundation, its members and its projects. The ASF stands
       proud among open source foundations and, I am sure, will continue to
       do so for many years to come. While I'm stepping down as President I
       have no intention of moving too far from the foundation. 

       And so, to my report...

       Executive Assistant
       =============== 

       Mostly "business as usual". One item of note: TAC process is 
       progressing well. 14 applications were approved from the 27 received.

       Brand Management
       =============== 

       No report at the time of writing. I'm not aware of any major issues.
       There has been a steady flow of requests, but for the most part they
       are being handled in the normal process. There are a couple of more
       complex potential breaches being explored, in at least one case the
       PMC is seeking guidance from VP Brand Management.

       Fundraising
       ========= 

       There was a discussion on a Google SEO forum that highlighted the
       ability to "buy" a link from apache.org for the price of a Bronze
       Sponsorship. This thread has since been deleted but there is
       discussion on at least one other SEO focused site. This prompted
       further discussion around the current no-follow policy for Bronze
       sponsors. As a result VP Fundraising has indicated that he will
       reverse the decision to provide follow links to Bronze level sponsors.

       Marketing and Publicity
       ================== 

       With some significant effort to obtain content from all parties Sally
       has published our Q1 FY2017 report. Thanks to everyone involved.

       Sally continues to work with VP Fundraising to help with
       communication/engagement.

       Snoot analytics is now available to all PMCs.

       Sally is proactively engaging with new podlings to help with early
       community building efforts through.

       Media trainings will be available at ApacheCon EU.

       Infrastructure
       ========== 

       A second round of interviews was carried out with the assistance of EA
       and Infra Admin. Consequently a hire decision was made and an offer
       has been extended. A second hire is being explored.

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ====================== 

       No report submitted. See EA report for details
       (EA remains acting VP given the ongoing absence of the current VP TAC)

       My resignation email 
       ================

       (posted to board@apache.org on Sept 28 2016)


       I have decided that it is time for me to step down as President of the
       foundation. I notified the board of my intention a few days ago and
       with this email I make it official. I will remain in service for up to
       three months while a replacement is found and we work to ensure a
       smooth transition. That said, I encourage the board to appoint my
       replacement as soon as possible.

       There are many reasons behind this very difficult decision. I will
       enumerate the key points here for the record. I am happy to expand on
       these points, but encourage discussion of my opinions and reasoning to
       be restricted to separate threads covering individual topics. This
       thread should stay focused on my resignation and the process of
       replacing me.

       At a high level my reasons for resigning are:

       1)	Personal: my day job role has changed in recent times. I am more
       directly engaged with engineers than I have been for years. Since I
       started my IT career as an engineer I am truly enjoying this change,
       even more so since many of the projects I work with are here at
       Apache. I want to return to my roots and become active in the Apache
       projects that are important to the engineering side of my life.
       Resigning as President gives me more time to do that. This is not to
       say that I will be moving away from the operational aspects of the
       foundation completely, more on this below. 

       2)	Workload: the role of the president is to ensure the smooth running
       of the Foundation from an operations perspective. The role is ably
       supported by a number of VPs and other volunteers. Most of those
       individuals do as much as they can, but most are volunteers and as
       such cannot be available at all times. Unlike our code projects the
       majority of things on the operations side are time dependent.
       Furthermore, the timing is largely dictated by our code projects, not
       by the operations teams themselves. For example,  a project needs an
       infra change before it can proceed with its work. A reporter needs a
       response before they can publish. A company needs a trademark approval
       before they can launch. A sponsor needs a PO before they can raise an
       invoice and pay. Contracts with event producers need to be signed
       before the venue booking expires. Travel for TAC needs to be booked
       before flights become prohibitively expensive. Project materials need
       to be shipped before an event starts Etc. Etc. Wherever possible we
       delegate this work to the PMCs, however, not all aspects can be
       delegated and not all PMCs are equipped to make progress. Generally
       our operations teams run quite well, but when they don’t the buck
       stops with the President, who is also a volunteer. Once things
       escalate to the President there is usually significant history to wade
       through before one can make progress. Even then there is likely to be
       conflict which needs to be resolved. I find I no longer have that time
       and/or energy to address these items as they escalate (see above).
       This is not good for the foundation. As the foundation continues to
       grow we will see this problem becoming more acute while we rely on
       volunteers at every level, which brings me to the next point.

       3)	Frustration: I have long felt that the foundation needs to plan for
       growth. I’ve stood for and been elected to the board on this point.
       When I was invited to become President I did not stand for board the
       following year. I felt it was important to separate community focused
       activities of the board from Presidential duties overseeing the
       management and growth of oyr operations. This was a natural next step
       in moving operations activities under the President as originally
       actioned by Jim as the President prior to myself. For the most part
       this been successful. However, I now feel it is time for the next step
       on this evolutionary path. We need to have a paid individual
       responsible for ensuring routine activities are adequately covered.
       This would free our volunteers to focus on escalations and growth
       planning. This discussion and the effort to find a solution that both
       alleviates the operational burden on our volunteers and preserves the
       Apache Way has proven to be unexpectedly frustrating (which has
       undoubtedly contributed to point 1). I feel that the current (and
       previous) board are paralyzed by the complexities of this issue. This
       is a symptom of being driven by consensus and having 9 board members,
       it is not a symptom of ineffective directors. This is a deliberate
       design of the foundation – a design that prevents undue influence from
       a single source. I do not propose changing this design, which has
       served us very well for many years. However, we can't continue without
       managed and controlled change in the way we handle operations within
       the foundation. I reject the assertion that paid operational support
       will lead to an undermining of the Apache Way, but have so far been
       unable to deliver a proposal that satisfies even a majority of the
       board, let alone reached consensus. This is the root of my
       frustration. In a private mail to the directors on this topic (most of
       which appears in my August board report) I said something to the
       effect of “don’t insult me by asking me, again, to throw more
       volunteers at this problem” (where the problem is identified is
       excessive workload, point 2 above). Unfortunately, this is exactly
       what the board have been forced to ask me to do since we do not have
       consensus on an alternative that adequately addresses the
       cross-foundation workload. 

       4)	Need for change: It is clear to me that my style within the
       Presidents role has reached its limit. I can choose to change my
       style, or I can choose to step aside. I have considered both
       approaches and have concluded that a change in President is better for
       me personally and likely better for the foundation as a whole. 

       I am very proud of what we, as a Foundation, have done to build out
       our operations capacity as we have grown. Just a few examples of this
       include: We have audited our finances for the first time (long
       overdue). We have moved our staff and contractors to a formal
       engagement through a Professional Employment Organization. We have
       successfully outsourced our conferences, resulting in multiple
       successful conferences across our many projects. We have modernized
       our infrastructure thus improving service uptime. Many of our
       trademarks are now protectable. We’ve made significant strides in
       improving our sponsor relations. And much more. Each of these sound
       trivial when written as a single sentence, but I can assure everyone
       that many, many hours from multiple volunteers have gone into, and
       continue to go into, each of these items.

       The foundation is in very good shape. We have finances to last many
       years, even at the deficit we are currently running. Our communities
       continue to grow. Our projects continue to drive IT innovation. For
       the most part our operations continue to function well. I am very
       happy to be handing the foundation over to a new President with new
       ideas, new energy and a new approach to building capacity for many
       years to come.

       I want to close by thanking all operations volunteers within the ASF.
       Their work is usually only in focus when someone is not happy. Few of
       our Members, most of our committers and probably none of our
       contributors and users are aware of the hard work our operations teams
       do. Operations work does not produce code, yet without it the
       foundation would not exist. I am proud of my part in this work, but as
       I write this email I find myself looking forward to more time to spend
       on code projects. I only hope that this does not mean that I start to
       be underappreciate the operations teams when something is blocking me.
       I encourage people to quote this paragraph back to me when I am guilty
       of such misconduct.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Apologies for failing to submit a report on time for the last board
       meeting. The past two months have been relatively uneventful except
       for some out-of-cycle payments. We are currently working on a spending
       policy for credit card holders, a first draft has been circulated and
       is waiting for comments. A request from the membership has been made
       to find out whether a company claiming to donate to the ASF for every
       survey response they receive actually even donated.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Travel, the school year, and preparing for upcoming talks have led to less
progress on brand answers and policy improvements than I hoped, although Mark
Thomas has done an excellent job in several areas both answering questions and
helping to analyze issues, including some ideas for improving operations in
the longer term.  I hope to have some plans documented by ApacheCon, although
finding the a workable and sustainable solution to protecting Apache brands
will be a long-term effort that will require more help.

I will be presenting "Practical Trademark Law for FOSS Projects" at All Things
Open, based largely on experiences with Apache projects dealing with third
party uses.  I will also be presenting several trademark-related talks at
ApacheCon in Seville, Spain.  Separately, I have been invited to speak at a
law conference on open source trademark matters.

One question about registered trademarks did come up that needs clarification:
PMCs are responsible for policing notable use of their project trademarks in
the same manner whether their trademarks are registered or not.  The ASF
treats all Apache project names and logos as trademarks of the Foundation. 

Two PMCs with strong brands have been actively working on addressing some
trademark issues, which is great to see the attention and care.  Unfortunately
the number of times that PMC members either disagree on actions to take or
have misconceptions about how trademark policies work means that there is
still a lot of back and forth with trademarks on many of the issues.

The Domain Name Policy is being updated to prohibit the use of Apache project
names as second level or similar style domain names when used for content
related to potentially similar software products or services to that Apache
project.  It's clear from review that we will need to publicize this more
widely to ensure PMCs are aware of it.

A major non-English website and long-running conference using one of our
registered trademarks was brought to trademarks@ and will need to be
addressed.  Given the popularity of the project, it's disappointing that this
website was never reported before now.  There is also little apparent interest
from the PMC to work on addressing it.

I am negotiating an contract update to continue licensing a project's
registered mark for a recurring conference.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Sorry for late posting.

I'll start with thanking Ross for his service and a wonderful mentor.

This month was marked by a thread in an SEO forum that, as Ross indicated,
claimed that the ASF is selling links. After a long debate on the fundraising@
list, the consensus is to revert back to 'nofollow' links. The plan is for VP
Fundraising to first update the Sponsorship page, and then work with all
Bronze sponsor to let them know that the link will convert very soon to a
'follow' link. For sponsors that will choose to withdraw the sponsorship, and
I anticipate getting into that situation, will have their sponsorship funds
returned. VP Fundraising will first work out a process with Tom (Virtual).
After that the Thanks page will also be reverted to 'nofollow' links.

We do have a few pending request for Bronze sponsorship to which we answered
that we are analysing the situation and a response will be provided later.

Due to the distraction triggered by the thread mentioned above, there was no
progress on the initiatives mentioned in the previous report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget. Several invoices, including news
clipping, have been submitted for payment. ApacheCon promotional
materials have been charged against ASF credit cards.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi published the ASF
Quarterly Report (Q1 FY2017) on 29 September. She continues to work
with Hadrian Zbarcea with select Sponsorship/Fundraising
communication/engagement items, and has opened the Snoot analytics
service to all PMCs. In addition, she has begun to work more closely
with the Apache Incubator, both kick-starting their Twitter campaigns
as well as leading the call for a new logo. Sally also continues to
counsel several vendors involved with various Apache projects with
publicity, outreach, and branding requirements, most notably those
involved with incubating projects and/or active in the Big Data space
(Strata + Hadoop conference took place this month).

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe: 

- 13 September 2016 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
Syncope™ 2.0
- 20 September 2016 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
Kudu™ v1.0
- 3 October 2016 --Apache® POI™ Celebrates 15 Years at The Apache
Software Foundation

IV. Informal Announcements: 9 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 115 weekly summaries published to date. 49 items were Tweeted on
@TheASF. No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel.
Sally has been tweeting for the Apache Incubator account for the past
few weeks.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for
more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 8 media queries. The ASF received
1,997 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 675. Media coverage
of Apache projects yielded 4,882 press hits vs. last month's 2,871.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 3 analyst queries and
completed fact-checking a Forrester report. Apache was mentioned in 18
reports by Gartner, 11 reports by Forrester, 12 reports by 451
Research, and 24 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is working with Sharan Foga and Melissa
Warnkin on preparations for the ASF booth at ApacheCon Europe, and has
just announced media/analyst training for ASF Committers, PMCs, and
Incubating projects during the event. Fintan Ryan of RedMonk will be
conducting the media training briefings.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: No
conference-related activities at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 31 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Operations Action Items:
========================


Short Term Priorities:
======================
- Work on experiment with ProxMox for virtualization to aid
  in moving VMs from the vCenter cluster, slated to be decommissioned.
- Further explorer upgrading puppetised machines to Ubuntu 16.04
- Engage with and onboard new staff once hired.

Long Range Priorities:
======================
- Explore moving podlings to separate LDAP entries, which would also
  make the MATT/GitHub experiment much easier in the long run.
- Mailing list system switchover is expected to happen in the coming
  months. A couple of outstanding tickets are pending, and we have yet
  to design a working redirect, although this is expected to be trivial.
- VMs on Eirene, Nyx and Erebus to be moved in readiness for their
  decommission, 
- Moving JIRA to a new location, as the old machine is slated to be
  decommissioned.

General Activity:
=================
- Infrastructure will be present at ApacheCon Seville to interact with the 
  wider ASF community.
- Maven backup repository is being moved to a different DC to save cost
- LDAP clusters are being resized to accommodate DC IP shortages
- VPN scenarios being worked on to reduce the number of public IPs used
Ticket Response and Resolution Targets:
=======================================
  Stats for the current reporting cycle can be found at
  https://status.apache.org/sla/jira/?cycle=2016-10
  
  The tentative goal of having 90% of all tickets fully resolved in time
  is currently not being met, but we expect the rate to go up once new
  staff has been onboarded.

Uptime Statistics:
==================
  Uptime stats have been very stable over the past few months,
  at 99.9% for critical services and 99.8% in total.
  
  For detailed statistics, see http://status.apache.org/sla/

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom Syndication
Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera is in maintenance mode with minimal development activity. I believe
there are at least three PMC members providing oversight still. Recently there
have been a couple of user requests for a new release to pick up updated
dependencies, hopefully that will get done during the next quarter.

The last release was over two years ago, the last commiter / PMC member
addition was Nov 2011.

No board issues.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Summary
The project is active and there are no Board-level issues at this time.
We have made one new release since the previous report and have
not added any committers/PMC members.

Releases
Version 1.8.0 was released on 9/6/2016!
Version 1.6.6 was released on 9/18/2016.

Activity
The number of subscribers to the dev list has decreased slightly, while
the user list subscribers have stayed constant. Mailing list and commit
activity are up significantly over the previous quarter.

In the past 3 months, there have been 295 commits to the master branch
from 16 authors, 7 of whom are not yet committers.

Version 1.6.6 has been released and we have ceased active development
on the 1.6 release line. We will only make another 1.6 release if a
severe issue requires it, and this will be the last release line to
support Java 6 and Hadoop 1.x.

Version 1.8.0 was released, our first significant, non-bugfix release
since May 2015. There was a discussion about dropping Java 7 support for
this release, but ultimately we decided to push that off until the next
major release.

The third annual Apache Accumulo Summit took place on October 11, 2016
(http://accumulosummit.com) and was very successful, with two tracks of
talks and over 200 attendees.

Community
Marc Parisi was added as a committer and PMC member on 8/31/2016.

## Mailing list activity: 
   
The mailing list traffic increased. The Jenkins build failures were coming to
dev list which provides a misleading statistic below. We now moved the jenkins
notifications to issues. From next quarter, the dev list threads will purely
indicate discussions.  Excluding this, still there is fair amount of community
engagement both on dev and user lists. We would like to continue to improve on
these aspects.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description: 
Arrow is a columnar in-memory analytics layer designed to accelerate big data. 
It houses a set of canonical in-memory representations of flat and hierarchical 
data along with multiple language-bindings for structure manipulation. It also 
provides IPC and common algorithm implementations.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity: 
- Arrow made its first release. 
- In preparation of the release, multiple discussions were focused on
  formalizing various Arrow specification details.
- Discussion was good and we reworked some integration to invert the
  dependency model between the Parquet project and the Arrow project.
- A new Arrow file format was defined and implemented in both Java and C++.
  It is also available from Python.
- Community members covered Arrow at multiple conferences including Strata
  NYC.
- Arrow <> Parquet interchange has been made available in C++. 
- The new Arrow file format is planned to be used to move forward on both
  cross-language IPC implementations and enabling cross-language compatibility
  tests.
- We've seen good growth in the Arrow developer mailing list, having increased 
  to 467 subscribers (up 43 in the last 3 months):
  
## Health report: 
- The first release is a good step in engaging a broader range of contributors
  and users. Having bits for use, albeit alpha, allows us to engage a wider
  range of engineers.
- We need to continue to add new examples and more documentation to better
  describe how to use and extend Arrow.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Henri Yandell]

The Attic is where projects slumber when their communities fade away.

Etch is still in the process of moving to the Attic.

Repeating from last report; activity is low. The Attic could use some energy 
towards generating advice on how to keep out of the Attic, some more energy 
on the mundane clean up work, and energy on encouraging energy.

That said, bar Etch there's not much short term to do. 

## PMC changes:

 - Currently there are 20 PMC members.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Ryan Blue]

## Description:

 - Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - 1.8.2 release is close to a release candidate.
 - Added a single-message format and API for systems like Kafka.

## Health report:

 - Last report stated, "Avro is healthier than last [quarter]". This is
   because the community was talking about setting up a regular release
   schedule and there was interest in regularly getting contributor work
   into releases. This is an important step becuase contributors won't
   submit patches to a project if they are never available to use.
 - The release planned for August has been delayed by build issues, but
   is nearly through blockers and is expected this quarter.
 - Contributor engagement is still a goal we are working on. Many committers
   do not have time to review patches.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 16 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Sean Busbey on Sun Feb 14 2016

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 23 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Matthieu Monsch at Mon Jan 18 2016

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Julian Hyde]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and
planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-module within Calcite, and provides a framework for
building local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Since March
2016, Avatica has an independent release schedule, but resides in the
same git repository.

## Issues:

- I (Julian Hyde) have decided to step down as PMC chair, because I
  believe that a rotating chair fosters a strong community. The PMC has
  voted on a replacement, and is recommending Jesús Camacho Rodríguez as
  new PMC chair.  (See Special Orders 7B).
- This is my last Board report for the project; I'd like to thank the
  Board for their support and trust.

## Activity:

Calcite became a top-level project exactly one year ago. On
graduation, the community decided not to adopt bylaws, but to have a
"state of the project" discussion each year, and to rotate the PMC
chair yearly if possible. We have been having this discussion,
achieved consensus on Jesús Camacho Rodríguez as a candidate for PMC
chair, confirmed in a private PMC vote.

Some of the other feedback during the discussion included:
- Satisfaction with the pace of the project, and its ablity to "fan
  out" to cover diverse areas of interest (some of practical use to
  production systems, some of them more experimental);
- A sense that Avatica is still doing OK as a sub-project (that is, it
  is not yet time to consider TLP status), but needs to be factored
  into its own git repo;
- A thirst for documentation to make it easier for casual users to use
  Calcite.

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and
its Avatica sub-project. There has been one release of Calcite, with
another currently under vote, and no releases of Avatica.

Julian Hyde gave a talk at FlinkForward (Berlin); three community
members (including the proposed new PMC chair) will be giving talks
about Calcite or mentioning Calcite at Apache: Big Data in Seville in
November.

## Health report:

Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both
Calcite and Avatica.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 14 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Alexander Broekhuis]

## Description:
 - OSGi framework implementation in C and C++.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - C++ support added by use of the C++ specific dependency manager.
 - Documentation relating to C / C++ dependency manager added / improved

## Health report:
 - Celix is still a small community, hopefully the C++ support will
   atract some atention

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Alexander Broekhuis on Wed Jul 16 2014

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 8 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Gabriele Ricciardi at Sat May 21 2016

## Releases:

 - Last release was 1.0.0-incubating on Tue Feb 25 2014
 - Celix release was postponed to add C++ support, in hindsight maybe not the
   best decission.  The idea is that C++ support can atract some additional
   attention. Technically everything is now ready for a release.

## Mailing list activity:

 - dev@celix.apache.org:
    - 57 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description:
   Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running
   MapReduce and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.
  
## Issues:
   We had a report this quarter that a file that was used in some of our
   tests contained content that had an unclear copyright status outside
   of the US (maugham.txt, containing a sampling of work from W. Somerset
   Maugham.) We removed this file from our source repo and updated the
   tests that made use of it, as discussed in this JIRA issue:
   https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CRUNCH-616 If the board feels
   that any additional action is required here, please let the PMC know
   and we will take it.
  
## Activity:
   We had a normal amount of activity this month, primarily focused on
   performance and debugging for very large MapReduce pipelines executed by
   Crunch and improvements to the new Kafka Streams-based pipeline executor.
  
## Health report:
   Work proceeds apace to improve what Crunch does well (executing large and
   complex MapReduce pipelines), but as MapReduce gradually declines in
   use and is replaced by Apache Spark as the execution engine of choice, we
   expect that patches will come in more slowly and be primarily focused on
   fixing bugs as opposed to adding new functionality.

## PMC changes:
  
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Micah Whitacre on Wed Apr 02 2014

## Committer base changes:

Attachment P: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description: 
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.  

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
 WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile. 

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider
 component of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 
This was a fairly active quarter on a bunch of fronts.  DOSGi 2.0
was finally released completing some of the splitting of the remote services
spec into Apache Aries and the implementation in CXF.   It also cleaned up the
architecture quite a bit to help make it easier to maintain.    Fediz had a
couple of patch releases to cleanup some requirements presented by users.  
CXF itself had some patch releases mostly to fix bugs.   Work toward 3.2 is
progressing and we were able to drive Oracle into producing a "milestone" API
jar for the JAX-RS 2.1 update that we need for 3.2. 

## PMC changes: 
- Currently 24 PMC members. 
- New PMC members: 
   - Francesco Chicchiriccò was added to the PMC on Sun Sep 18 2016

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

## Description:

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o Derby    : a relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
              testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
              persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

1) After our July, 2016 report, we received feedback from the board:

  mt: Thanks for the thoughtful response to the merging lists idea.
      Does the PMC have any ideas/plans for the DdlUtils sub-project?

  Since that time, the DB community have reached consensus that DdlUtils
  is retired. A public vote on the DdlUtils list confirmed that consensus,
  and the PMC are working to implement a subset of the Apache Attic
  process to reflect that decision and to make the status be clearly
  communicated to future visitors of the Db project site.

2) The Derby student who participated in the 2016 Google Summer of Code
   completed her project successfully

3) Apache DB welcomed two new committers this quarter:
   - Tilmann Zäschke was added as a committer on Fri Jul 15 2016
   - Brett Bergquist was added as a committer on Tue Aug 30 2016

## Health report:

Activity in the Apache DB community this quarter was low, but steady.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 43 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Matthew Adams on Sun Jan 19 2014

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 44 committers (up 2 this quarter).

## Releases:

 - Last release was Derby-10.12.1.1 on Sun Oct 11 2015 

 - A Derby 10.13 release is underway, and will probably complete next quarter.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Alan Cabrera]

## Description: 
Apache Geronimo is a JEE6 certified open source server runtime that integrates
the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes that meet 
the needs of enterprise developers and system administrators.
   
## Issues: 
- We are concerned with the lack of community activity
- The inability to obtain a AL2.0 compatible JEE TCK pins Geronimo to JEE6
- CI/TCK setup has fallen into disrepair
   
## Ongoing Work - prepare for possible breakup and shuttering or downsizing:
- bring in any PMC members of sibling projects in Geronimo's JEE6 universe
- inventory any required interactions between individual specs
- inventory outstanding bugs in JEE6 specs and assess the amount of work 
  required
- inventory what are the outstanding security issues and assess the amount of 
  work required  (will likely need to remove distributions until fixes can be 
        put into place)
- inventory CI setup and assess the amount of work required
- inventory TCK setup and assess the amount of work required

## Activity: 
- Released geronimo-validation-1.1 v1.0
- Apache Yoko moved to git to be worked on by David Jencks, Joe Chacko,
  and Neil Richards
   
## Health report:

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Christopher Douglas]

Apache Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and
managing distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

Apache Hadoop cut its first release from trunk since 2011. Releases in the 2.x
series will continue to follow stricter compatibility guidelines on a branch.
The 3.0.0-alpha1 release has kicked off several API cleanups, reasoning about
dependencies, and other pains endured to avoid downstream breakage.

RELEASES

2.6.5 was released 2016-10-07
2.7.3 was released 2016-08-24
3.0.0-alpha1 was released 2016-09-02

-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Andrew Purtell]

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of Hadoop
Common and Hadoop HDFS.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

We made two releases from our 0.98 code line under the supervision
of branch RM Andrew Purtell: 0.98.21 was released on August 15, 2016.
0.98.22 was released on September 9, 2016.

We made one release from our 1.1 code line under the supervision of
branch RM Nick Dimiduk: 1.1.6 was released on September 4, 2016.

We made two releases from our 1.2 code line under the supervision of
branch RM Sean Busbey: 1.2.2 was released on July 10, 2016. 1.2.3 was
released on September 11, 2016.

Our upcoming 1.3 code line is in prerelease under the supervision
of branch RM Mikhail Antonov, now taking on production-like workloads
to shake out the handful of remaining issues.

Recently the community updated plans for branching for the next major
code line, 2.0. Co-RMs Matteo Bertozzi and Stephen Yuan Jiang will
supervise. (Because of his volunteerism in this regard, discussion is
underway to add Stephen Yuan Jiang to the PMC.) In broad strokes the
plan is to branch and produce an alpha quality preview some time in
November of 2016, then stabilize toward beta quality by the end of this
calendar year.

ACTIVITY

It is my pleasure to report the project added four new PMC during
this reporting period. Dima Spivak was added to the PMC on August 30,
2016. Duo Zhang joined us on September 5, 2016. Misty Stanley-Jones
joined us on September 6, 2016. Stephen Yuan Jiang joined us on
October 14, 2016. 

Dima Spivak was granted committer and PMC status simultaneously,
increasing the ranks of our committers by one, to 53.

We had enough interest in HBaseCon, the yearly conference for the
HBase community that took place earlier this year in May, that the
Program Committee had to turn away quality talk proposals. Thanks to
generous contribution of hosting space and logistics from Google and
Bloomberg we found a home for this overflow in an additional East
Coast edition[1] which took place last month and was well attended
by members of our user and developer communities. The organizers
of the HBase-NYC meetup group report that their membership went
from ~600 pre-event to ~850 post, showing a good increase in local
community interest.

STATS

Mailing list membership has been steady.

The JIRA open/close rate and ratio is very close to that reported
last time.

53 committers
31 PMC
1066 subscribers to the dev list (up 3 in the last 3 months)
2355 subscribers to the user list (up 5 in the last 3 months)
592 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
457 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

 Apache Storm JMS Integration from P. Taylor Goetz
 Apache Storm SQE from JWPlayer

 A vote was started to import Aether from Eclipse Foundation as Maven Artifact
   Resolver, however it has not been closed as of the time of writing.

* Legal / Trademarks

 Sally has begun work on helping improve the incubator brand.  She has taken
   over the Twitter account and has proposed putting together a selection for
   a new logo.

* Infrastructure

 Kudos to the infrastructure team for their hard work on the Netbeans
   proposal, getting all of the needed infrastructure assessment prior to the
   incubator accepting this podling.

 Incubator usage of the new reporeq tool has been mixed.  It would be great to
   see a blog post or something about how to submit git repository requests.

Airflow

Airflow is a workflow automation and scheduling system that can be used to
author and manage data pipelines.

Airflow has been incubating since 2016-03-31.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Getting an Apache release out
 2.
 3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

We discovered a private Gitter channel for committers that was created during
the days when the Git project was owned by Airbnb. When the Github project’s
ownership moved to the ASF, so did that of all the Gitter channels. We killed
the channel - all committers left the channel and can no longer even
see/discover it.

How has the community developed since the last report?

1. We elected 2 new PPMC Members/Committers (Li Xuanji a.k.a. Zodiac & Sumit
Maheshwari a.k.a. msumit) 2. Since our last podling report 3 months ago (i.e.
between Jul 7 and Oct 4, inclusive ), we grew our contributors from 160 to 191
3. Since our last podling report 3 months ago (i.e. between Jul 7 and Oct 4,
inclusive ) , we merged >142 pull requests 4. Two meet-ups (One for HUG
Warsaw, the other an Airflow meet-up @Stripe HQ in SF) and several public
talks (e.g. DataDaySeattle, PyData SF) were held by the community 5. Since
being accepted into the incubator, the number of companies using Apache
Airflow has risen from 30 to 58

How has the project developed since the last report?

1. Podling name search approved :
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-110 2. Very active
discussion list, public Gitter channels and JIRA (more than 500 issues)

Date of last release:

 None.  First ASF release currently being discussed.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

As mentioned on
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Announcements, 1. On Aug
16, Sumit Maheshwari (a.k.a. msumit) was elected to the PPMC and Committer
group 2. On Aug 19, Li Xuanji (a.k.a. zodiac) was elected to the PPMC and
Committer group

 None

How has the community developed since the last report?

 There were no changes

How has the project developed since the last report?

 There was a discussion about a graduation attempt, and the overall result
   (though opinions
 can slightly differ) was that we better see if we can attract more developers
   first. For that,
 we intend to start a branch that gets rid of the several backward
   compatibility
 constraints that makes contribution and addressing some interesting
   templating
 problems rather difficult or impossible, and which makes the code base more
   attractive in general.
 (Note that this is 15 year old code base, and the need for this is not a new
   idea.) This branch
 would be also the opportunity to switch to org.apache Java packages and
   org.apache Maven coordinates.

 We have positively completed the verifications about possible name conflicts
   (PODLINGNAMESEARCH-107).

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. Produce our first Apache Release 2. Expand the community, by adding new
contributors and focusing on making sure that there's a much more robust level
of conversations and discussions happening around roadmaps and feature
development on the public dev mailing list 3. Infrastructure migration: create
Jenkins projects that build HAWQ binary, source tarballs, and run feature
tests including at least installcheck-good tests for each commit (HAWQ-127).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

Everything seems to be smooth, nothing urgent at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

1. we have seen significant increase of communication and collaboration across
the whole community in past 3 months. The community becomes more open for
discussion around the roadmap, various features that committers are working
on, infrastructure enhancements for the project.

MADlib

Big Data Machine Learning in SQL for Data Scientists.

MADlib has been incubating since 2015-09-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Need guidance from Incubator PMC on how to resolve the BSD licensing
   switch over to Apache License.  What should be the content of the license
   headers for files that were previously BSD licensed and then granted to
   ASF?  Related legal-discuss threads:

   D1AF43C-370B-4E58-B0EF-2E29D242F50B%40jaguNET.com%3E
 2. Continue to produce regular Apache (incubating) releases.
 3. Continue to execute and manage the project according to governance model
   required by the "Apache Way”.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

Yes-please see #1 above and provide guidance.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

 tdunning:
   This project seems to be ticking along pretty reasonably. The only worry I
     have about it is that it seems to be strongly centered around a few (or
     even just one) very strong contributors. That is a worry relative to
     longevity and community building. Overall, I don't think that the project
     is getting much marginal value from incubation.

 johndament:
   Its unclear what guidance from the IPMC is required if the podling is
     already reaching out to legal, which would be the main thing I can think
     of to recommend to them right now.

 rvs:
   @johndament: I think we need to formalize whatever decision by legal. I'll
     create a formal LEGAL JIRA soon.

Milagro

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Make a first release
 2. Continue to migrate to full Open Development.
 3. Building the MILAGRO community – engaging developers and cryptographers
   beyond the core companies, raising awareness and helping to secure future
   of internet.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

n/a

How has the community developed since the last report?

We have elected two new committers. User questions are dealt with well on the
mailinglist, although the volume remains low.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Commit activity has finally migrated from Github.  The project is very keen to
adopt full two-way mirroring with github as soon as possible. Mailinglist
activity remains low.

Main development focus over last couple of months was on crypto library
(MILAGRO crypto lib), which was re-factored and improved, in order to improve
the code quality, readability, and test coverage.

MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and
Flink.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Increase the number of active committers
 2. Increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list activity

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No

How has the community developed since the last report?

There were no new developers or new committers since our last report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

There were 8 JIRA issues reported during this period, from which 7 have
already been resolved. The main work during this period was on algebra-based
and source-level debugging of MRQL queries. Basically, results from an MRQL
query are annotated with lineage information, which links each result value
with the input data that were used to calculate the value. Given a result
value, our debugger not only can print the input values that contributed to
the result value, but can also display the detailed workflow that was used to
calculate this value (how-to provenance). In contrast other data-centric
debuggers, such as Titian for Spark, our debugger supports on-line browsing
and searching using GUIs and can work on all MRQL supported platforms
(map-reduce, Spark, Flink, and Hama). It also allows to insert trace points in
the query source to debug the query at the source level. We hope that this
debugger will be a valuable tool for developing and understanding MRQL
queries.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

 Julian Hyde (jhyde):

   I am concerned that the project is evolving but is not doing it
   in the Apache way. For example, the "new community members" were
   welcomed on the mailing list but there was not a vote or
   discussion about making them committers. Also, there is still no
   release and the project does not seem to be making it a priority,
   and substantive discussions are not happening on the list (other
   than discussions about pull requests). Of course, it  is great
   to see commit activity and a growing community.

 rvs: I'm very much in agreement with Julian that the project seems to be
   somewhat in trouble with adopting itself to the "Apache Way". Honestly,
   it feels like an academic project hosted by ASF at this point. I believe
   at this point mentors need to show some "tough love" and push for having
   a real plan of how community thinks about addressing all the issues we've
   observed so far. Julian and I are working on making it a priority for the
     PPMC.

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built on
top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and query
processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across multiple nodes.
Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through SPARQL, a conventional
query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Have a first release as part of the Apache Foundation
 2. Expand the documentation to be more formalized and more representative of
   the current codebase.
 3. Add new committers to the project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No

How has the community developed since the last report?

 * A new committer was invited and accepted to join the committers for Apache
   Rya (incubating).
 * Talk on Rya at the DC Graph Database meetup on August 30, 2016
 * Online presentation on Rya to a group of researchers and developers from
   Cray on September 29, 2016
 * Talk on Rya accepted at Accumulo Summit, October 11, 2016
 * The Rya "office hour" teleconference continues every other week, with few
   exceptions when people are too busy. Users and developers can ask
   questions, receive answers, discuss ideas for future developments. The
   minutes are sent to the dev@ list. Attendance at these meetings has grown
   beyond existing committers of the project to include new contributors.  New
   contributors have led the discussion for new features that they have helped
   develop.  We continue posting minutes and reference slides from the
   meetings on confluence to provide reference documentation to new
   contributors.
 * Multiple PRs from several non-committers which are integrated into the
   repository continue to be received

How has the project developed since the last report?

 * Worked on the first release. The first release candidate was proposed, but
   the vote did not pass on the dev list. Working on the next release
   candidate.
 * Resolved a handful of issues that users have encountered.
 * Committed features: added a benchmark tool for the pre-computed joins
   optimizer; added support for property chain inference; integrated Apache
   Fluo (incubating) with Rya so triples inserted in Rya are inserted into
   Apache Fluo (incubating) too in order to incrementally update any
   pre-computed joins registered with Fluo; added OPTIONAL support for
   pre-computed joins

 We have increasing feedback of use cases to be covered and also a few
 bug reports, so Tamaya is used by developers and companies.
 Additionally we are doing regular bi-weekly hangouts and have defined a
 well defined roadmap.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 We have decided to improve the project setup, so we can
 release easier and faster in the future: separating the site from the
 project release, separating experimental modules and stable modules
 into separate repositories. This work is currently ongoing, but we make
 good progress and we plan to get out a release of the core parts around
 end of October.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

## Description: 

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.

   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

   
## Activity: 

We have not made any releases this quarter, though a patch release (1.13.1)
is imminent.

A session on Apache Isis was presented at the JAX London conference [1], and
several further session proposals have been submitted for future conferences.


   
## Health report: 

Project activity (#mails, tickets, commits etc) are all healthy.  They
are down on previous quarters, but we are not concerned by the change.

This has been a "slow" quarter for development of the core platform, but we
expect development to pick up again in the next quarter.

In the last report we made a remark about Oracle's apparent lack of 
"enthusiasm" for JEE this year, prompting discussions on the dev list about 
maybe switching to using SpringBoot as a base platform.  Given that Oracle
now seems to have recommitted to JEE (with a renewed emphasis on "cloud"),
we are likely to keep things as they are and remain on core JEE.

   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 11 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Martin Grigorov on Tue Dec 23 2014 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 11 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Martin Tzvetanov Grigorov at Thu Dec 11 2014 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 1.13.0 on Mon Jul 11 2016 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
Nothing of much significance here; a small rise in subscribers.  Emails

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We are in the final stages of preparation for the jclouds 2.0 release. This is
long-awaited and much needed by many users, and we are close to completing the
feature set that we want to ship. The last details of the Azure ARM provider
are being wrapped up; with that, we will have support for all of today's major
cloud providers.

We have also completed integration with the new ProfitBricks REST API, and
have been able to move the jclouds Docker provider to a very stable state.

== Community ==

We have continued to receive substantial contributions from the community,
especially to the ProfitBricks and OneAndOne providers. This is very pleasing,
but we are still looking for additional ways to encourage participation.

We've tried lowering the barrier to becoming a committer; however, this has
not resulted in a noticeable increase in sustained activity. We are currently
discussing changes to our release cadence, with a view to releasing more
frequently, driven by user demand (e.g. for a set of required fixes to a
particular provider) rather than release dates or feature-based milestones.
This will hopefully allow users to keep up to date with the project more
easily, and encourage contributions by reducing the turnaround time from PR to
officially released code.

Our GSoC student completed their project successfully, which is in trunk and
will be part of the jclouds 2.0 release.

There are currently 11 PMC members and 23 committers.
Last committer: 2016-02-05 (Reijhanniel Jearl Campos)
Last PMC member: 2015-09-20 (Zack Shoylev)

We have voted on a new PMC member and the NOTICE has just been sent to the
board. We hope to have him added after the 72 hours if there are no
objections. This will help with the intended accelerated release cadence and
to bring new energy to our community involvement efforts.

== Community Objectives ==

Our immediate aim is to complete the Azure ARM provider and release jclouds
2.0 as soon as possible. Beyond that, we will be focusing on implementing the
new release criteria to improve the engagement with the community and
encourage participation.

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 1.9.2, took place on 2016-01-16.
As discussed above, we are aiming to release jclouds 2.0 shortly.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Johnzon Project  [Hendrik Saly]

## Project description

Apache Johnzon is an implementation of JSR-353 (JavaTM API for JSON
Processing) and a set of useful extension for this specification like an
Object mapper, some JAX-RS providers and websocket (JSR-356) integration.

## Status

Graduation out of the incubator is completed, the first non-incubator release
was done on July 21, 2016. There is ongoing work to make Johnzon JSR-367
(JSON-B) compliant. Its also planned to implement JSR-374 (JSON-P 1.1), the
successor of JSR-353.

## Releases

- 0.9.4 was released on July 21, 2016
- 0.9.5 was released on August 24, 2016

## Committers and PMC membership

The last committer we signed up was Reinhard Sandtner on April 12, 2016. The
last PMC member was Reinhard Sandtner, added to the PMC on August 30, 2016.

## Project activity

Since the last report (submitted July 2016) there was low activity.

We had 5 new Jira issues and fixed 6 of them. On the mailinglist there a no
unanswered questions left. On the dev list we have 28 subscribers currently
and 9 msg sent per week. Sine last report we saw mailing list activity from a
few new people.

One reason for low activity in the moment could be the uncertainty about the
situation within the Java community process (JCP) about the future of the
related Java specification requests (JSR's), namely JSR 374 and 367.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos]

## Description: 
- A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard 
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
  
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. There's enough 
people to provide oversight.
  
## Activity: 
- Source code was migrated from SVN to Git (+ its integrations) in order to 
ease contributions.

- We've also talked about moving jspwiki.a.o from ASF's CMS to JSPWiki 
(https://s.apache.org/PFXI) as a) historically it's always been that way, and
b) we could use it as showcase, having a separate wiki doesn't seem to be 
enough (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JSPWIKI-1030). I volunteered 
for the task (moving content, copyright compliance, asking infra) but haven't
had time this quarter. Hopefully this will change on the upcoming quarter.

- 5 new blog posts at https://blogs.apache.org/jspwiki/
  
## Health report: 
- All questions asked on MLs where answered, with a few JIRA issues solved 
and some other fixes that went into trunk/master.

- 3 JIRA issues fixes came from an external contributor.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues: 

No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Since the last report:
 - We released Kudu 1.0 in mid September, and issued a corresponding press
   release. Thanks, Sally, for the support!

 - The 1.0 release and corresponding press generated record traffic to our
   project web site. It has since tapered off but remains higher than
   historic levels.

 - The community is currently voting on a 1.0.1 bug-fix release to address a
   few issues discovered in 1.0.0.

 - Kudu was featured in 5 talks at the Strata+Hadoop World conference in
   NYC in September. Two talks were delivered by a member of the PMC, but
   three were delivered by real-world users about their use cases. These
   user talks had positive things to say about their adoption.

## Health report: 

- Mailing list subscribership is up slightly in the last month, and traffic
  is stable.

- We committed code from one brand new contributor in the past month.
  Many new users have shown up on mailing lists and our Slack-based user chat.

- JIRA tickets are being created at a slightly higher rate than they are
  being resolved, as a lot of contributors are working on scoping out
  upcoming post-1.0 development work. Nevertheless, new bugs reported by
  users are being triaged and addressed quickly.
  
## PMC/Committer changes: 

 - Currently 15 PMC members and committers (all committers are PMC)
 - Last committer/PMC additions: 2 added on 9/14/2016.

## Releases: 
  
 - September 19, 2016: Kudu 1.0.0 released.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

Description:

  The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for dynamic
  programming languages.  The Apache Clownfish "symbiotic" object system pairs
  with "host" programming language environments and facilitates the
  development of high performance language extensions.

Issues:

  There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Activity:

  A goal to publish feature releases more frequently was met this quarter:
  0.6.0 followed 0.5.0 after a seven month gap, whereas the previous two
  feature releases had been spaced by two-year gaps.  The testing framework
  and error handling routines received a lot of attention, going some distance
  towards making the software easier to grok and hack on.

Health report:

  There are currently 14 committers and 12 PMC members.  The last committer
  and PMC member change was Timothy Wilkens, who joined in September 2014.

  This quarter was quieter than usual.  In recent times, Lucy has been
  developed primarily by two main contributors, and one of them recently
  changed employment, resulting in diminished contributions.

  A Director inquired last report cycle about ways to identify new candidates
  for committer or PMC.  Growing the community requires at the least starting
  at the top of the "open source funnel": crafting a compelling story and
  publicizing the software.  New communities will have to be approached,
  as Lucy's original Perl story has limited growth potential.  Technically
  speaking, both Clownfish and Lucy could plausibly be presented in C, Go,
  or Python contexts, and Clownfish is ripe for presentation to
  language-dev groups, but the website and the documentation do not
  reflect that; changing the impression they give is probably a prerequisite
  to successful outreach.  Once that task is accomplished it's likely a matter
  of speaking at conferences, blogging, tweeting and other techniques to get
  the word out.

Releases:

  - Apache Clownfish 0.6.0 was released on Sep 23 2016 
  - Apache Lucy 0.6.0 was released on Sep 23 2016 

Mailing list and JIRA activity:

  - Mail volume on the dev, user, and issues lists was down somewhat this
    quarter.
  - 16 JIRA tickets created and 16 resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Hervé Boutemy]

Maven Board Report - October 2016
---------------------------

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

* Issues

  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

* Activity

  Some new required changed have been identified to improve the Maven 
  ecosystem.
  One proposal handles the support for identifying the platform as part of
  the Maven Artifact coordinate.
  Another proposal will introduce a new metadatafile besides the pom.xml we
  now call Project Dependency Trees Schema: The Project Dependency Trees 
  artifact defines all the side artifacts of a project as well as each 
  artifacts tree of dependencies. This can be used by consumers to decide 
  what the consumers effective tree of dependencies is as well as allowing 
  consumers to perform intelligent substitutions in the tree. By providing 
  the entire tree we can reduce the number of requests a consumer needs to 
  make in order to resolve all the artifacts the consumer requires.
  Others can already join to improve these proposals. Once all details are
  clear, we'll search for contact with third parties related to artifact
  management.
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Requests+for+Comment

  While the specs of Java 9 are still being adjusted, the work to support 
  these new features are still in progress. First result are already there
  and have been shared at JavaOne.

  IP Clearance for Aether, renamed to Apache Maven Artifact Resolver, has
  been finalized: 
  http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/maven-aether.html

  During an audit of expenses, Maven's EC2 instance + S3 bucket were found
  expensive and under-utilized: we studied both issues with infra and
  a new hosting solution was found that will be less expensive and easier to
  use for the PMC. Migration is under way (INFRA-12729).

  newcomers, discussion and commits from existing developpers on misc
  topics.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Description:

Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute
resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling
fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and
run effectively.

Issues:

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

Activity:

The project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features,
reviews and releases. The mailing lists, slack and IRC channels are
also very much active with healthy discussions.

Current plans:

MesosCon Europe was a great success. The keynotes, presentations and
events were all well received.

MesosCon Asia (our first conference in Asia) will be happening in
November. The program has been finalized after community vote.

We made good progress in cleaning up stale reviews and gathering
metrics.

New committers:

Qian Zhang was voted in as committer and PMC on .

We've identified couple more people that are close to become
committers and are actively working to nominate them.

Qian adds more diversity to the list of commmiters both in terms of
organization (IBM) and geography (China). In fact, we have more folks
in the committer pipeline from China which is great!

Releases: (since last report)

1.0.0       2016/07/26

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache MyFaces Project  [Mike Kienenberger]

## Description: The Apache MyFaces project is an umbrella project of the
Apache Software Foundation for projects relating to the JavaServer Faces (JSF)
technology.

## Activity and health:
- Apache Myfaces Core is healthy and in maintenance mode.

UI-Component Sets:
- Apache Tobago is healthy and active.
- Apache Trinidad is in maintenance mode.  Last developer commit was May 2016.
Last commit on behalf of a contributor was Sept 2016.
- Myfaces Tomahawk is in maintenance mode. Last developer commit was May 2016.
Last commit on behalf of a contributor was May 2016.

Add-ons and Extensions:
- Apache MyFaces Portlet Bridge is in maintenance mode.  Last developer commit
was Jan 2014.  Last commit on behalf of a contributor was May 2015.
- Apache MyFaces CODI is in maintenance mode. CODI was replaced by Apache
DeltaSpike so new development happens there.  Last commit March 2014.
- Apache MyFaces Orchestra is in maintenance mode.  New projects use CDI and
DeltaSpike instead.  Last commit on behalf of a contributor was August 2016.
- Apache MyFaces ExtVal is in maintenance mode. Last commit June 2014.
- Apache MyFaces Commons is in maintenance mode.  Last commit August 2012.
- Apache MyFaces Ext-Scripting is in maintenance mode.  Last commit Dec 2012.
- Apache MyFaces Test is in maintenance mode (Used by Myfaces Core).  Last
commit June 2014.

Security:
- We received a vulnerability report against MyFaces Trinidad on July 20th and
 responded to the reporter the same day.  We released patched versions of
 Trinidad 1.2.x, 2.0.x, and 2.1.x on Sept 29th along with CVE-2016-5019.

Issues:
  mt asked: Is it time to retire CODI and Orchestra? Also, a quick look at
     myfaces.a.o doesn't make it clear that CDI/Deltaspike is the
     recommended approach for new users.

 Initially, no one from the MyFaces PMC responded to these questions at the
 end of July, but discussion has started this week.  On Oct 12th, I posted
 a request for help on the dev@deltaspike and dev@myfaces lists to see if
 anyone there would be willing to update the pages for CODI and Orchestra.
 Two individuals who are members of both PMCs suggested some changes to the
 CODI and Orchestra pages to indicate that these two projects are not
 actively maintained and to redirect users to DeltaSpike or Spring. There
 was a trivial contribution for Orchestra on Aug 10th which was applied on
 Aug 11th, so support is still being provided when requested.

## Description:
- Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
distribute data.
- Apache MiNiFi, a child project of Apache NiFi, is an edge data collection
agent built to seamlessly integrate with and leverage the command and control
of NiFi. There are both Java and C++ implementations.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene®, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop®
data structures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.


ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


RELEASES

There have been no releases since the last board report:
- Nutch 1.12 was released on Jun 19 2016,
- the last release on the 2.x branch (2.3.1) dates to Jan 20 2016.


CURRENT ACTIVITY

Furkan Kamacı completed his GSoC project successfully and the developed code
is merged into Nutch's 2.x branch.

Four Nutch committers will give talks about crawler technology (not only Nutch)
at ApacheCon and Apache Big Data Europe in Seville.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Sathwik Bantwal Premakumar]

## Description: 
  Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web services 
  orchestration using flexible process definitions. 

## Issues: 
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
- As indicated in the last report about the inclusion of 2 new 
  features, we have been working on it, and both the features 
  are completed and are now undergoing final integration testing.
  We will start the release process for the new ODE Console sometime
  in this week and it will have its own release cycles and post its
  release we will initiate ODE release.

  New feature coming in the new release
  a) A new standalone distribution, based on an embedded TomEE and 
  b) New AngularJS based console app.

  Around 47 issues have been fixed for the coming release.

## Health report: 
- ODE is very mature and stable, however the interest in BPEL has 
  decreased significantly. Thus ODE's development is currently 
  pretty much in maintenance mode.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for databases,
 relational as well as non-relational. For relational databases, OpenJPA is
 compliant to the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0.
 OpenJPA runs in stand-alone JSE as well as  containers e.g JavaEE,
 Tomcat, Spring or OSGi.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 We started with the implementation of the JPA-2.1 spec and moved
 trunk to be 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.
 We don't have any TCK for it but that doesn't stop us.
 We got a few new contributors which we observe as committer candidates.
 We discussed the option to release 3.0.0 milestones starting with
 the end of this month.

## Health report:
 We have a few people involved in maintaining the older 2.2.x branches
 and a few who help us with the JPA-2.1 tasks. There is not a huge flood of
 new commits but we are moving steadily.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Marcus Lange]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. 
There are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument 
Format (ODF) that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With 
limited support for other formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, Max OS 
X, Linux 64-bit, Linux 32-bit and in dozens of languages.

STATUS
======

The first release after a longer time has been done and released and 
announced successfully. This makes sure that the community can build a 
release. So, we are back in the playground of active projects. However, 
limitations of capacity and coordination of the project's moving parts 
are ongoing concerns.

ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS
==========================

Concerns for Board attention are in the Issues section, below.

RELEASES
========

Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 was developed at the end of the 3rd quarter, 
with release on 2016-10-12.

Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4 is contemplated for release around year end for 
further maintenance and available security fixes.

Apache OpenOffice 4.2.0 is planned for next year (maybe Q1) to include 
new features and bigger enhancements but of course also further bugfixes 
and security fixes if needed.

ACTIVITY
========

Development and Release Engineering
-----------------------------------

The build documentation is further updated as the result of experience 
producing release 4.1.3. The number of individuals able to replicate 
release builds is increasing.

As part of a help-wanted effort along with public and mailing-list 
attention to the possibility of project retirement, 21 newcomers offered 
to contribute in various areas of the project. One is quite active with 
others not showing steady activity so far.

In addition, 5 previous contributors offered to return to active 
participation with varying presence so far. One returnee is highly 
experienced and is heavily active on security, bug fixes, and release 
management.

The arrival and continuing involvement of newcomers has been tracked in 
the PMC Private OpenOffice Calc spreadsheet at <https://s.apache.org/4Xij>.

Deployment and Take-Up
----------------------

The take-up of Apache OpenOffice in terms of downloads is at a 
consistent rate, showing a decrease for 4.1.2 of less than 10% compared 
to 4.1.1.

For the 12 months spanning release of AOO 4.1.2 through 2016-09-30, 
there are 37 million downloads, averaging about 3.1 million per month.

   86.1% for Windows,
    7.9% for Macintosh, and
    6.0% for all other distributions

For comparison, release of AOO 4.1.1 averaged 3.2 million per month 
(correcting a calculation error reflected in previous reports). Details 
are at https://s.apache.org/dxaX

US destinations have the greatest number of downloads by nationality, 
representing 16% of the total. About 40% of the worldwide downloads are 
for English localizations. The estimation of language proportions is at 
https://s.apache.org/2fwg

Branding
--------

There is no priority to update to the new feather logo and to adapt a 
new "Power-By" logo.

There is typically one request per month for use of the marks.

There is typically a report per month of a suspected trademark misuse 
(or confusion about selling of Apache OpenOffice binaries, e.g., on 
Ebay). One requested correction due to an incorrect use of OpenOffice in 
a product name was confirmed in September.

Community Lists and Archives
----------------------------

An Apache OpenOffice booth was manned at FrosCon 2016 near Bonn, 
Germany, in August. In November, there will be booths at events in The 
Netherlands and in Oberhausen, Germany.

The year-over-year decline in mailing list activity continues. A few 
bumps reflect the Q3 4.1.3 activity, developer recruitment, and 
discussions about retirement and avoiding retirement.

A new list, recruitment@, was launched on September 5. There have only 
been 8 messages so far. The list is intended to act as a 
single-point-of-contact to make it easier to support a gentler on-ramp 
for newcomers rather than contending with the active dev@ list for guidance.

Detailed data is in PDF at <https://s.apache.org/OHfh>. The list below 
is in decreasing order by 2015 activity.

    general-ja@     3     2     0     0    0

Bugzilla and Issue Tracking
---------------------------

The rate of new Bugzilla issues is steadily decreasing since 2013, the 
first full year of the Apache OpenOffice Top-Level Project. The rate at 
which issues remain unresolved over all that time is stubbornly more 
than 40%. The Q3 activity related to issues treated for maintenance 
release 4.1.3 has not altered that condition. Full comparative analysis 
is in the PDF at <http://s.apache.org/YFT>. Qualitative analysis at 
<http://s.apache.org/SNg> applies.

Wiki and Documentation
----------------------

The documentation effort initiated in 2013 is stalled. A committer and 
PMC member wanted to make progress here was be convinced to still keep 
active in the project, now probably in other areas.

Along with significant outdated material on the MediaWiki, changes in 
the product are not accompanied by corresponding user documentation.

The few documentation volunteers that arrived as part of the Q3 
help-wanted effort have not shown any impact on documentation so far.

ISSUES
======

Continued identification of risks and issues of capacity and capability 
is brought to public lists for discussion on the state of the project in 
the community. The general reaction

The limited supply of expert contributors with the capacity, capability, 
and availability for sustaining the project is reported.

As part of monthly reporting requested by the Apache Board, the 
following concerns are featured here:

   Development Capacity
   Handling of Security
   Trademarks
   Governance

Development Capacity
--------------------

The arrival of newcomers is at a slow trickle. Arrivals on the 
developer, QA, and docs lists seek assignments and mentoring. The 
newcomers appear eager though lacking project and product knowledge. The 
project has a low capacity to support them at that level. However, there 
are volunteers to take over the role as mentor.

A couple of developers, including returnees to the project, have arrived 
ready to work, making a noteworthy difference.

Effort to provide rapid maintenance releases has succeeded. There is now 
greater capacity for producing maintenance builds and having multiple 
release-manager candidates.

Next Steps: Improving the mentoring of newcomers and expanding the 
capacity to address major issues as part of a feature release.

Handling of Security
--------------------

Release 4.1.3 provides a full-update for the vulnerability CVE-2016-1513 
that was disclosed before there were updated binaries available. Release 
4.1.3 also provides fixes for two additional vulnerabilities. There is 
concurrent disclosure of those as CVE-2016-6803 and -6804.

For the three eliminated vulnerabilities in 4.1.3, the average number of 
days before an update was 248, the longest delay being 367 days, the 
shortest being 88 days.

In comparison, for the five eliminated vulnerabilities in 4.1.2, the 
average number of days before update was 146, the longest delay being 
247 days and the shortest being 86 days.

So, the average time has maybe increased. However, effort to turn these 
times down is serious.

The security team was streamlined somewhat, including the addition of 
more PMC members so that coordination of security with overall project 
governance is improved. An energetic security investigator has added to 
the team, and another returned as part of the community concerns over 
the future of the project.

Branding
--------

There continue to be significant abuses of the Apache OpenOffice brands 
by providers of downloads that introduce possible adware along with 
misrepresenting association with the project. One peculiar case 
(Softpedia.com) started to offer "Apache OpenOffice.org 4.1.3" [sic] two 
days before the release was officially announed by the project itself. 
Perpetrators have also discovered the easy use of "openoffice" as a 
subdomain (i.e., like openoffice.foo.com).

Materials for gathering and managing these cases have been set up on the 
PMC private repository.

The fight against these kind of windmills is still active but seems 
endless; especially on a project like OpenOffice with a very well-known 
brand name.

Governance
----------

Transition to the new Chair has occurred smoothly. Updating and turnover 
of documentation will be concluded in October.

The September discussions on "What Would OpenOffice Retirement Involve?" 
and "What Would OpenOffice NON-retirement involve?" were very heated, 
attract attention and have gone in a direction that was not wanted by 
the project. Luckily, these have died down, as has the arrival of 
newcomers and past contributors as part of the "Help-wanted" effort. We 
hope that this is entierly cooling down with showning more activity 
again. And new releases are a great help here.

The improvement to do new releases is a critical first step in building 
sustainability. We as project have shown that we can do it.

   nonexistent in this reporting period.
 - Greg Stein has chosen to leave the STeVe PMC. We thank Greg for his
   work - I'd personally like to thank him for his many code reviews
   over the years.
 - Still have 3+ PMC members that are alive and well, though we could
   consider appointing more PMC members at this point.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made two releases in the last quarter.
* Struts 2.3.30 - full GA release including bug fixes and feature
enhancements (2016-07-07)
* Struts 2.5.2 - full GA release including bug fixes and feature
enhancements (2016-07-07)

Within the reporting period we saw reasonable community and development
activity. Both the 2.3 and 2.5 branch received further bug fixing and
feature enhancement efforts. The new 2.5 release line, being considered
as a transition and consolidation branch on our way towards Struts 3,
seems to be adopted very well by our user community. Traffic on the user
mailing list was slightly more vivid in the last quarter.

No new committer was added in the last quarter. The last committership
addition was on 2015-10-23 (Aleksandr Mashchenko).
In the reporting period Aleksandr Mashchenko (amashchenko) accepted our
invitation to join the PMC as a new member, effective 2016-08-13 [1].

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

What is Tika?
=========================
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content
detection, analysis, and extraction. It allows a user to understand, and
leverage information from, a growing a list over 1200 different file types
including most of the major types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text,
Images, Video, Code, and science data) as recognised by IANA and other
standards bodies.

Issues
========================= 
There are no issues that need the boards attention.

Releases
========================= 
The last release of Tika was made in May 2016. Version 1.14 has been
progressing and will be released soon including new 
features such as the Image Recognition parser, OCR within PDFs, and a range of
new mime type support.

Work has also continuted on the new 2.X branch.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
 Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
 (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
 TinkerPop has added a new member to the PMC in Jason Plurad and a new
 committer in David Brown. 
 
 TinkerPop released 3.1.4 and 3.2.2. 3.2.2 contains gremlin-python[1], which 
 officially opens TinkerPop up to the Python community. We tend to think 
 of Python as the most used language for TinkerPop outside of the JVM so 
 having native support for it should help expand usage. October will see 
 releases 3.1.5 and 3.2.3. These two releases are mostly bug fixes and minor 
 usability improvements. We expect to continue to maintain both of these 
 lines of code (bug fixes for 3.1.4 and ongoing development of 3.2.2), but 
 intend to begin work on a new major line in 3.3.0 in the coming weeks. 
 
 In an effort to share the technical knowledge of "releasing TinkerPop", we've
 started to share the work of that process. While we've always had our release
 process documented[2] and a single release manager can handle releases, 
 we've determined it better (when possible) to have one release manager per 
 release line. Our initial trial with one release manager per version, on the
 previous release, worked well. We hope to continue with this approach for 
 future releases.
 
 Promotionally speaking, there have been a number of talks at conferences on, 
 or related, to TinkerPop. As a sample, here are the talks given by PMC 
 members:
 
 Graph Computing with Apache TinkerPop - Dr. Marko Rodriguez [3]
 Graph Processing with Titan and Scylla - Jason Plurad [4] 
 
 On the brand management front, it was noted by a PMC member (Jason Plurad 
 had just been voted in almost to the day he made the report) that there was 
 an individual selling products (baby clothes, mugs, t-shirts, etc.) on Amazon
 with TinkerPop graphics on them. Soon after, a second company was also noted
 selling similar products on an independent site. Neither, had permission from
 Apache to do that. After some discussion with Trademarks, the PMC chair sent
 notice to both sites requesting that they acknowledge the marks in their
 product description. No response was received from the seller on Amazon, but
 all products were quickly removed. No response was received from the second
 seller, but on greater inspection of the site, it doesn't really appear to be
 terribly active or maintained. Next steps with respect to this seller have 
 yet to be discussed. 

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
 - 3.1.4 (September 6, 2016)
 - 3.2.2 (September 6, 2016)

## PMC/Committer:

 - Last PMC addition was Jason Plurad - August 2016
 - Last committer addition was David Brown - August 2016

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

## Description: 
 Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
 and Varnish in functionality and features. What makes ATS unique across the
 landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on extensibility (plugins), HTTP
 protocol conformity and performance. ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs
 in the world, delivering a significant portion of all internet traffic. 
   
## Issues: 
 - I (Leif Hedstrom) have decided to step down as PMC chair. The ATS PMC has
   voted on a replacement, and is recommending Bryan Call as new PMC chair.
   (See Special Orders 7A).
 - This is my last Board report for the project , and I'd like to thank the
   Board and the entire Apache Community for the support and trust.
   
## Activity: 
 - No events were planned or held in the last quarter, however the community
   has worked hard organizing our upcoming ATS Fall Summit. Details for the
   summit is still being finalized, see our Wiki for more information:

      https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Fall+2016+Summit
   
## Health report: 
 - ATS v7.0.0 is in its final stages of being released, hopefully in the next
   few weeks we'll have a candidate.
 - We expect continued increase in committers, partially thanks to the Github
   migration which we feel continues to encourage and simplify user
   participation.
   
## PMC changes: 
 - Currently 39 PMC members. 
 - Chao Xu was added to the PMC on Sun Sep 18 2016 
   
## Committer base changes: 
 - Currently 47 committers. 
 - Chao Xu was added as a committer on Wed Sep 14 2016 
   
## Releases: 
 - 6.2.0 was released on Sun Jul 24 2016 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
 - Again, the drop in email activity is because of our changes to Github, and
   we ended up duplicating a noticeable amount of automated emails for a
   quarter. That has now settled, and we're back to normal levels. Hence the
   dramatic changes in traffic to some lists, which are as expected.
   
 - users@trafficserver.apache.org:  
    - 500 subscribers (up 16 in the last 3 months): 
    - 243 emails sent to list (up 40%)
        - 49 active participants/authors (up 22%)
        - 46 topics (up 4%)
   
 - dev@trafficserver.apache.org:  
    - 323 subscribers (up 11 in the last 3 months): 
    - 256 emails sent to list (down 90%)
        - 39 active participants/authors (down 18%)
        - 50 topics (down 85%)

 - announce@trafficserver.apache.org:
    - 15 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 1 emails sent to list (0 in previous quarter)

 - issues@trafficserver.apache.org:
    - 37 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 9734 emails sent to list (5982 in previous quarter)

 - summits@trafficserver.apache.org:
    - 14 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months)

## JIRA activity: 
 - 305 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 358 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

## IRC activity (#traffic-server):
 - 62 users (25 active)
 - 1,938 messages sent

(note: The IRC metrics are new, and only partial for this quarter).

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Sagara Gunathunga]

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.  However,
user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixes, and there
are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project can
continue to produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is
no longer considered state of the art, we don’t expect a major uptick in new
development efforts, new committers, etc...

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)


Releases this period:

WSS4J - implementation of WS-Security and related technologies
    * 2.0.9 - July 22, 2016

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]


Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of
REST style web services. The core server runtime is based on the
JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client
runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side
runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Community:
The Wink project is a mature project with a small community which is
currently not very active. Although I believe Wink is a mature project
with active users, the overall PMC has been alive but not active. The
user community was pretty much quiet in the last three months.

Releases:
* Last release was Apache Wink 1.4.0 which was released on September 15, 2013

Committers or PMC changes:
* Voted Gerhard Petracek was added as a Wink committer in August 2013.

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None
