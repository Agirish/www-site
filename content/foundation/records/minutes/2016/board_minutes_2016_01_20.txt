 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       A Happy New Year to everyone at the ASF.

       On the board list, we agreed on an Annual Meeting date of 22 March
       2016 (concluding 24 March). I plan to formally announce that in the
       next couple of weeks once we are within the 60 day window. There's
       some preparation to do to ensure the quorum and voting tools are all
       set, as well as the usual record preparation.

    B. President [Ross]

       It's been a quiet month with the holiday period. Though the new year
       has certainly been a busy one.

       There is no significant news from EA, Brand Management, Fundraising,
       Marketing or TAC, all of which are "business as usual" - given the
       quiet period of the last month that means very little to report.

       While most of us can take it easy during the holiday period this is
       not the case for our infra team. Service uptime for monitored services
       was over the "three nines" for the first time and work progresses on
       core infrastructure improvements, including GitHub integration. The
       Whimsy experiment is progressing nicely with infra reporting solid
       progress. Further details are provided in the Whimsy report.

       It is worth drawing attention to VP Marketing's proposal to reinstate
       media/analyst training at ApacheCon this year. This would be a very
       welcome return of a program run a number of years ago. We now have many
       new projects and as such it is not uncommon to have PMCs with nobody
       able to respond appropriately to media enquiries. I welcome the
       proposal to offer the sessions again and will support the initiative
       in any way I can.

       I've started the process for the 2016/17 budget. Virtual have raised a
       few questions regarding budgeted vs actual expenditure, in particular
       with respect to brand management ($4.8K of the $39K budget) and legal
       ($562 out of the $22K budget). With just four months left in this
       financial year we feel this indicates a need to reduce these budget
       items next year. I will work with the appropriate VPs and, if
       appropriate, will take the appropriate action.

       Unfortunately the time has come for us to look for a new VP Infra as
       David is looking to step down. I would like to thank David for his
       exceptional work in this role. I think we can all agree our infra
       support has improved considerably under his guidance and the hard work
       of our contractors. We all knew that one day David would wish to step
       down. I have been dreading the day as he is a very hard man to
       replace. On behalf of the Board, our Membership and most importantly
       our Communities I would like to thank David for his work.

       I've known about this or a couple of weeks and have been considering
       our options. As David himself has warned, the role of VP Infra is
       pretty much a full time role now. During the last couple of years we
       have considered many options to bring stability and scalability to our
       infra team and the VP infra role. We've never been entirely happy with
       the options available to us and have yet to come to find a solution
       that is full satisfactory. I am reviewing the options available and
       have added a discussion item to this months agenda with the view to
       reminding all directors of those options and to make a preliminary
       recommendation to the board for consideration over the following
       month. David continues to assist with these investigations but expects
       to step down within the next month. If necessary I will step in to
       bridge the gap. However, I must emphasize that we need to take action
       quickly in order to minimize disruption for our contractors and our
       communities.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

        The Treasurer’s Office processed out of cycle payments for
        infrastructure related services to bring them current.
        
        Jim and Virtual worked to update the website instructions for mailing
        checks.
        
        We continue to receive harassing emails from the Brazilian agency
        who claims to have handled the SVN Brazilian trademark. No action
        is requested beyond Jim’s prior action - this is merely informational.
        
        Virtual and the Treasurer will meet to discuss Bitcoin donations.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       A second round of requests for committers whose ICLA has gone missing
       has been sent out. This is based on recent whimsy tooling.

       In December, 87 iclas, five cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       We are one month out from the close of the CFPs for ApacheCon North
       America. We expect, as usual, to get a flood of submissions in the 
       last 2 weeks. (Submit now! Avoid the rush!) Thus, it is anticipated
       that the coming month will be busier, as we try to promote the CFP,
       and then begin working on the event in earnest.

 8. Discussion Items
 
    A. Discuss options for Infrastructure management.
       With the imminent retirement of the current VP Infrastructure we need to
       decide how to proceed in the near future. The easiest path is to simply
       replace David with a new volunteer VP. However, as discussed in the past
       this course of action is not considered sustainable due to the heavy 
       workload. Other options previously considered include:
       
       * Employ a full time infrastructure manager
       * Employ a full time Executive Director (infra management + additional 
         duties)
       * Outsource all infra services to a third party provider
         - not-for-profit
         - for profit
       * Outsource critical infra services to a third party provider whilst  
         keeping non-critical services in-house and volunteer managed
       * Creating a separate company to manage our infra services
       
    This discussion item is intended to allow us to:
       a) Refresh our memories of previous findings for each of the above 
          options 
       b) Identify any other options that should be explored 
       c) Agree to rule out some of the above options
       d) Provide a preliminary recommendation from the Presidents office
       e) Agree on a time frame in which the board will receive a final 
          recommendation from the Presidents office, and subsequently seek 
          to approve an action

    Presidents office, and subsequently seek to approve an action

    Ross: we need to make a timely decision on the replacement of our
    current VP, infrastructure. Bertrand: at some point we will probably
    need a full time operations manager. Ross: maybe at some time but
    not now. Brett: could the existing contractors handle the extra
    work? Ross: management of the contractors needs a different person
    in the role. Rich: the job is easily over 20 hours per week. Chris:
    this is potentially a high-burnout job. Shane: even if we use a
    third party service, we still need to manage them. Ross:
    communication with PMCs is still needed Jim: we need a job
    description to see what all is required and to see whether some
    duties might be changed to make it less burnout-prone @Ross: create
    a job description Ross: we are investigating outsourcing with a few
    third parties, including Virtual, and creating our own corporation.
    Ross: looks like we need both inside VP, Infrastructure to liaise
    with PMCs, and outsource infra services. Time frame: one month!
    @Ross: Prepare a plan to transition infra

TAC:
* 10 submissions; 2 pending
* Will be preparing the "behind-the-scenes" spreadsheets shortly in
preparation for the close of application

FOSDEM
* Working with Daniel on swag; awaiting response from Sally regarding whether
the new logo will be "production ready", if not, we'll use old logo.  Daniel
sourcing swag locally, I left a lot of swag from ACEU with a few folks to
carry to FOSDEM.
* Agreed Melissa will not attend, due to the cost, since there are plenty of
local volunteers

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Overall trademarks questions were down over the end of year holidays.  A
couple of PMC requests for registration are awaiting my time to complete
review and move forward, which I will catch up on this month.

A number of different individuals and organizations have asked to produce
t-shirts and similar goods featuring Apache project logos, so I plan to
publish a formal policy outlining requirements, and broadly allowing such use
for non-profit purposes by outside parties.

The USPTO has published our HBASE, CTAKES, PDFBOX, 
MANIFOLDCF, and TOMCAT registrations in the gazette, which is the final step
before the official registrations are granted.

A registration by Oracle of OPENOFFICE.ORG has finally completed in India.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising is continuing normally.

The bulk of the renewals happen to be in the first part of the (calendar) year
and we are in the process of talking about renewals and submitting invoices.
The revenues increased as expected, we are doing better than in the previous
months and I expect that by summer we'll be at or above the previous peak.

We also continue communication to new sponsors and there are signs that we'll
be signing on a few new sponsors in the coming months.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget. Sally Khudairi has negotiated an
extension and renewal to our press release distribution service
through 2017, and has also purchased a contact database subscription
as part of our clipping service. We haven't had a contact database
subscription in several years as our need was limited, but Sally
decided that we need ongoing current contacts/access to key
journalists/industry influencers, as there have been several shifts
with reporters/beats over the past few months alone which caused our
outreach emails to bounce for a while.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally has reminded
those involved with the content of the ASF quarterly progress reports
that we will begin to compile updates for the upcoming Third Quarter
report (November 2015-January 2016) shortly. Sally continues to work
with Fran Lukesh of LucidWorks and Lisa Dae of HotWax Systems on the
new ASF identity system. We are working hard to wrap up the core
elements in time for FOSDEM, where we are hoping to publicly debut the
new logo.

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during
this timeframe:

IV. Informal Announcements: 6 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 17 items were tweeted on @TheASF. 5 Apache News
Round-ups were issued, with a total of 70 weekly summaries published
to date. No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements remain in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and/or "Did You
Know?" success stories are welcome to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least
2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: whilst the number of actual media requests were
somewhat average (9 this month), the volume produced as a result was
quite high, stemming from the types of outlets seeking to engage with
the Apache community, as well as the range of topics covered. In
addition, we have had nearly continuous requests for
stories/interviews after every announcement and/or blog post published
to our dedicated media/analyst list. In addition, we've noticed a
recent uptick in our international media coverage due to an Asian
outlet covering nearly every technical item posted on the
announce@apache.org list. The ASF received 960 press clips over this
time period, vs. last month's clip count of 840.

In addition, due to our increased media presence and activities, Sally
is considering reinstating the media/analyst trainings offered during
ApacheCon, with the possibility of holding two different beginner
level sessions (one for podlings in the Incubator, the other for
established TLPs or sub-projects), as well as an intermediate or
advanced session as well. She will be following up with the Linux
Foundation team to see what options might be considered.

VI-a. Public Relations: in response to the number of non-media-related
phone calls received regarding non-media-but-Apache-product-related
queries Sally has been exploring options for an ASF-dedicated phone
line, as well as a more detailed/visible "help" page on apache.org. No
further progress has been made on this over the past month.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received an analyst fact-checking query
over the holidays, and were able to successfully respond within their
deadline. Apache was mentioned in 15 reports by Gartner (including 4
Magic Quadrant reports), 4 reports by Forrester, 5 reports by 451
Research, and 10 reports by IDC. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: no formal activities are planned at this
time, other than helping promote the CFP and Travel Assistance
deadlines.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no formal
activities are taking place at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we now have 52 pre-paid press releases with
NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through the end of 2017, due to the just-signed
service extension to the current contract. We also continue to receive
gratis news release distribution in the UK by Pressat.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Things were quieter this month than normal, largely due to holidays. 

General Activity:
=================
- Added new nodes to our LDAP cluster for more robustness, starting work on
  adding LDAP load balancers to prevent abusing specific nodes.
- Work continues on moving machines from our old VM boxes to our new provider,
  as well as formalizing existing setups (cinfig mgmt etc).
- GitHub organisational changes were applied, in order to continue with the
  exploratory MATT project. Committers can now be automatically added and/or
  removed from GitHub teams depending on LDAP affiliation and MFA settings.
- 120 JIRA tickets created, 156 resolved

Uptime Statistics:
==================
Continuing the positive trend since November, we are very pleased to report that
uptime across all SLA segments for this reporting cycle was above the famous
'three nines', and the overall uptime - when using the same number of decimal
places as most service providers - was at a marvelous 100.0%. That is not to say
we did not have our share of service glitches - in fact we had quite a few - but
the duration of these (a few minutes each) were too insignificant to budge the
total uptime figure.

In order to compare better with places using various decimal place settings, we
have tweaked our SLA page to accept this setting as an argument, thus:
http://status.apache.org/sla/?1 will show uptime as XX.Y% whereas
http://status.apache.org/sla/?3 will show it as XX.YYY% etc.

There are still places that we cannot or do not yet monitor, more specifically
various components in whimsy - mostly due to access restrictions -, and we are
in talks with people from the Whimsy project about utilizing a new status page
for our monitoring.

Whimsy Github Experiment
=====================
We've done some work around MATT (Merge All The Things -
http://matt.apache.org) and are relatively happy with the workflow around
definitively identifying Github and Apache accounts and merging them. 
(Our process allows for folks to sign into their Github account and the Apache 
account and confirm the other. 

That work has been followed up with some automation work so that: 
We can create groups on the fly, automagically populate them from 
group membership in LDAP(predicated upon the person identifying their
Github ID with MATT), and then grant them commit access if they have MFA
(Multi-factor authentication) enabled. We've decided, at least for the time
being to mandate MFA - as we have no visibility into authn failures or other
auth attacks, and the MFA ability grants us better security than we have on
our own hosted repositories. (Currently ~1/2 of Whimsy committers do not 
have commit access to the repository because they have not enabled MFA.)

We still have work today on the Github experiment, mainly around the 
automation of pushes back to an ASF copy of the repositories. 
We should have more to report on this front next month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Nick Burch]

Things are progressing on track for Vancouver. Applications will close just
after Speaker notifications go out, to give Speakers the change to apply if
they realise they'll need help once accepted. That still gives us a fair bit
of time to get the word out.

Application numbers so far are tracking similar to previous events. However,
we are hoping that the newly launched "TAC Stories" (featuring interviews
with past TAC Recipients) will help raise interest and awareness. We'll be 
working with Sally and the LF to help use these shortly.

Christofer Dutz (as past TAC recipient) has recently joined the committee,
and is helping with Vancouver. We've always more to do if other volunteers
turn up though!

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

In December, there was a charter extension request for the HTML Media
Extensions Working Group; a significant part of the extension is work on
Encrypted Media Extensions.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation canvased support for a formal objection
with charter modifications requiring all participants agree to conditions
that allow security researchers (and others) to circumvent technology for
protecting copyright.

The Foundation is not represented on the ongoing working group.

The ASF response to the charter extension expressed support for the
principle of free security research and open source implementation, but did
not support the formal objection nor the mechanism proposed.


Sergio Fernández has joined The Tourism Structured Web Data Community
Group. This is the first time ASF is represented so ASF has signed the
community group agreement.

Andy Seaborne has joined the CSV on the Web Community Group. This is the
first time ASF is represented so ASF has signed the community group
agreement.

Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

Relatively slow month. Some minor questions asked and answered on
the legal lists. Currently working a just-recently-discovered license
non- compliance issue related to a fork of one of our projects. Our
pro-bono counsel has been contacted regarding review of our bylaws, and
proposed changes (if necessary) to clarify how to apply "two-thirds
majority" when counting votes. As a reminder, currently we use the
'two thirds of cast votes' majority interpretation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Given recent issues with some teams neglecting security reports, the
team has started going back over older reports and ensuring they have
been handled by the respective PMCs.  One issue affecting Ranger
Policy Admin server was allocated CVE-2015-5167 but after 5 months our
requests to private@ranger.incubator.apache.org for updates have not
been responded to.  Raising this for board attention.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Summary
The project is active and there are no Board-level issues at this time.
No new committers have been added since the previous report, nor have
there been new releases. We are excited to have a new pre-commit build
for Accumulo using Yetus.

Releases
Version 1.6.4 was released on 10/3/2015.

Activity
The number of subscribers to the user list increased by 2 to 397 and the
number of subscribers to the dev list increased by 5 to 230. Mailing lists
remain active.

In the past 3 months, there have been 170 commits to the master branch
from 8 authors, 2 of whom are not yet committers.

Versions 1.7.1 and 1.6.5 will likely be released soon, with 150 of 164
and 41 of 44 issues fixed for those versions, respectively.

Community
Dylan Hutchison and Russ Weeks were added as committers and PMC members
on 10/7/2015.

Attachment B: Report from the Apache ACE Project  [Marcel Offermans]

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to
centrally manage and distribute modular software components,
configuration data and other artifacts to OSGi based and related target
systems.
 
Releases:
 * April 22nd, 2014: ACE 2.0.1 release.

Statistics:
 * Last committers added: March 27th, 2012
 * Last PMC members added: June 18th, 2013
 * Mailing list activity (dev+users) for last 3 (oct-dec) months: 40 msgs
   (previous 3 months: 19 msgs)
 * Commits for last 3 (oct-dec) months: 0
   (previous 3 months: 10)

Activity:
 * Upgraded the build to the latest Bndtools version.
 * Some discussions about performance, how to upload artifacts to ACE,
   how to commit changes automatically and how associations work.

Notes:
1. Traffic on the mailing lists is still relatively slow. As a community
   we should push for a new release and try to get some new committers
   involved by actively engaging them;
2. The release cannot be created just yet because of some dependencies on
   other projects (Apache Felix) that are not released yet.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]
Apache Airavata is a distributed system software framework to manage
simple to composite applications with complex execution and workflow 
patterns on diverse computational resources.  
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 

The community has been active but was understandably slow towards end 
of the year. This is typical. We expect to see activity on mailing list
raise back in new year.  
   
## Health report: 

Past few years have seen high activity around GSOC time frames. We expect
that will happen again this year. 

PMC members Marlon Pierce and Suresh Marru are teaching a class based on 
Apache Airavata. We hope the class will spur additional users and assist in
directly inject new committers or indirectly simplifying contributors 
on-boarding process and shepherding starter tasks.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Tom White]

Apache Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

== Issues ==

There are no board-level issues at this time.

== Community ==

Since the last board report in October, 34 Jira issues were filed and 27
resolved, roughly in line with the last period. Mailing list activity
is up slightly at over a hundred messages total per month.

Matthieu Monsch was added as a new committer this month (January 2016).

No new PMC members have been added since August 2015.

== Releases ==

There have been no releases this quarter. Avro 1.7.7 was released in July
2014. We are still in the process of releasing 1.8.0 after addressing a number
of blocking issues from a third release candidate.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including 
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

There are no issues requiring board attention at the current time.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was in fact towards the end of last year:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 15 PMC members on the project with the last additions
in January 2014.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

Community & Development
=======================

Committer activity is extremely low, as evidence from email lists show.
For this to be addressed, we need a concerted effort to get committers
talking on the dev list again to see who has time to help progress the
project and build enthusiasm for continuing.

Recent developments do include a prospective GSoC student enquiring as
to whether we would be a suitable project which is fantastic. It is not
clear whether we would be suitable for such a scheme this year but the
project chair has indicated that he would make time to mentor a student if
it were deemed appropriate. In particular this should require a backup
mentor from the PMC to ensure any student project is given appropriate
attention. A decision on this from the PMC is required in a short time to
avoid prejudicing the enquiring student's chances of finding another

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Brooklyn Project  [Richard Downer]

Description:
  Apache Brooklyn Project is a software framework for modeling,
  monitoring and managing cloud applications through autonomic
  blueprints.

Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

Activity:
 - The holiday season saw a slow-down in activity, but development has
   picked up again. Code is being contributed and merged at a regular
   pace, and new users continue to appear on the mailing lists.
 - We are moving through the post-graduation task list. Our main focus
   is on migrating our source code repository; we are using the move
   from incubator to TLP as an opportunity to reorganise our source code
   from a single monolithic repository to a small number of repositories
   focussed on distinct modules of the project. The new structure has
   been collectively decided and is now in place in the single
   repository; what remains is the physical split and move to the
   multiple new repositories.
 - As soon as the graduation tasks are complete, we aim to release a new
   version (0.9.0) as soon as possible.

Health report:
 - With regular code contributions and merges, new users on mailing
   lists, and turnover of JIRA tickets, we are satisfied with the
   health of the project (aside from the earlier observation about the
   holiday season).

PMC changes:

 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members since our last report.
 - Last PMC addition was Jean-Baptiste Onofré and Olivier Lamy, who
   converted their mentor status to committer/PMC member on graduation.

Committer base changes:

 - Currently 11 committers.
 - No new committers since our last report.
 - Last committer addition was Jean-Baptiste Onofré and Olivier Lamy,
   who converted their mentor status to committer/PMC member on graduation.

Releases:

 - No release since last report.
 - Last release was 0.8.0-incubating on 14th September 2015.

Mailing list activity:

 - dev@brooklyn.apache.org:
    - 94 subscribers as of 5th January
    - 558 emails sent to list in December

JIRA activity:

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Julian Hyde]

## Description

 Apache Calcite is a highly customizable engine for parsing and
 planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
 database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
 query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

 As a framework, Calcite’s audience is fairly small, consisting
 mainly of developers building data engines (Drill, Phoenix, Hive for
 example) but also streaming engines such as Samza, and some
 commercial engines using Calcite for query planning and its Avatica
 JDBC layer.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- New alliances with streaming projects:
  - Storm committed initial SQL support based on Calcite;
  - Flink announced plans to use Calcite develop a SQL interface for
    both streaming and traditional queries.
- Release schedule a bit slow due to the holidays, but 1.6 will
  probably happen mid-January.
- List, JIRA, and commit activity are about above average.

with 18 (11 new + 7 old) issues being resolved in that time. The majority of
the work on the project continues to focus on maintenance such as bug
fixes but also improvements to Scala and Spark.
A significant design and implementation effort has been underway to design
Java 8 Lambda API support.

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Community
---------

Community activity continues to be similar with the previous reporting
period.
The user mailing list has maintained a steady rate of questions and answer
(1 per day).
Over the last reporting period the activity on the developer mailing list
has increased (2 per day).

Micah Whitacre was added to the PMC on April 3rd, 2014.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description: 
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
During the "Holiday Quarter", development activity dropped a little bit, but
not as much as in previous years.  Much of the development was centered around
the Fediz sub-project (provide WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile and
various single sign on capabilities).   We're hoping to get a release of Fediz
shortly with the additional capabilities.   On CXF proper, most of the
development was around bug fixes, performance updates, and additional stuff to
support Fediz.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description: 

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

   
## Issues: 

There are no particular issue requiring board attention at this time.

   
## Activity: 

There hasn’t been a new release yet since the graduation to TLP.
We are still working on automating our process further, as the current 
release strategy requires too many manual steps that we fear might lead us 
to release sup-optimal versions as some point.

We created a new Twitter account (@ApacheGroovy [1]) to spread news and 
interesting links about the Apache Groovy project, and at the time of 
writing, we’ve just passed the 1000 followers mark.

With the holidays, the mailing-list has been pretty calm, with a slowdown 
in traffic on the users list, but overall there’s roughly a 10% increase 
in subscribers across lists, and dev was actually more active.


## Health report: 

Project activity (#mails, tickets, commits etc) are all healthy as the 
project is already pretty mature. But releases need to be made more 
frequently.

Downloads have been great throughout 2015, and we’ve broken our records 
with 12.7 million downloads from Maven Central (8M) and Bintray (4.7M).

Although we shouldn’t read too much into such indicators as they tend to 
more about buzz than actual usage, but the TIOBE programming language 
index now lists Apache Groovy in its top-20, at the 17th position [2].

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Christopher Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

In YARN, resource-aware scheduling (YARN-1011) continues to make progress on
a branch, particularly for oversubscription and distributed scheduling.
Other areas of active development include node labels, reservations, docker
support, and the timeline server.

In HDFS, a long-awaited native client (HDFS-8707) has made progress in a
branch. Other areas include the WebHDFS protocol, truncate, erasure coding,
and intra-datanode rebalancing. Discussion on the dev list suggests that
support for erasure coding will likely be pushed from the next release, to
2.9 or 3.0.

Bug fixes and stability improvements continue to be filed and fixed in
MapReduce.

The community prepares maintenance releases (2.6.4 and 2.7.2) concurrently
with a release of the head of branch-2 as 2.8.0.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 48 podlings currently undergoing incubation.

The end of the year was relatively quiet for the Incubator.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - James Taylor
  - Nick Kew

* New Podlings

  - Fineract
  - Milagro

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  December:

  - 2015-12-08 Apache Atlas 0.6-incubating
  - 2015-12-09 Apache Myriad 0.1.0-incubating
  - 2015-12-28 Apache Slider 0.90.2-incubating

  Wave's release candidate has set a record for frustration.  It was
  presented to general@incubator on November 3rd 2015, and still has only
  one IPMC +1 vote over two months later.

* Infrastructure

  Despite the heroics of Infra, JIRA's temperamental imports have
  occasionally delayed migrations for new podlings over the years.
  SystemML is the latest podling to experience difficulties.

* Miscellaneous

  - The Log4CXX podling has no active Mentors, but a volunteer has stepped
    forward.  The situation is developing.

* Credits

Apex

Apex is an enterprise grade native YARN big data-in-motion platform that
unifies stream processing as well as batch processing.

Apex has been incubating since 2015-08-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue release Apex-Core, and Apex-Malhar on ongoing basis.
  2. Continue grow contributors beyond the initial set.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No issues, thanks for your support.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community is very engaged with the development of the project.

  We see continuous uptick in mailing list participation (1392 messages on
  dev@ for December, 86+ subscribers).

  We have seen new contributors and work to integrate with other Apache
  ecosystem projects such as Geode and NiFi.

  The community has been active building meetup groups in various locations:
  http://s.apache.org/jKT

  Meetup membership grew to ~1000 in less than 4 months

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Release Malhar 3.2.0-incubating on 2015-11-16
  Roadmap published on web site:

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Jake Farrell (jfarrell):
 
    There has been very little activity on the mailing lists, John D.  Ament
    started a thread about the project's health.

  Chris Nauroth (cnauroth):

    +1 for concerns on lack of activity.  Attempting to rally PPMC.

  Julian Hyde (jhyde):
 
    I have the same concerns about low activity level. Allegedly there is
    *private* activity (re-factoring code to ready it for submission) but I
    am encouraging them to show *public* activity as well.

Fineract

Fineract is an open source system for core banking as a platform.

Fineract has been incubating since 2015-12-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Push the initial source code to Apache
  2. Inform the non-technical part of the existing Mifos.org community of
     the change in project structure
  3. Getting new committers up to speed on Apache processes and philosophy

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None, currently.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The project just has started. All members of the initial community are
  taking their first steps into the Apache Way. The larger Mifos.org
  community is still operating as it was before, and is a mix of 'clients'
  who use the platform and services provided by Mifos.org and partners who
  leverage more on the platform and extend on it. Most partners have already
  been involved and informed about the plans to become an Apache project,
  most of whom are part of the current Fineract Apache community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  This is the first report.

Date of last release:

  1. Finding contributors
  2. Do the first release from ASF

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have one new committer who works on the Chinese documentation.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The web site was moved over to the Apache infrastructure, and the
  freemarker.org domain was transferred to Apache too.

  Preparing for the first release from ASF, issues reported by Rat were
  fixed, and the build scripts were reworked to give output that conforms
  the release policy and conventions.

  There were a few smaller pull requests which were all reviewed and
  integrated.

  As a side note, there's a yet unresolved legal/policy issue (INFRA-10787)
  regarding if we can use freemarker.org as the canonical domain (while it's
  served from the Apache infrastructure), or we must redirect it to
  freemarker.incubator.apache.org (as it is now).

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Konstantin Boudnik (cos):
 
    For the next report: for me as a mentor (and perhaps for others on IPMC)
    it is not very insightful to see the number of pull requests or JIRAs
    opened. It isn't what "project development" constitutes in my mind. I
    would like to see more info about how project is getting into Apache Way,
    what important discussions are held, what decisions are made through
    community consensus, etc.

HAWQ

Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop native SQL query engine that combines the key
technological advantages of MPP database with the scalability and
convenience of Hadoop. HAWQ reads data from and writes data to HDFS
natively.  HAWQ delivers industry-leading performance and linear
scalability. It provides users the tools to confidently and successfully
interact with petabyte range data sets. HAWQ provides users with a complete,
standards compliant SQL interface.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce our first Apache Release
  2. Expand the community, increase dev list activity and adding new
     contributors
  3. Infrastructure migration: create Jenkins projects that build HAWQ
     binary, source tarballs and docker images, and run feature tests
     including at least installcheck-good tests for each commit (HAWQ-127).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Everything seems to be smooth, nothing urgent at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. One HAWQ Nest community meeting (topic: Data Federation with Apache
     HAWQ Using the PXF Extension Framework)
     Video: http://bit.ly/HAWQNest1217, Slides: http://bit.ly/HAWQNest1217ss

    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HAWQ/Becoming+a+committer).
    All good and healthy so far.

  Konstantin Boudnik (cos):

    Same comment as for Geode: the report is almost copy-cut from one another
    (if not in the letter, but in the spirit). Did you guys had anything worth
    mentioning besides of new features and bug fixes? Like Justin mentioned
    above - that what is very important for the project development.

--------------------
Impala

Impala is a high-performance C++ and Java SQL query engine for data stored
in Apache Hadoop-based clusters.

Impala has been incubating since 2015-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Resolve any issues around use of Gerrit as code-review tool.
  2. Movement of existing JIRA / Git / wiki / e-mail resources to Apache
     equivalents
  3. Initial release as incubating project.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Slowly - Impala is still in the very early stages of incubation, and
  performing the mechanical tasks of code movement and infrastructure setup
  is our first priority. The holiday period in the United States has slowed
  this effort slightly, but we look forward to picking up pace in early
  2016.  There have been no additions to the committer or PMC lists since
  incubation began.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have performed some of the basic initial tasks for incubation -
  establishing wiki pages, Git repositories and accounts for the initial
  committer set. Our next steps are:

  1. Finalize the SGA from Cloudera
  2. Move existing @cloudera.org e-mail aliases to their
     @impala.incubator.apache.org equivalents.
  3. Move source code from Cloudera git repository to Apache git repo.
  4. Improve out-of-box build and test experience so that community can
     easily evaluate release artifacts.
  5. Migrate cloudera.org JIRA tickets to issues.apache.org.

Date of last release:

  NA

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  At the time of the Incubation vote, 2015-12-03.

Kudu

Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache Hadoop
ecosystem.

Kudu has been incubating since 2015-12-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Move development to the Apache-hosted git repository, bug tracking, and
     code review.
  2. Build a more diverse development and user community
  3. Perform releases under the ASF

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None so far.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - The development community has remained about the same since the initial
    proposal, with overall code contribution levels a bit lower than
    historical averages due to the end-of-year holidays.
  - Xiaomi reported that they are now running Kudu in a production use case
    on ~70 nodes ingesting 10B rows/day. This is Kudu's first known
    production use case, and we expect continuing and increasing
    participation from developers at Xiaomi.
  - To spread the word about Kudu, various community members have given a
    number of talks over the last 6 weeks, including: Strata/Hadoop World
    (Singapore), Big Data Tech Con (Beijing), Shanghai Streaming Meetup,
    Korea Big Data Think Tank (Seoul), San Francisco Spark Hackers, The Hive
    Big Data Think Tank (Palo Alto), Charlotte Hadoop User Group, Cloudera
    World Tokyo, Big Data Warehousing Meetup (NYC), and more.
  - Members of the Kudu community met up with Apache Drill contributors and
    built an initial version of Kudu/Drill integration. We anticipate
    further collaboration with Drill and other ASF TLPs.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  This is our first report since incubation. In the past month, we've
  accomplished a few milestones:

  - filed an SGA as well as ICLAs for initial committers
  - granted karma, created mailing lists, and subscribed mentors/committers
  - updated our web site to comply with ASF branding
  - filed INFRA requests to start working on git and JIRA migration
    (INFRA-10959, INFRA-10983)
 
  Progress has slowed in the second half of December due to the holiday
  season, but we anticipate picking momentum back up in January.
 
Date of last release:

  None under the ASF. Outside of the ASF, we released 0.6.0 on 11/24/2015.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Activate some community
  2. Create a release
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Not sure if the project still has an official mentor assigned, after
  Christian Grobmeier is not the chair of the Apache Logging Services
  project anymore.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Not grown. However, the project aims to become a sub project of Apache
  Logging again. Community growth is not much a matter for this podling, as
  long as there are a few active contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Not at all: There's no public development and it seems there's currently
  only one originally incubating community member left. Though some support
  is given and bugs are tracked.

MADlib

Big Data Machine Learning in SQL for Data Scientists.

MADlib has been incubating since 2015-09-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce a first Apache (incubating) release.
  2. Expand the community, increase dev list activity and add new
     committers/pmc members.
  3. Execute and manage the project according to governance model required
     by the "Apache Way”.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Second community call held 12/18/15.  On the call Roman suggested that
     the MADlib community do a 1.9 alpha release in the near term.  There
     was general agreement and this is planned for January.  A Release
     Manager has not yet been identified.
  2. Material technical conversations on dev mailing lists and in the
     appropriate JIRAs.  E.g., 51 emails on dev in Dec.
  3. One new committer has been proposed and voting is under way on the
     private mailing list.
  4. Two comprehensive proposals were posted to the dev mailing list from
     community members.  One relates to the addition of geographically
     weighted regression (GWR) algorithms.  The second involves Bayesian
     analysis of binomial response models for MPP databases, which makes
     extensive use of MADlib’s new matrix operations.  Both proposals are
     under active discussion on the mailing list currently.
  5. We have been accepted to present a full talk at FOSDEM 2016/Brussels in
     the HPC, Big Data & Data Science Devroom on Jan 31.  The title of the
     talk is: "MADlib: Distributed In-Database Machine Learning for Fun and
     Profit"

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. 5 JIRAs created and 4 resolved in last 30 days.

Milagro

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.
In view of the holiday season, it has only really started this week
(Jan 4th) and is currently bootstrapping.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Import the software.
  2. Sign up the developers.
  3. Audit the Intellectual Property.

  All fairly meaningless until the Community is live at Apache.

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built
on top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and
query processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across
multiple nodes.  Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through
SPARQL, a conventional query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Populate the website for the project
  2. Expand the "how to" document to explain the ways new contributors can
     become involved in the project, so we increase the size of the
     community.
  3. Become familiar with the release process and have a first release as
     part of the Apache Foundation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * We have documented (on Confluence) and tested procedures for committers
    to review and incorporate Pull Requests into the incubator-rya Apache
    git repository.
  * The committers are becoming much more comfortable with the Apache
    infrastructure and processes. Committers have been documenting processes
    on Confluence, creating Jira tickets, tying these to Rya components and
    versions, and submitting and pulling in PRs to resolve these Jira
    tickets.
  * The Rya user community (i.e. non-committers) have begun submitting
    issues through Jira and the dev list.  These have become Jira tickets,
    resolved by committers, and tested by the community.  Specifically, the
    community submitted RYA-19, RYA-17, and RYA-6.  Committers resolved and
    the community tested RYA-19 and RYA-17.
  * Non-committers have also begun submitting PRs that have been
    incorporated into the apache repo.  Specifically, RYA-13 and most of
    RYA-7 was done by non-committers.
  * We've started logging "beginner" Jira tickets.  These are issues that
    we've found in Rya that a new developer could take on as a good way to
    "get their feet wet" in the code base.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * We've completed adding the Apache license headers and added license
    header verification to the project's build.
  * Resolved a handful of issues that users have encountered.
  * Committed features: Delete support for secondary indices, more efficient
  * Mongo Core and Geo indexing.
  * Still working on creating a website for the project.
  * Working on deploying artifacts onto Maven
  * Working on creating a quick-start VM for users to try out Rya.

SystemML

SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at
flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid
runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to
distributed computations such as Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

SystemML has been incubating since 2015-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow SystemML community: increase mailing list activity,
     increase adoption of SystemML for scalable machine learning, encourage
     data scientists to adopt DML and PyDML algorithm scripts, respond to
     user feedback to ensure SystemML meets the requirements of real-world
     situations, write papers, and present talks about SystemML.
  2. Core library improvements, including Apache Spark integration.
  3. Produce a release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The community has been blocked by INFRA-10714 since November.
  Beginning Jan 6th, we are manually updating the missing fields in JIRA so
  that we can properly manage project issues and delegate issues to new
  users to grow our community.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Users have asked several excellent questions on the dev list, and existing
  committers are actively helping these users. The project is receiving pull
  requests from contributors, committers have discussed these pull requests
  with their contributors, and contributions have been merged into the
  project.  Matthias Boehm has presented talks regarding the SystemML
  Optimizer at TU Dresden, HTW Dresden, and TU Berlin. Fred Reiss presented
  a talk on Dec 8th.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Numerous core library improvements have been made to project. Additional
  documentation has been created to help new users. The test suite has been
  refactored to increase maintainability and performance. Contributions have
  been made by non-IBM contributors. We are developing our 2016 roadmap,
  as seen in the "[DISCUSS] Project Roadmap" thread on the mailing list at
  <http://s.apache.org/9hK>.

Unomi

Unomi is a reference implementation of the OASIS Context Server
specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server
Technical Committee. It provides a high-performance user profile and event
tracking server.

Unomi has been incubating since 2015-10-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Improve documentation on the website
  2. Make some incubating releases
  3. Grow the community size and diversity.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We got feedbacks from users and interested people. A good sign is that the
  1.0.0-incubating release has been voted by people outside of the initial
  committer set (even if the release vote didn't pass).

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We did improvement on the website, and on the code. Our focus was on Unomi
  1.0.0-incubating release.  Unfortunately, a couple of issues (missing src
  assembly especially) blocked the vote. We are fixing those issues to
  submit a take 2 on 1.0.0-incubating release.

Date of last release:

  Unomi 1.0.0-incubating has been proposed to vote, but due to a couple of
  issue it has been declined.  We are working to submit a take 2 on
  1.0.0-incubating.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

## Description: 

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.

   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

   
## Activity: 

Since the last report we have made two releases, Apache Isis 1.10.0 [1] and 
Apache Isis 1.11.0 [2].  This is in line with a desire to push out new
features on a more frequent basis (every 6 to 8 weeks is the intention).

The mailing list activity is steady, with the number of new subscribers 
continuing to increase steadily. 
  

## Health report: 

Project activity (#mails, tickets, commits etc) are all healthy.  Part of
this is because more frequent releases (two in this reporting period) 
generates additional "traffic" as a side-effect.

We note that the automated scoring has downgraded us from "healthy" to
"mostly healthy".  This would seem to be primarily on account of no new 
committers/PMC members since Dec 2014.  In the Isis PMC we are not unduly 
worried; our user base is increasing and from that we expect to invite new 
committers in the fullness of time.

   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 11 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Martin Grigorov on Tue Dec 23 2014

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

Project Status
--------------

Likely related to the holiday period, activity around jclouds and,
specifically, development of the existing code has been relatively quiet over
the past quarter. That being said, there have been a number of recent
questions from new users expressing interest in developing custom cloud
providers, which is a welcome sign of ongoing interest and engagement in the
project. The core community has also continued to be very responsive to
questions from users.

Community
---------

We are also having discussions about how to grow the committer base. Due to
the nature of the project it is difficult to find people interested in more
than one provider or in several areas of the project. We are having
discussions to effectively mitigate this and to allow the community to grow
faster and better. Regarding this there is a committer candidate under the
radar.

There are currently 11 PMC members and 22 committers.

* Last committer: 2014-08-01 (Chris Custine)
* Last PMC member: 2015-09-20 (Zack Shoylev)
 
Community Objectives
--------------------

* Finally determine the scope and complete the features for jclouds 2.0.0.
* Encourage and supervise, where necessary, new contributors to grow the
committer base.

Releases
--------

The last jclouds release, 1.9.2, took place on Sat Jan 16 2016.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

## Description: 

Pure Java application for load and functional testing

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 

The project continues to work on improving the product. We are hoping to make
the next release soon.

The JMeter Twitter account has 2337 followers as of 8th Jan 2016. This is
about 180 more than at the time of the previous report (October)

We recently incorporated a substantial donation of code from UbikLoadPack for
generating reports.  This was processed via the Incubator IP clearance
  process.

## Health report: There is steady progress on fixing bugs and implementing
enhancements.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 7 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Felix Schumacher on Tue Feb 03 2015

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 11 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Deepak Shetty at Wed Jul 29 2015

## Releases:

- Last release was 2.13 on Sat Mar 14 2015

## Mailing list activity:

- dev@jmeter.apache.org:
- 138 subscribers (up 4 in the last 3 months):
- 525 emails sent to list (203 in previous quarter)

- issues@jmeter.apache.org:
- 40 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
- 438 emails sent to list (293 in previous quarter)

- user@jmeter.apache.org:
- 806 subscribers (up 5 in the last 3 months):
- 218 emails sent to list (393 in previous quarter)

It's possible that the reduced user mailing list participation is partly due
to increased activity on places like StackOverflow.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos]

## Description: 
   A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard  
        JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP). 
   
## Issues: 
 - Although almost no dev activity on this quarter (see below), we think 
   there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Almost no SVN activity this quarter. 
 - Release 2.10.2 blocked due to developers' lack of time on the project, 
   (due to being developed on a free-time basis) holidays, etc., but 
   should be doable on this quarter.
 - No questions unattended/unanswered on MLs.
   
## Health report: 
 - Although there hasn't been almost any development activity this quarter, 
   we don't think there's reason to concern: Project is stable / mature 
   with a slow pace of development, plus there's enough people to oversee 
   the project (vote on releases, answer questions, etc.). 
 - Activity is expected to be picked up once we release 2.10.2.

 Apache Mahout 0.11.1 was released on Nov 6, 2015.  This release supports
 Spark 1.4+ and has major performance improvements for vector and matrix
 operations.
 
 Sebastian Schelter presented the new Mahout distributed linear algebra
 framework at Flink Forward, Berlin On October 12, 2015. [1]

 Present activity is restricted to finalizing the Flink - Mahout integration
 which would be Mahout 1.0 release and to bolster the performance of the
 backend linear algebra by rebasing the code with alternate native
 implementations.

Releases: 
   
 - Mahout 0.11.1 was released on Fri Nov 06 2015 
      
Issues: 

Decline in the project user and developer base over the past 2 years, in large
part due to the availability of competing Machine Learning libraries with very
active developer teams backed by organizations. 

Its hard to sustain a Machine Learning project on voluntary basis with no
dedicated resources and yet be relevant with changing times and increasing
competition.

In the past, there was some promise of dedicated resources from organizations
but nothing promising enough.

JIRA activity: 
   
 - 22 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 35 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Hervé Boutemy]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build
lifecycle.

* Issues

  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

* Activity

  * As announced previously, we are starting to release 3.x.x line of plugins
    with Maven 3 and Java 6 minimum requirements (no more compatible with
    Maven 2.2.1 and Java 5).

    To fulfill this, we needed to release several shared components with the
    same requirements which will be used within the plugins.

  * We did a yearly Jira issues cleanup, following the same process as the
    cleanup done in september: with the same "3-years without update" limit,
    this time we closed ~120 issues (600 in september), and got feedback only
    on a few issues. Then these issues were worked on with reporter's help and
    fixed. This makes us think that the process gives us what we expected:
    ability to efficiently close orphan issues and detect issues that still
    have users active interest.

  * On behalf of the Apache Maven team, Jason van Zyl has become a member of
    the Java Platform Module System (JSR 376) expert group: see
    http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/

  * Prepations for adopting JDK9 Jigsaw have started.

* Health Report

  We have a few new committers and PMC members, replacing people becoming less
  active over time: the team is slowly rotating at every level.

  Even if Maven is stable, we have many Jira issues opened against our many
  sub-projects (Maven core, 46 plugins and their dependencies), more than what
  the current team can triage and fix, with or without active help from initial
  reporters: that's why yearly Jira cleanups, if not perfect, is the best
  solution we have found to focus our work. We expect to do such cleanup each
  year unless stats show that it's not useful any more (which is unlikely since
  some users tend to report issues but not give reproducible test cases or
  required explanations when asking for more details).

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Apache Mesos is a cluster manager that provides resource sharing and
isolation across cluster applications.

## General ##

The project and contributors continues to grow. The community has
bi-weekly meetings as well as a handful of working groups that are
addressing specific components. We are starting to prepare for a 2-3
different MesosCons this year (Denver, Europe, and China). We're also
planning on doing a 1.0 release in the coming months.

## Releases ##

 * Apache Mesos 0.23.1 (2015-09-21)
 * Apache Mesos 0.22.2 (2015-09-23)
 * Apache Mesos 0.21.2 (2015-09-24)
 * Apache Mesos 0.25.0 (2015-10-09)
 * Apache Mesos 0.26.0 (2015-12-10)

## PMC/Committership ##

No new committers or PMC members were added in November or December,
but we have a handful of candidates that the community is currently
proposing. The last added members:

 * Voted to add Joris Van Remoortere as a PMC and Committer on 2015-09-20.
 * Voted to add Michael Park as a PMC and Committer on 2015-07-28.
 * Voted to add Kapil Arya as a PMC and Committer on 2015-10-06.

## Community ##

 * Added more organizations to the 'Powered By Mesos' list, including
   YP.com.

 * The community is generally happy with our new monthly release
   cadence, but it has made backwards compatibility trickier to
   negotiate (although, see below, 1.0 release will help).

 * The community would like to do our 1.0 release. Vinod Kone, a long
   time PMC and committer member will be acting as a project manager
   for this release.

 * We're preparing for multiple MesosCon's this year organized by the
   Linux Foundation. The first is planned for Denver June 1-2,
   2016. Final dates and location for Europe have not been
   secured. We're also investigating doing one in China as there are
   some large users and a community developing there.

 * A new member in the community is Nvidia, who is working on adding
   GPU support to Mesos.

## Issues: 
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
## Activity: 
- We've made progress with preparing the next release, migrated some fixes
  from the development branch to the release branch. We're feature complete 
  with the current release and release preparation is in progress.
## Health Report:
 - ODE is very mature and stable, however the interest in BPEL has decreased
   significantly. Thus ODE's development is currently pretty much in 
   maintenance mode. We're ironing out technical debt and making sure
   that our codebase campground is clean, supporting our users with answers

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Dennis E. Hamilton]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

STATUS
======

The Project succeeded with maintenance release 4.1.2 on October 28.
This is a significant milestone and the first release in 14 months.

Warning signs around sustainability and disconnects across the
community are being brought gradually and gingerly to community
attention.

ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS
==========================

The Board needs to be aware of Activity concerns and Sustainability
warning signs reported/reviewed in the Issues sections, below.


RELEASES
========

Release 4.1.2 was approved on October 26 and announced as available on
2015-10-28.  In addition, Java UNO tools for Maven, jar files of AOO 4.1.2
components for independent usage, were distributed on 2015-12-21.

Complete Release History
  2015-10-28 4.1.2
  2014-08-21 4.1.1
  2014-04-29 4.1
  2013-10-01 4.0.1
  2013-07-17 4
  2013-01-30 3.4.1 refresh (8 more languages)
  2012-08-21 3.4.1 incubating
  2012-05-08 3.4   incubating


ACTIVITY
========

Release Effort and Plans
------------------------

Non-4.1.2-release-blocker issues and some anticipated features were
retargeted to a subsequent Apache OpenOffice release in order to
accelerate release of 4.1.2.

Improvements for performing unit testing have been introduced by
introducing Google Test in place of cppunit.  Some finalization
is needed to have the changes work for Windows builds.

There is not yet any action plan or staging for releases beyond
October's 4.1.2.  There are no projected release dates.

Community Operations
--------------------

The Apache OpenOffice community has three main pillars: development,
support, and end-user services.  The pillars are permeable, with
interdependencies from end to end.

For AOO, the provision of authenticated binaries as part of Apache
releases is not a mere convenience.  It is overwhelmingly the purpose
of the project in its origin and as brought to Apache, however much
the limited downstream use of the code base is also desired and
supported.

As evidence of that importance, by 2015-12-31, binary installers
of previous release 4.1.1 had been downloaded 48.1 million times.
Of these,

   87.7% were for Windows
    8.9% were for Macintosh
    3.4% were for all other distributions, including Linux

For 4.1.2 binaries, since release at the end of October until
2015-12-31, there are 7.7 million downloads, now continuing at
about 1 million per week, with

   87.5% for Windows,
    8.1% for Macintosh, and
    4.4% for all other distributions

Although US destinations have the greatest number of downloads
by nationality, that represents only 15% of the total for this
highly-international project.

That overwhelmingly defines the community of next-in-line adopters
of Apache OpenOffice software.


PMC/COMMITTERS
==============

The practice of welcoming new PMC/committer members on the dev list
dropped out and has been restored.

PMC
---

The AOO PMC consists of 27 individuals as of 2015-12-31.  Gavin
McDonald joined the PMC and Peter Junge retired in the October-
December quarter.

   18 have remained continuously out of the
      23 from TLP formation in October, 2012.
    9 are new or returned PMC members

    7 of the current PMC are Apache Software Foundation

The recognition and invitation of potential committers is improving and
expected to continue.


ISSUES
======

With the positive movement seen in this quarter, some issues linger.
It is slow going identifying obstacles and bringing them before the entire
community for its wisdom in identification of consensus-based direction.

Recent progress is owed to heroic efforts on the part of a small group.
We must find a way to not have that as the only way of operating,
burning out devoted contributors.  The inevitability of turnover is
worrisome.

Governance
----------

ACTION ITEM: Following the October 2015 Board Meeting, considering the
general lack of energy and resources reported, the AOO PMC was
requested to report plans for informing the public on current
difficulties and risks to the project.

STATUS: The PMC has not addressed the action item.  The Chair has made
an initial few [RISK? ...] posts on the dev@ list to bring individual
cases to general-community attention.  There are mixed results.

NEXT STEPS: Continue identifying risks and issues of capacity and
capability on the public lists to provide a grounded discussion on the
state of the project in the community.

Development
-----------

PREVIOUSLY: Chair was to follow through with PMC to develop a slip-stream
release setup that is always in hand regardless of what feature release
development is underway.  Have in place as soon as possible after release
4.1.2.
STATUS: Preparation for short-cycle releases and controlled changes,
such as code-signing and straightforward maintenance, has no alignment
on the PMC.  There is concern that this will distract from achieving a
feature release.
NEXT STEPS: Take the concerns to the dev@ community for discussion there.

RESOURCE ISSUES: The buildbot for Windows binaries has not
made a successful build since since 2015-07-28.  This has limited QA
testing and patch testing.  There is risk of regressions from changes that
are developed and successfully applied to Linux builds, the primary tool
active developers.

CAPACITY CONCERNS. Based on the crunch to release AOO 4.1.2, it is clear
that 5-6 developers, all on the PMC, completely held together the release
and deployment of AOO 4.1.2.  While there are important contributions from
many others on and off the PMC, without those five the release would not have
happened when it did.
   The involvement of QA volunteers was limited.
   There are also limitations around having enough PMC members provide
builds from source corresponding to the different configurations that are
supported.

Community
---------

PREVIOUSLY: Misalignment in the connection and support from developers
all the way to end-users via lists, forums, and bugzilla was raised as a
concern.  The incoherence in where fixes are focused versus where usability
is an issue are part of that concern.
STATUS: This has been raised among the different subgroups with modest
success.  Some do not see a problem.
NEXT STEPS: Continue to cultivate this issue.  Downgrade from an issue for
board attention.

ISSUE CLEARANCE AND TECHNICAL DEBT.  The handling of issues is how the cycle
of improvement from developers to users to developers is demonstrated.
   The tabulation of bugzilla issue growth has been completed to the end
of 2015.  The rate at which issues remain unresolved continues to be in
excess of 40%.  The overall tabulation is at <http://s.apache.org/YFT>.
A qualitative analysis is at <http://s.apache.org/SNg>.
   NOTE: There is a strenuous objection to the use of "technical debt" in
the analysis of unresolved-issue accrual.
   KEY CONCERN: No matter how the tracking and understanding of these issues
improves, there does not appear to be developer capacity for addressing
very many of them.  This may discourage further defect reporting and
diminish user confidence in their reliance on the software.

Previous Sustainability Concerns
--------------------------------

CUSTOM IT SUPPORT.  A project member has taken over the maintenance
of the MediaWiki software.  The Forum services are running successfully.
This is no longer an issue.

RELEASE MANAGEMENT.  A new Release Manager provided AOO 4.1.2.  The ability
to train others in managing releases is not fully established and resources
for the different builds are strained.  Improvement is expected to continue.
   NEXT STEPS: Continued attention.

SKILL DEVELOPMENT. Exploring engagement with companies that might
have a strategic reason for contributing skills to the project has
not been fruitful.
   Although there are occassional newcomers wanting to work on the project,
the learning curve is very steep, especially for Windows development.  It is
not unusual for new volunteers to disappear after a short time.
   On the bright side, three students are now being mentored by a senior
developer.
   NEXT STEPS: Continued attention, improve the Windows situation.

COMMITTER/PMC AVAILABILITY.  As of 2015-10-20, all 140 committers have updated
their passwords since the previously-required reset.  It remains to determine
what committers/PMC are still subscribed to the dev/private lists.  In any
case, most of the 140 are not regulary involved.
   NEXT STEPS: Promote more active contributors as committers, assess
capacity for development more closely.

INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES.
   PREVIOUSLY From 2015-09 Report. Clarify the situation and achieve a
sustainable arrangement in consultation with Infra.  Identify at least
temporary relief, with solid arrangement by January.
   STATUS: The Forum and Wiki systems are maintained by a project member
and the procedures are documented for use by others.
   NEXT STEPS: None.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache ORC Project  [Owen O'Malley]

## Description: 
   A high-performance columnar file format for Hadoop workloads. 
   
## Issues: 
 - We really need a release, which is blocked by wanting to get the Java
   reader and writer moved out of Hive.
   
## Activity: 
 - Progress continues on moving the Java reader and writer out of Hive. We've
   created the ORC module in Hive and moved the API, utilities and writer into
   it. We are currently cleaning up some of the ORC APIs before Hive 2.0.0
   gets released. The final bits to move over to the ORC module will be the
   reader. Once the reader is moved over, the entire module can be moved to
   the ORC project.
   
## Health report: 
 - The activity level is relatively low. The C++ reader works and is stable.
   There continues to be user interest in reading and writing ORC files
   outside of Hive.

 getting Drill off of its Parquet fork.  Releases are ongoing to allow Drill
 to upgrade its dependencies.  Several efforts are ongoing to improve
 vectorized reads from Java and C++ They involve collaboration of several
 organizations.  Communication is happening in JIRA
   
## Health report: 
  We have now a rotation to have someone responsible for answering JIRAs and
  emails each week.  Level of ticket creation and resolution is about the
  same, keeping opened tickets to a reasonable amount.  Typically user
  activity shows up in the user lists of other projects depending on parquet
  (drill, impala, presto, spark, ...)

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache PDFBox Project  [Andreas Lehmkühler]

## Description: 
The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for
working with PDF documents.

## Issues:
- there are no issues requiring board attention at this time"

## Activity:
- we are planning to release the third and hopefully last RC of PDFBox very
soon
- as there are a lot of fixes for the 1.8 branch we are going to release a
bugfix version of the 1.8 branch as well
- joining forces with Tim Allison from Apache TIKA to run some bulk tests
(analyzing ~250k of pdfs using different of versions of PDFBox) is a huge help
in many ways
 - compare 2.0.0 with 1.8.x (benchmarks as well as comparing results)
 - determine regressions
 - observe memory footprint/performance
 - find pdfs using rare features/combination of features which are unsupported
   by PDFBox

## Health report:
- there is a steady stream of contributions, bug reports and questions on the
mailing lists
- the core team consists of 4 - 5 active developers
- after releasing two RCs of the next major version more people show their
interest in PDFBox (see the increased number of subscribers to users@)

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation uses
to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.
  
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring much board attention at this time. As stated
 below, we are in a state of trying to find our footing, but at present,
 it is not something that the board need to concern themselves with,
 unless they wish to help out in a personal capacity.
  
## Activity: 
This quarter has been one of some soul searching within the PMC, kicked off by
a thread by the former VP asking whether it would make sense to disband the
PMC and merge the project with the Whimsy PMC. While this did not gain enough
traction to make it to any formal vote or the likes, it did shine some light
on the difficulties of 'seasonal projects' like STeVe, where the community can
seem quite dead for large periods of time. There were some follow-ups asking
for more participation, and we did manage to vote in a new committer to help
with the project.
  
## Health report: 
While the project can be considered as being in hiatus between annual member
meetings, the above mentioned call for a new committer did manage to garner
votes from 5 PMC members, proving that we still have the 3x+1 needed to have
an active PMC. We continue to monitor the state of the community as we
approach the usual busy period around March/April.

On a more personal note, I will likely be reaching out to the ASF membership
and seek people to help us test and improve the pySTeVe branch of our project.
It is my belief that getting a release out at some point will help our
visibility and grow our community, but we are in need of people to test and
report back with their findings.

Compared to previous quarter, the email flow picked up relatively well, albeit
still not much.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made no releases in the last quarter. Last GA release was
* Struts 2.3.24.1 - security fix release (2015-09-15)

Given this was the holiday season, we saw rather vivid development and
feedback activity within the reporting period. Work on Struts 2.5 keeps
moving forward, with a BETA 3 soon to be published. Struts 2.5 includes
new features, consolidations and dependency upgrades along with dropping
support for already deprecated APIs and framework parts. It is
considered a milestone release towards Struts 3, which is supposed to
include major new features as well as breaking changes.

We have currently three security reports under investigation. Progress
on these non-critical issues went rather slow, with Apache Security team
having to remind us that these issues are quite long-standing now. Two
of these issues seem to be finally fixed now, with announcements and an
improved solution to come up with the next Struts 2.3 GA release,
expected to arrive very soon. Thanks to Mark Thomas for his very
valuable help on analyzing one of these issues and giving advice on how
to improve on it. We made progress with the third issue as well.

We continue to receive high quality contributions by non-committers via
our GitHub mirror and issue tracking. This includes not only drive-by
patches, but also, and more importantly, continued involvement by
various individuals. We keep monitoring them as they might qualify for
committership addition.

Aleksandr Mashchenko (amashchenko) was added as new committer effective
2015-10-23.
No new PMC members have been added in the last quarter. Last PMC
addition was on 2015-05-12.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Hiranya Jayathilaka]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

No new committers or PMC members were nominated this quarter. Latest
Synapse committer was elected on December, 2013. Latest Synapse PMC
member was elected on December, 2013. 

Releases
========

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on 
January, 2012.

Board Issues
============

Over the past few years the community interest towards Synapse has 
been dwindling, with a considerable decline in the number of commits 
and the mailing list traffic. For instance, we haven't had any commits
or meaningful mailing list conversations over the last reporting period.
Right now it is only myself (PMC chair) who is even reasonably active 
on the project, with occasional contributions coming from Andreas Viethen
in the way of basic code maintenance. And with myself gettig occupied 
with academic work, the project is almost at a standstill. 

I would personally like to do one more release before we terminate the 
project, but without a compatible Axis2 release this is not possible.
I personally don't have time to contribute towards an Axis2 release, 
and the other Synapse committers haven't stepped in to make any
contributions either. Given these conditions I don't believe there's
any point in trying to keep the project alive. 

I have already initiated a discussion on the Synapse PMC list about
retiring the project. This thread was opened on 12th of January, and
it hasn't garnered a single response as of today -- 6 days later. I 
think this sums up the current level of  interest towards the project.

I will now go ahead and call for a vote to retire the project, and
kick off the procedure to move the Synapse into Attic. I intend to
send the corresponding resolution to the board by next month's
board meeting.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Massimo Manghi]

## Description:
 - Apache Tcl is an umbrella for Tcl-Apache integration efforts.
 Currently Apache Tcl has Rivet as only active subproject.

## Activity:
 - A new artifact of rivet was released (2.2.4) and a new version
 (2.3.0) is about to be ready. Development continues for the code
 in trunk at a slow but constant pace. More efforts are under way
 to document the new mod_rivet design
 - As stated in the October report we discontinued Websh.
 Since Websh was a subproject we didn't move it to the Attic, we
 just put a banner on the web pages and asked infra to delete the
 development mailing list.

## Issues:
 - There are no relevant issues requiring board attention at
 this time.

## Health report:
 - We can't be dismissive about the issue concerning the health of
the project. Even though most PMC members are voting each release we
basically have real commits from one contributor (myself).
In our last report I stated we had intention to start a campaign to
recruit more contributors but I failed to do so. We are discussing
a document with a list of topics on which we may attract attention
from the Tcl developers community. As soon as this chart is ready we
will make it public hoping to stir some interest

  Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which 
  can be used to process arbitrarily complex directed-acyclic graphs (DAGs) of 
  data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set of data-processing primitives

   newer version of ember.
 - There is also work ongoing to create a release with binary artifacts
   for easier consumption.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

The user list continues to be active with most queries resolved quickly.

Average user mailing list traffic: 230 messages / month
Dev mailing list traffic: 
  - 39  messages for October
  - 138 messages for November
  - 69  messages for December

We seem to continuously see new users reaching out to us.

Thanks to a community push and the joined effort, we dedicated the end of
November and the beginning of December on the TomEE 1.7.3 release which is
Java EE 6 certified. This is a maintenance release with a couple of important
fixes the community was looking for.

Most of the work has been dedicated to produce the first Java EE 7 TomEE
release, namely the 7.0.0-M1. This release has been anticipated for some
months and is a big step forward for the community. Lack the Java EE 7 TCK
continues to be painful disadvantage, one which will be slightly more
highlighted now that we are shipping Java EE 7 targeted releases and
questions of compliance increase.

Overall the project is lacking in resources and has been highlighted in late
board reports, delays in getting security issues resolved and the long lag in
the first TomEE 7 milestone release.  Action has been taken as previously
reported to address issues of late board reports.  The PMC is more actively
discussing the open security issue, ZDI-15-638.  As well serious discussions
are underway on how to attract more committers.  Expect some resolutions in
this area as a deliverable to the board in future reports.  The community is
aware and desires better.

Specifically for ZDI-15-638, the PMC expects resolution in the next two weeks
with release in both 1.7.x and 7.x shortly after.

Last release was 1.7.3 on 2015-12-09 and 7.0.0-M1 on 2015-12-10.  
Last committer was added November 2015.  Last PMC addition, 4 new members on 
2015-08-11.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

## Description: 
 Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
 and Varnish in functionality and features.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
 - The 2015 Fall Summit was hosted by, and held at, Yahoo! campus. Roughly 80
   participants were  present. The Summit was very well received.
 - We are starting planning for our Spring Summit, which likely will be held
   in combination with ACNA'16.
   
## Health report: 
 - We are happy to announce that since last board report, three new committers
   have been voted into the community! This is particularly exciting since
   they all three have been focusing on our HTTP/2 efforts.
 - We're in the final stages of a new v6.1.0 release, scheduled for January
   2016 release. No new releases were made since the last report, but our
   releases are following expected release schedules for the year.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache VXQuery Project  [Till Westmann]

Description:
Apache VXQuery implements a parallel XML Query processor.

Activity:
- Activity has slowed down - especially in December. There’s a sizable
  overlap between the committers for VXQuery and the AsterixDB podling
  and a lot of the attention has been focussed on AsterixDB recently.
  However, as some of the work in the AsterixDB podling is on the Hyracks
  and Algebricks frameworks that are the foundation of VXQuery, VXQuery
  also benefits from this work.
- Discussions on the integration with parts of the Hadoop ecosystem
  (HDFS and YARN) still ongoing.
- The paper on VXQuery has been presented by Preston at IEEE Big
  Data 2015 in Santa Clara.

Issues:
- There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

PMC/Committership changes:

- Currently 10 committers and 7 PMC members in the project.
- Last PMC addition was Steven Jacobs at Fri Jul 18 2014
- Last committer addition was Steven Jacobs at Fri Jul 18 2014

Releases:

- Last release was 0.5 on Thu Mar 05 2015

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Sagara Gunathunga]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Ross Gardler]

1) Many/(most?) Whimsy committers are now authorized to push to the GitHub
repository.  MATT is now online, but there appears to still be a manual step
required to identify which GitHub ID is to be associated with your Apache
account.  This presumably will be ironed out over time, and at the moment only
represents a point of confusion, not a stumbling block.

2) In addition to Sam, two committers (Chris and Sebb) have succeeded at
actually pushing to GitHub.  Also two committers (Craig and Sebb) are able to
run individual tools on their own development machines[1]. Their changes are
automatically deployed, without human intervention[2].  Craig is now working
on trying to push a change - this may be complete by the time of the board
meeting.

3) Set up of the whimsy-test VM has begun in earnest.  To the extent humanly
possible, everything is either provisioned through Puppet or deployed
automatically from the GitHub repository[3].

4) Status monitoring is beginning to be roughed in[4].  At the moment, it is a
simple ping endpoint.  This rolls up fined grained status of the various
applications deployed on whimsy, and alerts the infrastructure team when there
is failure.

5) A replacement for the Secretary mail tool is nearing completion.  It should
be considerably more responsive and reliable than the current tool[5], which
required multiple manual cleanup of intermediate svn directories this month.
The hope is that with this version of the tool, Craig will be able to develop,
locally test, and deploy improvements such as adding buttons and tweaking the
content of emails produced.

6) Additional items planned for the next month (or so) include:
  a) Flipping the "big switch" to enable synchronization between GitHub
     and ASF hosted repositories.
  b) Moving the board agenda tool over to what is now called
     whimsy-test.
  c) Changing the DNS so that that what is not whimsy-test will become
     the new whimsy.  The old whimsy will remain around under a new
     name for a few months.
