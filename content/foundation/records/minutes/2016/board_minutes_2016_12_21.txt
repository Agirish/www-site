 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The majority of discussion over the last month has been around the way
       in which project's enforce their brand, as covered in the President's
       report.

       In the next month, I'll start preparing for the Annual Members Meeting
       again, looking to set a date in March again.

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall
       =======

       My priorities remain: budget, brand, fundraising, then EA/TAC.  EVP will
       be reporting on other areas.

       Virtual has changed from outsourcing Professional Employer Organization
       (PEO) services to a third party to bringing this in house.  The only
       immediate change that contactors will see is a modest reduction in the
       number of days they have to select a health care provider should they be
       interested in taking advantage of this benefit.  The end date remains
       the same, it is only the start date that is slightly delayed.  There is
       a possibility that there may be some cost reductions that Virtual can
       pass on to us down the road, but that has yet to be seen.

       I'm working with the Treasurer to review a policy for ASF issued credit
       cards which was prepared by Virtual.


       Budget
       ======

       We now have a draft FY17 budget for review and approval.  It's not
       perfect, but I encourage the board to approve it as is and to provide
       feedback on what changes should be made for the FY18 budget.

       The budget reflects direct input from the following officers: Brand
       Management, Fundraising, Infrastructure Administrator, and Marketing and
       Publicity.  In all other areas, I'm carrying forward the data provided
       by Virtual as these areas are low risk and are likely to come in on
       budget.

       This budget includes a modest amount of funding for Fundraising
       activities.  I see this as experimental: we are going to try things to
       see what works and what does not.  Monthly fundraising reports will
       identify specifics as to how the money is spent and attempt to relate
       those expenditures with potential future sponsorships.

       In my opinion there has been an unwarranted amount of attention on Brand
       Management budget.  While it is true that for the first time Brand
       Management expenses are expected to exceed TAC, it still remains under
       both EA and Marketing and Publicity expenses.  If funding were tight --
       which it most definitely is not -- I personally would recommend looking
       elsewhere for savings first.

       To be fair, the pushback to date hasn't been so much on the amount but
       whether or not alternatives have been explored to see if lower cost
       options might be viable.  I'll merely observe that similar questions
       could productively be asked of each budget area, and that Brand
       Management isn't in my opinion a priority in either likelihood of
       finding savings or in the amount of savings.  My top priority for that
       remains infrastructure; not because I feel that it is poorly run (it is
       not), but due to the size of that budget item even a small change could
       produce a substantial savings.


       Brand Management
       ================

       Prior direction to this area was to decentralize where possible.  I'm
       now seeing signs that this approach will need to be modified.  More data
       is needed, and -- heads up! -- some board guidance and perhaps
       intervention may be required.  I've added a discussion item to the
       agenda for this purpose.

       Overall, my feeling is that having EITHER Brand Management OR the PMCs
       be responsible for marks (as an either/or) is problematic.  As PMCs will
       rarely need to worry about marks, this responsibility can be quickly
       forgotten.  What we need is:

       1) a way to track issues (which Mark and Shane are working on), and for
       both Brand Management and PMCs be jointly responsible for identifying
       and opening issues.  Brand Management's searches will need to be
       prioritized, and Shane has taken a first pass at doing exactly that.

       I'd like to see Mark's work to create a private JIRA instance to be in a
       position where it is ready to be used by the start of the next (January)
       board meeting, and am willing to task infrastructure with helping make
       this happen if that is needed.

       2) for the expectation to be set that PMCs to be the first line of
       defense, in terms of contacting outside parties using the documented
       process; and for there to be some consequences spelled out for PMCs that
       don't meet these expectations.

       3) for Brand Management (and/or the President) being the last line of
       defence after PMCs have taken every reasonable step to resolve the
       issue.

       This does not need to be resolved this month.  It may be prudent to wait
       until the effort to better track issues provides more data.


       Fundraising
       ===========

       Not quite yet fully on my radar, and continues to be well on track to
       support our increased FY17 expenditures, but preliminary discussions
       have occurred with a focus on making sure that we plan for a future that
       may rely more heavily on paid support.

       The primary idea is to expand beyond the tech focused companies that
       dominate our platinum sponsors.  An example of a company that we want to
       attract is Capital One.  Longer lead times and lower individual company
       contributions than Platinum sponsors, but the thought is that once we
       get a toehold in an industry we can get others to follow.

       This will require more careful tracking and physically being at places
       where we don't normally show up, so some expenditures for support from
       Virtual and a travel budget to places like conferences is included in
       the draft budget.


       EA/TAC
       ======

       As this month's report again shows, much of the EA's time is still going
       to TAC related activities.  A fundamental rethinking of the role of the
       EA is overdue.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary continues to run smoothly.

       In November, 68 iclas, 4 cclas, and 9 grants were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       As previously agreed, my focus is to be on the areas of the foundation
       that are running well. For the most part, therefore, my reports are
       expected to be uneventful.

       That being said, I have not done a good job of as I might in staying
       abreast of the activities in these areas. Fortunately, we have full
       reports. 

       For infrastructure all open positions have now been backfilled and new
       hires are being onboarded. Exploring GitHub as a master continues to
       be a focus, along with finding ways to reduce the infrastructure costs
       per project. 

       For conferences the dates for ApacheCon North America
       2017 in Miami were released (May 15-19, 2017), at the Intercontinental
       Miami.

       Marketing proceeds as expected. Thank you to Sally and all
       contributors to the FY17 Q2 report which was published on 12/15
       (https://s.apache.org/oTOF). A new monthly blog series "Success at
       Apache" has also been launched to share success stories from the
       foundation. Sally is seeking content for this blog.

       TAC has reported final numbers and budget for ApacheCon EU (13
       recipients, budget $26,190.04). Two of the TAC recipients have been
       invited to join the TAC committee. This presents some complication in
       that only foundation members can participate in some aspects of TAC,
       specifically where private information is shared by applicants.
       However, there are many ways in which non-members can assist that do
       not require access to private information. The TAC report includes
       some details about how many recent TAC recipients go on to participate
       more deeply with one or more foundation project.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Role of Brand Management as it relates to PMCs.  Do we empower PMCs
       to do what is best for their communities, and let a thousand flowers
       bloom, even to the point where we allow actions that may limit our
       abilities to enforce our marks?  Or do we treat Brand as a core part of
       our unique Apache model for community, and require consistency in
       approach across all PMCs and third parties, even if it means denying
       use of marks to friendly third parties in ways that would benefit
       communities?

       Generalities:
         1) Is the Trademark Policy a policy or a set of best practices?
            https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/
         2) Are PMCs the wrong tool for trademark enforcement?

       Specifics:
         1) Can a PMC decide that it is OK for a third party to make use
            of an ASF Mark in their product name?
         2) Can a PMC decide that it is OK for the only attribution to the ASF
            for use of a mark to appear in a link in a small font at the
            bottom of a page?
         3) Can a PMC decide that it is Brand Management's job to contact
            a third party who is making use of the PMC's name; or even to
            decide that no contact is necessary?

    Brand Management Discussion

    Marvin: it’s a policy, but a bit too verbose; can use improvement,
    but brand owns it

    Mark: it’s a policy but can have exceptions; enforcement must be
    delegated to PMCs with advice from VP Brand.

    Can a PMC unilaterally decide policy on their own? No.

    Sam: if there is an exception to policy should PMCs have to get
    approval from VP Brand?

    Mark: if PMC wants to act outside the policy they need to work with
    VP Brand.

    Brett: likes consistency; there's a good example in the way the
    press PMC handles publicity policy

    Chris Mattman: in regard to specifics: yes, yes, yes, as long as
    decisions are documented on archived list

    the last decision on board was PMCs should take a more active role,
    so this looks like a change from best practice to policy

    Sam: this wasn’t a change; there has always been a policy

    Brett: PMCs should still be very involved but it is a policy; there
    should be minimal burden on PMCs but the policy gives them teeth
    against bad actors; think of it as not to be holding PMCs to rules,
    but helping them

    Chris Douglas: there was a recent dispute with VP Brand from the
    October report about Hadoop China conference; VP Brand was
    dissatisfied with how Hadoop is managing the brand

    there are still lots of people showing up to work on hadoop, so who
    is negatively affected the way we are managing? how is hadoop PMC
    failing the mission?

    trademark enforcement is not something that engineers will do well;
    the value of a particular brand is limited

    Jim: what I see is that the public perception is there is an elite
    group of vendors who can make use of Hadoop marks but others cannot,
    and this is not a defensible situation

    for marks to be valuable they have to be protected;

    we must remember we are a 501c3 and must abide by our charter. so,
    we can enforce a tight policy where all vendors are playing on level
    field (good) or we show favoritism to some vendors, or we could lose
    the brand (both of which would be a bad outcome)

    this is potentially a slippery slope so needs to be tightly
    controlled and defended

    Bertrand: the web page with Brand policy is IMO too detailed and
    impossible for us to accept as policy as a whole.

    my suggestion would be to replace that page with a minimal list of
    "atomic" numbered items that the board can review to decide which
    items are policy and which ones are best practices only

    Sam: would like at least General question 1 answered as soon as
    possible, preferably today unless more talk might change peoples'
    minds

    Brett: leaning toward deferring a vote on whether brand has a policy
    or not; should come to agreement and have a resolution to vote on
    next board meeting

    AI Sam: lead the discussion offline and prepare another resolution
    to vote on for next meeting

    B. Appointing an Assistant Treasurer

    Kevin McGrail had the position of Assistant Treasurer before taking
    a leave; now that he is back, by acclamation the board reappointed
    him to the position.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Jim: Discuss new committers discussion with PMC
          [ Clerezza 2016-08-17 ]
          Status: emailed

    * Marvin: give feedback to PMC regarding bringing on new committers
          [ Pig 2016-09-21 ]
          Status: Complete. There was a bit of a miscommunication in that among
                  the several people working on the Spark branch was at least
                  one person who already had committer rights. Another, whose
                  candidacy had been back-burnered, has now been added.

    * Shane: report back on resolving the hadoop trademark enforcement issues.
          [ Hadoop 2016-10-19 ]
          Status: See president's report for prerequisite questions.

    * Mark: pursue a report for Abdera; determine if the Attic is next
          [ Abdera 2016-11-16 ]
          Status:

    * Marvin: Follow up with possible termination of the project
          [ DeviceMap 2016-11-16 ]
          Status: Complete.

    * Shane: Follow up with PMC and legal regarding potential trademark issues
          with a vendor
          [ Spark 2016-11-16 ]
          Status:

    * Marvin: Discuss retirement with PMC: need to discuss on dev/user list
          [ Stratos 2016-11-16 ]
          Status: In progress. A discussion is underway on the Stratos dev list.
                  We'll probably receive a retirement resolution next month.

    * Bertrand: Work with the Incubator PMC to clarify / better document the
          [ Action Items 2016-11-16 ]

ATTACHMENTS:

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

As usual, this is the slow time of year. I’ve been working with Accounting to
obtain the actuals for ACEU (had to wait for the credit card statement to get
the currency conversion). All actuals are in, and we came in $4,809.96 under
budget (as seen in my VP TAC report).

The booth was very busy, as it always is! We had a prime location, and I was
able to convince the LF to let us keep the booth up an additional day (ASFers
like to use the booth as a common meeting area/mingling spot). Due to the lack
of sponsors in the “technology showcase”, the booths were scheduled only for
Tuesday and Wednesday – I hope this improves for Miami!?

The leftover swag was sent back with Sharan Foga for use at FOSDEM 2017.

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy/Healthy New Year to all!!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

Please see the president's report.  In particular, a clear ratification
by the board if the existing policy documents posted on the website are
correct or not.  While PMCs report to the board, my expectation is that
the brand policies are required policies by PMCs, and that the board
will take action to work with PMCs repeatedly refusing to follow them.
If there are specific policies that the board wishes to change to
guidelines, that would be fine.  If the board votes to change all brand
policies to be non-required, well... I'm not sure what other work there
would be for Brand Management to do.

  https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/

Also, please see the brand request in the President's submitted budget.

* OPERATIONS

trademarks@ requests and questions both internally and externally; and
discussions from PMCs and Members, continues to grow beyond the capacity
of the few regularly participating Brand Management Committee members to
respond to.  Our current volunteer pool and resources are insufficient
to continue to be able to provide sufficient services for projects
requesting help or registrations.

I do not have a current solution for this, so over the next quarter will
work with the President to look for improvements or additional proposals
to the board.

To address some of the questions from the many discussion threads about
brand processes and details of specific issues, I have published some
additional information for review by the board and any interested
Members or committers.

* REGISTRATIONS

The IMPALA registrations have been donated to the ASF.

Our HADOOP application in India has been published for opposition; this
is the last step before the registration will actually issue.

Our APACHE registration has finally issued in Brazil.

Several requests are still in process at various stages.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities continue normally.

After a few conversation with Tom Pappas and Virtual we agreed to request a
fundraising budget. There are a few more details in the President report.
Assuming the request gets approved the following months reports will provide
details about how the funds are spent.

As in previous years we created a Holidays greeting card and we are in the
process of sending them to all our sponsors. I expect this to be completed by
the time of the board meeting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget with no payments due at this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues work with
Fundraising, Brand Management, the Apache Incubator, and
Events/ApacheCon. She continues working with ASF President Sam Ruby on
various Operations-related issues, is preparing the ASF's Q2
Operations Summary, launched "Success at Apache" (a new monthly blog),
and has created a detailed call for a new logo for the Apache
Incubator which will be announced before the end of the year. In
addition, she met face-to-face with Tom Pappas and Shane Curcuru to
discuss the budget for the current fiscal year, future
planning/tactics across several operational activities, and strategies
to manage non-Sponsor level donations.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Finances
========
This past month has seen lots of activity in reviewing the FY17
"actuals" and projecting our overall FY17 expenditures, within the
Infrastructure section of the budget. These numbers have been
coordinated with the President and with Virtual, and are presented
elsewhere in the December Board agenda.

In short, Infrastructure is forecasting increases in staffing costs,
cloud services, and a small amount related to a once/year gathering of
the team at ApacheCon. On the other side, we're looking at lower
hardware costs as we transition from ASF-owned machines towards a more
flexible posture using virtual private servers in our cloud providers.


Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Get one or more projects launched on the Gitbox system
- Training of our new staffers, particularly towards VM migration
- LDAP changes to support podlings, and to integrate it within our
  supported services (eg. Sonar and Roller)


Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Move all services off ASF-owned hardware, including the difficult
  process of moving our email infrastructure
- Finish the use of puppet for all services, then explore to move
  towards upgrading to Puppet 4, and/or containers for ongoing service
  management


General Activity
================
- Finalizing the (emergency) move of the moin wiki
- Continued gitbox work (see separate section)
- Ongoing conversation and development plans for integrating podling
  management into LDAP (and other ASF tooling; particularly, gitbox)
- SonarQube puppetized, LDAP-enabled, and brought up. This was a big
  VM move, and will enable self-service of sonar jobs
- Continued work on puppetizing Roller (blogs.a.o) and moving that
  VM. Testing is now beginning.
- Continued puppet work and VM moves
- Beginning investigation of launching Fisheye services locally at the
  ASF to replace the third-party service run by Atlassian. Numerous
  projects use the service, but it will be shut down in early
  January. We're costing out a local replacement.
- The security-vm is in testing, with a new Jira instance. This Jira
  will be used (privately) for the Security Team and Brand Mgmt.


Uptime Statistics
=================
Uptime for this reporting cycle hit 99.9% overall, with critical
services staying at an impressive 100.0%. The usual culprits, Jenkins
and SonarQube were responsible for dragging down the overall score,
and are being replaced/updated to address this. The moin wiki, which has
been moved and cleaned up heavily has improved immensely, going from a
previous average of 94% uptime to a solid 100% uptime over the past few
months. This weekend (Dec 17-18) we were hit by an outage at NERO,
causing outages for the services hosted at OSUOSL. While the situation
has been resolved, this will reflect negatively on next month's SLA.

For more details, please visit: http://status.apache.org/sla/


Github as Master
================
The GitBox project is moving ahead as planned, and is generally
considered ready for testing with willing projects. We are in talks with
a specific project for the initial tests, and will discuss onboarding
more projects as this progresses. The services involved have been set up
and fully puppetized, and tests are showing good results here. While
this service depends on LDAP (and thus awaits the upcoming LDAP changes
for podlings), we have modified the system to work with a hardcoded list
of podling members, so we can test with podlings without having to wait
for the LDAP changes.

We have a list of things either to be done or that have been done, at:
https://pad.apache.org/p/gitbox - this outlines what we were thinking,
where we are, and what remains to be done before we can consider this
service production ready.

We invite everyone to visit https://gitbox.apache.org/ and have a look,
perhaps even try out the account linking service and provide feedback on
this.


'Costs per project' Project
===========================
As a long-term project, Infrastructure has been tasked with reducing
the "cost per project added into our systems." There has been some
work at the margins of our self-servce tools and processes, to reduce
the staff/volunteer time to provide service and to reduce resource
costs of these services (eg. locating services on more cost-effective
providers). However, we have not made any progress on computing
current per-project costs, projecting those costs, or planning
mitigation strategies.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Since our last meeting, I have been primarily focused on getting
the recordings from ApacheCon Seville posted to FeatherCast. In
this effort, I have been enormously assisted by Felix Schumacher
and Sharan Foga. I hope to get the remainder of these recordings
uploaded over my Christmas break.

The CFP for ApacheCon Miami is still running, and is scheduled to
close February 11. December is always a slow time for this, and
promotion of that event will start in earnest at the first of the
year. As always, if you have suggestions for keynotes, or can make
connections for sponsorship, please get in touch with me.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

ApacheCon Europe
----------------
* 13 TAC recipients
* $4,809.96 under budget ($31k budget; $26,190.04 spent)
* TACers did a great job with their responsibilities; we added audio recording
  back in this time due to lack of sponsorship for such – there were a couple
  of sessions that didn’t get recorded, but the majority of them did.
* Online (google) schedule for the purpose of tracking session hosts worked
  very well (thanks to Sergio for ensuring this was up-to-date at all times!),
  as did using the HipChat channel for real-time communications (great
  suggestion, Chris!).
* 2 TAC recipients have joined the TAC Team as a result of attending ACEU
* Post-conference surveys are being recorded in svn and will be posted on the
  website

Committee – New Members
---------
Sergio Fernández Issac Goldstand Darshan Kumar (ACEU2016 recipient)
Gaurav Saini (ACEU2016 recipient)

Miami (Provided by Nick last month) - I'm so happy to have Nick back!!
-----
To try to avoid the SPOF's that affected Seville, committee members have
been meeting to try to better document the process, and the pointers to
other documentation / steps / resources / storage locations etc. That work
so far is on the wiki at
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAC/Apache+Travel+Assistance+Process
Planning on what to do differently/better in future is also being captured there.

Stats (Provided by Nick last month)
-----
Of the people helped by TAC at Budapest and Vancouver, 3 have become
members since the conference they attended, 2 have joined PMCs and 2 have
become committers.

Overall, the figures are:
* People who weren't members at the conference, and now are: 23
* People who weren't committers at application, now are: 21
* People who weren't on PMCs at application, now are: 37
* People who now help with TAC: 4 (6 now with the addition of the new members
  after ACEU2016)
* People who have never been/become committers: 27
* Unique people helped by TAC: 131
* Total number of TAC awards: 153

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and a Happy/Healthy New Year to all!!

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

The team is still trying to followup on issues reported via security@
to projects that do not seem to have been dealt with.  While in many
cases this leads to action (or formally closing an issue), there are
still some without action which we will raise to the board in due
course.  We're hoping to find better automated methods of tracking and
reporting on these.

Stats for November 2016:

5 CVEs issued to projects (some may not be public yet).

Attachment B: Report from the Apache Allura Project  [Dave Brondsema]

## Description:

Apache Allura is an open source implementation of a software forge, a web site
that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, wiki pages,
blogs, and more for any number of individual projects.

## Issues:

- No issues needing board attention.

## Activity:

- 1.6.0 release is currently in process
- Regular development, including two-factor auth added
- PMC member attended ApacheCon EU and spoke about Allura with others there
- Interview article with Jaxenter published
https://jaxenter.com/apache-allura-more-than-just-for-software-129214.html

## Health report:

Development pace is still a bit slow, but moving along.  One newer contributor
is providing some merge requests.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 13 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Rohan Verma on Tue Jul 26 2016

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 13 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description:
Apache Any23 is a library, a web service and a command line tool that extracts
structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web documents.

## Issues:
there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Any23 is very quiet. Very very quiet. We have brought on one new PMC
member based upon a documentation contribution which is great. However
Any23 remains (as is always has) very quiet.

## Health report:
The health report reflects the above activity. We are actually waiting on
a critical dependency release which will enable us to stabalize out test
suite and push for a 1.2. release. Any23 is very quiet as always.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was William L. Anderson on Sun Aug 28 2016

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 14 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Bill Anderson at Tue Aug 30 2016

## Releases:

 - Last release was 1.1 on Mon Oct 27 2014

## Mailing list activity:

It would appear that without any release coming out of Any23 our
community is not growinf much... if anything it is possibly stagnating
and even diminishing. As PMC Chair I am optimistic that if we can
stabalize tests and release, then this outcome will change as we
typically announce out releases to the W3C and other Web-based forums.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

The threat of moving the project to the attic is ongoing but further
progress has been acheived in the form of promoting a GSoC student to be
a full committer on the project.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 15 PMC members on the project with the last changes
in December 2016:

Resignations:
 * Mat Booth (12th December 2016)

Additions:
 * Dammina Sahabandu (13th December 2016)

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

Community & Development
=======================

The relatively small numbers of PMC members who are able to contribute
necessary skills for the continuation of the project remains a concern
although it has been mitigated by the addition of Dammina to the PMC.
Dammina was already one of the most active contributors and so it is
hoped that his addition will help drive the project forward.

It was also sad to see the resignation of Mat Booth from the PMC but he
had not considered himself to be one of the active contributors for a
long time. His advice will of course be missed.

The details for these PMC changes will be updated shortly.

There has been a modest increase in the number of emails to the dev list
over the previous quarter. Much of this was driven by Dammina with
discussions of what might go into a new release, updates to Trac and new
ideas around potential changes to the standard icon provider for the
project. In addition there were some queries from users indicating a
few problems with installation documentation and multi-product use cases
that we could better support.

Activity on the user list is negligible.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Will Stevens]

## Description:
   Apache CloudStack (ACS) is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud
   orchestration platform.  ACS manages many types of hypervisors, storage
   and networking devices.

## Issues:
 - The outstanding JIRA issue [1] has been closed in favor of a different
   resolution.  Instead of moving `apache/cloudstack` to
   `apachecloudstack/cloudstack`, we will likely be participating in the Beta
   of the new Github As Master initiative which Apache is working on.  This
   will give us access to the Github features we are looking for without
   being an anomaly in what Apache is supporting.
 - We are working with the ASF Infra team to finally get access to the racked
   servers which were donated by Citrix to Apache CloudStack for testing.  It
   has been a slow process, but Greg is working with us to finally make these
   resources available to us.

## Activity:
 - ACS is continuing its focus on testing and release tooling.  Our release
   cadence has intentionally slowed in favor of improving test coverage and
   stability of the large number of different deployment scenarios.  The
   developers at ShapeBlue have built and open sourced a tool called Trillian
   which allows us to automate and more accurately test the ACS features in
   many different deployment scenarios.  We have been integrating this tool
   into our development workflow to better validate the impact of proposed
   pull requests and to verify the functionality.
 - We currently have 3 releases which are in the final RC process; 4.10.0,
   4.9.1 and 4.8.2.  Since we have slowed the release cycle a bit in order to
   improve the test coverage and deployment scenarios, these releases are
   quite large.
 - The intentional slowdown in the release cycle is not a reflection of
   inactivity, but instead, more focus on the quality of the releases for all
   the different deployment scenarios ACS is used in.  You will notice that
   the activity on the dev@ list has actually more than doubled since the
   previous quarter.
 - We continue to rely heavily on the features of Github for managing and
   and merging changes into our source tree.  The majority of our
   communication around the code is actually done inline in the proposed pull
   requests as well as in the comments of the pull requests.  We look forward
   to being able to use additional Github features such as `Status` and
   `Labels`, once the new Github As Master program is available, to improve
   our workflow even more.

## Health report:
   The ACS project is very healthy.  We have a lot of activity and recently
   we have been able to focus on some of the challenges facing a project of
   our complexity.  The slowing of the release cycle so we could focus on
   improving the testability and test automation will produce a better
   experience for our users.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java
components.

The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
Apache and without. Any ASF committer can commit to Apache Commons.

The last report was on September 13 2016.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues that requires the boards attention this quarter.

## Activity:
 - The project is active with 6 releases this reporting period.
 - We released one new component: Apache Commons RNG 1.0. Commons RNG
   provides implementations of pseudo-random numbers generators that are
   either faster or of higher quality (and sometimes both) than
   java.util.Random.
 - Commons RDF is making its way out of the incubator into Commons toward a
   1.0 release.

## Health report:
 - Most components in Commons are mature, but are still actively maintained
   (6 releases). The dev list is active. JIRA is active. Speed of responses
   to users is reasonable in most cases. We have 1 new PMC member, and
   Commons is still open to any Apache Committer.
 - Commons Math still feels stuck and now depends on Commons RNG in our
   repository. We are discussing how to evolve this component, which has
   caused some friction within our community, all of which can be seen on the
   developer's mailing list. There are several proposals for fostering new
   communities in place of the dwindling Commons Math one, but that those are
   in limbo because no consensus has been reached yet.

Unedited reporter data follows.

## PMC changes:

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description:

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The iOS platform had one minor and one patch release, and the Android
platform had a major and minor release,  while the Windows platform only had
one patch (bug fix) release.

The Android platform major release (6.0.0) includes full support for Android
7.0 Nougat (API 24) while Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) support was deprecated.

The iOS platform minor release (4.3.0) includes support for CocoaPods in
plugins, and also support for Xcode 8.

The Windows platform patch release (4.4.3) fixes some major issues with
application activation, splashscreen and VS project generation.

We also had one Tools (CLI 6.4.0 and supporting libraries) release that
deprecates node.js 0.x support (we will only support node.js 4.x and above
starting next year), and it also includes other new features to config.xml,
plus bug fixes.

There were two overall plugin releases this quarter. An overall plugin
release usually consists of all, if not most, of our 22 plugins.

## Health report:

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green. The
badges that are red are known issues of the CI environment that we are
tracking in various JIRA issues.

We are actively trying to improve our testing -- we are trying to automate
more manual tests, and streamlining tests across the board since the number
of active contributors has dropped off. The drop off (as discussed in the
last report) is due to a large number of active contributors from a major
vendor being moved off the Apache Cordova project.

We still have a huge backlog of Github Pull Request activity. At last
estimate we had less than 150 pull requests in total, across our 60+ git
repos. We are actively trying to prune the PRs by closing out stale issues or
issues that cannot merge cleanly. It is harder to do so since we do not have
write access to Github to close or label PRs, due to Github's limited repo
access granularity. We can only clean up PRs using specially constructed
empty commit messages as suggested by INFRA, but there is no facility to
label PRs for organization.

Our goal for plugins release is to have one per week as a cadence, and we
have failed to do so again this quarter. We are working on streamlining this
so it will be easier for release managers to package releases.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache cTAKES Project  [Pei J Chen]

## Description:

Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) is an
open-source natural language processing system for information extraction
from electronic medical record clinical free-text.

## Issues:

- The majority of the committee has been working very hard to push forward
  the next release since has been almost 2 years since the last release as
  pointed out in the last report.  There are volunteers and an RM already
  stepped forward and started the process. However, there is a small group
  which differs in opinion and prefers to delay/block the critical
  minor/patch release (https://s.apache.org/Q0iS).  Looking forward to a
  concensus soon.

## Activity:

- There was a successful cTAKES hackathon during AMIA's NLP Working Group
  earlier in Nov at Chicago, IL (https://s.apache.org/IVqy)
- There has been continued activity and contributions in new components in
  sandbox and improvements to current components (Clinical De identification,
  ctakes-wsd, ctakes-temporal, etc. )
- There is interest from new committers to improve the current codebase such
  as Java File Resource loading improvements, general code clean up, etc.
- Committee continues to work on the next release (see above notes).

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Curator Project  [Jordan Zimmerman]

## Description:

- The Apache Curator Java libraries make using Apache ZooKeeper much easier
  and more reliable.

## Issues:

- Curator participated in the "help wanted" project. To date, we've not
  gotten any real help. People don't even bother to subscribe to the mailing
  list. It appears they are just fishing to see if they can pad their CVs.
  So, this isn't a Curator "issue" per se, but I thought I'd take this
  opportunity to report about it.

## Activity:

- Curator activity is normal for this period
- We continue to produce releases, field questions, etc.
- We continue to track releases of Apache ZooKeeper and try to stay current
  with it

## Health report:

- Curator is a healthy, active project. We have consistent, quality input
  from the community and Curator usage continues to grow.
- I've learned that Facebook will be standardizing on Apache Curator as its
  primary ZooKeeper client - good news!
- Curator's health is intimately tied to Apache ZooKeeper and, from our
  perspective, Apache ZooKeeper is a very healthy project
- Curator could use 1 or 2 more active committers. A few individuals have
  been identified and, assuming they continue to contribute, votes can take
  place

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Falcon Project  [Srikanth Sundarrajan]

ABOUT
Falcon is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop
designed for data motion, coordination of data pipelines,
lifecycle management, and data discovery. Falcon enables end
consumers to quickly onboard their data and its associated
processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters.

ISSUES
There are no issues that require board's attention at this time.

STATUS
Work is currently underway in Falcon to support user space
extensions to easily extend various data management operations without
requiring changes to the core Falcon code. This, the project
team hopes will help encourage developers to contribute repetitive
and useful data processing & management functions for reuse.

Besides the team is also reviewing work relating to update of
Falcon entities with an effective time, essentially supporting use cases
where users can go back in time and reprocess data without submitting
newer processing entities.

Earlier, we had introduced feature in Falcon to visually monitor processing
backlog through a monitoring system.

The community of developers and their activity has come down compared
to the past, however core set of developers continue to make heavy
contributions to the project and help move forward. The project team
continues to be on the lookout for new committers to maintain sustainable
growth of software and usage.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES

- Apache Flex FalconJX 0.7.0 was released on 9/7/16. Voting underway for
  Apache Flex SDK 4.16.0.

- Apache Flex SDK 4.15.0 was released on 1/9/16.
- Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.2 was released on 11/16/15.
- Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
- Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
- Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
- Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was released on 6/23/15.

ACTIVITY

The past three months saw a significant increase in committer activity around
FlexJS.  FlexJS is the next generation of Flex that provides application
developers with a highly productive framework and tool chain for developing
web apps, mobile apps and desktop apps.  Traditional Flex applications
require Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes (or tools to pre-compile them to
Android/IOS).  FlexJS applications output HTML/JS/CSS and can even be used to
create Apache Cordova applications.

A few new names have appeared, but none are at the point of being
committer-candidates yet.  But two existing committers have jumped in, making
significant contributions to the UI toolkit by creating a library with a
Material Design look-and-feel.

COMMUNITY

- Greg Dove was added as a committer.
- No new PMC members this quarter either.
- Last PMC addition was Josh Tynjala on Wed Sep 16 2015. Flex has recently
  attracted committers that show up for 3 months and just as we are thinking
  they are ready for PMC nomination, they go quiet.  But I am encouraging one
  PMC member to nominate one recent committer so hopefully that will happen
  before the next report.
- Latest analytics include a little less than 1000 hits per day on the
  website during the work week (less on weekends).
- There were more than 14,000 installs of Apache Flex 4.15.0 since its
  release in January.
- Almost 115,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.  Tour De Flex
  is a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex applications.

TRADEMARKS
- A company is promoting a software product called Flex that appears to be
  related to themes/styles for website visuals. Despite several attempts to
  contact them, they have not responded. The ASF VP Trademarks sent them an
  email on 11/3/16.  I did not see a response and their website is still up.
  What is the next step?

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam (incubating),
Hadoop, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, Bahir, and others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The Flink community is heading towards the 1.2 release, which is the
    biggest release so far. The community decided to add backwards
    compatibility of "application state" from this release on (in addition
    to API compatibility since version 1.0.0).

    Releasing version 1.2 is also the blocker for merging a large feature
    branch on resource management that many contributors have worked on
    over the last months.

  - The community is also in the progress of releasing the bug fix release
    1.1.4.  This release is the result of a major effort with large
    production users to address robustness issues found in such
    installations.

  - There will be 'Flink Forward' conferences in San Francisco (April 2017)
    and Berlin (September 2017). The PMC will be in touch with the organizers
    to make sure the event is endorsed by the Flink community and respects
    the Apache trademark guidelines.

  - 'data Artisans' conducted a survey among Flink users and contributors,
    with the goal to share the results with the community.  The survey is
    currently being evaluated, results to be shared soon.

  - In the previous quarter, the Flink community started working together
    with the Apache Bahir community. The first connectors are now exclusively
    managed by the Bahir project, and not part of the Flink project any more.

  - Several community members have started to voice concerns that the Flink
    code base is getting very intensive to build and test. Individual
    discussions in these threads suggested to kick of a proper discussion
    after the 1.2 release is out.

COMMUNITY

There was no new PMC addition since the last report.
The latest PMC addition was July 2nd, 2015 (Maximilian Michels)

No new committers have been added since the last report.
The last committer addition was Tzu-Li (Gordon) Tai on August, 26th, 2016.

Flink currently has 24 committers and 16 PMC members.

RELEASES

The following releases were made since the last board report:

 → 1.1.3 was released on October, 12th, 2016

ACTIVITY ON JIRA / MAILING LISTS

Both user@f.a.o and dev@f.a.o lists are quite active, with mails getting
answered by a mix of committers and non-committers.

 - Gora has come off the back of a very productive summer. The
   proect has seen two new modules being committed however they
   have not been released. The next goal is for the PMC and
   Commiter base to push the 0.7 release.

## Health report:
 - A number of Gora modules are slightly behind, however what
   we support is stable. We had excellent representation... yet
   again at ApacheCon where one of our GSoC students clearly displayed
   how flexible as framework Gora truly is. JCache is  now supported over
   any Gora datastore implementation. A huge win for those that want and
   require object-to-datastore transactions.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 22 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Pierre Sutra on Mon Jun 13 2016

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

vmgump has been replaced with a new VM with most of the installation
being automated via Puppet.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

As indicated in the last report we've freed up the Linux VM named
vmgump so its host Eirene can get decommissioned. The new installation
vmgump-vm3 is based on a Puppet module for most of it, a few manual
steps remain as they require credentials we don't want to store in a
repository.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and
humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Achieving active development cadence
  2. Attracting new contributors
  3. Establishing presence (web, repo, activity)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Beginning work within the ASF has been slow (and rather
  confusing). Mailing list activity has improved, but still low
  volume. Development priorities are still being discussed. We do now
  have repositories for code and the website, but are blocked by needing
  access to them--the request as been made to the general@incubator
  list. However, we have successfully gotten Jira and Confluence setup
  for the project and have a promotional web page ready and waiting once
  access has been granted. Making the incubation process clearer (and
  ideally more automated) would have saved a lot of time and confusion.
  That said, our Champion (Daniel Gruno), has been most helpful in
  helping us navigate.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Discussions have begun on development priorities. Infrastructure
  helped us resolve some outstanding project setup needs (Jira,
  Confluence, and git for the web site and code). Once the site is
  online, we intend to promote the community more and make concrete
  plans out of the proposals made on the mailing list so far.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Same as above. Mostly discussion and infrastructure/access setup--some
  still in progress.

Date of last release:

  None.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  None since start of incubation.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

Drew Farris (shepherd):

  One mentor active on mailing lists and another's assistance is referenced
  in the board report. Annotator is still getting off the ground. Observed
  recent mailing list activity seeking to set a path forward for the project.

--------------------
AriaTosca

ARIA TOSCA project offers an easily consumable Software Development
Kit(SDK) and a Command Line Interface(CLI) to implement TOSCA(Topology
and Orchestration Specification of Cloud Applications) based solutions.

AriaTosca has been incubating since 2016-08-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community and enroll new committers.
  2. Have frequent Release cycles to be compliant with the Apache Way.
  3. Publish "How To Contribute" guide at ARIA-TOSCA Website.
  4. Update ARIA website acording to ASF guideline(Include release process
     for ARIA-TOSCA Project)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There's an INFRA jira we created over a month ago which has yet to be
  addressed - please see here INFRA-12733 - Ability to create a Sprint
  Board for AriaTosca WAITING FOR USER

  It is not entirely critical for the project's progress, but it could
  be helpful if we indeed get a sprint board and the other things
  requested in that issue.

  Update: the ticket is now in progress.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Open-O is in process for consuming the ARIA ASF package
  * Cloudfiy is in process for consuming the ARIA ASF package as well.
  * Need to work on building the community and accepting external
    contributions.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * TOSCA parser migrated into ASF
  * CI on Appveyor, Jenkins
  * Sphinx documentation added to the project
  * CLIs of workflow engine and parser coalesced
  * TOSCA CSAR packager added
  * APIs for workflows, operations
  * Workflow engine task retry support
  * Workflow engine execution cancel support

Date of last release:

  No Releases yet

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Project is still functioning with the initial set of committers.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John D. Ament:

    The podling is still getting its feet wet.  Discussions are starting to
    happen on the mailing lists rather than in physical offices which is good
    and will help to bring about a more diverse community.  I would also
    strongly encourage the podling to work with their mentors to get infra
    changes in to avoid confusion.

--------------------
Atlas

Apache Atlas is a scalable and extensible set of core foundational
governance services that enables enterprises to effectively and
efficiently meet their compliance requirements within Hadoop and allows
integration with the complete enterprise data ecosystem.

Atlas has been incubating since 2015-05-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Podling name search is pending.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No specific issues at this time to report.

How has the community developed since the last report?

     messages per month between September and November [1]
  3. People across various organizations are interested in exploring
     Atlas.  We have received comments and suggestions from people who
     are evaluating Atlas for their governance requirements [5]

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. We are working towards a 0.8-incubating release in the next couple
     of months.  This upcoming release would include major features like
     structured high level REST APIs, entity creation/updation from
     Atlas UI,DSL Search improvements, Atlas Hook support for Hive2,
     Knox SSO support for Atlas, addition of user defined and system
     attributes to entities

  2. An abstraction layer has been added to make Atlas agnostic to the
     underlying graph database version

  3. A total of 186 issues were reported between Sep 1st 2016 and Nov
     30th 2016.  122 issues have been resolved in the same time [2][3]

Date of last release:

  2016-07-09: 07-incubating [4]

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  1. The PPMC voted and elected 3 new members as committers to the

log4cxx2

Logging for C++. N.B. This is a reboot of the Log4cxx podling which
previously graduated.

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create a release
  2. Activate some community
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There was a discussion in the first quarter of the year to move the
  project to attic unless it is able to release in the next few
  months. No release happened since then.

  Currently it seems that there's only one official project member with
  commit access left and even though some contributor worked on fixing
  the release process, that project member was unable to invest the
  necessary time to create a release yet.

  For that reason, the left member decided to not even care anymore
  about a release and published this decision on the dev mailing list of
  the project.  While the member is still willing to provide some
  support and would regret a move of the project to attic, creating a
  release has no priority nor is seen as strictly necessary and will
  therefore most likely always prioritize lower than other tasks.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  3 support questions, no new project members. There was a lengthy
  discussion about switching to C++ standard smart pointers with
  possibly breaking the API, the influence of such an approach on a
  release etc. Some bugs have been created to coordinate that work.

  Robert Middleton started to move the project to smart pointers using
  boost or std::shared_ptr in a private GitHub repo. He's actually
  changing more code than the one left official project member.

  https://github.com/rm5248/log4cxx-testing/tree/smart_pointers

Date of last release:

  2008-04-03 was the last official, pre-incubation 0.10.0

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Ralph Goers:

    The Log4j PMC will need to have a discussion about the state of this
    project. Since Log4cxx2 was always intended to be a subproject of
    the Logging project moving it to the attic may or may not be the
    right move.  Instead, it might just become a "dormant" subproject.

--------------------
Mnemonic

Apache Mnemonic is an advanced hybrid memory storage oriented library,
we've proposed a non-volatile/durable Java object model and durable
computing service that bring several advantages to significantly improve
the performance of massive real-time data
processing/analytics. developers are able to use this library to design
their cache-less, SerDe-less and native-direct computing high
performance applications.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Apache releases: we have release version 0.3.0-incubating
  2. Improved dev. docker to facilitate development.
  3. provided information to potential customers e.g. bank user, other
     project's Apache committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our last report was in April. Since then

  * Two more developers are going to join our community.
  * We need to encourage more discussion on the dev list in the coming months

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Added durable native sorting service (n-dim linked data) with
    testcases
  * Removed the 3rd Maven repository and use Maven central repository
    only
  * DOM and DNCS could apply to volatile memory service except fixed k-v
    store
  * Added a bench workload to verify the benefits from DNCS with
    scripts, generator
  * Added a sys-vmem service that makes it possible to utilize system
    memory for DNCS in an unified way
  * Added a script to bundle signed portable artifacts for maven
    repository submitting
  * and other bugfixes, features, improvements

--------------------
MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark,
and Flink.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase the number of active committers
  2. Increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list
     activity

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There was one new developer who developed the new evaluation mode for
  MRQL that runs on top of Apache Storm. There were no new committers
  since our last report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A new evaluation mode for MRQL queries was developed based on Apache
  Storm (using the Trident API). MRQL can now process stream queries on
  a single stream using Storm, but will be soon be extended to support
  multiple streams.

Date of last release:

  2016-03-02

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Alan Cabrera:

    Not a huge amount of activity but at least there's a small consistent
    trickle.  I think that the fact that someone was interested in adding an
    Apache Storm adapter speaks somewhat to the viability of the project.

--------------------
Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos
together on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations
across both Hadoop and other applications running on the same physical
data center infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Expand user/contributor/committer community
  2. Gather more support from Hadoop and Mesos vendors
  3. Release new versions (0.3 in progress), with more enterprise features

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Alan Gates:

    I'm concerned about this podling.  The last commit was on August 15.
    Discounting broadcast and reminders, there have been no emails on
    the dev list since October, and there were only 3 that month.  I've
    sent email on the dev list asking if people are still actively
    involved.

  Flavio Junqueira:

    I second Alan's concern, there has been very little activity in the
    last period for this podling.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Alan Gates:

    Very low activity on this project over the last few months, with
    last commit showing as Sept 22 and very few commits since last
    March.  A big need here beyond activity is to grow the community.
    There is a one individual who made several contributions last
    spring; I sent an email to the mailing list asking if it made sense
    to invite him to become a committer.

  We released the v1.0 shortly after the last report, which include major
  changes in terms of the programming model and other aspects:

    + Tensor abstraction for supporting more machine learning models.
    + Device abstraction for running on different hardware devices,
      including CPU, (Nvidia/AMD) GPU and FPGA (to be tested in later
      versions).
    + Replace GNU autotool with cmake for compilation.
    + Support Mac OS.
    + Improve Python binding, including installation and programming
    + More deep learning models, including VGG and ResNet
    + Replace website building tool from maven to Sphinx and updated the
      documentations.
    + Integrate Travis-CI

  We also added python notebooks and windows support, and are working on
  the model zoo, python whl files and Docker images to make it easier
  for users to get started with SINGA.

  We are focusing on our niches, including distributed training at the
  system level and health-care models at the application level.

Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich
communication.  It can be used like email, chat, or a document.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Growing community
  2. Improving code base

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has several new/re-activated contributors and
  participants across different disciplines since last report.  The most
  significant developments for our community have come about since
  September.

  After an open community conference call on Sept 28th, a joint effort
  between Wave and SwellRT development was initiated. SwellRT API has
  been tried out by some members of the community and a branch
  containing the SwellRT code is now in the repository. Discussions are
  still taking place to determine the full extent of the integration as
  the projects share a common goal but have side plans as well.

  SwellRT is a fork of Wave resolving some complexity issues of the Wave
  code that have prevented community growth and adoption issues.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Some members of Wave community have tried SwellRT API and some common
  tasks have been performed, such as:

  - Cleaned up some obsolete dependencies.
  - New branch created on wave repo containing a mirror of SwellRT code.
  - Updated major dependencies and fixed minor bugs, some taken from
    SwellRT.

Date of last release:

  March 2016

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  February 2016

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Upayavira:

    SwellRT appears to be a useful addition to Wave - it was originally
    a fork of Wave that has been improved/simplified. The Wave community
    still needs to handle IP Clearance for the SwellRT codebase.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

Report from the Apache Jackrabbit committee [Michael Dürig]

## Description:
   The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
   implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
   (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content
   repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
   maintained.
   Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant
   hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
   Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the
   foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding
   content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not
   implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it
   is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All
   maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are
   continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

   Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of
   the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
   driven by dependencies from Oak.

   In reaction of the recent move of the JSON license to Category X
   the PMC removed usages of respective libraries from all versions of
   all products released within the Jackrabbit project. See See JCR-4068
   and OAK-5171.

## Health report:
   The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic
   on all mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective
   component / sub-project.
   Commit activity is moderate to high in preparation of new major
   release early next year.
   The oak-dev list is seeing a broad variety of topics being
   discussed.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description:

Apache Labs exists to incubate small and emerging projects from ASF
committers.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

There has been no activity of any kind in the past three months.

## Health report:

The project remains healthy but there was an ongoing lack of all activity
in Labs in the reporting period. This lack of activity does not imply a
lack of health, the PMC and committers include experienced and
active members and committers. I note from MT's comments on our last report
that "if the lack of activity continues for another reporting period or two
then the attic starts to look more likely." I would be interested to hear
other board members' opinions on attic vs status quo vs pivot, given that this
was a strategic initiative and is an outlier in its nature and purpose.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

## Description:

Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The latest release 16.11.01, published on November, is an important
   milestone for the project: apart from a large number of features,
   enhancements and fixes, the release changes the build system (from Ant to
   Gradle), improves the dependency management configuration, provides some
   tools to manage integration and extensions; the community has dedicated
   this important release to the memory of OFBiz Committer and ex PMC member
   Adrian Crum, who passed away on 1st January 2016 and his loss is strongly
   felt.
 - The release has also resolved two security vulnerabilities, CVE-2016-6800
   and CVE-2016-4462, that have been announced after the release, completing
   the security handling workflow; there are no outstanding security
   vulnerability reports at the moment.
 - Several new features, improvements and bug fixes have been contributed and
   integrated into the official code base.
 - Interesting discussions about possible framework and user interface
   refactoring are ongoing in the dev list.
 - ApacheCon EU 2016 @ Seville: the event was a success for the OFBiz project
   with 5 OFBiz presentations and a series of informal meetups.
 - The activity in the official blog and Twitter accounts is steady with a
   monthly blog post and frequent tweets.
 - The PMC is working at improving the workflow to manage and implement
   trademark protection (a special thanks to Shane who is providing great
   advices); in parallel, the PMC is addressing specific trademark
   violations with good results: please refer to [*] for details.
 - The PMC is defining a policy to govern and limit marketing messages
   operated by third parties on the OFBiz lists.

## Health report:

This month the OFBiz project is celebrating 10 years at ASF! And after
10 years the project is still in an healthy and active phase characterized

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description:
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.

## Olingo Status
Currently Olingo has no issues that would require board attention.
The 4.3.0 release was provided to the community on September 19th, 2016. The
next release is scheduled at the end of December. Considering that there are no
major new features which were developed with the new version a release is
unlikely.

There have been bug fixes in the Olingo V2 code line. But since no community
member asked for a new patch release we have not yet provided one.

Traffic on the mailing list and our JIRA has gone down compared to the last
report. Same goes for the number of contributions. This does not worry me as the
V2 and V4 core libraries are nearly feature complete. Once the new OData 4.01
specification is published at Oasis these numbers should grow again. All in all
I still think Olingo is a healthy Apache project. We don`t have as much traffic
as other projects but it is mostly constant.

In the last report I mentioned a large contribution from an individual to the
Olingo V4 code line. It was a JPA extension to the Olingo core libraries.
After discussing this contribution on the mailing list it was decided that it
will not be accepted. Main reason was the fact that some PMC members thought
that the new extension could not be handled with the current Olingo community
members. They felt that even if we gave the contributor committing rights the
main burden would be on this one committer. If he left the community there would
be no other that would take over. As a compromise the contributor was encouraged
to create a GitHub repository for the extension first. Once the code has reached
a certain maturity and attracted a larger number of committers they could
come back and contribute to Olingo again.
Initial discussion:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/olingo-dev/201609.mbox/%3CetPan.57e60779.412690d1.c4bd%40apache.org%3E
Follow up:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/olingo-dev/201610.mbox/%3C2266c519a9fd470c9a3343e0a07d9a76%40derote13de02.global.corp.sap%3E


Questions from last report:
idf: Do you have any guess as to why those people filing a JIRA
     issue tend to not come back?
OData as such is not a hype and does not have as much users as other open source
projects. So my personal guess is that once their specific issue has been
addressed they are satisfied. Thus they don`t have to contribute further and
leave. Most of the users that open multiple JIRA issues don`t attach patches.
Of course pointing the community towards issues with their code is also an
important part in a community. But it does not help speeding up the fixing
process.
Another reason is the complexity of the protocol. Many don`t want to dive into
protocol specifics but rather only use it with as much abstraction as possible
to not worry about the details. When providing a fix one must make sure to be
specification compliant which can make even simple fixes challenging.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Tom Barber]

DESCRIPTION

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

- Last release was 1.0 on Wed Jun 29 2016

We resolved 0 issues for this release.

We finally reached a point in the platform lifecycle which made sense to
release Apache OODT as 1.0. This was done both to signify the stability of
what we had but also allow us to prepare for major changes coming in the next
major release cycle to modernise the platform and extend what was already in
place.  These changes will be API breaking and as such we wanted to signify
this in the release versioning.

It was asked in last months meeting to keep the board updated with regards to
driving adoption. To this end this month we have switched our website from
Apache CMS to gitsubpub and Jekyll to ease the updating process. Along the
website has tried to reduce the science centric focus and add more business
use case type content. This will be an ongoing process as we get time to add
more content to aid potential users in understanding how OODT can help them.
Tom also gave an OODT related talk at Apachecon Europe that had decent
attendance and further feedback afterwards. Having spoken to a number of PMC
members we feel that reducing the size of the code base and integrating with
a number of the other ASF data projects will help bring people on board and
as such the roadmap for OODT 2.0 has this aim in mind.

COMMUNITY

Latest committers and PMC members:

- Radu Maonle(radumanole) on 11th Oct 2015 as committer and PMC member

Last committer and PMC member added on 6th October 2015.

Mailing list activity has been pretty much static in terms of period on
period volume and Jira has been quiet.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

HEALTH REPORT

The project activity is pretty quiet, but there are still on going efforts in
place to help drive wider adoption.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

Development on the project has been great since the last report. September and
especially November have seen very high contributions from a number
of our regular contributors. We've also seen occasional interest from external
contributors expressing interest in participating, but nothing has come from
that yet.

The project released v 1.1.0 late in July which provides a number of key
features required of the tool in addition to many quality-of-life
improvements. The team is currently discussing a 1.2.0 release and features /
improvements we would like to see make their way in first. We expect to see
a new release in the next reporting cycle.

Issues for the Board:
None

When was the last committer or PMC member elected:
- Omkar Reddy - 20 January 2016
- Ibrahim Jarif - 26 April 2016

When was the last release:
- 1.0.0 - 22 September 2015
- 1.1.0 - 27 July 2016

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Jörn Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference
resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced
text
processing services.

Development
------------------
The development team stayed active over the last three month
and the activity in commits increased slightly while working
on the next release.

Community
---------------
The community stayed active with the usual amount of traffic on the user
mailing list and contributed a couple of patches to fix bugs and
to improve our code.

Rodrigo Agerri was added to the PMC on Jul 09 2015

Anastasija Mensikova was added as a committer on Jul 20 2016.

Releases
------------
The last release OpenNLP 1.6.0 was released on Jul 09 2015.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specification which is defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0) and CDI-1.1
 and CDI-1.2 (MR) specifications (JSR-346).

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 Activity is ok.
 We started with a new subproject called Meecrowave. It is a mircroprofile
 server consisting of Tomcat9 + OpenWebBeans + CXF + Johnzon, all in 9MB.
 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openwebbeans/meecrowave/trunk/
 We decided to create an own subproject since we rely on other projects
 and thus we will see separate release cycles as from OWB core.

 We will also see a CDI-2.0 implementation effort soon as the spec
 (JSR-365, available under ALv2) is just about to get finished.

## Health report:
 Nothing special to report. We did not yet create separate tickets for
 Meecrowave as we did not yet have any release.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Description:
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
   features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
   Java platform.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at this time.

Activity:
   Activity has been way down this quarter (see stats below). The long-
   delayed next release did not happen this past quarter, but we are
   ready to do it when the chair can get some cycles.

Health report:
   The ongoing issue remains lack of activity on the project.  Active
   development was being done by myself, but my employment has changed
   technologies, and is no longer interested in Pivot, so it is hard to
   find the time to do much more. I will push through the 2.0.5 release
   in the next few months and we will see if that helps any.

   There are also many changes in "trunk" that could almost warrant
   a 2.1 release (but there is no "killer" feature yet), but that
   might produce an uptick as well.

   When I get time, I will try to reach out some more using any of
   the available means to try to stimulate some interest.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 4 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Niclas Hedhman on Wed Jan 13 2016

Committer base changes:
 - Currently 5 active (that is, not emeritus) committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months.
 - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago.

Releases:
 - Last release was 2.0.4 on Mon May 19 2014

Mailing list activity:
  As you can see from the following statistics there was virtually
  no activity this last quarter.

 - dev@pivot.apache.org:
    - 62 subscribers (no change)
    - 7 emails sent to list (23 in previous quarter)

 - user@pivot.apache.org:

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Short version of report:

 No releases, modest activity.  Some growth of the community,
 and a new PMC chair.

## Description:

 The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
 software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
 to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
 which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In
 addition, the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had
 a release since 2007.

## Issues:
- The board may be interested in the FOSSA security report,
  commissioned by the EU commission into Apache HTTPD core
  and extending into APR.  This was handled by Dirk van Gulik
  for the ASF.  Summary details in Dirk's email at
  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/apr-dev/201611.mbox/%3C9643AB52-078F-4779-B80C-9CE39A2121AF%40webweaving.org%3E
- No issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- Commit activity remains low.
- Mailing list activity remains low.
- The number of open issues on Bugzilla is stable.

## Health report:
- This is a mature project, and most of its development activity is
  driven by the needs of established users.
  In this quarter, a new apr_redis module has been introduced.
- There is little impetus to develop the software further to meet the
  needs of potential new users.
- Since a few patches have been languishing committed but unreleased
  for some time, we have identified a need for a new release and
  anticipate one within the next quarter.

## Personnel changes:

- Jeff Trawick having indicated his desire to step down from the role
  of PMC chair, Nick Kew has stepped into that role.
- Currently 67 committers and 40 PMC members.
- Christophe Jaillet was added to the PMC in October.
- Ivan Zhakov joined the team as committer in October.

## Releases:

- No releases in this quarter
- APR 1.5.2, released April 29, 2015
- APR-util 1.5.4, released September 22, 2014
- APR-iconv 1.2.1, released November 26, 2007

## Mailing list activity:

 Traffic has been predominantly of a routine nature.  The increase
 on last quarter is partially down to discussion of the new apr_redis.

- dev@apr.apache.org:
   - 349 subscribers (down -9 in the last 3 months):
   - 66 emails sent to list (43 in previous quarter)

- bugs@apr.apache.org:
   - 21 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):
   - 39 emails sent to list (62 in previous quarter)

## Bugzilla Statistics:

- 2 Bugzilla tickets created in the last 3 months
- 2 Bugzilla tickets resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Issues

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

## Activity

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

During the las period we have provided the users with new maintenance release
6.0.5 and new updates 5.6.2 and 6.1.3 from the development branches. We have
decided to transit the 5.5.x branch into EOL, as there is no more development
on this branch nor on the proper versions of the related projects. We have
also released 2 new OSGi bundle sets.

We have also released the last preview release of ServiceMix 7 (7.0.0.M3). We
plan to release the final version at the end of this year.

In the next period we plan to focus on ServiceMix 7, but we also expect to
provide the maintenance releases for ServiceMix 5 and 6, as long new
dependencies will be available.

## Health report

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA is on the same level like in the
last period.  We had some new contributions. We have lost a lot of our
momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being maintained in
related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to board for December 2016

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

The status of the project is basically unchanged from the last report, a
mature project that is not in rapid development. The users mailing list is
active with user level questions and responses from people with expertise in
SpamAssassin. Traffic on the developers mailing list is much quieter, showing
mostly the results of our automated processes and regular bug fix activity by
developers on our Bugzilla issues. Much of the ongoing developer level
activity is around the maintenance of the rule-generation facility that runs
as a service for the users of SpamAssassin.

Issues:

The problems with the mailing list mentioned last quarter seem to have been
successfully resolved by the banning of one person from the list. There are no
new issues to mention.

Releases:

Last quarter’s report stated the intention to produce a 3.4.2 release, as did
the previous quarter’s report. We still have not selected a release manager
and triggered the release process but have closed a number of our Bugzilla
issues that would go into a 3.4.2 release. It would be a good idea to get the
release process started in January.

Committer/PMC changes:

John Hardin (jhardin) joined the PMC two months ago.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description:
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Progress continues toward making a 1.1.0 release.
 - Migration of Clojure code to Java is nearing completion.
 - A significant amount of progress has been made on Storm's SQL
   interface that leverages Apache Calcite.
 - An effort is underway to implement an improved API for collecting
   and reporting system level and user-defined metricts.
 - An effort is underway to implement an Apache Beam runner on top of
   Storm.

## Health report:
 - Overall the project continues to be healthy and we are seeing new
   faces show up and contribute.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 32 PMC members.
 - Xin Wang was added to the PMC on Mon Nov 28 2016

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 33 committers.
 - Xin Wang was added as a committer on Tue Nov 29 2016

## Releases:

 - Last release was 0.10.2 on Mon Sep 12 2016

## Mailing list activity:

 - There has been a significant drop in the number of emails to the dev@
   list. This can be attributed to moving JIRA notifications to the issues@
   list and modifying GitHub integration (GitHub activity now posts to the
   JIRA work log instead of comments to reduce the number of duplicate
   emails).

 - dev@storm.apache.org:
    - 548 subscribers (up 6 in the last 3 months):
    - 1840 emails sent to list (4816 in previous quarter)

 - issues@storm.apache.org:
    - 12 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 626 emails sent to list (0 in previous quarter)

 - user@storm.apache.org:

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Isuru Udana]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

The last committer and PMC member was added in May 2016:
  Ravi Undupitiya (ravi)

We have completed most of the development work related to the 3.0 release.
Since we are doing a major revamp of the http protocol handling transport,
this release requires a significant amount of testing.
Several committers and no committers are working on testing the release
and hopefully we should be able to get the release out by end of the year.

Releases
========

There have been no new releases since the last report.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on
January, 2012.

Board Issues

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Mick Semb Wever]


## Description:

Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for Java
applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify the
development of user interfaces.

## Activity:

Apache Tiles remains a stable but low traffic project.

This quarter there was very little public activity. A couple of small
fixes. No releases were cut.

The majority of activity still happens on non-apache sites like the
StackExchange forums. StackExchange sees a few questions and answers
each day or two. Efforts to subscribe these posts back to the user
mailing list should be re-investigated.

## Health report:

There are currently two responsive PMC, other PMC help out with
votes when needed.  Everyone is aware of the how little momentum
the project has, but it does not feel abandoned by members, nor not
in use by the public.

## Issues

Further effort is still required to increase health to the project.
Previous board report received feedback on what such effort might be.
This can be from including the StackExchange traffic, following up
on some of the development ideas, to publicity and engagement with other
communities that have more momentum in the UI space.

## Memorial

On September 30th our previous chair Greg Reddin passed away.
A number of members stepped forward to contribute their praise and
condolences.  What was written up was shared with Greg's wife.

- Apache Tomcat Native 1.2.10 was released on Oct 05 2016
- Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.42 was released on Oct 05 2016

## Trademark:
Since our last report the Tomcat PMC dealt with the following trademark
issues:
- A minor issue with a github project that was renamed at our request
  from "Tomcat XXX" to "XXX for Tomcat".
- Some historical documentation for a product previously renamed from
  "Tomcat XXX" to "XXX for Tomcat" appeared in our regular search using
  the old name. The historical documentation was updated to use the
  correct form.
In both cases speedy resolution was aided by the fact that Tomcat PMC
members were involved in - or had close ties to - the projects
concerned.

The Tomcat PMC has decided not to pursue further a trademark issue outstanding
since 2008 since the project has been dormant for many years.

There are currently no outstanding trademark issues that the Tomcat PMC is
working on.

Detailed history is available at:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/tomcat/trademark-status.txt

## Security:
 - Detailed status:

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description:
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- Upon a review of our documentation, we realized that it needed notable
  improvement and thought it best to put a fair amount of work into it
  before getting our next release out. Work is in progress to improve it.
- There are a few coding issues that still need to be completed for the next
  release. We plan to focus on the documentation first, and finish up the
  coding work afterwards.

## Health report:
- Overall, the health of the project is fair. Activity and interest seem to
  be fairly flat. We're working on aspects such as improving documentation
  to attempt to make it easier for people to adopt the Apache VCL software
  and also to contribute to the project.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Report from the Apache Wicket project [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented server-side web
application framework.

A bit busy quarter, our dev@ traffic roughly doubled compared to our previous
quarter (to 426 messages sent). The increased traffic is mostly caused by our
actions pre and post ApacheCon and the JSON.org re-categorization.

Due to the re-categorization of the JSON.org library to category-X we had to
rework our code, while maintaining API compatibility for our releases that
follow semantic versioning. The next releases for 6.x, 7.x and 8.x will
feature the re-implementation courtesy of Ted Dunning.

ApacheCon EU 2016 in Sevilla featured 2 presentations by two committers
(Andrea del Bene and Martijn Dashorst). The turn up was a bit disappointing,
but having Andrea and Martijn meet in real life was good. Also the conference
enabled some cross project collaboration between Martijn and Directory
Fortress.

During ApacheCon Martijn and Andrea worked on the documentation of Wicket,
converting from the obsolete gdocs format to Asciidoctor. The 191 documents
and 10,000 line reference is converted using scripts crafted by high school
student Thijs Beltman in the summer of 2015. Documentation for 7.x and 8.x has
been converted, 6.x will follow soon.

## Noteworthy items:

- Currently 30/29 Committers/PMC members.
- Last committer/PMC addition was François Meillet on Mon Jun 29 2015
- Work on Wicket 8 is in progress, we released a milestone release (8.0-M2)
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Releases this quarter

We have issued the following releases: 8.0.0-M2, 7.5.0, 6.25.0 and 1.5.17.

## New committers/PMC members

We haven't seen many new contributors to the project, we will keep an eye out
for new folks to join, but we don't expect a huge influx given the state of
server-side Java web frameworks in general.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of REST
style web services. The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311)
standard. The project also introduces a client runtime which can leverage
certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink delivers component
technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Community:
The Wink project is a mature project with a small community which
is currently not very active. Although I believe Wink is a mature project with
active users. 

The probe to check how many active PMC members sent to the private PMC list
had response from two of the PMC members, with partial support for retirement.

https://s.apache.org/pmc-probe-2016

Based on this, I have started a discussion on 'what's next' with the larger
wink community:

https://s.apache.org/wink-whats-next

We have also started discussions on removing the dependency on json.org with a
member of the community volunteering to handle the work. After that is
completed the community will need to prepare a new release.

Releases:
* Last release was Apache Wink 1.4.0 which was released on September 15, 2013

Committers or PMC changes:
* Voted Gerhard Petracek was added as a Wink committer in August 2013.

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

# Xerces-J

There were only a few commits over the reporting period (to update
documentation of the XML Schema 1.1 tests).

A Xerces-J committer from long ago recently approached the PMC to
have their committer status reinstated. It seems this does not
require a new vote, but we are not sure of the next steps and
would appreciate advice on what to do here. This particular
individual was last active when the ASF was still using CVS and
does not have an SVN account.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 50+ posts on the j-dev
and j-users lists since the beginning of August 2016.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

# Xerces-C

A vote was recently completed to add a new committer. He has
already submitted his CLA and we plan to request a new account
for him once the vote result appears in the mailing list archives.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 80+ posts on the c-dev
and c-users lists since the beginning of August 2016.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-C 3.1.4 (June 29th, 2016).

# Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development
activity over the reporting period.

# XML Commons

No activity over the reporting period.

# Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in
February 2015 (Xerces-C) and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

No new PMC members since the last report. The most recent
addition to the PMC was in June 2016.

One committer has committed changes to SVN since August.

# Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Sean Busbey]

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and
release processes for software projects.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD'S ATTENTION

Last report we were asked if we had approached VP Legal about our
licensing issue (we had a contribution we had to ultimately reject
because of a hard dependency on a GPL project). We never did approach
VP Legal because the planned new component was not an internal build
tool to our project but something intended to be used by downstream
users of our project. While our most visible downstream users are
currently other ASF projects, our goal remains the wider public good
so the foundation rules around dependency licenses should apply
normally.

RELEASES

None since last report. Last release was version 0.3.0 on May 22nd 2016.

The community is currently working through a 0.4.0 release.

ACTIVITY

Ajay Yadava was added to the PMC during this period (Dec 1st).

Andrew Wang and Ajay Yadava were added as committers during this
period (Sep 20th).

The community had a noticeable plunge in both overall activity and
apparent reviewer bandwidth during this report period. This has been
most apparent in our protracted effort to complete the 0.4.0 release.
The PMC has previously discussed our need to accelerate
responsibilities for new contributors, but the topic needs to be
reviewed again.

Additionally, I'm looking to rotate the PMC chair but none of the
other PMC members have sufficient time to step in. I've agreed to try
to keep finding the time through our March report. I presume the lack
of folks who think they have the extra hour or two per quarter means
our community needs to get aggressive on PMC recruitment in addition
to our need to expand the committer list.

STATS

- Currently 8 PMC members
- Currently 10 committers
- dev list has 41 subscribers (flat from previous period)
- 17 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 7 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Zest Project  [Niclas Hedhman]

## Description:

Apache Zest is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented
Programming for domain centric application development.

## Issues:

It has come to the PMC's attention that Eclipse Zest is a well-established
subproject, within EMF/GEF/GMF ecosystem at Eclipse Foundation, and that
there is some conceptual overlap (both deal with explicit application
models). They also started way back in time, and the Zest PMC think that
although we could stick to the name, we think we should express some goodwill
towards Eclipse and change name. The sooner the better, especially since we
have no published releases under the Apache Zest namespace.

The new name "Apache Polygene" has been chosen, after quite a lot of
discussion back and forth and some dead ends. We have just started the
"unusual" process of project name change, and we are trying to capture the
work needed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEST-195, a fairly long
list of tasks (currently 18).

We don't need Board assistance on this issue.

## Activity:

Recruitment of new blood is continuing to be our weak spot. Re-positioning,
re-branding, better tutorials and lowering the bar to entry are items to be
worked on, inspired by other Apache projects, although I suspect too few
small projects check what other smaller ASF projects do right.

Zest is a small community, and this quarter was very typical, with good
progress towards the long overdue 3.0 release, which is all about making the
incompatible changes once and for all, both in namespaces as well as
leveraging Java 8 features in public APIs and discarding outdated ways for
that.

Zest is started participating in Oracle's outreach beta testing of Java 9 in
CI build, and we are currently reporting "yellow" but expect to go "green"
before 3.0 release.

## Health report:

Zest is small, but above the threshold for worry. Efforts are being worked on
to simplify adoption.  Mailing list activity remains moderate and JIRA issues
are being both created and worked on.  All active committers that are
willing, are on the PMC already.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Kent Sølvsten on Tue Sep 22 2015

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 18 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Georg Ragaller at Thu Jun 16 2016

## Releases:

 - Last release was JAVA-2.1 on Fri Jul 31 2015

## Mailing list activity:

Rich Bowen is taking up 100% of the traffic on the users@ list :-) with
announcements. Officially, the users@ list is non-active as all queries are
directed to the dev@ list. The dev@ activity this month was normal, although
the stats shows a substantial increase, but that is probably due to a larger
number of CI build reports, some related to Java 9 testing

 - users@zest.apache.org:
    - 19 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 2 emails sent to list (2 in previous quarter)

 - dev@zest.apache.org:

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Junqueira]

## Description:
Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It enables
distributed systems to implement a variety of primitives and mechanisms that
are critical for such systems to function, e.g., distributed locks, master
election, group membership, and configuration.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
The focus of the community has been to lift the alpha label of the 3.5 branch.
We have solved the main remaining issue (ZOOKEEPER-2014) and we are now getting
ready to release 3.5.3, which is supposed to be the last alpha release of the
3.5 branch.

The 3.5 branch has a number of important new features,
including reconfiguration, which has been the main culprit for the stabilization
of the branch.

We have additionally been preparing a new release of our stable branch, 3.4.10.
It will include bug fixes and one contribution that improves security for
server-to-server communication.

Both these releases are very close to coming out.

We have organized a meetup at the Facebook HQ back in November.

## Health report:
There has been a good amount of activity on all lists, new contributors, and new
features proposed. There are potentially new committers currently being discussed
on the private list.


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Chris Nauroth on Sun Aug 07 2016

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 19 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Chris Nauroth at Wed Sep 09 2015

## Releases:

 - Last release was 3.4.9 on Sat Sep 03 2016

## Mailing list activity:
 The activity on the dev list remained roughly constant while the activity of the
user list dropped. This is an artifact of questions now being asked on the dev list
mostly because they often involve more than just a clarification over the API. The
community has been favoring discussions on the dev list and slowly moving more
towards asking questions directly on that dev list. We don’t really make an effort
to have a clear separation between the two, although we suggest that API and use
case questions are better on the user list.


 - dev@zookeeper.apache.org:
    - 500 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months):
    - 3251 emails sent to list (3252 in previous quarter)

 - user@zookeeper.apache.org:
    - 1182 subscribers (up 6 in the last 3 months):
    - 186 emails sent to list (300 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:
The number of issues created has been greater than the number of issues resolved,
creating a backlog. We need more committer cycles to help with the backlog, and
we are working on inviting new committers.

 - 67 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 33 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months
