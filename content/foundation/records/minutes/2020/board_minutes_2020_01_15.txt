 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       The foundation continues to run financially conservatively and we
       foresee no significant issues.

       I have accepted a speaking engagement at the Huawei Developer
       Conference in Shenzhen in February.

    B. President [Sam]

       Finances again seem to be on track, with expenditures overall under
       budget and income now back on track and converging on plan. 
       Conferences is the lone area that is exceeding budget, but that was a
       known risk, shared with the board before it occurred, and amply
       covered by other underspending.

       All areas operating normally.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Operating Cash on December 31st, 2019 was $2,135.4K, which is up
       $400.4K from last month’s ending balance (Nov 19) of $1,735K.  Total
       Cash as of Dec 31st, 2019 is $3,529.3K (includes the Pineapple,
       Restricted Donation as well as the Tides Restricted Donations) as
       compared to $3,720.7K on December 31st, 2018, (a decrease of $191.4K
       year over year). The December 2019 ending Operating cash balance of
       $2,135.4K represents an Operating cash reserve of 9.3 months based on
       the “Estimated” FY20 Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $230.2K/month.  The ASF actual Operating reserve of 9.3 months at the
       end of December 2019 is a bit ahead the budgeted 8.1 months of reserve
       for YTD through December 2019.  The estimated YE Operating reserve of
       8.9 months is ahead of the Budgeted YE reserve of 7.6 months.  The ASF
       Operating reserve is above the ASAE standard average of 6 months of
       reserve for Non Profits.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is behind budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $117.3K ( with the timing of Sponsor
       payments the gap as of Nov 30th was closed by $351.8K), partly due to
       ACNA19 Registration income was behind but,  offset that to a degree, 
       by ANCA 19 Sponsorship exceeding the budget.  Public Donations are a
       bit behind due to a bit of timing however as of the December YTD
       close, Foundation sponsorship is ahead by $78.8K as the timing of
       payments has caught up( The open Accounts Receivable is very healthy
       at $701.5K, which as of the Dec 19 Fin Close is enough, if it comes in
       before 4.30.20, to achieve the FY20 Foundation Sponsorship Budget). As
       compared to FY19, FY20  YTD revenue is ahead by $249.3K primarily due
       to FY20 Events exceeding Revenue as compared to FY19, YTD.

       YTD expenses through December 31st, 2019 are under budget by $232.8K,
       spread across all depts except Conferences.  As noted in last month’s
       narrative the budgeted loss for ACNA19 was $55K and we were estimating
       it to be in the $110K-$120K loss range, once all expenses are in.  As
       noted in the November Narrative, the estimated loss for ACEU19 could
       be 107K Euros.  The goal is to have both ACNA19 and ACEU19 closed, as
       we close the ASF books for Jan 2020.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$260.9K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$376.4K> NI or $115.5K ahead of
       Budgeted NI for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  After being
       behind last month, with the timing of Sponsor payments we are back on
       track for FY20 as compared to budget.  The cash forecast has been
       updated, with the information we have at hand,  and at this point with
       about 4 months left in the Fiscal year, we are still on pace to meet
       our FY20 budgeted NI.  Again as I have done in previous months, I urge
       all dept heads to review their depts in the Cash forecast, for the
       last 4 months of the Fiscal year,  and let us know if there is
       anything that they are aware of that could change the estimates for
       the remaining four months of FY20.  This effort will make the Cash
       forecast a much more accurate management tool for the Foundation  
       With regard to FY19, we are ahead in revenue, by $249.3K as noted
       above, but we are also ahead on expenses by $770.2K (due to ACNA19 and
       the Lease web payment which should have taken place in FY19, but did
       not etc); thus, year over year NI for FY20 is behind FY19 by $520.9K. 
       It is estimated that this will even out, to a degree,  as the FY20
       progresses.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

As with prior months, we continue processing renewals smoothly through
business-as-usual activities. Of note, we've recently had a sponsor upgrade
from Bronze to Silver. Additionally, two Bronze sponsors will not be renewing:
one is no longer in business, and the other has chosen to not renew their
sponsorship. We continue pursuing overdue sponsorship fees as well as working
through email connectivity issues with a prospective Silver sponsor.

We are supporting sponsorship for ASF Conferences in 2020, comprising 3
Roadshows in North America and 1 in Europe, as well as ApacheCon North
America. All outstanding sponsor payments for 2019 ApacheCons are now closed,
with thanks to Virtual. Additionally, we had a great touchbase with EVP and
TAC (+M&P) in late December during our weekly Fundraising call that should
lead to improved awareness among our "departments".

We are delighted to share that the Individual and Corporate Giving campaign,
which launched on 27 November and ended on 31 December, grossed $14,240 over
112 individual donations and 3 corporate gifts. This reflects a 222% increase
over last 2018's yield. We are pleased that several past donors participated
again in this year’s campaign, and provided some heartening feedback. One
donor wrote: "Your expressions in your email is exactly why the global
community owes Apache full support. Years ago when I needed an office suite
and could not afford Microsoft Word, Apache was there for me. You make
computer literacy and online fluency possible for billions around the world.
Thank you for being there."

We have reached out to all Sponsors regarding their renewals, per their usual
sponsorship cycle. Our Ambassadors Ted Lieu, Bob Paulin, and Craig Russell
have been bringing forth new candidate Sponsors this year. Part of our program
is to actively engage with sponsors throughout the year to alert them of
upcoming events, activities, and opportunities, and are dovetailing with
Marketing & Publicity outreach in select instances as appropriate. Sponsor
reception has been positive --recent feedback includes: "Loving all the
sponsor / marketing / publicity activity. Professional, positive, crisp, and
awesome" and "thanks also for your support...you are very generous".


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — January 2020

I. Budget: we continue on budget as planned. A few vendor invoices arrived at
the end of the month and have been forwarded for payment processing.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising by securing ASF Sponsor renewals, pursuing outstanding sponsor
payments, and running the 2019 Individual and Corporate Giving campaign, which
grossed 222% more than 2018's donations. In addition, we promoted the 2020 ASF
Community Survey and Apache Roadshow/DC, and published the Q2 FY2020
Foundation Operations Summary (quarterly report) https://s.apache.org/2kv2n .
Three Platinum Sponsor profiles remain on hold due to Sponsor scheduling. The
ASF documentary, "Trillions and Trillions Served", is in post-production and
on schedule.

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the newswire
service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this timeframe.

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 7 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog.
4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 287 weekly summaries
published to date. We tweeted 52 items to 55.7K followers on Twitter, and
posted 45 items on LinkedIn that garnered more than 130.4K organic
impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are awaiting follow-up from their
respective Project Management Committees (PMCs). Projects planning to graduate
from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major project
milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?" highlights, and
"Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to two media queries. The ASF received 1,150
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,411. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 1,550 press hits vs. last month's 2,322. ApacheCon received 1
press hit.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received a request for a second briefing and have
responded to a small handful of fact-checking queries for an upcoming report.
Apache was mentioned in 2 reports by Gartner; 2 reports by Forrester; 6
reports by 451 Research; and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team continue work on tweaks to the
ApacheCon pages, as well as refining the Apache PLC4X theme, the ASF
Fundraising pages, and Apache project logo pages. We are in the process of
developing a new landing page for Central Services that will enable us to
standardize how we process requests and track progress. We anticipate securing
re-commitment from those volunteers who signed up to assist with editorial
services, but were unable to do so last year. We are developing the 2020
publishing schedule, which includes a new blog series that will launch
hopefully in January.

IX. Events liaison: we are supporting ComDev-coordinated events, as well as
some that have presentations by individual ASF Members, Apache PMCs and their
communities. They include third party events such as DevNexus, FOSDEM, and
Huawei Developer Conference 2020, ASF Conferences (Apache Roadshows and
ApacheCon), and a handful of project MeetUps in China.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: our press release and clipping services
will auto-renew through 2020 to ensure we have constant access without
interruption.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- Hired Andrew Wetmore as a part-time Technical Writer/Editor to
  review, refine, and manage the 20 year pile of organically-grown
  documentation on our websites and wiki.
- mod_mbox based archives (mail-private.a.o and mail-archives.a.o)
  have been officially deprecated, in favor of lists.a.o. An internal
  announcement was made, feedback has been received, and our current
  plan is to decommission those services in mid-to-late February. The
  larger email to committers@ will occur around January 20, 2020.

Finances
========
- The budget process will be starting within the next month or two.
  Infrastructure does not foresee any significant changes from prior
  years, nor the five-year forecast.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Complete the decommission of mod_mbox, which will require some list
  backfill at lists.a.o, and archive management on mbox-vm (our
  long-term, internal mbox storage system).
- Get our team meetup in Nashville, TN, USA planned. We are shooting
  for end of March, or early April.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Complete migration away from p3, especially for the nodes still
  using Ubuntu 14.04 (which saw its EOL in 2019).

General Activity
================
- An updated automated port-blocking system ("blocky3") has been
  rolled out, replacing blocky2. This system uses log-scanning to
  detect abuse, then blocks those clients. blocky3 introduces some
  scalability features, leading to better responsiveness.
- Assisted Sam with setting up his Loomio demonstration instance,
  currently residing on debate.a.o
- Per our Targeted Sponsorship from CloudBees, we have installed the
  Operation Center to closely manage Jenkins masters. Apache CouchDB
  was the first community to use this, and is finding it useful and
  productive. We have a couple new rollouts planned for the Apache
  Beam and Apache Hadoop projects, each of which has a set of build
  slaves assigned to those communities. It is presumed that the
  CloudBees install will allow us to better tune/allocate the nodes
  for those communities.
- Stabilized svn-master.a.o after its move to p6/18.04.
- Some minor mirror system improvements, to add https: support, along
  with some documentation for better support.

Uptime Statistics
=================
- Downtime occurred across many services on Friday, January 10th. The
  core issue was an automated update to libgnutls which invalidated a
  certficate chain on our LDAP servers. We had to create a new cert
  with a valid chain, load that onto our LDAP servers, and then
  propagate that cert to all LDAP clients (many), along with updating
  some Java certificate stores. The overall impact was minimal for
  "downstream" since authentication is not required for public access;
  the services needing authentication (eg. Jenkins) were up/down for
  various periods across a span of four hours.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

VP Conferences took most of December off, and so little progress was made on
ApacheCon North America. The CFP announcement should go out this week.

Other North American roadshows (Chicago, DC, Seattle) appear to be progressing
on schedule.

Meanwhile, planning for a EU roadshow has progressed considerably, led by
Julian Feinauer.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Current Events
==============

Fosdem 2020
-----------

Accommodation/Travel has been locked in for the attendees. Emails and
paperwork being processed on the tac-apply alias.

4 applicants were accepted from a total of 8 applicants.

Future events
=============

We need to start looking into updating the application form for the next
events coming up in March/April.

Mailing list Activity
=====================

Not much happening on the lists right now. There was one important email,
which was an action item given to V.P. TAC to summarise a cross-committee
conference call. There were no follow up replies about this email.

Membership
==========

No changes to the Committee this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

VP of Finance report.  With the Holidays not much to report though

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

Contributors Gris Cuevas Katia Rojas Georg Link

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:
None

## Activity:

*** Project:  Survey revamp***
- The 2020 ASF Community Survey was launched on Dec 05, 2019 according to it's
  launch plan [ 1 ]
- We are 86 responses away from our original goal of getting at least 700
  people fill the survey.
- We have had so far: 460 responses from unique links and 154 from the open
  link.
- The original survey close date was on January 4th, 2020. We left it open to
  continue receiving answers.
- We plan to do a last promotional push in two venues: at the ASF booth at
  FOSDEM and sending a general reminder to people subscribed to committers@

*Please, promote the survey in your project mailing lists using the message
 shared by Sally in the pmc@ and ppmc@ lists.*

You can find a template to promote the survey with the link to the public
version here [2]

*** Project: User Experience Research on new contributors ***
- We have reviewed preliminary answers from the survey to draft interview
  questions.
- The main focus for now is to write follow up questions to validate early
  hypothesis, main topics gravitate around type of contributions, demographic
  background specially spoken language, and challenges experienced by newer
  members.
- We need to find at least 20 people we can interview with the questions from
  this User Experience research. See the operations section below to see how
  we're planning to do this.


*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***
- Mentor's reviews have been submitted to Outreachy and are positive. Mentor's
  feedback is positive as well.
- We keep working in the training toolkit to help newcomers: Getting started
  at Apache [3]. We are discussing further actions.
- We keep working on the friction template [4]. We are discussing issues
  related to the scope.
- The next round has been opened, May-August 2020 [5].
- We submitted the community for participation [6].
- We are working with PR on the next call for mentors and projects (May 2020).
- We decided to move our weekly meeting to Mondays at 20H (UTC)

*** Operations ***
- Planning to send an email to committers@ with a reminder about taking the
  survey, email will be general and using the committers@ alias, haven't
  discussed this with Sally yet.
- Need to find 20 people to interview during the User Experience research,
  We're planning to send out a call for participation, also will coordinate w/
  Sally.
- Planning to send an email to members@ with an update on the EDI committee:
  what prompted its formation, our focus so far and long term goals, will
  coordinate w/ Sally.
- Planning to introduce Daniel Izquierdo from Bitergia to Myrle and Sharan who
  will be at the ASF booth in FOSDEM to coordinate an EDI office hours to
  answers questions/discuss the 2020 community survey.


## Health report:

The dev@ and diversity@ mailing lists continue to be slow, not too much
activity outside the work done for each ongoing project. The discussions have
been focused on topics that pertain to the projects we are running.
## Committee members changes:

None.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]


Progress: Work rekindled.

- Call for any interested members gone out to subscribe to privacy@; people
  moderated through.

- General approach mail gone out & slowly posting a list of around 20 example
  cases (most collected over the past 12 months).

- Speaking to pro-bono and specialist (but paid) legal folks to get the lay of
  the land (Delaware, but wanting to do this right in CA, EU and UK - despite
  conflicting rules).

- Dealing with one 'want to be forgotten' request; next step here is to get a
  private JIRA set up - or postpone & keep this in a president private SVN
  repo for now.

Problems: None yet

Plan: Go through a set of examples to derive what we value as a community and
then work top down again. Establish a private JIRA or similar. Establish a
private channel to operations. Figure out if some of our existing (iCLA filing
services) can be subverted to also handle the mechanical aspect of things and
what they need (beyond a runbook).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're down 3 (to 21),
unresolved issues this month.

I tried to contact VP Jakarta EE Relations (Mark Struberg) but failed to get a
response. I will be proposing that we start an official search for a
replacement on members@ (it also, unfortunately, means there has been no
progress with Eclipse foundation so far).

We had a good discussion about clarifying some of the patent implications
around Apache License v2 and ultimately decided to refrain from updating the
FAQ.

There was a discussion around updating the appendix of the canonical Apache
License v2 text with the guidelines around the text of the licensing itself
and how the use of "Apache License" brand needs to be respected if the text of
the license gets amended/updated. Ultimately the decision is to go with the
documentation update for now and let the canonical text of the license stay as
it is.

     In total, as of 6 January 2020, we're tracking 49 (last month:
     60) open issues across 26 projects, median age 116 (last month:
     119) days.  30 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     4 (last month: 7) of these issues, across 3 projects, are older
     than 365 days.

and customizable server-side processing. It is based on Google's BigTable
design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift.

## Issues:

The Oct report listed a discussion about a trademark issue at
http://www.accumulodata.com [1]. We are still waiting for the owner to repoint
to https://accumulo.apache.org.


## Membership Data:

Apache Accumulo was founded 2012-03-20 (8 years ago)
There are currently 36 committers and 36 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Holly Keebler on 2019-08-08.
- No new committers. Last addition was Holly Keebler on 2019-08-09.

## Project Activity:

- No new releases this quarter, although 1.10 is in discussion [2] and [3],
which is the 1.9 line with the minimum JDK moved to 1.8.  The 1.10 releases
will also be our first LTS release [4].
- The monthly "Hack Day" continues in Columbia MD. There was nothing of note
posted from the meetings in Oct[5] and Dec[6].  The Nov[7] meetup was
mirrored on the west coast and some issues labeling for 'good first issue' was
accomplished [8].

## Community Health:

- Activity in the community was lower this quarter than last, but 
consistent with prior quarters.  The uptick last quarter was most likely 
due the surge to release 2.0.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Christian Schneider]

## Description:
Apache Aries software is a set of pluggable Java components enabling an 
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Aries was founded 2010-12-15 (9 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 41 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carlos Sierra Andrés on 2018-07-03.
- No new committers. Last addition was Amichai Rothman on 2019-05-23.

## Project Activity:

We mainly worked on Aries Remote Service Admin, Aries CDI and 
Aries JAX-RS-Whiteboard. 

## Community Health:

Only a few of the many sub projects of Aries are active at the moment. 
There is some uptake on the dev list activity but it is mainly caused
by development work. 

Activity on user list is very low which is a bit concerning.

On the upside we have a few new people becoming active and will follow up when
to vote for them as committers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

The mission of Apache Arrow is the creation and maintenance of software
related to columnar in-memory processing and data interchange

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Arrow was founded 2016-01-19 (4 years ago) There are currently 50
committers and 28 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Micah Kornfield on 2019-08-21.
- Eric Erhardt was added as committer on 2019-10-18
- Joris Van den Bossche was added as committer on 2019-12-06

## Project Activity:

* We have completed our initial migration away from Travis CI for continuous
  integration and patch validation to use the new GitHub Actions (GHA)
  service. We are much happier with the compute resource allocation provided
  by GitHub but longer term we are concerned that the generous free allocation
  may not continue and would be interested to know what kinds of guarantees
  (if any) GitHub may make to the ASF regarding GHA.
* We are not out of the woods on CI/CD as there are features of Apache Arrow
  that we cannot test in GitHub Actions. We are still considering options for
  running these optional test workloads as well as other kinds of periodic
  workloads like benchmarking
* We hope to make a 1.0.0 release of the project in early 2020. We had thought
  that our next major release after 0.15.0 would be 1.0.0 but we have not yet
  completed some necessary work items that the community has agreed are
  essential to graduate to 1.0.0

Recent releases:
0.15.0 was released on 2019-10-05.
0.14.1 was released on 2019-07-21.
0.14.0 was released on 2019-07-04.

## Community Health:

The developer community is healthy and continues to grow.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Sean Busbey]

## Description:
Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

## Issues:
The project currently has no issues that require board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Avro was founded 2010-04-20 (10 years ago)
There are currently 33 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Nándor Kollár on 2019-08-29.
- Michael A. Smith was added as committer on 2019-10-18
- Ryan Skraba was added as committer on 2019-12-12

## Project Activity:
No new releases in the past quarter.

A user found an issue with our project signing for the 1.9.1
release and our KEYS file; the issue was corrected. (RM key was in a staged
KEYS instead of project KEYS)

Work has continued to update both build tools, language versions, and third
party dependencies. The need for both a new minor release and a new major
release has come up in a multiple discussions about getting these changes into
the hands of downstream users.

There has been no movement on the previously reported need to document and
update how the project versions releases.

## Numbers
For those who prefer metrics:

Mailing Lists:
 - dev@avro.apache.org had 837 emails (11% increase)
 - user@avro.apache.org had 79 emails (22% increase)

JIRA:
 - 81 issues opened (-24% decrease)
 - 71 issues closed (22% increase)

GitHub:
 - 81 PRs open (-2% decrease)
 - 73 PRs closed (1% increase)

Code Repository:
 - 73 commits in the past quarter (-49% decrease)
 - 18 code contributors in the past quarter (flat)

## Community Health:
Community health remains steady. We have a core set of contributors working to
keep the project going and are getting better at recognizing that work through
project responsibilities like committership. We still need to work to
establish a release cadence, probably indicating room to improve the work
required to steward release candidates.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

With the continuing lack of progress as noted, the chair has initiated
new discussions to either get some momentum behind the project or look at
migrating the project to the attic. The content of the email was more
biased towards continuing the project, mentioning ideas for the direction
of the project and trying to encourage the community to offer advice on
libraries and architectural decisions.

At the time of writing there has been one response from someone expressing
interest in involvement and noting some of the shortcomings around the
information available about the project. One reason for this is that the
project VM which hosts the issue tracker appears to be inaccessible. The
project may be able to hold off on requesting INFRA intervention on this in
the short term if we can come to a relatively quick initial decision
around whether to retire the project.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Stamatis Zampetakis]

## Description:
Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data not
residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Calcite was founded 2015-10-22 (4 years ago).
There are currently 45 committers and 22 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Danny Chen was added to the PMC on 2019-10-30.
- Haisheng Yuan was added to the PMC on 2019-11-11.
- Stamatis Zampetakis was appointed as PMC chair on 2019-12-18,
continuing the tradition of the project of rotating the chair every year.
- No new committers. Last addition was Mohamed Mohsen on 2019-09-17.

## Project Activity:
Calcite 1.21.0 was released in the middle of September, including more than
100 resolved issues and maintaining a release cadence of roughly one release
per quarter.

Calcite 1.22.0 is under preparation and is expected to be released inside
January while at the moment contains more than 230 commits and 150 resolved
issues.

Avatica 1.16.0 was released in the middle of December, including numerous bug
fixes and security improvements while the build system has been migrated from
maven to gradle.

The build and test infrastructure has been modernized for both Calcite and
Avatica, with the migration from maven to gradle, JUnit4 to JUnit5, and the
introduction of GitHub actions as part of the CI. The changes shall improve
developers experience, code quality, and protect better against regressions.

Members of the project participated in ApacheCon EU on October and Flink
Forward Asia on November, representing the community, and presenting talks
about Calcite.

Finally, the Hazelcast system has decided to adopt Calcite for query planning.

## Community Health:

Activity levels on mailing lists (37%), git (40%) and JIRA (opened 15%, closed
19%) have increased significantly in the last quarter. One reason is the
modernization of the build and test infrastructure for both Calcite and Avatica,
which triggered  many discussions and follow-up tasks. Another reason, is the
changes in the roster of the PMC and open discussions about the future of the
project. Last but not least, is the involvement of new people in the community
bringing up new challenges and ideas for improvements.

The rates of pull requests being closed and merged on Github has increased by
16%, as we work to clear our backlog. Nevertheless, the number of open pull
requests is still big since the number of committers who get involved in reviews
is rather small. Furthermore, there are pull requests which are stale,
work in progress, or proposals that make the numbers look even bigger. On the
positive side every pull request receives comments within a couple of days after
being submitted and there are many which get merged without too much effort
showing that the project attracts skilled developers who may turn into
committers quite soon.

another release so that users who need to be on Hadoop 2.8.2 and
later versions can keep working:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CRUNCH-692

## Community Health:
Quiet quarter, aside from the release vote and a bit of
traffic related to the upgrade.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache CXF was founded 2008-04-15 (12 years ago)
There are currently 43 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andy McCright on 2019-02-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexey Markevich on 2017-12-29.

## Project Activity:
Activity this quarter was mostly around bug fixes.   We did a few release, but
just "patch" releases that were targeting bugs found by users.  However, after
the 3.3.3 patch release in August, we did retarget master branch for more
forward looking changes such as Java 13+ updates, microprofile updates, etc...

Part of the ongoing work  is updating the code to use the new "Jakarta" specs
instead of the javax.* API's.  There were some queries about participating in
the Jakarta spec process which started some additional discussions around
trying to support both API's, who can participate, etc...

Apache CXF Fediz 1.4.6 was released on 2019-11-27.

We are working on a 3.3.4 patch release very shortly.  It was due in December,
but the holidays delayed a few things.

## Community Health:
For the most part, the project is making steady, but not stellar, progress.
Many of the protocols and specs that CXF implements are mature specs and don't
really change much (other than the above mentioned package change from
javax->jakarta).   Thus, steady progress and regular releases are a good
thing.   We are responding to bug reports and security issues and getting
patch releases out.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Tilmann Zäschke on 2019-02-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Laura Stewart on 2019-03-08.

## Project Activity:

There are no imminent releases. The JDO developers are working on 
updating the JDO web site to use asciidoctor markup and making 
updates to the typed query functionality. The Derby developers are
discussing a possible 10.15.2 release for late winter and are
addressing the complications of supporting Java 8, Java 9, and
Java 11.

## Community Health:

It was a quiet quarter for the Apache DB projects. There is a steady
flow of questions and discussions on the mailing lists, but not a lot
of new development activity, which is not surprising for these
mature projects.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Shawn McKinney]

## Description:
The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
- ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
         written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
         compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
         Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
- LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
         replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
         and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
         with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
         servers.
- Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
         used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
         designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
         application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
- Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
         role-based access control, delegated administration and
         password policy services with an LDAP backend.
- Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
         various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
         and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
         interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
         facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
         as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
         and mobile.
- Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
         (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.
- SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification.

## Issues:
The PMC is concerned that project activity is very low.  This is mostly due to
lack of contributors as the community is healthy except Fortress, Kerby and
Scimple where community involvement remains low. That is to say there is
important work that remains undone due to a low number of contributors.  One
problem is a change in job status of one prominent member (of ApacheDS).  He
has less time available to contribute.  We are having discussions about this
and will continue to monitor going forward.  The low community activity in
Fortress, Kerby and no activity (of any kind) in Scimple are a concern as
well.

## Membership Data:
Apache Directory was founded 2005-02-22 (15 years ago)
There are currently 58 committers and 19 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Radovan Semancik on 2018-09-28.
- No new committers. Last addition was Lothar Haeger on 2018-12-16.

## Project Activity:
Per sub-project:

- ApacheDS: low activity: A release was planned for last quarter but was
  delayed due to the work not getting completed.  The primary developer had a
  change is job status which hampered progress in this project.  Nevertheless,
  a release (again) planned for this quarter.  It is much needed and will
  include LDAP API 2.0.  One security issue, a timing issue, was reported to
  the PMC.  It was determined not to be a vulnerability.

- LDAP API: low activity. A GA release last November.

- Studio:   low activity but being maintained.  No new releases planned at
  this time.

- Fortress: low activity.  One release last December, included all of the
  enhancements and bug fixes from 2019.

- Kerby:    low activity: A release is being planned for this quarter.

- Mavibot:  decent activity: Work is being done implementing transaction
  support and improving the data structures.

- SCIMple:  no activity: For the third quarter in a row, this project has been
  dormant.  The project members have again been contacted asking for status. 
  The PMC is weighing options of waiting more or recommending a move to the
  attic.

## Community Health:
The concerns listed in issues above (low activity, community involvement,
availability) notwithstanding, activity has picked up a little bit during the
4Q 2019.  Releases in both the LDAP API and Fortress.  Overall the work being
done has increased as well.  With 234% increase in commits and 75% increase in
committers.  But, overall activity is still pretty low although the PMC is
diligent, fixes reported problems, helps users over the mailing list and
continues to plan new features and capabilities. The project is healthy and
actively being maintained. The are releases planned for 1Q for ApacheDS and
Kerby.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Druid Project  [Gian Merlino]

## Description

Apache Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database. It is
designed for workflows where low-latency query and ingest are the main
requirements. It implements ingestion, storage, and querying subsystems.
Users interface with Druid through built-in SQL and JSON APIs, as well
as third-party applications.

Druid has an extensive web of connections with other Apache projects:
Calcite for SQL planning, Curator and ZooKeeper for coordination, Kafka
and Hadoop as data sources, Avro or Parquet as supported data input
formats, and DataSketches for scalable approximate algorithms. Druid
can also be used as a data source by Superset.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

This is Druid's first report as a top-level project.

Since graduating, we have added 9 PMC members and 2 committers.

Community activity has been strong since graduation, with a constant flow
of mailing list posts, issues being filed, and pull requests. We make an
effort to respond to a high percentage of user questions to encourage
adoption. Most of these questions come in through GitHub issues, or our
user group mailing list, or the ASF Slack channel #druid (where we recently
passed the 500 member mark).

We are working towards our first post-graduation release, which is expected
to be Druid 0.17.0 and is expected to be released in the coming weeks. The
major initiatives in this release include an improved batch ingestion
interface, substantial new work on our built-in parallel batch ingestion
feature, performance improvements, and LDAP integration.

We believe in-person events are an important part of community development.
In December, there were Druid meetups in Bangalore and Denver. This upcoming
month, there are meetups planned in New Delhi, London, Athens, and Tel Aviv.
Additionally, a Druid Summit event is planned for April 13 - 15 in the San
Francisco Bay Area. It is being organized by a third party (Imply) in
coordination with the Druid PMC. The models we are using for this are
similar events like Kafka Summit, Spark + AI Summit, and Flink Forward.

## Recent PMC changes

 - Currently 27 PMC members.
 - Immediately after graduation, on Dec 20 2019, we added the following
   committers to the PMC: Benedict Jin, Clint Wylie, Dylan Wylie, Fokko
   Driesprong, Furkan Kamaci, Mingming Qiu, Niketh Sabbineni, Surekha
   Saharan, and Vadim Ogievetsky.

## Recent committer changes

 - Currently 34 committers.
 - New commmitters since graduation (Dec 20 2019):
    - Samarth Jain (Jan 2 2020)
    - Alexander Saydakov (Jan 7 2020)

## Recent releases

 - 0.16.1-incubating was released on Dec 10 2019

## Development activity by the numbers

In the last 3 months:

 - 196 pull requests opened
 - 190 pull requests merged/closed
 - 97 issues opened
 - 81 issues closed
 - 672 comments on pull requests
 - 648 comments on issues

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Dubbo Project  [Ian Luo]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Dubbo is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a high-performance, lightweight, java based RPC framework.

## Issues:

## Membership Data:
Apache Dubbo was founded 2019-05-15 (8 months ago)
There are currently 52 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:

- Scott Wang was added as committer on 2019-12-27
- Xiaodong Yang was added as committer on 2019-12-20

## Project Activity:
- Apache Dubbo Developer Day Chengdu was held on 2019-10-28
- Apache Dubbo Developer Day Hangzhou was held on 2019-12-28
- Dubbo 2.7.4, 2.7.4.1 and 2.7.5 are released.
- Dubbo go 1.1.0 and 1.2.0 are released.
- Dubbo js 3.0 is under release vote.

## Community Health:
In the past quarter, we did good job to continue to develop both new
committers and new PMC members, but at the same time, we saw traffic decrease
on both mailing list (-45% on @dev) and GitHub (roughly -30% on each metrics).
The traffic decrease on GitHub is expected since it means Dubbo 2.7 branch
gets more stable after 7 releases. 

Overall community health is good, but we should do better on mailing
list traffic.

- Joseph Koshakow was added as committer on 2019-11-07
- Mike Miller was added as committer on 2019-10-30

## Project Activity:
 * Worked on making Fluo and Muchos work with Java 11.  Had to bump next Fluo
   version to 2.0.0 because supporting Java 11 required dropping some
   deprecated APIs.
 * Parallelized some of Fluo's transaction failure handling code.
 * Updated Azure Log Analytics integration within Muchos. 
 * Refactored Muchos Configuration code to align with three cluster types
   (AWS, Azure, Existing) and improved configuration using decorators.  This
   change makes it easier to improve and maintain Muchos.
 * Updated Fluo's dependencies and docs about them.
 * Clarified what RTC means for Fluo on our website.

## Community Health:
Since the last report, there were 28 commits from 7 committers and 6
non-committers.  I need to review the total activity for the 6 non-committers
to see if any should be invited.  There were less commits this quarter than
last, but the total number of people contributing is about the same.

There was a lot more discussion on the dev list than the previous quarter.
There were discussions about new committers, technical issues, and the path to
being a committer.

We have not had a release in quite a while, we really need to get Fluo 2.0.0
released.  Hoping to see that happen in the current quarter.

2.1.7 was released on 2019-10-08.

There are lots of users still on branch-1.x, there were some discussions about
the release plan for branch-1.x.

About the versioning and 1.5.1 release
https://s.apache.org/krmcu

About the EOL of branch-1.3
https://s.apache.org/b2jac

We decided to use GitHub PR instead of Review Board officially, since Review
Board is only available to committers now.
https://s.apache.org/mkkld

We decided to cut branch-2.3 soon and EOL branch-2.1, Nick Dimiduk volunteered
to be the release manager of branch-2.3.
https://s.apache.org/bwr9g

We discussed the hadoop versions and release plan for 3.0.0, Sean Busbey
volunteered to be the release manager of 3.0.0 and start to make alpha
releases for 3.0.0.
https://s.apache.org/gih8e

## Community Health:
- Mailing list activity:
dev@hbase.apache.org:
990 subscribers(1015 in the previous quarter)
1157 emails sent to list(1297 in the previous quarter)

user@hbase.apache.org:
2121 subscribers(2150 in the previous quarter)

73 code contributors in the past quarter (-22% decrease)

- GitHub PR activity:
297 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-27% decrease)
267 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-36% decrease)

I think the number decreasing is partly because the long holiday in China in
October, and also the Chrismas holiday in some western countries in December.
And also, since branch-2 gets more and more stable, the number of bug fixes
will also be decreased day by day. We have already started to make the 3.0.0
release and bring more new features to the community.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for January 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here: 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/January2020

There are presently 46 podlings incubating. In December, podlings executed
9 distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members and no IPMC members 
retired. There was one requested IP clearance, but it has an outstanding 
issue.

We have one new podling this month NuttX; another is under discussion 
YuniKorn. The Druid project graduated last month. BatchEE exited the
incubator to become a subproject of Geronimo. At least one podling is
heading towards graduation in the next few months.

NuttX had a long useful discussion on it's entry into the incubator due to
a number of potential issues, all were discussed and sorted and the podling
has a good idea of what is expected to happen for it to graduate.

There was also discussion on YuniKorn name and if the ASF would get the
rights to that name. Cloudera's legal team have been involved.

New podlings are being asked to double check that they have permission to
use their name as it a lot of work for Infra to change podlings name.

Several podlings did not report and will be asked to report again next 
month; they include Annotator, Milagro, Myriad and Taverna. Myriad is
discussing retirement. I would guess this is due to the holiday season,
despite warning being given and asking podling to get the reports in early.
We also had a large number of reports that needed manual fixing this month,
podlings in question have been reminded on how to format their reports.

Warble is in hibernation and has not been asked to report again as there's
nothing to report. At some point Infra will need to decide what to do with
this project.

TubeMQ is still having trouble bootstrapping and some of its mentors seem
missing, I've asked for mentors to respond on it private list and asked
what is happening on the dev list to move them forward. TubeMQ did report
late but the report wasn't accurate and was rejected and resubmitted. 

The Incubator release area continued to be cleaned up.

The new branding/trademark question (added the podling report) has made
a number of podlings realise they were not paying attention to this and
has increased awareness of what is needed here. An open source site awarded 
several podlings awards but had several branding and trademark issues. 
These were quickly resolved.

## APISIX

APISIX is a cloud-native microservices API gateway, delivering the ultimate 
performance, security, open source and scalable platform for all your APIs 
and microservices.

APISIX is based on Nginx and etcd. Compared with traditional API gateways, 
APISIX has dynamic routing and plug-in hot loading, which is especially 
suitable for API management under micro-service system.

APISIX has been incubating since 2019-10-17.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. More Apache Releases and more committers act as release manager to 
  release a version.
  2. More committers and PPMC members.
  3. Branding issues in the documentation, code, website, etc.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  - We have some talks about the best practices of high-performance API 
  gateway on COSCon 2019, Dec 8th and OpenTalk, Dec 8th.
  - We have solved the Apache APISIX major brand issues in documentation, 
  code, website, etc.
  - We have 13 committers and 50 contributors (including 13 committers) 
  contributing to Apache APISIX.
  - Over 19 company users have announced that they are using APISIX and 
  more than 50% of them also submitted code or fixed the documentation for 
  APISIX 
  : https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/issues/487

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has been quite health, with more than 29 pull requests, 25 of 
  them have being merged in December. These pull requests are authored by a 
  diverse set of contributors. We also suggest and guide users from QQ 
  group to make issues at Apache APISIX mailing list, which is helpful for
  people who have the same issue and tracking bugs.

  This month's Pull Request is mainly divided into three aspects:
  - Fixing Apache APISIX bug.
  - Supporting more configuration items and optimizing the experience on 
  Apache APISIX Dashboard.
  - Supplement Apache APISIX function manual

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No issues.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  In the 4 months since the last report, 138 pull requests were merged for an 
  average of 34.5 per month. While this is down from the previous monthly 
  average of 49.6 per month for June through August, this contribution rate 
  is still very active and healthy. Contributions are coming from a regular 
  group of contributors outside of the initial set of committers, which is a 
  positive indication for adding new committers and PPMC members over the 
  next few months.

  The community released the first version of Apache Iceberg, 
  0.7.0-incubating. This release used the "standard" incubator disclaimer and 
  included convenience binaries. The release candidate votes were very active 
  with community members testing out the release and reporting problems.

  There was an Apache Iceberg talk at ApacheCon NA in September.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  - The community is building support for the upcoming Spark 3.0 release
  - The first PR from the vectorization branch has been merged into master
  - Support for IN and NOT IN predicates was contributed
  - Python added support for Hive metastore tables and the read path is 
  near commit
  - Flaky tests have been fixed
  - Baseline checks (style, errorprone, findbugs) are now applied to all 
  modules

## Livy

Livy is web service that exposes a REST interface for managing long running
Apache Spark contexts in your cluster. With Livy, new applications can be
built on top of Apache Spark that require fine grained interaction with many
Spark contexts.

Livy has been incubating since 2017-06-05.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Grow the community to get more reviews and content. 
     
  However, at this point, the community might want to consider that it 
  is a stable project that has met its initial functional goals. With 
  multiple public releases under its belt, it might be worth discussing a 
  time to graduate. A substantial increase in community activity in terms of 
  code contribution and related community growth might occur after a new set 
  of functionality/scope is identified for the project. But to date, the 
  existing community and code are following the Apache way.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## NuttX

NuttX is a mature, real-time embedded operating system (RTOS) with  
emphasis on standards compliance and small footprint.

NuttX has been incubating since 2019-12-09.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Clear any potential infringing use of the NuttX trademark
  2. Grow the community outside the old project and around Apache 
     infrastructure
  3. Make the first release under the Apache umbrella.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Even though the project is in its early incubation stages, its maturity  
  allowed us to elect 3 new members:  
  Ken and Masayuki are both long time contributors to NuttX. They were  
  interested in becoming Committers/PPMC members and supposed to be in the  
  initial committers list but missed the window by few hours (the voting 
  had  already started).  
  Brennan is also a long time contributor, and recently has put in some 
  crazy hours to convert our old DokuWiki to Confluence.  

  The project consists of two main repositories, _nuttx_ and _apps_.  
  These two repositories are hosted by Apache in  
  https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-nuttx.git  
  and https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-nuttx-apps.git  
  There are also 3 supporting repositories that have GPL licenses  
  and hence can't be released under the Apache license.  
  Nothing in these GPL repositories is ever delivered with NuttX releases.  
  There are only references in the documentation to aid in building and  
  installing the operating system.  
  It is unclear where these repositories should reside.  

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  The project used to have a google group where questions, patches and  
  technical issues were discussed.

  Now, three mailing lists are in place: _dev_, _commit_ and _private_.  
  _dev_ has 100 subscribers and is getting quite heavy traffic as the  
  community is debating the next steps of the project.  
  In the meantime, some contributors have already submitted a few patches  
  and PRs.

  However, as it was expected, user activity has dropped down a little  
  compared to the google group.  
  First, not all google group subscribers are subscribed to the _dev_  
  mailing list.  
  Additionally, moving to Apache required reviewing the previous workflow  
  and developing new requirements. This is currently the center of almost  
  all discussions in the mailing list.  
  Things are anticipated to settle down and get back to normal once  
  our new way of working is sorted out.  

  Regarding the project committee, it started with 12 members  
  (4 mentors and 8 initial committers).  
  Since incubation, 2 committers and 1 PPMC member have been added.  

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project is only in its early days of incubation.  
  The necessary resources are set up. The repositories have moved from  
  Bitbucket to GitHub/GitBox and the Wiki from DokuWiki to Confluence.  
  As noted above, the workflow requirements are still under development,  
  it is expected that the project will see more contributions once this  
  has been taken care of.  

  First version of the website is available in github.io  
  (https://apache-nuttx-website.github.io/).  It will be moved to Apache  
  servers.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  Mentors are helpful and responsive.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

 * Gregory Nutt registered the NuttX trademark in the US.
 * Some projects are distributing modified versions of NuttX under the  
   name NuttX. These issues need to be addressed before graduation.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: While off to a good start the podling has run into several
  issues, and seems to need a bit more focus before it has a functioning 
  PPMC.
  Some of these issues are due to ignoring mentors/incubator advice. I'd 
  suggest the project focus on more immediate needs rather than hypothetical
  issues that may or may not occur in the future.

  Flavio Junqueira: NuttX started incubation with an established community,
  and a good amount of the ramp-up effort has been spent on understanding
  the Apache environment and principles, moving the code base, and adapting
  or replacing existing processes. I’m happy with the community progress so
  far, and have no specific concern.

--------------------
## PonyMail

Pony Mail is a mail-archiving, archive viewing, and interaction service,
that can be integrated with many email platforms.

Pony Mail has been incubating since 2016-05-27.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Growing contributor base
  2. Getting release processes nailed to a tee
  3. Expanding unit tests

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No answer.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Not much progress although we did get a question on the user list which 
  was responded to quickly. Progress is slow paced as usual although any 
  reports of issues is dealt with in a timely manner.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  We have had a couple bug reports that have been worked on since the last 
  report.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  Dave Fisher: Given the movement to lists.apache.org planned by 
  Infrastructure does it make sense to graduate this podling a PMC like
  Whimsy? One that does not do releases?

--------------------
## StreamPipes

StreamPipes is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non- 
technical users to connect, analyze and explore (Industrial) IoT data 
streams.

StreamPipes has been incubating since 2019-11-11.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Finish license review of third-party dependencies
  2. Make a first Apache release
  3. Grow the community

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  There are no issues right now.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Although our priority in the last reporting period was on finishing the 
  initial setup, there are some notable things regarding community 
  development:
  - A few new people appeared on the mailing list expressing their interest 
  to contribute to StreamPipes
  - First pull requests from an external committer were merged
  - Many users appeared on the Slack channel or sent emails and asked 
  questions around the installation/usage of StreamPipes, we hope that some 
  of them will consider to contribute in the future
  - We met people from two companies and talked about the possibility to 
  contribute to StreamPipes
  - The number of Twitter followers has increased (currently at 94)
  - The number of Github stars has increased (currently at 102)

  Community development will be the focus of the next reporting period.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  We finished the initial setup:
  * The website is now online at streampipes.apache.org, and we added pages 
  that explain how to participate in the project
  * All Git repos were transferred to the ASF
  * Setup of several CI/CD pipelines based on Github Actions to build the 
  website and code
  * Setup of a CI/CD pipeline in the ASF Jenkins to publish snapshots to 
  the ASF Nexus
  * Finished setup of Jira and migrated old issues from the previous Gitlab 
  to Jira
  * Finished setup of the StreamPipes Confluence space and moved existing 
  content to Confluence
  * Currently, we are finishing a license review to properly create LICENSE 
  and NOTICE files
  * Having completed the initial setup, we are now shifting the focus back 
  to feature development

  In the next month, we plan to work towards the first Apache release and 
  also intensify work on community development.

## TubeMQ

TubeMQ is a distributed messaging queue (MQ) system.

TubeMQ has been incubating since 2019-11-03.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Bootstrap the Apache project and migrate repos to Apache.
  2. Grow the community to involve more contributors and increase the 
  diversity.
  3. Polish the code and document to satisfy the Apache way.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Needs mentors and IPMCs to help to bootstrap the project and follow the 
Apache way to grow the community.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Currently the project is still on migrating, because of the migrating 
  gap, there's 60+ GH issues and 80+ GH PRs submitted, 
  and over 25 contributors on this project, but this was not happened in 
  Apache JIRA/repo, we will migrate them soon. 
  Also We hosted 3 meetups to promote this project.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Towards migrating to Apache incubator, like building home pages, launch 
  first Apache release.

     I would be happy to help.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Junping Du: The project get bootstrap a bit late due to misunderstanding 
  on Champion role of the project. The email list and JIRA are setup just 
  recently, so contributors and committers are still learning how to 
  communicate through JIRA and dev alias - it takes time but things are 
  getting better.  
  Justin Mclean: Your mentors can't help if you don't communicate on the 
  dev list. Your number one aim should be to move communication on list and 
  work with your mentors in the open to complete the bootstrap process. This 
  is the PPMC responsibility not just the mentors or the IPMC as mentioned in 
  the issues. Several mentors and IPMC requests have gone unanswered, please 
  make sure these are responded to.
  Dave Fisher: It is important that PPMC Members drive the move with the 
  help of active Mentors. I feel that Junping is in a dual role but is less 
  experienced. Justin and JBO are the experienced mentors that will need to 
  step in with the guidance. Two months in including the year end holidays 
  the podling is actually doing OK.

## TVM

TVM is a full stack open deep learning compiler stack for CPUs, GPUs, and
specialized accelerators. It aims to close the gap between the productivity-
focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- or efficiency-
oriented hardware backends.

TVM has been incubating since 2019-03-06.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Keep growing the community
  2. Make a few more Apache releases
  3. Improve documentations

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  no

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  TVM community has welcomed two new committers/PPMC members since last 
  report. 
  There are also two on-going new committer nomination that will close in a 
  week.
  The community hosted many meetups and an annual developer conference with 
  more than 200+ attendees.
  These contents are made publically available as per apache way.

  This has been a great year for us doing the Apache way and grow the 
  community. 
  The community has grown 70% in terms of number of contributors and 
  committers,
  while these statistics do not necessarily indicate success, they suggest 
  we are on the right track.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We made our first Apache release. Thanks to the help of IPMC members, in 
  particular Justin, we were able to
  hold the Apache standard and release without using the WIP disclaimer

  A lot of improvements have been made. Including TensorCore support, 
  embedded system support and performance improvements

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

## Description:
The mission of Isis is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Isis was founded 2012-10-17 (7 years ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johan Doornenbal on 2018-04-05.
- No new committers. Last addition was Johan Doornenbal on 2018-03-19.

## Project Activity:
There continues to be substantial development work on v2.0, with the framework
being "re-platformed" to run on top of Spring Boot and separating the
framework's core concerns from those that are considered extensions, examples
or testing infrastructure. We have been adding additional (higher level) tests
to verify that the core functionalities do actually work, finding and fixing
several issues in the process.

We are performing a significant update of our website which for the first time
now also has automated content creation in order to keep some documented
examples in sync with the source code. The goal is to keep maintenance work of
the ascii-doc sources as low as possible.

We have implemented a Continuous Integration pipeline utilizing github, with
daily runs building the java packages as well as the website. In addition we
integrated with sonarcloud.io for automated code quality analysis.



- Last release was 2.0.0-M2 on Tue Jan 22 2019

## Community Health:
This is a mature project. The framework is generally stable with some
activity taking place for the version 2.0 release.

In order to gain better traction with our user community, we have 
resurrected our #apache-isis channel on the ASF slack workspace. We have 
informed users and developers on the users@ and dev@ mailing lists and
are making use of a self-signon for users without an @apache.org email
address. 

The Slack channel is intended for rapid communication between the active
developers (and our users). We repeated in the mailing list announcements
that issues will still be discussed and voted on in the mailing lists.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud-agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

jclouds continues to squash bugs but little feature work.

As commented in the previous report, we are still aiming to support newer Java
versions. The availability of the current PMC member is low and we're looking
for champions to modernize the project dependencies, but we have not seen
interest beyond some few comments in the JIRA issues. At this point, it is
unlikely that we'll find someone in the community willing to take this effort.

== Community ==

There have been small contributions from the community and bugfix reports as
in previous quarters.

THe concern around the amount of time being dedicated to the project is still
there, since most of the PMC and committers are now "pure" volunteers (with
$dayjob no longer related to jclouds). Another concern keeps being the lack of
traction, requests, and general interest from the community itself.

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Find a champion that helps us upgrade the core dependencies that pin us to old
Java versions. Keep engaging contributors on Slack, and propose them as new
committers as appropriate. Monitor the PMC and ensure we have enough resources
to properly manage the project.

== Releases ==

The last major jclouds release, 2.2.0, took place on 2019-10-21.
The last bugfix release, 2.1.3, took place on 2019-10-21.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:
The mission of Jena is the creation and maintenance of software related to Java 
framework for building Semantic Web applications

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Jena was founded 2012-04-18 (8 years ago)
There are currently 18 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:7.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Aaron Coburn on 2019-01-22.
- No new committers. Last addition was Greg Albiston on 2019-07-08.

## Project Activity:
Jena 3.13.1 was released on 2019-10-11.

The project operates aspires to a releases every 3-4 months and is now
discussing the 3.14.0 this month, subject to PMC availability.

The 3.14.0 has several contributions from new people, outside the main
committers.

The project is also discussing reorganising its mailing lists to reduce the
volume on dev@ by moving github traffic to a separate list. The hope is that
with less low-level emails and pull request specific emails, it will encourage
discussion on the longer term direction of Jena.

## Community Health:

Activity on the users@ and dev@ lists is about normal. The new people
contributing pull request is encouraging and hopefully some these people will
remain going forward.

We expect a drop in dev@ email when the github traffic is directed to another
list.

email:
dev@jena.apache.org same level: (566 compared to 562)
users@jena.apache.org same label (291 emails compared to 292)

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez]

## Description:
The mission of JSPWiki is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Leading open source WikiWiki engine, feature-rich and built around standard 
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

- No new committers. Last addition was Dave Koelmeyer on 2016-04-06.

## Project Activity:
This quarter we released 2.11.0.M6, which was mostly dev-oriented. It also
contained one pull request from a contributor. Current development right now
is also focused in a big refactor of one of the core JSPWiki classes
(JSPWIKI-120). Current pace of development continues to be slow, as JSPWiki
 keeps being worked on free time.

## Community Health:
This quarter has been a very quiet one, which shows up in the traffic decrease
on both mailing lists. This could be in part explained because development
itself has seen less movement this month, but having quarters with less
traffic is not that unsual.

Questions on MLs get answers and we have enough people to cut releases, so
projects remains with enough oversight.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Zhang Yifan was added to the PMC on 2020-01-07
- Zhang Yifan was added as committer on 2020-01-07

## Project Activity:
We found a licensing issue in a transitive dependency that has been present
since Kudu 1.10.0. The memkind library was added as a dependency to this
version. This depends on libnuma which is licensed under LGPL. We released
1.11.0 before noticing the issue and then released both 1.10.1 and 1.11.1 to
address the issue. Details on this can be found in the release notes and in
KUDU-2990.

Recent releases:
- 1.10.1 was released on 2019-11-20.
- 1.11.1 was released on 2019-11-20.
- 1.10.0 was released on 2019-11-01.

## Community Health:
- Traffic to the dev mailing list is up by 190% which can be attributed to the 3
  releases and several other larger topics we discussed on the list. User list
  traffic is down 30%.
- Website traffic is slightly down, by 7% both by number of unique users and
  visits.
- Developer activity is up by every metric we track, except for open JIRAs (down
  15%): reviews +40%, issues closed +16%, commits +80%.
- Code was authored by 23 contributors (down 4% since last quarter), 6 of
  which are new to the project.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

## Description:
The mission of Maven is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Java project management and comprehension tools

## Issues:
"There are no issues requiring board attention."

## Membership Data:
Apache Maven was founded 2003-03-01 (17 years ago)
There are currently 61 committers and 24 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Mark Struberg was added to the PMC on 2019-12-27
- Elliotte Rusty Harold was added as committer on 2019-12-12

## Project Activity:

There has been a regression release of Apache Maven (3.6.3). This was required
because we want focus on Maven 3.7.0, this way we expect to avoid other 3.6.x
releases that require cherry picking from commits. One important new feature
worth mentioning is the support for reproducible builds: Maven 3.6.3 build is
reproducible, you can rebuild from source and get a per-byte exact same binary
result, so it can always be verified against the checksum from reference
release build.

Maven 3.7.0 is expected to be an impressive release, with some new features
that should clear the path for Maven 4 and 5, requiring a lot of work. Because
Robert wants to get more time to work on code, it made sense to offer to
rotate the PMC chair, after 2 years of good service from him. In the end there
were 2 nominated, only one has accepted the nomination. The vote result was
unanimous +1 for Robert Scholte, so nothing will change. One might wonder if
this is a good sign. It is a compliment for Robert, but rotating the chair
helps to share the work and attention on the project. Now most eyes are on
Robert.

We received a message about a security vulnerability, but it was a false
alarm.

Finally, we're reaching the final stage of the process of code donation of the
Maven Wrapper to the Apache Maven project. We expect it to be part of Maven
3.7.0, as requested often by the community.

## Description:
Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order
to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis.  Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Metron was founded 2017-04-18 (3 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Justin Leet on 2017-12-03.
- No new committers. Last addition was Shane Ardell on 2018-11-16.

## Project Activity:
The community is working towards a 0.7.2 release in the first quarter of 2020.
This release is a bugfix release, so no major features are going to be
included.

We also released a bugfix version of our bro (a popular open source intrusion
detection system) plugin in October.  This plugin allows bro to write events
to kafka (and consequently process them in Metron).

## Community Health:

Community health is mixed.  We are seeing an up-tick in user@ mailing list
discussion (~50% incrase as compared to the last quarter).

At the same time, we are seeing decreased activity in both the
last month as well as compared to the last quarter.  Specifically:
* 40% drop in traffic on the dev list
* Perhaps most worrying, a 43% drop in commits as compared to last quarter.

I expect some of this is due to the holidays, but it's worth keeping a closer
eye on.  I am going to bring this up on the lists.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
The mission of NiFi is the creation and maintenance of software related to
providing an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
distribute data.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
Java and C++ implementations.

Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
MiNiFi.

Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
NiFi classloader isolation model.

Apache NiFi Flow Design System is a theme-able set of high quality UI
components and utilities for use across the various Apache NiFi web
applications in order to provide a more consistent user experience.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache NiFi was founded 2015-07-14 (4 years ago)
There are currently 47 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Peter Wicks on 2019-05-29.
- Dániel Bakai was added as committer on 2019-10-19
- Kotaro Terada was added as committer on 2019-10-19
- Peter Turcsanyi was added as committer on 2019-10-25

## Project Activity:
We are nearing release of Apache NiFi Registry 1.0.0.  The release includes
support for common HTTP security headers, running on Java 11, updated to
Ranger 2.0, and more.

Released Apache NiFi 1.10.0.  This brings powerful features such as sourcing
extensions from the latest NiFi Registry at runtime, far better model for
parameterized version controlled flows, Java 11 compatibility, back pressure
prediction and more.

In the release candidate phase of Apache NiFi 1.11.0 which provides a range of
bug fixes, improvements and a handful of new features.  This release will
solve class-loader isolation to include native libraries as well.

The release for MiNiFi CPP 0.7.0 is still being worked.  There are nearly 140
closed JIRAs including many bug fixes and new features such as ensuring all
inbound sockets are TLSv1.2 or newer, cron driven scheduling, support
Kerberized connections to Kafka, support for packages with Python scripts, and
ability to capture individual frames from an RTSP camera stream.

## Community Health:
We have seen about a 15% decline in users and dev mailing list activity this
quarter. This is likely due to the growing use of Slack for more
direct/responsive interaction as well as seasonal considerations. We also saw
a roughly 40% decrease in JIRA related activity.  This is certainly related to
the completion of the very significant Apache NiFi 1.10.0 release as well as
seasonal aspects.

We've brought in several new committers in this timeline and hopefully the
current committer base leads to additional PMC members soon. The community
remains active on numerous release lines as well. Community health continues
to be a strong point with a healthy committer and PMC pipeline as well as high
activity from current PMC members. We see numerous release lines across the
mentioned parts of the Apache NiFi project all with very active development
across features, bug fixes, and improvements. Our mailing list continues to be
highly active and our slack room is also super active.

For the past few quarters we've reported 394, 523, and now 707 persistent
users in our slack channels. Interestingly we see more non committer based
collaboration here than we have on the mailing lists. People seem to prefer
the collaboration style of Slack quite a lot as well as more subject dedicated
rooms to talk in. It isn't clear that this is leading to more committers and
PMC members but does help the community in general.

On Oct 11, 2019 both 1.16 and 2.4 have been released

With the release of 2.4 we resolved CVE-2016-6809, a vulnerability caused by
an upstream dependency. We also announced that we retire the development on
the 2.x branch and advice users to use the 1.x/master branch instead.

Work on 1.17 is proceeding with about 11 issues resolved so far.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Jörn Kottmann]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Jim Jagielski]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## SUMMARY

Latest Release was in September 2019. The community health in general is on a
low level. A major obstacle is the complex code and build system. Therefore it
is not easy for new people to gain a foothold into the code when the first
build is hard to be done. Short- and mid-term there is no view of improvement.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

No issues

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines:

1) 4.2.0 is the next minor release, planned to be released into a beta phase.
We have missed our goal on going into the beta in 2019. We managed only to
solve the biggest blockers. Currently a new dev test version is discussed to
be rolled to be more widely tested. An alpha and/or beta release is planned
for the next quarter.

For that release we improved the translation process. We are now able to sync
our translation server Pootle with the code.

At this time we support 63 languages in Pootle. We plan to add some new
languages to the 4.2.0 release.

2) We are currently in discussion about a 4.1.8 release. The motivation in
still maintaining the 4.1.x release line is not very high, especially due to
the the 4.1.x codebase being  based around much older OS versions. Therefore
we will shut it down as soon as we have a stable release of 4.2.x. There is no
release date defined although we hope to have at least a beta in the coming
quarter once we resolve some blockers.

## LATEST RELEASE HISTORY

2019-09-21 4.1.7 
2018-11-18 4.1.6 
2017-12-30 4.1.5

## PMC DATA

Apache OpenOffice was founded 2012-10-16 (7 years ago) There are currently 141
committers and 27 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 3:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N.
  McKenna (knmc). Last PMC member withdrawal was on 2019-Sep-24 Roberto
  Galoppini (galoppini)
- No new committers. Last committer addition was on 2017-Jan-28 Kay Schenk
  (kschenk). Last committer withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton
  (orcmid)

Roberto Galoppini has requested went Emeritus on the OpenOffice PMC. He stated
that his reasons are strictly pragmatic. We thank Roberto for his long time of
service in the OpenOffice PMC and we wish him all the best.

Peter Kovacs stepped down as PMC Chair and Jim Jagielski was nominated and
appointed, via resolution at the Oct. 2019 board meeting, as replacement.

## COMMUNITY HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT

Community overall health is stable. Our user level support and translation
teams are well working. Documentation team is virtually non existent. We have
issues to bring volunteers on board for development.

Certainly, more people would be helpful and we continue to try to grow the
developer and especially the builder communities. We do have the process and
the people in place to enable us to continue development and, more
importantly, perform releases in a reasonable time-frame. We also struggle
somewhat with our commitment to continue to support, and being a viable
platform, for users who are "stuck" on older machines and OSs, since this makes
development and community builds more difficult. However, it also appears
obvious that that community is being neglected by other FOSS office platforms, 
who tend to focus on providing releases for newer platforms.

Community metrics:
- dev@openoffice.apache.org had a 10% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (493 emails compared to 446)
- dev-de@openoffice.apache.org had a 92% decrease in traffic in the past
  quarter (2 emails compared to 24)

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We have initiated the migration from the old Apache CMS to Pelican CMS. We
face the issue that we have 9 GB of content to move. A plan has been made.

Our build bots are now functional again. Work has still to be done on
improving upload speed (Linux bots) and the RAT builds.

## MARKETING

We are in the process of printing new flyers.

### Feb 01st + 02nd - FOSDEM (Brussels, Belgium) [1]

We are co-organizing the Open Document Editors devroom, that brings together
Apache OpenOffice and other similar projects. OpenOffice PMC members will be
giving at least two talks. We applied for a table, but that was not accepted
and have signed up for time at the ASF table with ComDev.

The PMC has, using targeted funds, purchased a replacement computer system and
monitor for usage at various conferences and events in which OpenOffice
presents and/or has a table. It will make its debut at the "Chemnitzer Linux
Days 2020" [2]

[1] https://fosdem.org/2020/
[2] https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2020/en/

## DEVELOPMENT

An Apple Developer ID, for signing our macOS community convenience builds, has
been requested and approved. This ID was assigned to Jim Jagielski, who does
our macOS builds. This will be used for notarizing/signing our subsequent
macOS releases. A handful of test macOS builds were performed and signed using
this ID and process, with confirmation that the resultant DMG image is
correctly approved.

We also have access now to the Symantec Code Signing platform to provide
signed builds for Windows.

interface along with Infra before then, to make sure everything still works.

We MAY use the annual meeting as an excuse to try recruiting more people for
the project, as this is often the time where people tend to care more about
it.

There are no current plans to make a release of STeVe (nor have we ever had a
release).

## Community Health:
Very little activity, so community health is difficult to elaborate on. I did
the usual PMC roll call[1], and we do have sufficient oversight on the PMC, as
well as oversight on any bugs/suggestions that might land in our inbox (though
none have landed to date in this quarter).

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Thrift Project  [Jens Geyer]

## Description:
The mission of Thrift is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Framework for scalable cross-language services development

## Issues:
There are no current issues requiring board attention.

We released version 0.13.0 successfully, with three +1 votes cast. However one
of the three votes was counted as binding vote by mistake. Since this
particular release fixed two CVEs and the CVE information had already been
publicized in the meantime, since the community feedback we received on that
release was pretty good, and since there were no -1 votes, no further action
was taken as the mistake got noticed. Last not least, the particular voter is
an active long-time committer who in the meantime also became a PMC member.
Nevertheless, we are aware of the mistake and will make sure it does not
happen again.

## Membership Data:
Apache Thrift was founded 2010-10-20 (9 years ago)
There are currently 35 committers and 18 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Duru Can Celasun was added to the PMC on 2019-11-11
- No new committers. Last addition was David Mollitor on 2019-05-08.

## Project Activity:
Version 0.13.0 was released on 2019-10-16. In the last two months we got an
noticeable increase of contributions and patches in various areas. There is no
concrete schedule for the next release as of today, but there will be one.

## Community Health:
We receive a steady flow of contributions and own improvements. We are still
working on broadening the committer and PMC base in order to increase our pool
of active people. Community activity has increased. In our opinion this is a
direct function of the increased release frequency (compared to the years
before), we generally receive good feedback from the community in that regard.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Tim Allison]

## Description:
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from, a
growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognized by IANA and other standards bodies.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tika was founded 2010-04-20 (10 years ago)
There are currently 32 committers and 31 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Tilman Hausherr on 2019-10-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Tilman Hausherr on 2019-10-03.

## Project Activity:
1.23 was released on 2019-12-06. This included improved file type
detection and a new parser for XLIFF files. 

Nicholas DiPiazza recently contributed a parser for OneNote files, which
will be available in the next release.

Over the last two or three quarters, we've seen an increase in reports
of vulnerabilities in our dependencies.  We upgrade when we can, but
there are some upstream dependencies out of our control that have required
some non-trivial solutions, including forking and fixing (as a last resort).

## Community Health:
We've seen an increase in email, commits and and other activity
compared with last quarter, but overall, no significant changes.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BV: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
Since our last report, TinkerPop has released versions 3.3.9 and 3.4.4,
both of which included bug fixes and minor improvements. As mentioned in
the previous report, we now expect to slow down on minor releases to those
branches of development to focus on 3.5.0 to hopefully have that ready for
release in 2020. That said, we will likely release 3.3.10 and 3.4.5 by the
next board report.

We saw the growth of the wider TinkerPop ecosystem with the following
release announcements:

* JanusGraph-Aerospike[1] - a JanusGraph backend for Aerospike
* gremlin-visualizer[2] - a Gremlin visualization tool.

There were a number of talks/papers about TinkerPop, Gremlin and related
projects during this reporting period. Here were some by TinkerPop
committers/PMC members:

* In Search of the Universal Data Model[3] - Josh Shinavier
* Algebraic Property Graphs[4] - Josh Shinavier
* The Query Translation Landscape[5] - Harsh Thakkar
* Direct Mappings between RDF and Property Graph Databases[6]- Harsh Thakkar
* Let’s build Bridges, not Walls – SPARQL Querying of TinkerPop Graph
    Databases with sparql-gremlin[7] - Harsh Thakkar

Last month we reported that we were in the process of inviting a new
committer. That person did not respond to the invite or to follow-ups to
that invite and we were therefore unable to confirm them as a committer.
However, during this period we did invite Divij Vaidya to become a
committer and he quickly accepted.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.3.9 (October 14, 2019)
- 3.4.4 (October 14, 2019)

## PMC/Committer:
- Last PMC addition was Jorge Bay-Gondra - October 2018
- Last committer addition was Divij Vaidya - November 2019

server

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:

## Project Activity:
We are working on our ATS 9.0.0 release, which will be released this quarter.
Verizon Media has deployed a prereleases version of ATS 9.0.0 in one colo. We
are also continuing to support making bug fixes and updates to the 8.0.x and
7.1.x release branches.

## Community Health:
We had our Fall Summit at Verizon Media in Sunnyvale, CA.  80 people signed up
for the event and we had guest speakers from Google and Apple talking about
WASM and low latency video serving.  We had 18 presentations over a two day
period and had one day designated for a hackathon.

The number of commits are up for the quarter by 37%, which is surprising
considering winter break.  Also, the number of code contributors also went up
by 14%, which is another pleasant surprise.

Attachment BX: Report from the Apache Twill Project  [Terence Yim]

## Description:
The mission of Twill is the creation and maintenance of software related to Use 
Apache Hadoop YARN's distributed capabilities with a programming model that is 
similar to running threads

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

There are currently 9 committers and 6 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andreas Neumann on 2016-06-14.
- No new committers. Last addition was Yuliya Feldman on 2018-03-06.

## Project Activity:

- Cleanup the project with the removal of the support for Java 7 
  and Hadoop 2.0-alpha.
- We are targeting to create a smaller runtime footprint for Apache Twill
  by making ZooKeeper as an optional dependency.

## Community Health:
There are increases in activities in the past quarter. Increases are across
mailing list engagement, JIRA activities, and GitHub pull requests. However,
the absolute number of activities is still not very high, but we expect it
will increase after the holiday season pasted.

Attachment BY: Report from the Apache VXQuery Project  [Till Westmann]

Description:

Apache VXQuery implements a parallel XML Query processor.

Activity:

- Christina Pavlopoulou joined the PMC on 2018-10-29.
- Last PMC addition was Christina Pavlopoulou on 2018-10-29.

Attachment BZ: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.


## Membership Data:
Apache Web Services was founded 2003-01-22 (17 years ago)
There are currently 224 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2016-05-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2014-09-14.

## Project Activity:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required. However, user
questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed, and there are at
least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project can continue to
produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer
considered state of the art, we don't expect a major uptick in new development
efforts, new committers, etc...

The only release done recently was an XmlSchema 2.2.5 patch release to fix a
problem a user was having.   There are plans on some WSS4J releases soon once
new versions of Apache Santuario are available.

## Community Health:
As mentioned, SOAP/WebServices is not considered state-of-the-art anymore and
we are getting very little contribution from anyone other than the 2 or 3
regulars" that are driving features and changes needed for CXF (which is
being driven by their employers).   Thus, we are not seeing any possibilities
for future new committers or PMC members.  However, there are plenty of
people around that can do releases and answer questions and respond to
security issues.  It's a mature project.
