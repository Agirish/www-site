 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       After technical difficulties last month (and lack of sleep),
       I am going back to the normal agenda (without a consent agenda)
       to see if it makes any difference for a light meeting.

    B. President [David]

       This month was relatively quiet. 

       I received and handled one code of conduct complaint. 

       I intend, shortly after this report is submitted, to appoint Christian
       Grobmeier as VP, Data Privacy.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       This month was mostly uneventful for the Treasurer's office.  We have
       been working with Trademarks to resolve an issue that has made the 
       credit card unusable that was issued to the VP Trademarks.

       After discussions on the board mailing list, we have decided to draw 
       down our monthly financial reporting.  The board will continue to 
       receive this information on the private board mailing list, and we will 
       continue to post it in our quarterly and annual reports.  But this will 
       be the last month in which we will include it in the Treasurer's 
       board report.

       The Treasurer will, of course, continue to report on the activities of 
       the Treasurer's office in the board report.

       Operating Cash on August 31st, 2020 was $1,915.4K, which is down
       $44.2K from last month’s ending balance (July 20) of $1,959.6K.  Total
       Cash as of August 31st, 2020 is $3,341.3K (includes the Pineapple,
       Restricted Donation, and project funds) as compared to $3,844.3K on
       August 31st, 2019, (a decrease of $503K year over year). The August
       31st, 2020 ending Operating Cash balance of $1,915.4K represents an
       Operating Cash Reserve of 13.7 months based on the “Estimated” FY21
       Cash forecast average monthly spending of $139.8K/month.  The ASF
       actual Operating Cash Reserve of 13.7 months at the end of July 2020 is
       ahead of the August 2020 budgeted 12.8 months of reserve. The
       forecasted ASF Operating reserve for the end of FY21 is 14.6 months. 
       The ASF Operating reserve is well above the ASAE standard average of 6
       months of reserve for Non-Profits.

       Revenue through August 31st 2020 was ahead of budget by $24.2K,
       primarily due to the timing of Sponsor payments year to date vs the
       Budget. As compared to FY20, FY21 YTD revenue is behind by $357.4K. 
       This is due to Sponsorship and registration revenue for ACNA and ACEU
       in 2019 ( $358.6K of Conference income in 2019 vs $24.5K in 2020),
       which are not happening as a face to face events in FY21. Also,
       Foundation Sponsorship payments are down $27.9K from 2019 to 2020
       though Donations are up $4.2K during the first 4 months of the Fiscal
       year as compared to the same time period in FY20.

       Expenses through August 31st, 2020 are under budget by $25K. This is
       due to timing of Conference expenses for the online event platform,
       planned for later in the year as well as the timing of the payments of
       the anniversary video and timing of some Brand management invoices. 
       This is offset by under-spending in all other departments.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY21 the ASF finished with a Negative
       <$221K>NI vs a budgeted negative <$270.3K> NI or $49.3K better than
       the Budgeted NI as of August 31st 2020.  FY21 compared to FY20 as of
       August 31st 2020, while we are behind in revenue, by $357.4K as noted
       above,  we are also behind on expenses by $106.2K.  So year over year
       as of August 31st 2020 we are behind in NI by $251.2K. We are however
       holding to our FY21 Budgeted NI which is a favorable sign for the
       first 4 months of FY21.

 7. Special Orders

    A. Terminate the Apache PredictionIO Project

       WHEREAS, the Project Management Committee of the Apache PredictionIO
       project has chosen by vote to recommend moving the project to the
       Attic; and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it no longer in the best interest
       of the Foundation to continue the Apache PredictionIO project due to
       inactivity;

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Apache PredictionIO project is
       hereby terminated; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the Attic PMC be and hereby is tasked with oversight
       over the software developed by the Apache PredictionIO Project; and be

 8. Discussion Items

    A. What to do with the Pineapple fund?

       We have discussed whether the board has formally set aside the funds
       associated with the Pineapple donation. No restrictions were
       attached to that money when donated.

       We also discussed whether we have (or need) a common expectation
       regarding the size of our operating reserve, with respect to other
       non-profit organizations, and how that could feed into future
       budget discussions.

       There is board consensus that the funds will be recognized as a
       one-time donation.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsor status: we are pursuing renewals for one Platinum, one Gold,
and two Silver Sponsors; we have a dozen additional sponsors up for renewal in
Q4 of 2020. One Platinum sponsor has renewed one quarter prior to their
anniversary. Payments have been received from one Platinum and two Bronze
Sponsors. One Gold and one Silver sponsor have renewed, and one Platinum has
downgraded to Silver. We are in the invoicing process with two Platinum, one
Gold, one Silver, and three Bronze Sponsors, one of which is a new sponsor. We
are discussing possible sponsorship with four organizations (sponsorship
levels not yet confirmed).

2) Targeted sponsor status: discussions continue with two candidate Targeted
Sponsors interested in providing support to ASF Infrastructure.

3) Sponsor Relations: Sponsor outreach, development, and communication
continues. We have issued a sponsor update focusing on the August
month-in-review, ApacheCon@Home, and project interviews on Feathercast.

4) Event Sponsorship: we have successfully processed this year’s
ApacheCon@Home sponsors that include Apple, AWS, Codethink, DataStax, IBM,
Imply, Instaclustr, OpenLogic, PostgreSQL Association, Red Hat, and VMware. A
few additional sponsors are in-flight.

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $22,535+ total
during August. This includes sponsors using Hopsie for online payment
processing that includes ASF Sponsors (one Bronze renewal); ApacheCon@Home
(one Platinum payment); ASF Conferences partner (payment for use of the
ApacheCon Hopin account), as well as 40 individual donations, including one
donation for $7,200. We have also received a contribution from FOSS
Responders’ UPLIFT! program.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — September 2020

I. Budget: all vendor payments are up-to-date.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support day-to-day
activities within ASF Fundraising, including creating a presentation on the
ASF for a Platinum Sponsor. ASF Conference promotions continue across ASF
channels as we approach ApacheCon@Home at the end of September. We issued the
August Month In Review https://s.apache.org/Aug2020 , published "Success at
Apache: I Became an Apache Solr Committer in 4,662 Days. Here's how you can do
it faster!" https://s.apache.org/hney3 , and are editing Part I of the "Inside
Infra” interview with Daniel Gruno. Some of our "Success at Apache" posts,
particularly those that are "Apache Way" process-oriented, have been
translated and promoted in Chinese. We coordinated responses to a
vulnerability with members of the ASF Security team, and reported a brand
violation to ASF Trademarks & Brand Management. We are planning FY2021
reports, and continue to make adjustments to the apache.org master style
templates and homepage.

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the newswire
service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during this timeframe.

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 6 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog,
including 4 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 332 news
summaries published to date. We tweeted 12 items to 57.7K followers on
Twitter, and posted 11 items to 43.1K followers on LinkedIn that garnered more
than 61.4K organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are on hold. Projects planning to
graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major
project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?"
highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 4 media queries. We missed a reporter's
very short deadline on a security-related article; a volunteer PMC member
responded 12 hours after the article was published. We reconnected with a
publication whose editor-in-chief had left the group after 16 years, and now
have two new journalists in our media circle. We also coordinated a member
from the Apache Kafka community to author a paid article for a German
publication. The ASF and Apache Projects have received a total of 2,396 press
hits vs. last month's 2,850.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 3 analyst requests. We were asked to
review a report in development on Open Source trends that appears to have been
commissioned due to the heavily-biased nature of their questions and
statements; we are continuing work with this group on this project. Apache was
mentioned in a total of 19 reports by Gartner, Forrester, 451 Research, and
IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team continues to publish updates to the
apache.org homepage to include all four parts of the "Trillions and Trillions
Served" documentary as well as adjustments to the site's master style. We are
also working with ASF Infrastructure on their content publishing project
across apache.org and migrating from the current CMS. We created a new badge
for ApacheCon, and have been asked to create an additional asset. We will be
reaching out to Apache projects and invite those seeking creative assistance
to do so using our new intake form and process. The Editorial team continues
to help with drafting and publishing Weekly News Round-ups and Month-in-Review
summaries.

IX. Events liaison: we will continue helping promote ApacheCon@Home through
the duration of the event. We were approached by India's largest Hackathon to
participate in an upcoming event, which we forwarded to ComDev for
consideration.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: we haven't changed our processes yet,
although we will establish standalone accounts for the ASF to phase out
billing pass-throughs from HALO Worldwide.

XI. Miscellany: we continue to review and counsel organizations on their
promotions that highlight their relationships with specific Apache projects,
including press releases, blog posts, bylined articles, and educational
videos. Sally was invited to give an orientation to two incoming Outreachy
interns. An incubating podling has been seeking our assistance on promotional
tactics to benefit the project as well as its contributors.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- CMS out-migration has been in earnest. This service has been
  deprecated for many years, we have several alternate solutions for
  the projects, and our documentation for website building has been
  improved, to support the migration.
- All Jenkins nodes are now managed via multiple CloudBees Operations
  Center instances, providing better service to the projects with
  "their own" Jenkins nodes. The shared cluster is now managed this
  way, too, and all jobs moved over from the old shared cluster.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Finish GitBox v2, in order to use our newer platforms/services.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Migrate all projects away from the CMS, and turn it off.

General Activity
================
- Many improvements around "pipservice" tooling, and our deployment of
  those tools to all our machines. Some tricky work was needed to
  uninstall pre-pipservice tools.
- Turned up our usage of the AWS Route53 DNS service for the few
  domains which are not served directly by Namecheap (most are
  redirects to $FOO.apache.org). The expected increase in traffic did
  not materialize, however, so we may have already been serving the
  bulk of our DNS queries via R53.
- Our mirror network is now served via IPv6, where available. Most
  mirrors are served via TLS (a future requirement of Chromium when
  downloading content).
- All projects have migrated away from Ubuntu 14.04, but many are
  "in-flight" on migrating away from 16.04. We are migrating them to
  Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) and Puppet v6, mostly within the PNAP
  datacenter. Infra has some older machines which are lower priority
  to migrate.
- Our spam-processing infrastructure has been upgraded to 20.04/v6, as
  part of our continuing process to modernize our mail subsystems.
- Lots of supporting work for the shift to Operations Center, such as
  account credentials, and using GitHub Apps to trigger builds. This
  work creates a more solid system and avoids some GitHub API limits.
- Additional support for the new nightlies.a.o service.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

We are in the final stretch leading up to ApacheCon @Home 2020, which
will be held September 29th - October 1st, at
https://apachecon.com/acah2020. As of today (September 8th) we have
2550 attendees registered.

At this point we're just making small tweaks to the talk schedule, and
working with sponsors to get all of their content and sponsored
keynotes on the website.

We have 8 Platinum sponsors, one Gold, and two Bronze.

We are working on criteria to make the Hopin platform available to
other projects, after ApacheCon, since the Hopin contract is a
year-long subscription, with unlimited events. We hope to present this
plan to the President a few weeks after ApacheCon.

Meanwhile, we are hosting Pulsar Summit as a pilot of that plan, to
figure out how it's going to work, working with a PMC to host an
event. Pulsar Summit is scheduled for November 27th - 29th.

We continue to carefully watch travel bans at major tech companies, as
we consider what we'll do in 2021. Most companies we have been
watching have banned conference travel through June of 2021, so it
seems likely that we will continue doing virtual events through 2021
at least.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

Response to comments:

ASF participation is primarily in the web data area of W3C where much of W3C's
"new work" nowadays happens in Community Groups (CG) which are open to
individuals and not requiring a W3C member organisations.

In addition, ASF has 2 people on the JSON-LD Working Group, which does require
individuals to come from a W3C member organisations.

I only have some knowledge of the web data area of W3C. A quarterly overview
of what is happening in W3C is a significant amount of work to track areas I
currently have no insight into.

Does W3C Relations need to be a direct report to the board or can it be folded
into another activity?


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

This, again, was one of the most uneventful months on record (summer time
perhaps?): we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing through LEGAL
JIRA and legal-discuss. Committee members took good care of resolving most of
these in time. We're up 2 (to 29), unresolved issues this month.

The only worthy event was that we finally got an agreement from DLAPiper to do
a pro-bono full review of our by-laws. This is great timing giving the vote
that is expected to happen on changing the gender pronouns.

Attachment 13: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations [Rob Tompkins]

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Airflow Project  [Bolke de Bruin]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Airflow is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to workflow automation and scheduling that can be used to author and 
manage data pipelines

## Issues:

We would like guidance from the Board about what constitutes a release when it
comes to Docker images and Helm Charts.

For context:
https://lists.apache.org/x/thread.html/rcb608739206d788785081073a0deb417ffa9981634975fc5525dc769@%3Cdev.community.apache.org%3E

The ASF release policy says:

"Every ASF release must contain a source package, which must be sufficient for
 a user to build and test the release provided they have access to the
 appropriate platform and tool"

Our specific question:
- Does the reproducibility of a Helm chart include the images it depends on?
- Or do we count the Helm chart as "stand-alone" (it is just text files/text
  templates and references which docker files to use.

We (Airflow PMC) weren't able to reach a conclusion ourselves
https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10753

## Membership Data:

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Axis was created on 2001-01-19 (19 years ago).

There are currently 63 committers and PMC members in this project, a vote in
2010 made all committers automatically PMC members.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## Health report:
As Axis approaches our 20th year as an Apache project, this past quarter we
continued to have slow but steady progress by having at least three PMC
members make commits. 

Our Axis user lists and Jira activity this past quarter indicates that we
continue to have users.  We typically see them when they are migrating their
legacy applications to newer servers and dependencies.

The Axis2 Java commits this past quarter included upgrades of many of our
dependenices, as requested by Jira issue AXIS2-5984. We continue to make
commits related to supporting JDK 9 and later.  Our goal for the next release
is JDK 11 compilation, including reworking the custom code we have for Javdoc
and XDoclet.

For Axis2 java, most of our users are using legacy SOAP so we are lacking
committer growth.  The plan to attract new users is by better highlighting our
Axis2 JSON and Rest support in the upcoming release that we expect by the end
of the year. We expect that some planned Spring Boot docs will also bring in
new users.

Axis2 C PMC member Bill Blough continued to make good progress this past
quarter, as shown by 14 commits and 4 closed Jira issues.

## Axis2 java Jira issues closed in the last 90 days.

AXIS2-5983, AXIS2-5984

## Axis1 java Jira issues closed in the last 90 days.

AXIS-2938, AXIS-2939 (closed issue, helped clarify the fix). 

## Axis2 C Jira issues closed in the last 90 days.

AXIS2C-1600, AXIS2C-1603, AXIS2C-1638, AXIS2C-1674

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Kenneth Knowles]

## Description:

The mission of Apache Beam is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing, 
enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution engines and 
providing extensibility points for connecting to different technologies and 
user communities.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

Apache Beam was founded 2016-12-20 (3.75 years ago)
There are currently 75 committers and 22 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Alexey Romanenko was added to the PMC on 2020-06-11
- Aizhamal Nurmamat kyzy was added as committer on 2020-06-17
- Austin Bennett was added as committer on 2020-06-22
- Heejong Lee was added as committer on 2020-09-03
- Reza Ardeshir Rokni was added as committer on 2020-08-17

## Project Activity:

- Beam 2.24.0 is the last release with Python 2 and Python 3.5 support.
- “Cross-language transforms” continue to grow: JdbcIO (Java-based) now 
  available to Beam Python users.
- Twister2 runner is merged
- Python 3.8 support added
- More effort on Splunk, Snowflake, and Google Healthcare API integrations

Recent releases:

- 2.23.0 was released on 2020-07-29.
- 2.22.0 was released on 2020-06-08.
- 2.21.0 was released on 2020-05-27.

## Community Health:

Community metrics steady:
 - Mailing list activity about the same on user@ (about 500) and
   dev@ (between 1000 and 1500)
 - Pull request open and close rate about the same (just under 800). The fact 
   that equal numbers of pull requests are opened and closed is nice.

The board may enjoy this basic analysis [1] of code contributors presented at
the Beam Summit. Highlighted points:

 - Each release has a bit under 100 unique contributors (steady for a long
   time)
 - About 20 of which are new each time (which means 20 depart as well)
 - This is explained because the majority of Beam's contributors have under 
   10 commits total, perhaps mostly "scratching an itch" by fixing a one-off 
   issue.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======
There are no issues to raise to the Board at this time.

Releases
========

There have been no releases since the last report. The last release was
towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Community & Development
=======================

Unfortunately a long time has gone by since the last board report with no
real progress being demonstrated.

A message on the dev list from a Director asking if it was time to move the
project to the attic produced a quick response from members of the PMC and
others indicating that despite the silence, oversight was being provided by
at least 4 PMC members. A roll call email has been sent to the private PMC
list to see if other PMC members are available.

In order to make progress, one PMC member has specified their expected
availability over the week of September 21st for working on the project and
encouraging others to engage to any extent that they feel they are able
over this time. At this point further plans for what to do with this time
and further preparations still need announcing.

Alongside this, there has been some effort to migrate a bloodhound vm with
the help of INFRA. Progress has also stalled on this but there is not
expected to be much more to do to complete this.

  selected did a great job

## Community Health:
- dev@camel.apache.org had a 25% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (467
  emails compared to 622): This is mainly related to the fact we released the
  LTS 3.4.x. So there was less activity on dev ML, another reason is the
  summer time
- users@camel.apache.org had a 22% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (367 emails compared to 469): Similar to dev ML, the summer time is one
   reason, the other one is that Camel 3 is still in his early adoption so not
   all the users are moving from the 2.x version
- 337 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-31% decrease) This is related to
  the LTS releases train and the summer time
- 338 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-25% decrease) This is related to
  the LTS releases train and the summer time too. Basically we are adding new
  features on next releases > 3.4.x and we are reviewing the old issues.
- 3000 commits in the past quarter (-13% decrease) During the LTS work we add
  a lot of stuff, during the summer time we slowed down a bit
- 673 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-28% decrease) This decrease is
  related to the LTS releases and the summer time
- 681 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-25% decrease) This decrease is
  related to the LTS releases and the summer time
- 299 issues opened on GitHub, past quarter (-6% decrease) This decrease is
  related to the summer time and the LTS releases
- 207 issues closed on GitHub, past quarter (-40% decrease) This decrease is
  related to the summer time and the LTS releases. We reviewed the old github
  issues and closed some of them.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

## Description:
Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the
CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in
Java, Python, PHP, .NET, Objective-C, and JavaScript (and possibly other
languages).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Chemistry was founded 2011-02-16 (10 years ago)
There are currently 38 committers and 36 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Laurent Mignon on 2017-09-23.
- No new committers. Last addition was Laurent Mignon on 2017-09-20.

## Project Activity:
There was little to no activity in the last three months.
Last releases were in 2017.

## Community Health:
We have a mature code base. No major development is expected.
Because there hasn't been much activity in the last three years, we
consider moving the project to the attic after a final OpenCMIS release.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Sven Vogel]

## Description:

Apache CloudStack (ACS) is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud
orchestration platform. ACS manages many types of hypervisors, storage
and networking devices.

## Issues:

No issues to report.

## Activity:

- The Apache CloudStack project is pleased to announce the releases of
CloudStack 4.14.0 and 4.13.1. 
Apache CloudStack 4.14.0 is the latest new LTS release while 4.13.1 is
a maintenance release of the 4.13 LTS branch. 

- the community is actually working on the release of the Apache
CloudStack 4.15 and the first GA candidate of the new UI (Primate)

- The PMC as a whole decided stop maintaining a separate security list
and move the CloudStack security related issues to the ASF Security
Team and private lists for more visibility.
explanation and justification to the Apache Board of Directors:

The PMC had a security@ list which was by definition separate to the
PMC private@ list. Because of this, the PMC was not directly aware of
issues. we don't have a dedicated security team and the sizes/scope of
our project does not really warrant one. the removing of the
CloudStack security@ list and having security@apache.org raise any
issues directly with the PMC was the next logical step.

## Health report:

- Apropos of the activity report; the project is considered healthy

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Jesse MacFadyen]

## Status report for the Apache Cordova project - September 2020

## Description:
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
   JavaScript.

## Activity
Recent work has been around keeping up with recent changes to iOS and Android,
our most used platforms.  We are also working towards reducing some of our
technical debt, we have discussed narrowing our platform support by removing
some of the now outdated platforms we support so we can better serve our
community. We still have not made a decision how best to use last year's
generous donation.

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Health report:

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green -
failures are usually due to external service issues that do device testing.
Our nightly builds have been extremely stable.

ASF Project Statistics gives the project a Community Health Score (Chi): 6.33
(Healthy) That said, we are only seeing contributions from a small group of
dedicated individuals, and a lot of work has been focused on reducing some of
the technical debt to keep the project managable with the limited time we
have.  All the large corporate sponsered development has ceased, but the
project continues to see good traffic, and usage has been stable.

The cordova-cli, the base tool used for creating/building/running gets 125k
downloads a week on npm, and has been consistent for the last year.  Various
core plugins see usage in the 50-80k/wk range.

Our primary channel for helping, and hearing from users is via our #slack
community, which has ~4k users and is fairly active.

The pmc has renewed interest in having online video hangouts, which we are
aiming to have every 2-3 weeks or more if possible.  Our time-zones are very
distrubuted, so we will likely distribute the timing as well.  All meetings
will be recorded and shared on YouTube, and we hope to get more and more
intrest from the community.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache DeltaSpike is  a suite of portable CDI (Contexts & Dependency
 Injection) extensions intended to make application development easier when
 working with CDI and Java EE.  Some of its key features include:

 - A core runtime that supports component configuration, type safe messaging
   and internationalization, and exception handling.
 - A suite of utilities to make programmatic bean lookup easier.
 - A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans
   outside of a container.
 - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
 - JPA integration and transaction support.
 - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.

 Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
 your CDI enabled projects.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 Summer time has been quite quiet. Our main activity went to move our
 CI to the new boxes and also added workarounds to our EAR tests for
 a few big EE irons which behave a bit weird.

## Health report:
 Still many active users. But DeltaSpike is really stable, so it most of 
 the times just works. We also have a strong eye on backward compatibility
 and don't just rework/rewrite parts for the fun of it. 

## Releases:
 - 1.9.4 was released on 2020-06-12

A discussion about starting the process to attic the Flex project begun. There
was no vote about it, but it seems that there's a consensus to not start the
attic process as long as Harman will support Flex/AIR and as long our
community is able to meet the Apache criteria for an active project.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

## Description:
Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and
libraries for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam, Calcite,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

## Issues:
  - There are currently no community issues that require board attention.

## Membership Data:
PMC changes since previous report:
- Yu Li joined the PMC on 2020-06-15
- Piotr Nowojski joined the PMC on 2020-06-15
- Dian Fu joined the PMC on 2020-08-27

The newest committer is Igal Shilman, joined on September 7th, 2020.

There are currently 62 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.

## Releases
The following releases were made since the last board report:
  - 1.10.2 was released on 2020-08-25.
  - 1.11.0 was released on 2020-07-07.
  - 1.11.1 was released on 2020-07-22.

## Project Activity:
  - The Flink community is proud that Flink continues to be among the most
    active projects in the ASF. As per the FY 2020 Annual Report, Flink had
    the #1 most active dev@ mailing list (excluding builds, commits, and issue
    updates which go to separate lists) and the #2 most active user@ list,
    despite a growing second user mailing list (user-zh@).
    
  - The big 1.11.0 release went out in July, and a follow-up patch release
    since then as well. It included a lot of improvements, like a major update
    to Flink's checkpoint mechanism, support for change-data-capture streams,
    deeper Hadoop/Hive integration, better support for common Python libraries
    for Python users.

  - For the 1.12.0 release, the community has discussed the feature freeze to
    be end of October. The major release cycle is implicitly becoming a bit
    longer than it used to be, which seems a natural result due to the growth
    of the project, community, and issues going into releases.

  - The Stateful Functions project is heading for the 2.2 release, probably
    in the next two weeks, with several usability and stability improvements.

  - There will be a Virtual Flink Forward Community Conference, October 21-22.
    The main event is free for all.
    https://www.flink-forward.org/global-2020/conference-program

## Community Health:
After a very busy spring season, the summer season is slightly slower:

  - About 20 new major feature proposals (FLIPs = Flink Improvement Proposals)
  - user@f.a.o is roughly stable (2266 mails/quarter)
  - user-zh@f.a.o almost doubled (3359 mails/quarter)
  - dev@f.a.o is 25% slower (2340 mails/quarter)

Similarly, Jira activity is at 50% of last quarter;
  - 876 JIRA tickets created,
  - 782 JIRA tickets closed

This is probably explained by the very big 1.11 release to which the community
was gearing up in the last quarter, while this quarter didn't yet see the very
active phase leading to the next release (1.12 feature freeze is still two
months away).

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server. Gump's intention
isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that makes people look
beyond their project's boundaries and helps the projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version control
systems. The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well as non-ASF
projects and their dependencies. It started in the Java part of the foundation
but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and OpenSSL.

## Summary

In essence, nothing has changed over the past three months and we honestly do
not anticipate changes in the foreseeable future.

The Tomcat community is the only one still using Gump actively and the only
activity in Gump is around keeping the infrastructure alive and tweaking
things for the benefit of Tomcat builds.

We will certainly support any other project that wants to get the benefit of
the early warning system for backwards incompatible changes Gump provides, but
we are not actively recruiting projects.

We've been scheduled to move the vmgump instance over to a bigger machine
soonish.

## Releases

Gump has never done any releases. One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the time
following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

## Changes to the Roster

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure the ASF
installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark Thomas join
in November 2014.

Brett Porter has left the PMC in December 2019.

to providing atomic upserts and incremental data streams on Big Data

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Hudi was founded 2020-05-19 (4 months ago)
There are currently 18 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Anbu Cheeralan on 2020-05-19.
- Pre-graduation,last PMC addition was Bhavani Sudha Saktheeswaran on
  2020-03-27
- Gary Li was added as committer on 2020-08-21
- Pratyaksh Sharma was added as committer on 2020-09-04
- Udit Mehrotra was added as committer on 2020-08-24
- Raymond Xu was added as committer on 2020-08-21

## Project Activity:
We released Apache Hudi 0.6.0, the major release that provides lot of
critical functionality like - Spark Streaming/Compaction, Bulk Ingestion
tools, Data bootstrapping and many more. All in all, it was a community effort
to stabilize RC, test, fix blockers and put this release out. 

We had few blogs on hudi.apache.org/blog, that feature contributors sharing 
ideas, explaining how features work. Our PMC members (Vinoth Chandar/Nishith
Agarwal) were featured on DataCouncil DC_THURS to discuss history and evolution
of the project.

Planning ahead, community is discussing several improvements to our release
process including major/minor release principles, testing/CI to be more 
continuous. 0.7.0 is the next major release that will deliver elimination of
filesystem listing, new indexes and Flink support.


## Community Health:
Compared to previous report timeline, there were similar activity in terms of
github issues/prs/jiras. Some upticks in number of participants on dev ML and
its related metrics. Drilling down, we continue to support more and more user
support tickets via GH issues, as users tend to like its ability to share
code/stack traces better over mailing list.

Last month, we merged close to 68 PRs, with several large PRs under review

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for September 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts. There are 
presently 46 podlings incubating. In August, podlings executed 8 distinct 
releases. We added one IPMC member and none retired. There were 2 IP 
clearances in August. A couple of new podlings are still being discussed 
and proposals prepared, one in particular Hop has generated interest. No 
projects graduated last month.

This month we were missing reports from BlueMarlin, Liminal, S2Graph, SDAP, 
Warble and Weex. All of these podlings failed to report last month and it 
concerning that two of them are new podlings. Again all will be asked to 
report next month. If they fail to report again, the IPMC will need to take 
further action. This is the fourth time that Warble has failed to report, 
and it will be recommended to the podling that it retires. Again we've also 
seen more podlings needing to ask mentors and IPMC members to vote on 
releases. This may be a result of the current pandemic situation or a lack 
of mentor engagement.

MXNet progress on resolving issues seems to have been stalled. Conversation 
with NVIDIA about changing the licensing terms also seem to have stalled. 
An MXNet release was found to contain code that had not passed IP clearance 
and further branding, trademarks and distribution issues have been uncovered. 
At this point, I think the IPMC will need to discuss if the project should 
continue to be in the incubator and if it can graduate in its current state.
Discussions on ECharts graduation uncovered several trademark, branding and 
domain issues which are being dealt with by the project. Graduation of TVM 
also run into several similar issues, most of which have been resolved. 
However, it was determined that the project has not made enough 
releases to be ready for graduation as it had only made 2 releases by a 
single project manager.

No progress on the policy changes to distributing releases on various 
platforms has been made. This initiative is currently stalled, and without 
board intervention or ASF policy change, it may not progress further.

The incubator has organised a track for the upcoming Apache@home conference.

Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases, graduations and 
new proposals.

Spot has sorted out its subscription/roster issues.

  2. Establish convincing Crail use cases
  3. More steady release cycle

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  A developer recently joined the community, volunteering for the
  implementation of the elastic scaling of the data store.

  The project failed to resume from a period of
  inactivity which started this spring. With implementing
  elastic scaling, we hope to see increasing activity.
  Elastic scaling is a needed pre-requisite to use Apache Crail
  as an efficient ephemeral data store for serverless frameworks.

## Sedona

Sedona is a big geospatial data processing engine. It provides an easy to
use APIs for spatial data scientists to manage, wrangle, and process
geospatial data.

Sedona has been incubating since 2020-07-19.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. We are still working on the initial setup.
  2.
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  N/A

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been active since the last report. We have started to
  use the mailing list to exchange ideas of different development issues in
  Sedona. Several contributors, users and committers have joined the
  discussion on the mailing list dev@

  It is also worth noting that we are still working on importing the code
  into the incubator ASF GitHub repo. It took us several weeks to collect
  CLAs and SGAs from the major participating parties. I believe we have
  collected sufficient evidence to prove that the artifact is ready to be 
  imported and the secretary has confirmed the CLA and SGA. We just created
  a JIRA ticket for the infra team and are waiting for them to import our 
  codebase into ASF GitHub: 
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-20786

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project made a good progress. In the past month, we accepted several 
  patches from Kengo Seki and Sachio Wakai. In the meantime, Committer 
  Netanel is working on a large PR to replace a 3rd party dependency 
  JTSplus with JTS in order to improve the performance. Committer Pawel is
  working on another large PR to carry out the Sedona Python support for
  Spark 3.0.

## Spot

Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model
and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Increase community activity in mailing list and commits
  2. Make the product more approachable for new contributors and users
  3. Develop a roadmap that focuses on delivering one use case effectively

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Not at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our new contributors have helped us increase our capacity to fix and 
  resolve issues. Our goal in the near future is to work with the 
  community on a roadmap that will allow more contributors to focus 
  and work on different levels of the project (i.e. data modeling and 
  schema design, use-cases, ingestion, ml, ui, dev ops, docs, etc).

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have increased our conformance with ASF podling policies by removing
  from the PPMC all who are not on the private mailing list.  This has
  been the longest-standing caution against us.

  We have significantly revamped the project website with the object of
  making it more approachable for new contributors.  We have used whimsy
  to ensure that all ASF requirements are complied with.

  We have captured all of the sample data used by the project and are now
  hosting them using ASF resources, instead of a third party AWS S3 link,
  which was hosted by unknown persons.

  We have cleared away a large development effort that was initiated by
  a large company but not completed, and no contributors appear to be 
  ready to resume work on it.  Discussions have been started to take
  this feature in a direction fulfilling different use cases.

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

  2020-08-24 - We removed PPMC members who were not subscribed 
  to the private mailing list and who did not respond to 
  an email asking them to subscribe

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  Are things falling through the cracks? If so, please list any
  open issues that need to be addressed.

  Our mentors have been helpful in onboarding new contributors, 
  and in getting us the Whimsy and Clutch reports and updating 
  the website so we more completely conform to ASF policy 
  requirements for podlings.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings
  name and brand? If not what actions has the PPMC taken to
  correct this? Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?

  We have no knowledge of any issues with the brand or trademark.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Marcel Reutegger]

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained. 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding 
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Membership Data:

Apache Jackrabbit was founded 2006-03-15 (14 years ago)
There are currently 56 committers and 56 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Fabrizio Fortino on 2020-05-22.
- No new committers. Last addition was Fabrizio Fortino on 2020-05-21.

## Project Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the main development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

We continue making regular feature releases of Jackrabbit Oak. The
most recent release was Jackrabbit Oak 1.32.0 that was made available
on July 16th.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

The project migrated CI builds to the new Jenkins service from
CloudBees. Builds seem to take longer on the new Jenkins service.

## Community Health:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
lists as well as on the various JIRA issues. 

Commit activity is moderate mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues and the desire of the individual contributors to bring
features and improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.

## Releases:

 - jackrabbit-2.20.1 was released on 2020-06-08
 - jackrabbit-2.21.2 was released on 2020-07-08
 - jackrabbit-oak-1.32.0 was released on 2020-07-16

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Karaf Project  [Jean-Baptiste Onofré]

## Description:
Apache Karaf provides a modern and polymorphic applications runtime,
multi-purpose (micro services, cloud, modulith, integration, IoT, OSGi, etc).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Karaf was founded 2010-06-16 (10 years ago)
There are currently 31 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:

## Project Activity:
Apache Karaf track has been prepared for ApacheCon, the schedule is ready. We
are working to create HTML page to publish the schedule on ApacheCon website.
There's two PoC on the way:
- Karaf DevX (https://github.com/jbonofre/karaf/tree/DEVX/devx)
- Karaf Spring Boot support
  (https://github.com/jbonofre/karaf/tree/SPRING-BOOT/spring-boot) These two
   new features will be discussed on the mailing list as soon as we have a
   full story to show. We migrate our Jenkins build to ci-builds.a.o now
   pipeline build.

In term of releases, we did:
- Apache Karaf Cellar 4.2.1 was released on 2020-08-21.
- Apache Karaf Cellar 4.2.0 was released on 2020-07-18.
- Apache Karaf Decanter 2.5.0 was released on 2020-06-22.

Apache Karaf 4.2.10 is in preparation with several fixes and improvements.
Apache Karaf 4.3.0 is also in preparation. We are waiting for Pax Web 8.0,
however in the meantime, we are evaluating the use of Felix HTTP as default
instead.

## Community Health:
We are happy to have received several talk proposals for ApacheCon.

We are increasing our partnership with other Apache projects, especially
Apache Camel to help on the camel-karaf project (cleanup, refactoring,
improvements).

Regarding ServiceMix, we are still in the process to move ServiceMix parts to
Karaf, but due to other activities, we have postponed a bit.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Kibble is the creation and maintenance of software
related to an interactive project activity analyzer and aggregator

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at present.

## Membership Data:
Apache Kibble was founded 2017-10-18 (3 years ago) There are currently 12
committers and 12 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is

## Project Activity:
Community outreach is being done, helping other open source communities
utilize Kibble for gaining insights into development trends and
community/diversity statistics for individual projects as well as
organizations and communities as a whole.

Due to time being spent in other Apache projects and life outside Open Source,
the project code-base has not changed much this quarter.

We helped out Project Jupyter[1] assess their code-base and developer make-up,
and are looking at other similar projects to help spread what Kibble can help 
communities achieve.

## Community Health:
The community remains a small handful of people. We do have oversight and >=3
active PMC members, but would love to grow the community.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Matt Sicker]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Logging Services project is to create and maintain
of software for managing the logging of application behavior, and for related
software components.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Logging Services was founded 2003-12-16 (17 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 13 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 3:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carter Kozak on 2018-07-29.
- Volkan Yazici was added as a committer on 2020-05-17
- Davyd McColl was added as committer on 2020-08-04
- Robert Middleton was added as committer on 2020-08-04
- Stephen Webb was added as committer on 2020-08-08

## Project Activity:
- In May, we released version 12.0 of Log4j Scala which introduced support for
  Scala 2.13 as well as migrating its build system to SBT.
- In May, we released version 2.13.3 of Log4j to fix a regression introduced in
  the previous 2.13.2 release.
- In June, we merged Volkan Yazici's JSON template layout along with Volkan
  himself into the project.
- In July, we migrated from using Travis CI to GitHub Actions to increase the
  reliability of our PR checks.
- In July, we migrated our Jenkins pipelines from builds.apache.org to
  ci-builds.apache.org which eventually allowed us to enable PR checks from
  this system as well.
- In July, we announced CVE-2018-1285 which affects log4net releases up to and
  including 2.0.8 and the recently released 2.0.9. This XXE vulnerability only
  affects applications that allow arbitrary user input in their log4net
  configuration file, and it is planned to be fixed in a future 2.0.10 release.
- In August, we released version 2.0.9 of log4net with the help of our new
  committer, Davyd McColl. This release primarily involves bringing the project
  back from dormancy and making its build and release process functional again.
- In August, we released version 0.11.0 of log4cxx with the help of our two new
  committers, Robert Middleton and Stephen Webb. Being the first release of
  log4cxx in about 12 years, this includes numerous changes, features, and bugs
  fixed. Much of the recent activity around this project involved migrating to
  CMake and making a release with the renewed community interest.
- In August, we signed and tagged all our historical Log4j git tags under the
  immutable rel/X.Y.Z tagging scheme.
- In August, we migrated our base logging.apache.org website from the old CMS
  to the asf-site git branch method of publishing the site. We also migrated
  from svnpubsub to the pypubsub in publishing the rest of our website.

## Community Health:
- This quarter has been one of the busiest in our community in some time!
- Both log4net and log4cxx have seen renewed community interest including new
  committers working on them and new releases published.
- The publication of CVE-2018-1285 did raise several inquiries about the state
  of the project, though this hasn't led to any new contributors.
- Mailing list traffic, commits, and PRs are all up from previous quarters;
  much of this is attributable to increased activity in log4net and log4cxx in
  addition to the typical Log4j activity.
- We updated our Project Team page on our website to list our active and
  inactive team members. Active team members are defined as committers who have
  participated in the project in the past two years. Inactive team members are
  either committers/PMC members who requested emeritus status or have not
  participated in the community in the last few years; they are always welcome
  to continue participating at any time. Today, we have 8 active PMC members
  and 6 active committers (14 together), along with 11 inactive or emeritus
  PMC members and 4 inactive committers.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Anshum Gupta]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
The community is currently working on reducing the tech debt that Solr
currently carries, as mentioned in the previous board reports. Several
committers are actively working on a much improved 9.0 release.

## Membership Data:
Apache Lucene was founded 2005-01-18 (16 years ago) There are currently 86
committers and 59 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Atri Sharma was added to the PMC on 2020-08-19
- Gus Heck was added to the PMC on 2020-08-02
- Mike Drob was added to the PMC on 2020-07-23
- Munendra S N was added to the PMC on 2020-08-02

- Mayya Sharipova was added as a committer on 2020-06-08
- Tomoko Uchida was marked as Emeritus PMC member but continues as a committer
- Doron Cohen was marked as Emeritus PMC member

## Project Activity:

As informed in previous reports, the Lucene PMC is currently working on
graduating Solr as its own TLP based on a vote earlier this year. This effort
will move faster after some planned build reorganization is completed.

We released Apache Lucene and Solr 8.6.0, 8.6.1, and 8.6.2 since the last
report.

Lucene 8.6.0 introduced a feature to optionally reduce the number of small
segments in the index, increasing search performance. It also fixed resource
leaks and various other optimizations. Solr 8.6.0 improved the search
performance in cases where exact count isn’t required. This version also
released a major redesign of the Solr documentation.

Solr 8.6.1 was a bug fix release that fixed a performance issue introduced by
the default auto-scaling policy introduced in 8.6.0 release.

Lucene 8.6.2 fixed a memory leak in the IndexWriter that was introduced in
8.6.0. Solr 8.6.2 introduced a bug fix allowing the admin screen to work with
older ZooKeeper versions.

The community has removed Ant support for building the project from master and
transitioned to gradle.

A new Logo for Apache Lucene was selected by voting[1]. The old logo will be
retired soon.

A code contribution from The Library of Congress for the Advanced Query Parser
is currently being worked on as SIP-9[2].

## Community Health:
Our JIRA issue activity and code contributions are also very strong. 365
issues were opened and 383 issues closed in JIRA past quarter (25% increase).

There were 2578 commits in the past quarter (187% increase) due to some heavy
committing on a feature branch to pay off technical debt.

There has been an overall deterioration in the community health with an
increase in the incidents involving loud language and impolite behavior. The
community needs to return to a more friendly and inviting style of community
discussions and resolution of disagreements as we have in the past.

A committer meeting was organized in this last quarter as a substitute for
in-person meetings that used to happen at conferences. The meeting was
attended by many committers, and there are plans to organize subsequent
meetings at a regular interval.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Apache Lucene.NET is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

Lucene.NET has had a pretty active quarter:

• Several bug fixes
• Some missing features were added to the project
• The test framework has had some major bottlenecks removed
• We had 3 beta releases (00009, 00010, 00011)
• We also had releases of our 2 main dependencies, J2N and ICU4N
• We set up performance benchmarks to see how different releases compare

Since our move to GitHub Issues, we are now getting bug reports that have been
long underreported. This new collaboration channel with end users is helping
us zero in on bugs, and is also helping to drive some PR activity from
contributors. We have also been steadily improving performance and refactoring
APIs to be more .NET-like than Java-like.

In addition, 2 new PMC members were added this quarter.

== Board-Level Issues ==

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

== Releases ==

* Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012
* Working toward 4.8.0 - Currently beta00011, released 2020-07-24

== People ==

* Last PMC Member added Sept 2020, Laimonas Simutis (laimis)
* Last committer added April 2020, Michael Condillac (xmichaelc78x)
* PMC Chair rotated 20 June 2018 to Shad Storhaug (nightowl888)

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    During this unprecedented crisis, I think pretty much everything is 
    largely slowed down.In this period of reporting, 13 of tickets has been 
    created and 14 resolved, basically, we are working on refactoring project
    building process and upgrading the dockerfiles to major Linux 
    distributions, fixed some CI and documentation issues. we plan to migrate
    Maven build to Gradle for efficiency and flexibility.

Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - no new PMC member added since Jun. 2018.
 - 1 PMC left in Aug. 2020

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 12 committers.
 - No new committer added since Jun. 2018.

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.12.0 on Sep. 04 2018
 - Still active development on next major version (0.13)

reports and feature requests which have mostly been addressed.

Also in the last few weeks a lot of new folks have been showing up, one was
already invited to become a committer and some which will probably be invited
pretty to join the community soon, if they continue the current level of
activity.

Especially the new PLC4PY initiative, where a group of community members and
new folks have started working on porting PLC4J to Python is currently seeding
more activity in the community.

Another notable initiative is one to bring support for CAN bus communication
as well also the efforts to port PLC4J to C.

ApacheCon@Home will be having 3 talks where PLC4X is a main topic or a
sub-topic and we are looking forward to it.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and 
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent
interface to underlying platform-specific implementations. The primary goal is
to provide an API to which software developers may code and be assured of
predictable if not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which
their software is built, relieving them of the need to code special-case
conditions to work around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies
or features.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) was founded 2000-12-01 (20 years ago)
There are currently 68 committers and 43 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Michael Osipov was added to the PMC on 2020-08-29
- Michael Osipov was added as committer on 2020-08-29

## Project Activity:
The project has been very quiet even by APR's standards.  Nothing of interest
to report.

The most recent release was 1.7.0 in April 2019.

Regarding nh comment on the previous report:

 nh: Has APR looked into expanding the scope with abstractions of
      modern architecture to get new traction and excitement, or has
      it decided to remain what it currently is? Examples; GPUs and
      FPGAs are making in-roads to "general computing", Security
      Hardware Accelerators, fingerprint sensors are on many
      laptops,... Just a thought from peanut gallery.

The answer is No and No.  We haven't considered it as of now, but we are
always open to new proposals if someone is driving them.  If someone comes
forward with a credible proposal or an existing piece of work that might
integrate with APR, we would expect to consider that on its merits.

## Community Health
The community is quiet, reflecting the lack of activity.  Working on the
principle of "scratch your own itch", noone is itching.  We believe we retain
the capacity to respond to new proposals or to new issues, though none have
arisen in the quarter.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache SystemDS Project  [Jon Deron Eriksson]

## Description:
Apache SystemDS is a machine learning (ML) system for the end-to-end
data science lifecycle from data preparation, validation, and cleaning,
over efficient ML training, to model debugging and deployment. Data
scientists specify ML algorithms or ML pipelines in a high-level
language with R-like syntax - or through related Python and Java APIs,
and the system automatically generates hybrid runtime plans of single
node, in-memory operations as well as distributed operations on top of
Apache Spark.

## Project Status:
- The name change from Apache SystemML to Apache SystemDS has been
   completed (thanks to the INFRA team for changing all relevant services
   such as JIRA, Github URLs, website, and mailing lists).

- We're currently in preparation of the SystemDS 2.0 release,
   hopefully to be released by end of September.

- Change PMC chair: According to the board feedback on our 08/2020
   report, we had an explicit vote on changing the PMC chair, and this
   resolution has been submitted to the board for approval.
 
## Membership Data:
- Apache SystemML - now SystemDS - was founded 2017-05-16
   (incubator process entered 2015-11-02)
- 4 new committers have been added 2020-05-01
   (Arnab Phani, Mark Dokter, Shafaq Siddiqi, and Kevin Innerebner).
- 1 new committer has been added 2020-06-08
   (Sebastian Baunsgaard)
- Rich Bowen has resigned from the PMC 2020-08-19
- There are currently 31 committers and 22 PMC members in the project.

## Activity and Health:
- Code activity is healthy with 175 commits in the last 3 months.
- Community growth is healthy with 1 new committer and 20 active
   contributors in the last 3 months
- Communication is healthy but mailing list activity can be improved.

## Releases:
- Apache SystemML 1.2.0 was released on 2018-08-24.
- SystemDS 0.2.0 was released (outside ASF) on 2020-03-24
   https://github.com/tugraz-isds/systemds/releases
- in progress of preparing the SystemDS 2.0 release
   (for reconciling the previous SystemML and SystemDS version lines)

## Answers to Board Questions:
- ss: I'm unclear what this means, could you please clarify? "-
       SystemDS 0.2.0 was released (outside ASF) on 2020-03-24"

   ps: The situation is complicated by a merge and name change from
       SystemML to SystemDS, but neither set of mailing lists seems to
       have a release vote early this year.

This statement referred to the System 0.2 release [1]. SystemDS was
forked from Apache SystemML in Sep 2018, and this v0.2 was the last
release of the forked, non-ASF open source system (Mar 2020). After
PMC discussions end of 2019, we merged SystemDS with Apache SystemML
in Apr 2020, to form Apache SystemDS.

[1] https://github.com/tugraz-isds/systemds/releases/tag/v0.2.0

- curcuru: Reminder: to change the PMC's chair, you should have a PMC
            vote, and you must submit a resolution to the board.
            https://apache.org/dev/pmc#newchair

Thanks, I misinterpreted the guidelines. We now had a successful vote
and we have submitted the resolution to the board.

and answers. Of course, all official Apache business is still happening on the
mailing lists but newcomers seem to prefer using Slack.

The project will probably be proposing new committers soon, as some of the
regular contributions for the GraphQL API work have been consistently
contributing and providing great support to the project.

Here are some metrics:
- #unomi slack channel has 87 members !
- dev@unomi.apache.org had a 37% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (340
  emails compared to 532)
- users@unomi.apache.org had a 37% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (7
  emails compared to 11)
- 22 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-65% decrease)
- 13 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-82% decrease)
- 55 commits in the past quarter (-61% decrease)
- 9 code contributors in the past quarter (-35% decrease)
- 24 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-25% decrease)
- 23 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-28% decrease)

Attachment BZ: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Josh Thompson]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache VCL project is to create and maintain of software 
related to a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and 
brokers remote access to compute resources.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

## Project Activity:
- Last release: 2019-07-25
- VCL is primarily used by universities. With a new semester having recently
  started, time to put toward development has been pretty low. We hope to be
  able to focus more on development once things start to slow down for the
  semester and then work toward getting another release out.

## Community Health:
- VCL remains a small but functioning community.
- We're happy to have picked up a new PMC member.

Attachment CA: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Andrea Del Bene]

## Description:
The mission of Wicket is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Component-based Java Web Application Framework.

## Issues:
No issues require board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Wicket was founded 2007-06-20 (13 years ago)
There are currently 33 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:8.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Thomas Heigl was added to the PMC on 2020-08-14
- No new committers. Last addition was Thomas Heigl on 2020-05-18.

## Project Activity:
The most relevant activity of the last quarter has been the release of Wicket
9, which has been covered by two online magazines: the German based heise.de
and the sdtimes. At the same time we released the new 8.x version and the last
7.x which reached its end of life. We also managed CVE-2020-11976 inviting
users to upgrade Wicket to the latest versions. As final note, in the next
quarter we should rotate the Chair role to another PMC member, as we decided
to do after Wicket 9 has been released.
## Community Health:
Overall community health is good. The new Wicket 9 has been received very well
and we already integrated some external PR(*) to foster security standards
support. In general, the overall amount of feedback collected so far is enough
for the first minor release of 9.x branch, i.e. 9.1.0

Attachment CD: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Allen Wittenauer]


## Description:
The mission of Yetus is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
libraries and tools that enable contribution and release 
processes for software projects

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Yetus was founded 2015-09-15 (5 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-12-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-02-06.

## Project Activity:
Project has been very quiet the past quarter, with sporadic discussion about
switching form 'master' to 'main', the occasional help request, bug/rfe work,
etc.  The community health metrics below reflect that.

Overall, it's summer and people are busy with other things.  Nothing too
exciting to worry about... we are due to work on a release soon though, if
only to update the dependencies in our Docker image.

With the removal of builds.apache.org, the Yetus community has decided to move
their CI to GitHub Actions.  There are enough contributors that regularly use
Jenkins that it wasn't felt necessary to continue using that as a the baseline
test.  Additionally, jobs that we ran for the ASF's benefit ( JIRA<->Jenkins
patch submitter, docker cleanup, etc) would require significant retooling and
support effort to work in an equivalent manner under the new, broken up
layout.

## Community Health:

Down...

* dev@yetus.apache.org had a 29% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (25
 emails compared to 35)
* 12 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-20% decrease)
* 7 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-41% decrease)

... but not totally dead!

* 5 commits in the past quarter (-72% decrease)
* 6 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-57% decrease)
* 6 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-60% decrease)
