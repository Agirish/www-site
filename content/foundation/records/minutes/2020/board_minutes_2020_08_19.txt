 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       I don't have anything to report this month aside from the meeting
       agenda. If we have enough preapprovals, I will skip ahead to the
       consent agenda (7A) after the roll call to confirm those items that
       already have consensus, and then we can spend the bulk of the meeting
       on the remaining discussion items. I expect this to be another 30
       minute meeting, but try to reserve the full hour just in case.

       I hope to start experimenting with a private GitHub repository over
       the next month to see if a more familiar authoring and issue tracking
       tool can improve our development and tracking of foundation policy,
       possibly leading to another data source for the agenda tool.

    B. President [David]

       This month has been relatively busy with a lot of administrative
       activity.

       The Fedora project approached us with a need for a venue for their
       virtual conference which they weren't going to be able to acquire on
       schedule on their own. Their primary fiscal sponsor, Red Hat, agreed
       to compensate us for our cost if we could make our recently contracted
       platform available. Due to Rich having a conflict of interest, he
       brought the matter to me. I consulted the contract, Myrle Krantz as
       Treasurer and Tom Pappas in his role at Virtual were brought into the
       conversation and Tom sought additional guidance from our CPA. After
       clearing those hurdles I approved the request as a zero-cost way to
       help another open source community.

       This month we also spoke with a number of attorneys and engaged one
       boutique firm who can be on call for administrative matters similar to
       that of a in-house general counsel. (The attorney we used in the
       ApacheCon matter specialized in real estate and hospitality matters
       which was especially needful in that case, but that area isn't our
       primary need.) Since then we've initiated one contract review matter.
       This is following on the need Operations has for basic attorney
       functions and direction we received from VP Legal to source this
       function on our own.

       Thanks to help from Tom, we solicited and executed on renewals for D&O
       insurance and have received our confirmation of insurance.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       The Treasurer's office has signed and submitted an engagement letter 
       for our regular audit which should be starting soon.

       In addition the Treasurer's office has renewed our D&O insurance 
       through to August 2021.

       The Treasurer's office was also consulted with on the topic of 
       lending our Hopin access to a non-Apache event (the other event was 
       also paying for Hopin access, but had a timing problem).  With 
       Virtual's assistance, we determined that there was no financial risk
       to the Foundation in doing so, and provided our blessing for this use.

       The Treasurer's office was notified by Infra that our website is based 
       on deprecated technology, and that it is time to convert.  The 
       Treasurer's website is in need of a refresh from the ground up to 
       reflect new AP processes as well.

       Operating Cash on July 31st, 2020 was $1,959.6K, which is down $28.1K
       from last month’s ending balance (June 20) of $1,987.7K.  Total Cash
       as of July 31st, 2020 is $3,385.4K (includes the Pineapple, Restricted
       Donation and project funds) as compared to $3,866.9K on July 31st,
       2019, (a decrease of $481.5K year over year). The July 31st 2020
       ending Operating Cash balance of $1,959.6K represents an Operating
       Cash reserve of 13.5 months based on the “Estimated” FY21 Cash
       forecast average monthly spending of $142.2K/month.  The ASF actual
       Operating Reserve of 13.5 months at the end of July 2020 is slightly
       ahead of the July 2020 budgeted 13.4 months of reserve. The ASF
       Operating Reserve is well above the ASAE standard average of 6 months
       of reserve for Non-Profits.

       Revenue through July 31st  2020 was ahead of budget by $28.5K,
       primarily due to the timing of sponsor payments year to date vs the
       Budget. As compared to FY20, FY21 YTD revenue is behind by $269.7K. 
       This is due to sponsorship and registration revenue for ACNA and ACEU
       in 2019 ( $296.9K of Conference income in 2019 vs $0 in 2020), which
       is not happening in 2020, that is offset with more Foundation
       sponsorship payments( $32K more in FY21 vs FY21 at this point in the
       fiscal year) received through July 31st 2020 as compared to Foundation
       sponsorship payments received as of July 31st 2019.

       Expenses through July 31st, 2020 are over budget by $20.7K. This is
       due to timing of Conference expenses for the online event platform,
       planned for later in the year as well as the timing of the payments of
       the Anniversary video and timing of some Brand management invoices. 
       This is offset by underspending in all other depts.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY21 the ASF finished with a Negative
       <$176.9K>NI vs a budgeted negative <$184.7K> NI or $7.8K better than
       the Budgeted NI as of July 31st 2020.  FY21 compared to FY20 as of
       July 31st 2020, while we are behind in revenue, by $269.7K as noted
       above,  we are also behind on expenses by $40K.  So year over year as
       of July 31st 2020 we are behind in NI by $229.7K, though we are
       holding to our FY21 Budget.  For three months into the new Fiscal we
       are doing well as compared to budget.  However I will be connecting
       with dept heads and Fundraising so we can update our cash forecast for
       the final three quarters of FY21, as we complete the August 2020
       Financial close.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In July 2020, the secretary received 43 ICLAs, 8 CCLAs, 5 software
       grants, and 18 CoI affirmations. The secretary would like to thank
       Craig Russell and the Whimsy PMC for making the CoI affirmation
       process super easy and efficient.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       The highlights of my month are pretty well covered in the fundraising
       and conferences reports. I'm pleased that ApacheCon@Home sponsors have
       more than covered our costs for holding the event, which means we
       should also have extra funding for future virtual events, which Rich
       refers to. In fact, the unexpected challenge was that we agreed with
       one platinum sponsor to offer the unlisted benefit of a 15-minute
       keynote (which we've done at live events in the past), and thus
       extended it to all of them. Except most of our sponsors are platinum,
       so we may run out of time slots if any more come on board!

       adopted.

       Article I - Background
       Top-Level Projects are increasing using other
       distributions platforms to distribute releases to their
       users, and there is some confusion on how ASF policy
       applies to these platforms. There have been ongoing
       conversations on the Infrastructure and board lists
       about this and changes to distribution policy proposed.
       The policy change has previously had lazy consensus of
       the board. The Infrastructure project has requested this
       change via a board resolution as it is unsure it can
       make this change with only lazy consensus.

       Special Order 7F, Change Infrastructure distribution policy to
       refer to all platforms, was tabled.

    G. Regular Meeting Schedule

       A proposal to change the meeting to the fourth Wednesday of every
       month was withdrawn due to lack of consensus.

       Special Order 7G, Regular Meeting Schedule, was tabled.

    H. Change the Jakarta EE Relations VP

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors heretofore appointed
       Henri Yandell (bayard) to the office of Vice President,
       Apache Jakarta EE Relations, and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors is in receipt of the
       resignation of Henri Yandell from the office of
       Vice President, Apache Jakarta EE Relations, and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has found Rob Tompkins
       (chtompki) to be a qualified successor to the post of
       Vice President, Apache Jakarta EE Relations;

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Henri Yandell is relieved
       and discharged from the duties and responsibilities of the
       office of Vice President, Apache Jakarta EE Relations, and

       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Rob Tompkins be and hereby is
       appointed to the office of Vice President, Apache Jakarta EE
       Relations, to serve in accordance with and subject to the
       direction of the Board of Directors and the Bylaws of the
       Foundation until death, resignation, retirement, removal or
       disqualification, or until a successor is appointed.

       Special Order 7H, Change the Jakarta EE Relations VP, was
       approved by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsor status: we are pursuing renewals for one Platinum, one Gold,
three Silver, and one Bronze sponsors. We continue to pursue new
points-of-contact for one Silver sponsor, whose primary point-of-contact has
left the organization. One Platinum sponsor that was in arrears from FY2020 is
no longer being pursued for renewal. Payments have been received from one
Platinum Sponsor and one Gold Sponsor has renewed. Due to pandemic impacts on
their business, one Platinum Sponsor has renewed at a lower level and one
Bronze Sponsor was unable to renew. We are in the invoicing process with one
Gold and five Bronze Sponsors (two of whom are new Sponsors). We are
discussing a crypto-to-fiat contribution, reviewing Sponsorship options with
one candidate organization, and continue to explore options for future sponsor
prospecting.

2) Targeted sponsor status: discussions with two candidate Targeted Sponsors
interested in providing support to ASF Infrastructure have quieted, but we are
continuing to follow up.

3) Sponsor Relations: Ongoing Sponsor outreach, development, and communication
continues. We have issued a sponsor update focusing on the July
month-in-review, the FY2020 Annual Report, ApacheCon@Home, and Feathercast.

4) Event Sponsorship: Four Platinum sponsors have --DataStax, Instaclustr, Red
Hat, and VMware-- signed on for ApacheCon@Home. Three additional sponsors are
in-flight.

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $1,190 over the
past month. We have received a corporate matching gift from AOL. We had an
incident with a bot that was attempting fraudulent credit card payments via
donate.apache.org and slammed us with more than 600 messages in ~90 minutes.
The Hopsie team responded within the hour, stopped the attempts, and also
implemented a captcha challenge for all donations.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: all vendor payments are up-to-date.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support day-to-day
activities within ASF Fundraising. ASF Conference promotions continue across
ASF channels and will step up once the ApacheCon@Home program has been
announced. We issued the July Month In Review https://s.apache.org/July2020 ,
and published the third and final part of the "Inside Infra" interview with
Greg Stein https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Greg3 . We completed two major
milestones with 1) the release of "Apache Innovation", the fourth and final
segment of the "Trillions and Trillions Served" documentary
https://s.apache.org/ApacheInnovation , and 2) the FY2020 Annual Report, our
largest to date: highlights https://s.apache.org/FY2020AnnualReport-PR and
full report https://s.apache.org/FY2020AnnualReport . We are planning FY2021
reports, and have also updated the apache.org homepage to reflect our latest
activities.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 29 July --The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Annual Report for 2020
   Fiscal Year
 - 15 July --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® APISIX™ as a
   Top-Level Project
 - 15 July --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Wicket™ v9

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 8 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog,
including 5 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 327 news
summaries published to date. We tweeted 17 items to 57.5K followers on
Twitter, and posted 21 items to 42.7K followers on LinkedIn that garnered more
than 75.7K organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are on hold. Projects planning to
graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major
project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?"
highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to seven media queries. The ASF and Apache
Projects have received a total of 2,850 press hits vs. last month's 2,433.

VII. Analyst Relations: we had an interview with one firm on how ASF's vendor
neutrality protects Apache Projects from nefarious code encroaching into their
codebases, and was the main feature of an analyst article. We also spent
considerable effort helping a handful of researchers fact-check two industry
reports. Apache was mentioned in a total of 18 reports by Gartner, Forrester,
451 Research, and IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team published updates to the apache.org
homepage, and is working on additional changes that will be deployed in
August. They have also posted several videos on the ASF's YouTube channel
https://www.youtube.com/c/TheApacheFoundation/ . They are also finalizing
Central Services's intake form & process for new projects. The Editorial team
continues to help with drafting and publishing of the Weekly News Round-ups
and Month-in-Review summaries.

IX. Events liaison: we are helping promote ApacheCon@Home, and will continue
outreach when further information is available.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: we are establishing standalone accounts
for the ASF to eliminate any challenges with billing pass-throughs from HALO
Worldwide.

XI. Miscellany: We’ve reviewed promotions from three organizations that
highlighted their relationships with specific Apache projects. We solicited
and coordinated potential keynote speakers for a Big Data conference produced
by a third party in Europe. We solicited and coordinated COVID-related success
stories for a publication focused on Open Source healthcare. We responded to a
request to reproduce images from the ASF Website for a PhD program, provided
ASF performance metrics for a presentation on Open Source governance as well
as ASF historical metrics for a presentation on The Apache Way/Community Over
Code. We also coached the organizers of an Apache project summit and also a
project VP on ways to promote their activities.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Contact all communities still using the deprecated CMS service, and
  get them onto a plan for migration.
- Turn on Route53 for the bulk of our DNS provision.
- Move project VMs into PNAP.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Turn off the CMS.

General Activity
================
- Our email "outbound" IP was assigned to a new machine, as we
  continue to reconfigure our email systes/network. This removes more
  functions from our old/outdated box, which simplifies the ongoing
  work to upgrade/migrate to our standard Ubuntu layout.
- While performing the email systems upgrades, we have also up'd our
  game with SPF records (spam prevention) with the huge assistance of
  one of our community members.
- Lots of Jenkins work to migrate communities to our new clusters.
- Launched a new nightlies.a.o service for (large) transient files.
- Gitbox "v2" is in progress. Some services are moving from the v1
  system over to the v2, to minimize impact when the "big switch" is
  pulled. We're already using AWS' SQS to ensure that we don't lose
  data during any such migration.
- Our pubsub system has been upgraded to enable subscriptions to
  changes within private/protected repositories.
- Many migrations from older systems to Ubuntu 20.04 and Puppet v6.
- Solved a security issue within our download page scripting by
  tightening it up. At the same time, we were able to finish the
  deprecation of download assets from our primary TLP servers, and
  shifting them to our download server.
- Continued work on website publishing workflows. Notably, adding
  Jekyll as an option for communities. Hugo is also being explored,
  although we have not moved that into "official support".
- Our mirror system has been made fully IPv6 ready, including 
  proper geolocation features and supplying IPv6 visitors with
  a list of IPv6-enabled mirrors.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon @Home 2020 is now 41 days out (as of board meeting date). We
currently have:

1619 registrations
2540 USD in (optional!) ticket sales
3 keynotes
285 sessions
6 Platinum sponsors

ApacheCon @Home will be held on the Hopin.to platform, September 29th through
October 1st. We will be featuring content in two main time blocks - one
focused on a EU/NA audience, and another focused on an APAC audience. The full
schedule may be seen at https://www.apachecon.com/acah2020/tracks/ and is
still being filled out at the time of writing. Content has been provided and
curated by 29 different projects or communities, creating the widest (ie, most
tracks) ApacheCon ever. It will also be the largest ApacheCon yet in terms of
registrations.

Lessons learned from this event, and other online events in general, will
inform how we do events in the future, as audiences will expect an online
component to events going forward.

The Hopin platform is available to us all year, and after ApacheCon we intend
to make it available to projects to do smaller one-day events. We will figure
out details of this once we know the final cost of ApacheCon.

We had the opportunity to help Fedora put on their Nest With Fedora event
(called Flock To Fedora in non-pandemic years) -
https://hopin.to/events/nest-with-fedora/ - when they were unable to get
access to the Hopin platform in time for their event, and they shared our
Hopin account for that event. They will be compensating us for their use of
the platform. Additionally, we were listed as a sponsor of that event in
recognition of our help. David Nalley approved this as President.

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

  research methodology used in this project


*** Project: User Experience Research on new contributors ***
- advances with the interviews, but still not all of them available, need to
  do a final round of referrals, otherwise will limit the number of
  interviews. 


*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***
The progress of the current round (May-Aug 2020) goes as expected, feedback is
positive.  The current round ends on August 18th. We prepared the friction log
form and we will send it to mentors and interns on the 19th of August.  The
next round starts in late August. We are promoting the program and calling for
mentors for the upcoming round. See diversity-dev mailing list archives
(Outreachy Program: your chance to support your projects with internships) [1]

We updated the information regarding the Outreachy program to make it more
accessible to mentors.  To maintain flexibility in our schedules and provide
better details on our operations we reduced our weekly sync meetings to
bi-weekly synchronous meetings and asynchronous communications for no
sensitive topics on the mailing list.

Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

This was one of the most uneventful months on record (summer time perhaps?):

legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took a good care of
resolving most of these in time. We're up 1 (to 27), unresolved issues this
month.

Fun fact of the month: we've received our first legit request in Russian:
LEGAL-534

- Ant 1.10.8 was released on 2020-05-13. 
- Ant 1.9.15 was released on 2020-05-13. 
- Ivy 2.5.0 was released on 2019-10-24.

Migration of the buildserver Infra is setting up a replacement for
builds.apache.org. It is currently available as ci-builds.apache.org. The old
server will be turned off on the 15th August.
- let create a new 'folder' for Ant: created
- migrate / 'delete' the 34 jobs: in progress

Tests with early version of JDK 15 worked.

Hourly build on early-JDK-16 is set up (as part of matrix build Java8..16).
Testfailures for Java16-only are no checked yet.

The vote of retiring Ant 1.9.x in May 2020 failed due a lack of participation.
More discussion started with more points for retiring that branch. We'll start
a new vote later.

## Community Health:
For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done.
But basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development.

For IvyDE we lack the knowledge of building Eclipse plugins on actual 
Eclipse versions. We hope to get the build running again so we could update 
that.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:
The mission of BookKeeper is the creation and maintenance of software related
to Replicated Log Services which can be used to build replicated state
machines. During the past years it became a more general basic building block
for Distributed Storage Systems, as Apache Pulsar and other OpenSource
projects like Pravega.io and HerdDB.org.

## Issues:
No relevant issues for the board at the moment.

## Membership Data:
Apache BookKeeper was founded 2014-11-19 (6 years ago) There are currently 22
committers and 16 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Charan Reddy G on 2019-07-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Rajan Dhabalia on 2020-03-23.

## Project Activity:
The project is quite active even if we are not cutting releases very often.
4.11.0 was release on 2020-07-09
4.10.0 was released on 2019-11-06.

The project is moving forward with new features and bugfixes.


## Community Health:
New users are often using the Slack channel instead of the ML in order to get
in touch with the project, this has the effect to a reduced activity on the
user@ mailing list.  The activity on the ML is stable on dev@, and we are also
following a formal process to get major changes in (BookKeeper Proposals design
documents).

We had a BookKeeper dedicated track at PulsarSummit.com, a conference devoted
to Apache Pulsar.  We also have a few talks about BookKeeper at ApacheCon@Home.

We recently moved to GitHub Actions the CI jobs relevant to testing Pull
Requests.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
- We have released 1.5.8 in July 2019. We haven't had any activity since.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Cassandra was founded 2010-02-17 (10 years ago)
There are currently 56 committers and 34 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Michael Semb Wever on 2020-04-09.
- David Capwell was added as committer on 2020-07-22

## Project Activity:
This has been a busy quarter:
- We have 19 talks accepted for ApacheCon
- We have received a proposal for a sizeable code donation of all the client
  driver libraries maintained by DataStax. We are currently discussing how
  this would work in terms of onboarding committers, integrating with
  community, and structuring of artifacts and release cadences. We will most
  likely import the java-driver first (following the incubator process for
  donation) as a trial run to work out the process.
- DataStax has also offered to donate a substantial amount of documentation to
  the project along with resources for maintenance
- We have released 4.0-beta1 and received a good amount of press

Recent releases:
3.0.21 was released on 2020-07-29.
2.2.17 was released on 2020-07-24.
3.11.7 was released on 2020-07-24.
4.0-beta1 was released on 2020-07-20.

## Community Health:
Between the number of talks submitted for ApacheCon, the recent donations,
and the interest from 4.0-beta1, we feel the community is doing quite well. 

There is daily participation on both the user and dev slack channels and 
the number of users therein continues to increase. 

Traffic to dev@cassandra.apache.org had a 21% increase in the past quarter.

2. API Utility module version 2.0.0

The latest release was created on July 11, 2020.
The last module to be release in the next reporting period for having
a complete set of Apache Clerezza is the JAX-RS RDF Providers module.

Latest update of the Apache Clerezza Website was in February 2018.
Unfortunately, we don't have time yet to update the content of the Website.
Activity was concentrated on releasing all modules of Apache Clerezza.
We will update the Website afterwards.

## Community Health:
Community involvement is still low, but this was expected, since we haven't
put too much effort in improving that situation. This will be tackled after
all modules are released.

## Project Activity:

Community Track CFP
We had a successful response to the CFP for Apachecon@Home
and received over 35 submissions. We will have a 3 day Community track [1]
that will present content in 2 timezones. For the first time we will have
presentations in other languages than English.

Apachecon@Home 
We are working with the conference team to ensure a good
transition to an online conference. We are working on ensuring that all
speakers are registered in the platform and that we have coverage for Q&A
sessions during the presentations.

We also plan to have an online booth available so need to think about how it
will work and what activities we can do.

Feathercast 
We have kick started Feathercast as tool for
promoting projects. The objective is to have all projects represented. We sent
out a request for people to be interviewed about specific projects. We have
had a lot of interest and feedback has been very positive. We currently have
12 interview featured[2].and hope that this will continue to increase.

ALC 
We now have branding for ALC chapters and thanks to the Kenneth Paskett
from the Central Services team [3][4][5] 
ALC Beijing held their first meetup [6] 
ALC Indore held two webinars [7][8]and will be presenting a range of talks
in Hindi for Apachecon@Home 

GSOC 
Student evaluations were completed in July.

## Community Health:
Our dev mailing list has seen a decrease in traffic compared to the previous
quarter (557 emails compared to 696). This is probably due to the holiday
season. We expect to see increased activity levels as we continue towards the
buld up to Apachecon@Home.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
Apache CouchDB software is a document-oriented database that can be queried and
indexed in a MapReduce fashion using JavaScript. CouchDB also offers
incremental replication with bi-directional conflict detection and resolution.

## Issues:
Response to feedback from last report:

>  jm: What was stopping users of this unauthorized binary provider
     from providing the patches directly to the Apache project?

Nothing, that’s not what happened. Patches for bugs found running the
unauthorised binaries went directly into Apache CouchDB. This issue
was about a third party making binaries available for the Apache CouchDB
master branch, which is prohibited by ASF policy.


## Membership Data:
Apache CouchDB was founded 2008-11-19 (12 years ago)
There are currently 67 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jonathan Hall on 2020-02-12.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alessio Biancalana on 2020-02-27.

## Project Activity:

Significant progress has been made to add features and bugfixes to the
3.x release line, a new release here is in on the horizon.

Also, significant progress is being made on the design and implementation
of the next major release 4.0 in line with our expectations of progress here.
See previous reports for more details on 3.x and 4.x.

We are trialling GitHub’s new Discussions feature for end-user support. It
is being used in excess of our expectations and helps us to keep the bug
tracker clean: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/discussions — We appreciate
INFRA’s help in getting this set up.



## Community Health:

It being the summer quarter for most contributors plus the COVID-19 situation
has decreased overall project activity. That said, end-user support continues
tat normal levels.

## Health report:

Activity is low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User questions
(mostly on StackOverflow) and new Jira issues are being answered promptly. The
 short term goal is to develop the next micro version (2.3.31). The long term
 goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0 branch, so that the
 project can innovate and the code base can become much cleaner and more
 attractive for new committers.

 key-value stores, document stores, distributed in-memory key-value stores,
 in-memory data grids, in-memory caches, distributed multi-model stores and
 hybrid in-memory architectures. Gora also enables analysis of data with
 extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Apache
 Pig support.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Gora was founded 2012-01-24 (9 years ago)
There are currently 31 committers and 31 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Lahiru Jayasekara on 2020-04-30.
- No new committers. Last addition was Lahiru Jayasekara on 2020-04-28.

## Project Activity:
- 0.9 was released on 2019-08-15 and we are currently working on our
  development drive for next release. We haven't made significant progress from
  last report. However we received some minor code contributions on several
  improvements which currently in review at the moment.
- Received several contributions from an external contributor.
- 4 GSoC projects are going pretty well, By the end of the coding period, We
  are planning to integrate 4 new modules to the code base.  On the other hand
  We are expecting to expand our committer base further, with new GSoC
  participants.

## Community Health:
- We noticed some reduction in dev email traffic, however we are progressing 
with our usual development work. We hope to further increase level of 
development activities once we review the GSoC project work converted into 
pull requests.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Paul King]

## Description:
Apache Groovy is responsible for the evolution and maintenance of the Groovy 
programming language. Groovy is a multi-faceted JVM programming language.

## Issues:
No issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Groovy was founded 2015-11-18 (5 years ago)
There are currently 20 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Daniel Sun on 2019-05-06.
- Mikko Värri was added as committer on 2020-06-03

## Project Activity:
We continue to work on bug fixes for 2.5 and 3 and continue to assist
other non-Apache projects within the Groovy ecosystem move to 3.0.
We are also working on our roadmap for Groovy 4 and expect to
release an alpha version in the next quarter.

Recent releases:
- 2.4.20 was released on 2020-07-22
- 2.5.13 was released on 2020-07-22
- 3.0.5 was released on 2020-07-22
- 2.5.12 was released on 2020-05-21
- 3.0.4 was released on 2020-05-21
Downloads (Maven central/bintray only):
- For May/Jun/Jul quarter: approx 82 million
- last 12 months: ~275M
- since 2012 (when we started keeping stats from above repos):  ~574M

## Community Health:
The overall community status remains healthy. The community tries very
hard to be welcoming and interesting discussions continue to take place
at appropriate times. Large endeavours currently take a while to progress
due to the part-time nature of most contributors.

One key community building aspect for the project has been around
ApacheCon @Home. The project has a dedicated track and received interest
from numerous speakers. This is expected to remain a high focus for
the coming quarter.

Notable mailing list trends:
dev@groovy.apache.org had a 56% increase in traffic in the past quarter

This quarter, 272 commits were contributed from 19 contributors
including 13 non-committer contributors (10 new).

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
The mission of HTTP Server is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to Apache Web Server (httpd)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache HTTP Server was founded 1995-02-27 (25 years ago)
There are currently 125 committers and 54 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mario Brandt on 2020-04-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Mario Brandt on 2020-04-27.

## Project Activity:
The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.46 was released on Friday 2020-08-07 after a couple
of attempts at 2.2.44 and 2.4.45 hit some minor snags with back-ports.

I wish to personally thank our Release Manager, Daniel Ruggeri, for steering
the ship through these waters that is preparing and managing a httpd release.

2.4.46 brings further improvements and stability to our http/2 features, as
well as improvements in our mod_ssl core module.

The 2.4.46 release also addresses 4 CVEs, three of which are new, and finally
one which was previously fixed, but was later deemed worthy of a CVE
notification.

Additional improvements are currently being made and tested for mod_lua[1]
with upcoming support for Lua 5.4, and mod_ssl with OpenSSL 3.0.0[2].

Works is also underway to overhaul our documentation[3], primarily fixing
encoding issues with later versions of Java (used by our XSLT tool to build
our documentation)

Furthermore, we are making good headway with fixing compiler warnings for
Windows platforms.

Lastly, our new CI builds have proven very useful in catching issues early
on[4], primarily linked to compiling httpd or with/within our existing test
framework.

[1] https://s.apache.org/pfxw9
[2] https://s.apache.org/lo8al
[3] https://s.apache.org/z6xgj
[4] https://s.apache.org/mzqfw + https://s.apache.org/663xr etc.

## Community Health:
The overall community is considered very healthy. We had a great influx of
questions on our users mailing list with more than 100 people discussing httpd
usage, causing a 35% spike in traffic compared to last quarter. Our
development list had roughly the same activity level as last quarter, with a
late uptick as the 2.4.46 release was heading out the door and generally more
distinct topics than usual.

Code activity was also on the usual busy level (more than 350 commits this
quarter), and the number of code/docs contributors rose from 18 to 19.

On the "lines of code" side of things, we have seen a very large increase,
primarily attributed to two factors mentioned in the activity section;
documentation encoding fixes and getting ready for the new release.

Our new GitHub notifications list (notifications@httpd.a.o) is starting to
gain some traction, with 48 emails this quarter compared to just 2 in the
previous. This means people are starting to discuss issues on GitHub and the
development community is receiving and interacting with the feedback.

## Project Activity:
Developement
 - We made great progress towards our 0.6.0 major release, expecting first RC
   this week, as planned by the community.
 - Notably, we have merged support for bootstrapping any parquet datasets into
   hudi tables seamlessly, spark streaming/async compaction support, several
   performance fixes
 - Author of RFC-15 (design docs in Hudi) has an initial version working, we
   made progress on several key RFCs like record indexing, clustering
 - Few large PRs could not make it into 0.6.0, due to timeline risks/expanded
   scope. Plans are to target this on the first bug fix release in 0.6.x

Outreach
 - Hudi PMC and Contributors from Amazon gave a talk around past, present,
   future of PrestoDB/Hudi integration. Also authored a blog on presto site.


## Community Health:
 - We held our very first community code/design walkthrough session, attended 
   by almost ~10 contributors across time zones. Slides/Video recording shared 
   with entire community
 - Since the last report, we saw good uptick (38%) in conversations on dev
   mailing list. We also have a users mailing list now, but users are still
   preferring dev@
 - We are nearing almost 500 members on our slack channel.
 - Our project JIRA/Github activity recorded a 34% uptick, as we picked up pace
   towards 0.6.0

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Iceberg Project  [Ryan Blue]

## Description:
Apache Iceberg is a table format for huge analytic datasets that is designed
for high performance and ease of use.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Iceberg was founded 2020-05-19 (2 months ago)
There are currently 10 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- Shardul Mahadik was added as committer on 2020-07-25

## Project Activity:
0.9.0 was released, including support for Spark 3 and SQL DDL commands, support
for JDK 11, vectorized Parquet reads, and an action to compact data files.

Since the 0.9.0 release, the community has made progress in several areas:
- The Hive StorageHandler now provides access to query Iceberg tables
  (work is ongoing to implement projection and predicate pushdown).
- Flink integration has made substantial progress toward using native RowData,
  and the first stage of the Flink sink (data file writers) has been committed.
- An action to expire snapshots using Spark was added and is an improvement on
  the incremental approach because it compares the reachable file sets.
- The implementation of row-level deletes is nearing completion. Scan planning
  now supports delete files, merge-based and set-based row filters have been
  committed, and delete file writers are under review. The delete file writers
  allow storing deleted row data in support of Flink CDC use cases.

Releases:
- 0.9.0 was released on 2020-07-13
- 0.9.1 has an ongoing vote

## Community Health:
The month since the last report has been one of the busiest since the project
started. 80 pull requests were merged in the last 4 weeks, and more importantly,
came from 21 different contributors. Both of these are new high watermarks.

Community members gave 2 Iceberg talks at Subsurface Conf, on enabling Hive
queries against Iceberg tables and working with petabyte-scale Iceberg tables.
Iceberg was also mentioned in the keynotes.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.
There are presently 46 podlings incubating. In July, podlings executed 11 
distinct releases. We added 1 IPMC member and none retired. There were no 
IP clearances in June. A couple of new podlings are still being discussed 
and proposals prepared. One projects APISIX graduated last month.

This month we were missing reports from BlueMarlin, Liminal, NLPCraft, 
S2Graph, SDAP and Warble. Two podlings that failed to report are new which 
is concerning. Weex was unable to get sign off by its mentors. All will be 
asked to report next month. This is the third time that Warble has failed 
to report. As with last month, it's uncertain why a large number of 
podlings where unable to submit reports, but it's likely to be related to 
current external events. We've also seen more podlings needing to ask 
mentors and IPMC members to vote on releases and fewer mentors voting on 
releases.

MXNet is slowing working on its issues with ASF release and distribution 
policy. But as with last month report, more issues have been found. The 
project has taken steps to correct items in both sets of issues, but there 
are still some outstanding concerns. There has been a constructive 
conversation with NVIDIA about changing the licensing terms to be 
compatible with the Apache license, and another 3rd party (DJL / Amazon) 
has MXNet corrected branding and trademark issues. But despite this 
progress, the MXNet PPMC seems reluctant to fix these issues promptly and 
not is not following advice given.

An objection to guidelines on distributing releases on various platforms 
was brought up at the last minute (despite multiple conversations spanning 
over a year being held on these guidelines). This initiative has stalled. 
Technically the vote to approve these guidelines passed, but until the 
person clarifies or removes their objection, it's unclear how to proceed. 
The person did not respond to requests to clarify their objections. If this 
can't be resolved, it may require the board to step in.

The Incubator has organised a track for the upcoming Apache@home conference.
 
Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases and on 
graduations and new proposals.

SDAP sorted out its subscription/roster issues, but Spot still needs to do 
so despite multiple reminders.

--------------------
## Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and
humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

  3. Demonstrate good governance through voting on process improvements.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community calls continue. A few new developers and projects have reached
  out with interest in using the project. Developing this community is the
  highest priority of the project right now.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has made its first release. In the month since, the community
  has converted the project to TypeScript, added a DOM/HTML text 
  highlighting

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences.
Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream
and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to
computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than
traditional, exact methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Adding more committers. We have just added our first new committer
     since incubation! We have a few more individuals that have been
     consistent contributors to the project that we will soon want to
     go through the new committer election process. This is a big change
     from our last report where we had no candidates at all. 
  2. Fill out the Maturity Model
  3. Prepare for Graduation.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  We could use some help in finding people who would find working in 
  the sketching algorithms area really interesting and would want 
  to work with us to become committers.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  The word is getting out! We presented talks at the USPTO 2020 tech 
  conference and the Spark & AI 2020 conference, mentioned in the last 
  report, with lots of good feedback. 

  We will be co-authors in a tutorial on sketching technology at the 
  upcoming ACM-KDD conference in August with one of the world's 
  leading scientists in streaming algorithms and sketching.

  We have been invited to give a keynote talk at the upcoming 
  DataCon2020 in Taiwan in early September.

  We have been accepted for a talk at ApacheCon again this year.

  We also are seeing a big increase in the number of single PRs coming 
  from a number of different people, especially for our C++ components, 
  which is very good news. This proves that there is growing 
  interest in the project and there are folks out there that want to 
  contribute to the project. 

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  See the releases since the last report below. 

  In addition we have made significant improvements to our website 
  thanks to some external contributors! 

  To the best of our knowledge all of our licensing and website issues 
  have been addressed and have been implemented in formal releases or 
  are in master-branch staging, awaiting the next release.

  - 2020-05-07 incubating-datasketches-java 1.3.0 

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

  August, 2020 

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  Yes, in general. However, we do have to prod them with reminders 
  to check-off our releases. Our releases have been taking 
  longer and longer to get through the voting process especially 
  when it is in the 2nd IPMC phase. A little help here would 
  be appreciated. 

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

  To the best of our knowledge, yes. 

  * Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings
    name and brand? 

    As far as we know, yes. 

  * If not what actions has the PPMC taken to correct this? 

    We have not had to face this issue yet. 

  * Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?

    Yes, and it is clearly stated as such on 
    http://incubator.apache.org/projects/datasketches.html

## PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to
help make the web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce
latency and bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Grow the number of active developers
  2. Enhance the release process: switch to github tagged release to
  simplify.
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Mailing lists and git issues are active. The number of active developers
  is unchanged.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The first incubator release has been announced after field-testing.
  Furthermore, small enhancements are being contributed from people outside 
  of
  the initial committer group. Major changes have landed on master: the 
  build
  system has been refreshed to leverage bazel, c++17, abseil and Envoy. All
  dependencies have been refreshed and sanitized where possible.
  As a side-effect, some of the remaining issues from the WIP-DISCLAIMER 
  have
  been addressed.

  - MPL licensed source code for http date parsing replaced with our own
  version
  which leans on abseil. That part is all Apache licensed now. 
  - The no longer contains compiled code pulled in from dependencies.

  A simple PoC port to Envoy has landed, as a first step towards running
  PageSpeed
  as a stand-alone sidecar service (where traffic of arbitrary servers can 
  be
  routed
  through it via transparent proxying or L7 routing).

  - As far as we know the brand is respected by third parties. We-Amp
  mirrors the incubator site over at modpagespeed.com - but will work
  on transferring the domain name to the ASF this quarter.
  - It's not known if the VP, brand has explicitly approved, so that is
  something we need to make sure about and resolve.

## Toree

Toree provides applications with a mechanism to interactively and remotely
access Apache Spark.

Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  In my opinion, I believe Toree is one of those small but useful projects
  that,
  except for being very active, would be ready to graduate. Having said 
  that,
  where there is an important issue or for voting new members and releases
  the
  PPMC show up and participate (see example of last committer/release 
  thread).

  I have started updating the podling related artifacts such as project 
  page,
  etc
  and will try to start graduation discussions before the next report.

  1.Increase active contributors
  2.
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Similar pattern with a few Q&A on both Gitter and mailing list.

## Training

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for
training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various Apache
and non-Apache target projects.

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Promote the information about Apache Training Project with increased 
     participation from community
  2. Create a tutorial on how the tools provided by this project can be 
     used to create own content
  3. Review current policies around contribution review and releases to 
     find a pragmatic compromise 

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  Due to recent changes in work being done remote has led to change of 
  format
  for many conferences and trainings.
  The Training project can be very valuable in dissemination of knowledge
  in this situation. We hope to adapt to new format of learning in this
  situation.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Activity has increased since the last report.
  There were 71 posts in last 3 months.
  We have received contributions from other Apache projects like COMDEV and
  other individual contributors.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  New training slides were added on three topics:

  * Apache Hadoop
  * Apache Hive
  * Apache COMDEV

  PR activity has picked up momentum since the last report.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
  There are currently some issues with this podling that we are working to
  address,
  we believe that the issues are not yet critical and can be turned around
  from within the community but want to make the board aware of this early 
  on.

  The name search process has not yet been started, as there is still time 
  to
  do that
  if and when graduation draws nearer. The PPMC is actively monitoring usage
  of the Podlings current name on other sites.
  The Podling is not directly affiliating with any sponsors donating content
  and presenting an independent image on the webpage.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. [Branding
  issues](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WEEX/Branding+issues).
  There are about 10 git repos violating the trademark of Apache Weex,
  together with their NPM/Maven artifact.
  2. [Community


  diversity](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WEEX/Communtiy+divers
  ity). Apache Weex needs more PPMCs and committers from community, no
  employees from a single company shall have majority vote in PPMC and
  committer.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Dave Fisher: I see no relevant email from the dev team on dev@ or private@
    since March. There is activity on commits@ from git activity which means
    work is being done. I think that there should be discussion about the
    trademark issues on private@ along with a Podling Suitable Name Search.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform for efficiently storing
and processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========
We released 2.6.0, which includes the following new features:
- TLSv1.3 has been enabled by default for Java 11 or newer.
- Significant performance improvements, especially when the broker has
large numbers of partitions
- Smooth scaling out of Kafka Streams applications
- Kafka Streams support for emit on change
- New metrics for better operational insight
- Kafka Connect can automatically create topics for source connectors
- Improved error reporting options for sink connectors in Kafka Connect
- New Filter and conditional SMTs in Kafka Connect
- The default value for the `client.dns.lookup` configuration is
now `use_all_dns_ips`
- Upgrade Zookeeper to 3.5.8

This release also includes other features, 74 improvements, 175 bug fixes,
plus other changes.

We are also in the process of releasing 2.5.1, which fixes 72 issues since 
the 2.5.0 release.

We are actively working on replacing Zookeeper with an internal Raft based
consensus service. This will simplify the operation of Kafka and allow
Kafka to handle many more partitions.

We are also actively working on tiered storage support which decouples the
storage from the compute in Kafka.

Community
===========
Dev mailing list had a 20% increase in traffic in the past quarter (3248 emails
compared to 2685).

We added 2 new PMC members, Mickael Maison on Jul. 30, 2020 and John Roesler
Aug. 9, 2020. We added 2 new committers, Boyang Chen on Jun. 22, 2020 and
Xi Hu on Jun. 23, 2020.

The now virtual Kafka Summit Austin (August 24-25, 2020) has more than 20,000
registrations so far.

We also have a new layout for the Apache Kafka website.

Releases
===========
2.6.0 was released on Aug. 3, 2020.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

## Description:
The mission of Knox is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Simplify and normalize the deployment and implementation of secure Hadoop 
clusters

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Knox was founded 2014-02-18 (6 years ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 18 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Sandor Molnar on 2019-11-20.
- No new committers. Last addition was Sandor Molnar on 2019-11-21.

## Project Activity:
* 1.4.0 was released on 2020-04-26
* Focus was on the KnoxShell client functionality with features for the
interactive shell that enable JDBC and HTTP/REST access to tabular data
through Knox - presenting it in a dataframe like object for continued
manipulation and aggregation.

## Community Health:
I believe decrease in email list traffic and other metrics are due to a number
of root causes. While it has been considerably less than last quarter,
the fact that the last release introduced a brand new area of concentration
inflated the amount of bootstrapping issues, commits and related emails.
A large number of dependency upgrades and other hygiene related work was done
for the last release as well. This quarter has not had a release focus though we
likely have a enough bug fixes for a maintenance release. The planning for the
next feature bearing release will begin shortly - with continued focus on cloud
and client interactions with cloud deployments from KnoxShell.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.16 release on May 6,
2020.  The next major release was due on August 30, 2020, and is currently
       awaiting a release candidate.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Cihad Guzel as committer on 8/16/2019. We nominated
and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did not sign up
any new PMC members or committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the
lookout for new PMC members and committers.  The light level of activity this
quarter has limited our pool of new developers considerably.

In the latest quarter the team has been working on ironing out problems with
the JDK 11 port.  Activity otherwise has been very light; clearly the pandemic
is interfering to some extent with user development and adoption.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been fairly quiet this quarter.  Requests for
connector development continue to be heard.

I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache OpenWhisk Project  [Dave Grove]

## Description:
The mission of Apache OpenWhisk is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a platform for building serverless applications with functions

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenWhisk was founded 2019-07-16 (a year ago)
There are currently 49 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Rob Allen on 2019-07-16.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexander Klimetschek on 2020-03-12.

## Project Activity:

The project made releases of 4 OpenWhisk components since the last report:
- openwhisk-runtime-dotnet-1.15.0 was released on 2020-08-04.
- openwhisk-wskdebug-1.3.0 was released on 2020-08-04.
- openwhisk-runtime-nodejs-1.16.0 was released on 2020-07-27.
- openwhisk-package-alarms-2.1.0 was released on 2020-05-11.

The project currently releases 9 language-specific components that support
defining OpenWhisk actions in specific programming languages
(openwhisk-runtime-LANGUAGE). Seven of the these runtime components include a
proxy web server implemented in Go, which was being built using Go v1.12. As
Go 1.12 which has reached its End-of-Life, we decided to defer making the
next release of the core OpenWhisk system until we had refreshed these seven
runtimes to use Go 1.14.  Some initial PRs have been submitted; we anticipate
completing this refresh within the next month.  We will then return to
working on releasing the core system.

## Community Health:
Statistical measurements of project activity such as dev-list traffic show
significant declines since the previous quarter.  Based on conversations with
multiple community members, I believe we are mainly seeing the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, not a deeper problem in community health.  The strain
of changed work and family situations has reduced the time available to
community members to participate in open-source projects that are not their
primary work activity. If activity continues to decline, we may need to
re-evaluate this interpretation and consider options for re-engaging
our community in project development.

--- mod_perl --

mod_perl 2.0.11 was released on October 5th 2019

-- Activity --

Nothing significant hapenning on the mailing-lists, as can be expected at this
tine.

Without significant bugs found or reported, it's not unusual to see this level
of quietness.

There has been a few lenghty conversations about the relevancy of
Perl/mod_perl for web development in today's world.


-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, as usual.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers.

No new changes to the committer base since last report.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Phoenix Project  [Ankit Singhal]

## Description:
The mission of Phoenix is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
High performance relational database layer over Apache HBase for low latency 
applications

## Issues:
No issues to report to the board at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Phoenix was founded 2014-05-20 (6 years ago)
There are currently 51 committers and 33 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Istvan Toth was added to the PMC on 2020-07-06
- No new committers. Last addition was Gokcen Iskender on 2020-02-07.

## Project Activity:
* Apache Phoenix had its last release of 4.15.0 on 2019-12-20. 
And, since then we have been actively working towards for our next 4.16.0
 and 5.1.0 release. Current work is to bring some fixes in
parity between both the release lines.

* We are also figuring out a plan to do the release of adopted Apache 
projects(Omid, Tephra) and started preparing for the first release of our 
 derived repos phoenix-connectors and phoenix-queryserver.

 * Phoenix PMC took over the ownership of pypi account of PhoenixDb 
and started preparing a release of our python-based phoenix driver 
for the first time after adopting PhoenixDb through code donation.

* We had a discussion to make our binary release of 4.x branches on Java8 
but had to defer it again, due to the dependency on HBase runtime 
which can still run on JDK 1.7.

* To avoid conflict with guava version in a user runtime, a new repository 
phoenix-thirdparty was created to keep the shaded version of guava so that all 
downstream phoenix modules and public APIs can refer it 
consistently.

* We also appreciate the committers who identified and 
fixed the time-consuming tests to improve our overall build efficiency 
so that new fixes can be verified faster and reduces some friction 
for the new contributors.

## Community Health:
Phoenix continues to be an active and growing community. With 
new contributors and active committers, there is always a 
continuous flow of reviews and commits happening.

We have not added any new committers in the last half year though as PMCs ,
we did evaluate few contributors but noone stand out at that time, 
but we will take this action item again and be more frequent in evaluating 
and nominating new contributors.

There is a slight drop(-15%) of traffic on our dev mailing list from last 
quarter, though the traffic on user mailing list and number of active 
contributors are holding steady. 

We have seen an improvement in resolution time of issues in this quarter 
by 25% and our created-to-resolved ratio is still 4:3.

I may be missing some statistics as community health metrics 
is not available(or not complete as it used to be) on the 
reporter tool so had to extract few of these manually.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache POI was founded 2007-05-16 (13 years ago) There are currently 40
committers and 32 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Axel Howind on 2019-11-11.
- Sayi was added as committer on 2020-08-04

- Sayi was invited as PMC, the notice to board is underway, so he will join
  the PMC shortly

## Project Activity:
 - Some bugfixing and smaller features work did happen, mostly in HSLF/XSLF
   area, rendering of slides as well as some code quality work.

   There is a larger rework of the build-system underway to improve support
   for Java 9+, this is planned to be released as major version 5.0.

## Community Health:
 - There are some questions from users about features/behaviour which
   indicates that the popularity of Apache POI is still high. Questions via
   email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   There is still activity from multiple committers. We are looking at ways to
   broaden the developer base but not many potential committers show up on the
   mailing lists currently.

   Overall issue count went up a bit there is still a fairly large number of
   reported bugs in various states of triage.

### XMLBeans
 - Code-structure and buildsystem were reworked to prepare for an upcoming
   release 4.0.

   The main build for XMLBeans 4.0 is now modulized for Java 9+, some more
   work might be necessary to finish this before we can release XMLBeans 4.0.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode.

## Bugzilla Statistics:

### Apache POI

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache REEF Project  [Sergiy Matusevych]

## Description:

The mission of REEF is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

Apache REEF was founded 2015-11-17 (5 years ago)
There are currently 35 committers and 22 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Doug Service on 2017-09-28.
- No new committers. Last addition was Scott Inglis on 2018-09-27.

## Project Activity:

we've finished a major overhaul of the project's dependencies this quarter.
A minor release 0.16.1 planned for this quarter is currently blocked by a
few failing unit tests. We will fix the issue and complete testing in August
and publish REEF 0.16.1 as a long-term stable release. 

### Mailing list activity:

 - dev@reef.apache.org:
    - 86 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months)
    - Same amount of traffic in the past quarter (25 emails)

 - user@reef.apache.org:
    - 20 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months)
    - 0 emails sent to list (0 in previous quarter)

### JIRA activity:

 - 2 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (2 last quarter)
 - 6 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (2 last quarter)

### GitHub PR activity:

  - 6 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (3 last quarter)
  - 9 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (2 last quarter)

## Community Health:

The engagement from the community has been declining perhaps because the
codebase has been stable, although there is some splash of new activity on
release 0.16.1 this quarter. We expect more engagement from existing members
once we start working on the elastic group communications for the next
release.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

As per the boards request we discussed the Attic and there was strong support
for continuing the River project, despite activity being relatively quiet, it
does appear that the board was not aware of our commit history due to the
project's use of svn and a stable trunk branch.  Development is currently
performed in the modules branch, which doesn't appear on github or show up in
commit statistics.

Since the boards request to consider the attic, the project team has voted to
change from svn to git, however due to the number of branches and separate
components, we are still trying to figure out how to execute the change.
Additionally the project has also voted to change the modular build from Maven
to Gradle.

The River project typically operates in maintenance mode, however there is an
ongoing long term undertaking to make River's monolithic codebase modular.

The modules branch will become the stable trunk branch after the next release,
this modular build has been a significant undertaking, hence the long time
since the project's last release.

##Commit statistics (from commits@river.apache.org):

July 2020    64 commits

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Roller Project  [David M. Johnson]

## Description:
Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based blog server that works well on
Tomcat and MySQL, and is known to run on other Java servers and relational
databases. The ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org runs on Roller 5.0.3 Tomcat
and MySQL.

## Issues:
No issues require board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Roller was founded 2007-02-20 (13 years ago) There are currently 11
committers and 7 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Swapnil Mane was added to the PMC on 2020-05-23
- Michael Bien was added as committer on 2020-08-04

## Project Activity:
Roller has been pretty quiet this quarter with only minor enhancements and bug
fixes. One fix was to eliminate use of the term "blacklist" and replace it
with the more descriptive terminology "banned words list".

## Community Health:
Community is fairly quiet but healthy as you can see by the recent additions
of a PMC member and a new committer.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description:
The mission of Santuario is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
XML Security in Java and C++

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Santuario was founded 2006-06-27 (14 years ago)
There are currently 17 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Daniel Kulp on 2018-10-01.
- No new committers. Last addition was Daniel Kulp on 2018-10-01.

## Project Activity:
There was one release over the previous quarter - version 2.2.0 of the Apache
Santuario - XML Security for Java library. This was a new major release that
was some time in the making. Since then we have had fixes for three issues
applied that were contributed to the project. A 2.2.1 release will probably
happen before the end of the year.

The Java project has completed a move to GIT, the C++ project remains on SVN.
We have also migrated our build jobs to the new Jenkins instance.

## Community Health:
Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
the PMC.

potentially merited a Serf 1.3.x release, was ultimately reverted.
Therefore, no Serf 1.3.x release was deemed necessary.

Work continues on investigating a 1.4.x release - however, no ETA at
this time.

## Community Health:
Nothing particular of note; community is low-traffic, but responses
are received in a timely manner.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:
The mission of Apache SIS is the creation and maintenance of software providing
data structures for developing geospatial applications compliant with the model
of OGC/ISO international standards.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache SIS was founded 2012-09-19 (8 years ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johann Sorel on 2017-09-07.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexís Manin on 2019-07-05.

## Project Activity:
Development is steady with about +20,000 lines of code and +10,000 lines of
comment in last 3 months. Those developments include a JavaFX application,
mentioned in previous report as an attempt to attract users and developers by
illustrating SIS capability (but the SIS mission is still to provide a library
independently of JavaFX). This application will be shown during the ApacheCon
Geospatial track on September 30 in "Visualize Apache SIS capabilities with
raster data" talk. Other developments in last 3 months are about raster data
(remote sensing).

A #sis channel has been created on https://the-asf.slack.com/ and announced on
the developer mailing list. Discussion started about choosing a website
technology in replacement of Apache CMS.

## Community Health:
Activity on the mailing list is low, but emails posted (e.g. about slack
channel or website technology) usually get a quick response from peoples
different than the usual committers, which is encouraging.

Almost all work in the last 10 months is happening on a branch. For peoples
observing "master", the Apache SIS project may look inactive. This situation
is caused by work contributed last November which needs some refactoring before
merge (for avoiding merge conflicts), and that review did not happened yet by
lack of time. A similar situation happened before SIS 1.0 release where another
contribution also took almost one year to be reviewed. The repetition of this
situation suggests that we need to reconsider our work flow (branching, etc.).
I have not seen expression of frustration yet (the community seems patient),
but we are aware that this issue needs to be considered seriously.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, R and SQL as well as a rich set
of libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph
analytics.

Project status:

- We released Apache Spark 3.0.0 on June 18th, 2020. This was our largest
  release yet, containing over 3400 patches from the community, including
  significant improvements to SQL performance, ANSI SQL compatibility, Python
  APIs, SparkR performance, error reporting and monitoring tools. This release
  also enhances Spark’s job scheduler to support adaptive execution (changing
  query plans at runtime to reduce the need for configuration) and workloads
  that need hardware accelerators.

- We released Apache Spark 2.4.6 on June 5th with bug fixes to the 2.4 line.

- The community is working on 3.0.1 and 2.4.7 releases with bug fixes to these
  two branches. There are also a number of new SPIPs proposed for large
  features to add after 3.0, including Kotlin language support, push-based
  shuffle, materialized views and support for views in the catalog API. These
  discussions can be followed on our dev list and the corresponding JIRAs.

- We had a discussion on the dev list about clarifying our process for
  handling -1 votes on patches, as well as other discussions on the
  development process. The PMC is working to resolve any misunderstandings and
  make the expected process around consensus and -1 votes clear on our
  website.

- We added three new committers to the project since the last report: Huaxin
  Gao, Jungtaek Lim and Dilip Biswal.

Trademarks:

- We engaged with three organizations that had created products with “Spark”
  in the name to ask them to follow our trademark guidelines.

Latest releases:

- Spark 3.0.0 was released on June 18th, 2020.
- Spark 2.4.6 was released on June 5th, 2020.
- Spark 2.4.5 was released on Feb 8th, 2020.

Committers and PMC:

- The latest PMC member was added on Sept 4th, 2019 (Dongjoon Hyun).
- The latest committers were added on July 7th, 2020 (Huaxin Gao, Jungtaek Lim
  and Dilip Biswal).

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Nathan Hartman]

The Apache Subversion® version control system exists to be universally
recognized and adopted as an open-source, centralized version control
solution characterized by its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data;
the simplicity of its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs
of a wide variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no board-level issues at this time. However, we would like to
  make the board aware of the following:

  This quarter, we made a long-awaited milestone release. Our PMC was blocked
  from announcing it on the ASF-wide announce@a.o mailing list by one of the
  list's moderators who acted unilaterally. We feel this was unjust and
  outside the scope of moderation, but more importantly, it interfered with
  the normal operations of our PMC.

  As we have not yet exhausted the normal path of escalation, we are not
  requesting any board intervention at this time.

* Community

  Our developer community is all-volunteer and we'd like to begin by thanking
  everyone for their hard work and support.

  This quarter began with a flurry of activity in the run-up to our recent
  1.14 release (see Releases below). This is our most important release since
  1.10 in 2018 and the first since our 20th Anniversary.

  We'd like to thank Sally and ASF Marketing for assisting us with a Press
  Release to announce this major milestone.

  Since the release, our developer mailing list has quieted down considerably
  as we all catch our breath. However, we have been receiving constructive
  feedback and bug fixes. These are gradually being vetted for inclusion in
  an upcoming point release.

  Our user support forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers
  regularly and our dev@ list has been receiving bug reports and patches for
  bug fixes.

  We have added one PMC member since the last report:
  Jun Omae (jun66j5@) joined the PMC in May 2020.

* Releases

  Our most recent release, 1.14.0, was made on 27 May 2020.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache SystemDS Project  [Jon Deron Eriksson]

## Description:
SystemDS is a machine learning (ML) system for the end-to-end
data science lifecycle from data preparation, validation, and cleaning,
over efficient ML training, to model debugging and deployment. Data
scientists specify ML algorithms or ML pipelines in a high-level
language with R-like syntax - or through related Python and Java APIs,
and the system automatically generates hybrid runtime plans of single
node, in-memory operations as well as distributed operations on top of
Apache Spark.

## Project Status:
- The name change from Apache SystemML to Apache SystemDS has been
   completed (thanks to the INFRA team for changing all relevant services
   such as JIRA, Github URLs, website, and mailing lists).

- We're currently in preparation the SystemDS 2.0 release,
   hopefully to be released by end of August or soon thereafter.

- Change project chair: The SystemDS PMC (including its chair Jon Deron
   Eriksson) agreed to the resolution of making Matthias Boehm the new
   SystemDS chair (see private@ message, May 13), and Matthias is happy
   to take over this responsibility.
 
## Membership Data:

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Thiago Henrique De Paula Figueiredo]

## Description:
The mission of Tapestry is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Component-based Java Web Application Framework

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention. Answering jm's question ("May
it be time to clean up your roster a little?") Is this just about the private
list or the committer and PMC member roster too? If this the former, yes, we
can definitely do that. If the latter, than we
(or at least I) need to research the right of doing it. I don't think Tapestry
 ever did that. Roll call? Indeed, we have a number of non-active people still
 in the committer and membership rosters.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tapestry was founded 2006-02-14 (14 years ago)
There are currently 27 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Dmitry Gusev on 2019-09-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Balázs Palcsó on 2019-01-17.

## Project Activity:
No new releases, but we've working towards a new major release, 5.6.0,
very soon. One security vulnerability was reported to our team,
but it's already fixed in source and it's going to be released in 5.6.0.

## Community Health:
In the one hand, the users mailing list traffic was pretty low this quarter.
Interestingly, we had more traffic in the dev list, mostly in preparation for
the 5.6.0 release, than in the users one. Tapestry is a mature project with no
major new features or changes in the last years, so I'd say a decrease in mail
traffic is expected.

dev@tapestry.apache.org had a 0% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (50
emails compared to 50) users@tapestry.apache.org had a 90% decrease in traffic
in the past quarter (6 emails compared to 59) 8 issues opened in JIRA, past
quarter (60% increase) 5 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (25% increase) 19
commits in the past quarter (-5% decrease) 1 code contributor in the past
quarter (-50% decrease)

We're delighted to welcome a new committer to the project, Daniel Dias Dos 
Santos, who has continued to contribute to the project regularly after 
becoming a committer.

The project has been attempting to release more rapidly, and ideally this
would become a monthly activity, at least on the TomEE 8 branch, to follow
the Tomcat release cycle. One problem is being able to obtain PMC votes in 
timely manner, and we are looking to address this be considering new PMC
members.

## Activity

Jakarta EE 8 is the last release with code under the javax namespace and
Jakarta EE 9, aimed for release this fall, has all code migrated to the
jakarta namespace in one large breaking change.  Aside from the namespace
change, the APIs are unchanged and intentionally identical.

TomEE 8.x currently implements Jakarta EE 8 with around 95% passing and some
work left to do to completely pass all TCK tests. Since the previous report
the project has worked on providing a version of TomEE which uses the jakarta
namespace. This has been achieved using using the Eclipse Transformer on the
server at build time, and a new TomEE Maven Plugin which uses a novel
technique to patch particularly tricky items in upstream libraries that the
Eclipse Transformer is unable to handle. This technique allows the project to
produce binaries for both the javax and jakarta namespaces from the same
codebase, therefore reducing maintenance overhead for the project.

The project made TomEE 8.0.3 and 9.0.0-M1 releases available on June 23rd,
to co-incide with the Jakarta EE 9 milestone launch. TomEE 9.0.0-M1 passed
92% of the Jakarta EE 9 TCK at the point of release.

Work continues on the website rebranding and updating of the technology
used. David Jencks has put considerable effort into migrating the website
to Antorra, and this is being rolled out. The previous website used the
Apache CMS, which is being phased out, so this is a timely update. We're
extremely grateful for David's hard work in this area.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Traffic Control Project  [David Neuman]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Traffic Control is the creation and maintenance of
software related to building, monitoring, configuring, and provisioning a large
scale content delivery network (CDN)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring the board's attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Traffic Control was founded 2018-05-15 (2 years ago)
There are currently 25 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Robert Butts on 2020-03-12.
- No new committers. Last addition was Matthew Jackson on 2020-02-26.

## Project Activity:
Traffic Control 4.1 was released on 06-17-2020.  This was our second release
this year, which was a great accomplishment for the community.  We are hoping
to have our next release out before ApacheCon. We have scheduled a one day
track for ApacheCon and the community is looking forward to it.  The community
is hopeful that we can get as much out of the online format as we do in
person.

## Community Health:
The community continues to be challenged in finding diversity, especially in
terms of contributors.  We continue to see new users joining the community and
we are retaining the users we have, but it seems as if the types of users that
are coming to the project are not the ones that contribute back.  We continue
to discuss ways that we can encourage more contribution for our user base.  We
still feel like we have a healthy community despite the continued lack of
diversity.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Turbine Project  [Georg Kallidis]

## Description:
The mission of Turbine is the creation and maintenance of software related to a
Java Servlet Web Application Framework and associated component library

## Issues:

The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.

## Membership Data:

Apache Turbine was founded 2007-05-16 (13 years ago)
There are currently 11 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jeffery Painter on 2017-11-12.
- No new committers were added. The last change to the committer base was the
 addition of Georg Kallidis (2012-09-19).

## Project Activity:

- Turbine Parent 7 was released on 2020-06-25
- Fulcrum Component yaafi-crypto has been prepared and is in voting process.

## Community Health:

Turbine project has seen only quite low levels of activity in the last
quarter. As integration of Db Torque is set next (big step) and Project Db
Torque is in voting process, after it's release, this could be done and
released.

After that, which might need one or two quarters, Turbine developer community
is invited to discuss, what will be next.

## Project Activity:
 - CI setup with ASF Jenkins still in progress. Daily builds are in place but
   configuration needs to be investigated as builds are not green.
 - Experimentation with using newer versions(5.x) of Elasticsearch vs.
   supported older version (1.7).
 - There is interest in making a new release as there are many bug-fixes and
   features in the latest of master. We are working to identify a committer
   who can take on the responsibility of managing the release.

Recent releases:
 - 2.1.0 was released on 2016-02-18.
 - 1.0.2 was released on 2015-07-20.

## Community Health:
Growth is flat and use of Usergrid has been stable with no issues reported
recently. There has been interest for modernizing
Usergrid -- upgrading Cassandra/Elasticsearch to the latest version and
containerizing Usergrid. However, there has not been any significant
contributions for this yet.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Whimsy is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information
lookup activities

## Issues:
As I have now reported for over year, I (Sam) remain concerned that there
are not enough developers on the board agenda tool.  There was an effort
underway to make this tool more approachable to developers, this effort
involved a rewrite to Node.js.  That effort has failed to attract any
new developers.

## Membership Data:
Apache Whimsy was founded 2015-05-19 (5 years ago)
There are currently 11 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Matt Sicker on 2020-04-11.
- Matt Sicker was added as committer on 2020-04-09

## Project Activity:
Notable changes made this quarter:
 - new COI reporting tool
 - support for emeritus requests
 - library support for SVN has been significantly redone, now
   supports svnmucc, and will support passwords from stdin.
 - a whimsy-vm6 virtual machine is in the process of being set up.
   This will be based on Ubuntu 20.04.

## Community Health:
More than enough oversight, increased interest in extending a number of tools.

One tool (as noted above) has a bus factor isssue.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
Apache Xalan exists to promote the use of XSLT. We view XSLT (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language Transformations) as a compelling paradigm that transforms 
XML documents, thereby facilitating the exchange, transformation, and 
presentation of knowledge. The ability to transform XML documents into usable 
information has great potential to improve the functionality and use of 
information systems. We intend to build freely available XSLT processing 
components in order to engender such improvements.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Xalan was founded 2004-09-30 (16 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 5 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-02-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-03-20.

## Project Activity:
The project activty was low until a nice uptick in Xalan-C: XalanC-1.12 was
released on 2020-06-07.

## Community Health:
The project health is poor due to the low level of activity. 
There is some interest in a new Xalan-J release but
not enough folks to do the work available.
