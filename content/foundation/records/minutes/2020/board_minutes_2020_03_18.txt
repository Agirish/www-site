 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       The COVID-19 pandemic has had several effects on the operation of the
       Foundation. Many face-to-face conferences and meetings have been
       postponed or canceled, including Apache conferences and other open
       source and vendor conferences. More cancellations are expected before
       the situation is resolved.

       Considering that most of Apache's work communication happens via
       email, the functioning of the individual projects seems to continue
       with minimum disruption. If any member of the Apache community needs
       help dealing with the pandemic, they should let us know.

       The annual Members Meeting is on track and is expected to be conducted
       as normal. A reminder will be sent for everyone to submit a proxy if
       they are not sure they can attend the first part of the meeting via
       IRC. The membership will be asked to vote on recommending that the
       board update the Bylaws to change gender-specific terms to
       gender-neutral terms.

       Thanks to Patricia Shanahan for leading the effort to adopt a formal
       Conflict of Interest policy, which will be voted on shortly.

    B. President [Sam]

       As a reminder, I would like David Nalley to be considered the acting
       President at this time.

       I've forwarded on the rare emails I have received as President to
       David, and have not noted any problems that have occurred due to my
       deferring to David.  To the contrary, I've been very pleased with the
       changes he has already instituted, in particular the monthly
       operations calls and the more rigorous checking that expenses that are
       incurred are actually charged against the right line items in the
       budget.

       At the present time, I'm assuming that the official changes in
       positions will be done by the new board.  I don't foresee that being a
       problem.

       I contributed to the COI policy that is being drafted and am
       supportive of its adoption.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Operating Cash on February 29th, 2020 was $2,107.4K, which is down
       $30.4K from last month’s ending balance (Jan 20) of $2,137.8 K.  Total
       Cash as of February 29th, 2020 is $3,501.3K (includes the Pineapple,
       Restricted Donation) as compared to $4,052.8K on January 31st, 2019,
       (a decrease of $551.5K year over year). The February 29th 2020 ending
       Operating cash balance of $2,107.4K represents an Operating cash
       reserve of 9.7 months based on the “Estimated” FY20 Cash forecast
       average monthly spending of $249.9K/month.  The ASF actual Operating
       reserve of 9.7 months at the end of February 2020 is a bit ahead the
       budgeted 8.7 months of reserve for YTD February 29th, 2020.  The
       estimated YE Operating reserve of 10.5 months is ahead of the Budgeted
       YE reserve of 7.6 months.  The ASF Operating reserve is above the ASAE
       standard average of 6 months of reserve for Non-Profits.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Revenue is behind budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $288.6K (this is partly due to timing of
       sponsor payments and Conference and Donations lagging a bit behind
       budget at this point in the Fiscal)  The open Accounts Receivable is
       very healthy at $448K, which as of the February 20 Financial Close is
       enough, if it all arrives in the bank, before 4.30.20, to achieve the
       FY20 Foundation Sponsorship Budget. As compared to FY19, FY20 YTD
       revenue is ahead by $131.6K primarily due to FY20 Events exceeding
       Revenue as compared to FY19, YTD.

       YTD expenses through February 29th, 2020 are under budget by $237.8K,
       spread across all depts except Conferences, Infra and D&I, which are
       minor amounts, comparatively speaking.  The updated Cash forecast
       expects this underage in expenses to continue through the end of the
       Fiscal year.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$288.9K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$238K> NI or $50.9K behind the
       Budgeted NI for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  The cash
       forecast has been updated, with the information we have at hand,  and
       at this point with about 2 months left in the Fiscal year, we are
       still on pace to,  if everything goes according to the Forecast, 
       exceed our FY20 budgeted NI.  I want to thank the Dept heads for their
       review of the FY20 actual activity which has allowed us to move some
       expenses to the correct accounts and departments, which has made the
       cash forecast a much more valuable management tool as we move forward
       and close out FY21.   With regard to FY19, we are ahead in revenue, by
       $131.6K as noted above, but we are also ahead on expenses by $989.1K
       (due to ACNA19, ACEU19, the Lease web payment which should have taken
       place in FY19, but did not,  as well as other expenses that occurred
       in FY20 and not in FY19); thus, year over year NI FY20 is behind FY19
       by $857.5K.  It is estimated that this will even out, to a degree, as
       the FY20 progresses.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In February, the secretary received 74 ICLAs, 2 CCLAs, 4 SGAs, and 3
       emeritus requests. Note that these emeritus requests are from the past
       three months are were not all sent in February; they were officially
       filed in February.

    E. Executive Vice President [David]

       This month has been a busy one for the Operations side of the ASF. The
       COVID-19 pandemic has generated a lot of work for Conferences,
       Marketing & Publicity, Fundraising, Travel Assistance, and
       Infrastructure.

       FY21 Budget
       ===========

       A good deal of work has been done by those officers with budgets, both
       in vetting the items charged against them, as well as preparing plans
       for the coming year. The current proposed budget shows a loss of
       roughly 176k. Just to begin preparing folks and start the discussion
       you can view my budget worksheet here:
       https://s.apache.org/FY21-Draft-Budget

       We still have some account rejiggering to do, but I suspect we're
       close to final form. I am still missing a few smaller numbers and I've
       highlighted those cells in yellow, and that will change as we move
       forward.


       Fundraising
       ===========

       Despite all of the extra work from the pandemic, and the normal good
       work; I do want to call out what I see as an incredible victory from
       the Fundraising team in a multi-year commitment from one our Platinum
       sponsors.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Working smoothly despite the increased workload.

       Travel Assistance
       =================

       TAC was ramping up to support roadshows, but that's no longer needed.
       TAC has also realized that they keep standing up web apps for
       collection of information about applicants. With the need to support
       ever more of these, they are looking for something that demands less
       volunteer time. They're working on creating a requirements list as
       well as discussing what others who do similar work in our space are
       doing.

       D&I
       ===

       Survey hasn't materially moved but should have progress to report by
       next month.

       I highly recommend that all Directors read the friction logs from the
       first Outreachy session. There's very valuable insight there. Because
       of the small number and privacy concerns, members and Directors can
       read those on the D&I private list.

       The upcoming Outreachy term has three projects teed up.

       Privacy
       =======

       A GDPR request has been handled.

       Work remains to be done on a repeatable process and governance.

       Conferences
       ===========

       Conferences has cancelled or postponed 3 Roadshows thus far.

       Work continues forward with ApacheCon.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       Assisted with preparing files and communications for our Annual
       Member's Meeting this month.

       As an all-online organization, the recent COVID-19 disruptions are not
       a direct issue for most of our operations.  However, as an
       all-volunteer organization, many development activities may take
       longer than expected, as our volunteer committers spend time keeping
       their families safe.  A big thank you to all of our communities for
       their help in this turbulent time.

 7. Special Orders

    A. Change the Apache CloudStack Project Chair

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors heretofore appointed Paul Angus (paul_a)
       to the office of Vice President, Apache CloudStack, and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors is in receipt of the resignation of Paul
       Angus from the office of Vice President, Apache CloudStack, and

       WHEREAS, the Project Management Committee of the Apache CloudStack
       project has chosen by vote to recommend Sven Vogel (svogel) as the
       successor to the post;

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Paul Angus is relieved and
       discharged from the duties and responsibilities of the office of Vice
       President, Apache CloudStack, and

       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Sven Vogel be and hereby is appointed to
       the office of Vice President, Apache CloudStack, to serve in accordance
       with and subject to the direction of the Board of Directors and the
       Bylaws of the Foundation until death, resignation, retirement, removal
       or disqualification, or until a successor is appointed.

       Special Order 7A, Change the Apache CloudStack Project Chair,
       was approved by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

    B. Adopt a COI policy

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors desires to increase clarity around
       correct handling of conflicts of interest, and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors desires to hold our organization to the
       highest standards of transparency

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the following conflict of interest
       policy, be adopted, and that the Secretary be charged and entrusted with
       the record keeping which results from Articles IV and VI, and that the
       Chairman of the Board be charged and entrusted with the ensuring the
       performance of periodic reviews as described in Article VII.

       Article I - Purpose

       The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the
       Apache Software Foundation's (ASF's) interest when it is
       contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might
       benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the
       ASF or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction.
       This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable
       state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to
       nonprofit and charitable organizations.

       Article II - Definitions

       1. Principal Officer: A principal officer is an officer other than a PMC
          chair who holds no other office.

       2. Interested Person: Any director or principal officer who has a direct
          or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested
          person.

       3. Financial Interest: A person has a financial interest if the person
          has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:

          a. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the
             ASF has a transaction or arrangement,

          b. A compensation arrangement with the ASF or with any entity
             or individual with which the ASF has a transaction or
             arrangement, or

          c. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation
             arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the
             ASF is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

       Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts
       or favors that aren’t insubstantial.

       For purposes of this policy, an ownership or investment interest that is
       insubstantial need not be disclosed.

       A financial interest isn’t necessarily a conflict of interest. Under
       Article III, Section 2, a person who has a financial interest may have a
       conflict of interest only if they declare a possible conflict of
       interest or the appropriate board decides that a conflict of interest
       exists.

       Article III - Procedures

       1. Duty to Disclose

       In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an
       interested person must choose one of two paths:

          a. They can disclose the existence of a possible conflict of
             interest, and recuse themselves from the affected decisions,
             without giving any more information.

          b. If the interested person believes the financial interest does not
             constitute a conflict of interest they must disclose the existence
             of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose
             all material facts to the directors and members of committees with
             governing board delegated powers considering the proposed
             transaction or arrangement.

       2. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists

       In case of voluntary declaration of a possible conflict of interest
       and recusal, the conflict is presumed to exist.

       If the interested person declares a financial interest without
       voluntary recusal then after disclosure of the financial interest and
       all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested
       person, the remaining board or committee members shall decide if a
       conflict of interest exists.

       3. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest

          a. An interested person may make a presentation to the board or
             relevant committee, but shall not cast a vote on the transaction
             or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.

          b. The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if
             appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to
             investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or
             arrangement.

          c. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee
             shall determine whether the ASF can obtain with reasonable efforts
             a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or
             entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.

          d. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement isn’t reasonably 
             possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest,
             the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority
             vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or
             arrangement is in the ASF's best interest, for its own benefit,
             and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the
             above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to
             enter into the transaction or arrangement.

       4. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy

          a. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe
             a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of
             interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief
             and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged
             failure to disclose.

          b. If, after hearing the member's response and after making further
             investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing
             board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an
             actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate
             disciplinary and corrective action.

       Article IV - Records of Proceedings

       The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board
       delegated powers shall contain:

       a. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to
          have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible
          conflict of interest. If the interested person did not choose
          voluntary recusal, the nature of the financial interest, any action
          taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the
          governing board's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of
          interest in fact existed.

       b. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes
          relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the
          discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or
          arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the
          proceedings.

       Article V - Compensation

       a. A voting member of the governing board who receives compensation,
          directly or indirectly, from the ASF for services is precluded from
          voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation.

       b. A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes
          compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or
          indirectly, from the ASF for services is precluded from voting on
          matters pertaining to that member's compensation.

       c. No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose
          jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives
          compensation, directly or indirectly, from the ASF, either
          individually or collectively, is prohibited from providing
          information to any committee regarding compensation.

       Article VI - Annual Statements

       Each director, principal officer and member of a committee with
       governing board delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which
       affirms such person:

       a. Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,

       b. Has read and understands the policy,

       c. Has agreed to comply with the policy, and

       d. Understands the ASF is charitable and in order to maintain its
          federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which
          accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

       For purposes of this article, a Project Management Committee (PMC)
       having only the normal powers of a PMC is not a committee with governing
       board delegated powers.

       Article VII - Periodic Reviews

       To ensure the ASF operates in a manner consistent with charitable
       purposes and doesn't engage in activities that could jeopardize its
       tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic
       reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:

       a. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable,
          based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's length
          bargaining.

       b. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with
          management organizations conform to the ASF's written policies, are
          properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for
          goods and services, further charitable purposes and don't result in
          inurement, impermissible private benefit, or in an excess benefit
          transaction.

       Article VIII - Use of Outside Experts

       When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, the
       ASF may, but need not, use outside advisers. If outside experts are
       used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its
       responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.

       Special Order 7B, Adopt a COI policy, was approved by
       Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues operating smoothly with renewals and business-as-usual
work. We are pursuing renewals for one Gold, two Silver, and two Bronze
sponsors. One sponsor has deepened their commitment to The ASF by upgrading
to Platinum and signing a multi-year sponsorship agreement. We are waiting
for purchase orders to invoice renewals for one Platinum and one Gold
sponsor. One Gold and one Silver sponsor have been acquired and are sorting
out their future budgets/strategy. We have been seeking a new
point-of-contact for one Silver and one Bronze sponsors. One Gold sponsor is
in arrears. We had no new Sponsors this month.

We are finalizing our outreach to our Targeted Sponsors to confirm their
commitment to renew their benefits to The ASF through 2020. We will continue
to work on developing a new Targeted fund specifically earmarked for TAC
recipients to ASF events in collaboration with the TAC team, but will hold
off on its launch until travel bans and coronavirus-related issues ease. We
also received a new Targeted donation to benefit Apache Tomcat.

We have reached out to all Sponsors regarding their renewals, per their usual
sponsorship cycle. We also pre-pitched sponsorship opportunities for ASF
Conferences in 2020. We will be following up to share the Q3 Operations
Summary as well as the ASF Statement on the COVID-19 coronavirus Outbreak and
an update on ASF conferences.

Support for ASF Conferences in 2020 continues as usual, comprising 3
Roadshows in North America and 1 in Europe, as well as ApacheCon North
America. We have ceased sales for those Roadshows that were cancelled or
postponed due to the coronavirus.

We earned $2,215 over the past month from individual donations and corporate
giving. We have been experiencing a high volume of repeat fraudulent donation
attempts over the past few months, and have successfully worked with Hopsie
and ASF Infrastructure to resolve the issue.

other ASF operations areas mistakenly applied against the M&P budget, as well
as reconciling a small handful of bills that continue to be presented by a
vendor that has already been paid. We intend to resolve the outstanding issues
during March to avoid a scramble at the end of the fiscal year.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising with Sponsor Relations outreach, Sponsorship renewals, Targeted
Sponsor commitments, pursuing outstanding sponsorship fee payments. We have
successfully secured commitment for a multi-year Platinum sponsorship which
will commence towards the end of FY2020. We are also making arrangements for a
one-off corporate donation valued between ASF Platinum and Gold levels to be
received before the end of FY2020. We are also developing a specific Targeted
fund towards TAC sponsorship for Apache events, but will be holding off on
launching due to widespread corporate travel bans and serious health risks by
travelling to events. Our work with ASF 2020 Conferences has shifted towards
assisting with status notifications for those events impacted by the
coronavirus. We also published The Apache Software Foundation Statement on the
COVID-19 Coronavirus Outbreak https://s.apache.org/COVID-19 , as well as sent
messages of support and encouragement to ASF Sponsors and Committers during
this difficult time; the FY2020 Q3 Report/Operations Summary
https://s.apache.org/r6s5u , "Success at Apache: Google Summer of Code
Mentorship --inside the GSoC 2019 Mentor Summit" https://s.apache.org/ejj5q ,
and the February edition of the Apache Month in Review (a new monthly overview
of events that have taken place within the Apache community)
https://s.apache.org/Feb2020 . Post-production continues on the ASF
documentary, "Trillions and Trillions Served".

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe.

3 March - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Brooklyn(TM) v1.0
27 February - The Apache Software Foundation Announces 20th Anniversary of
Apache® Subversion®

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 14 items on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups and 2 monthly overviews were issued, with a
total of 299 news summaries published to date. We tweeted 28 items to 56.3K
followers on Twitter, and posted 21 items on LinkedIn that garnered more than
73K organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are on hold. Projects planning to
graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major
project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?"
highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to five media queries. The ASF received
1,276 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,213. Media coverage of
Apache projects yielded 1,622 press hits vs. last month's 1,180. ApacheCon
received 3 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received two briefing requests and one extended
fact-check. Apache was mentioned in 2 reports by Gartner; 8 reports by
Forrester; 6 reports by 451 Research; and 5 reports by IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team have been updating the Apache
project logo page and updating all "Powered By Apache" badges where possible.
Our work on a new home page for Central Services requests (both Creative and
Editorial) continues. We continue to grapple with gaps in editorial production
due to volunteers' limited availability.

IX. Events liaison: we have been assisting a member of the "executive team"
with their keynote presentation at a Sponsor-run event, which has since become
an online event due to the coronavirus. We received offers to hold an ASF
booth at two Apache project events, and are seeking local volunteers from
ComDev to participate, providing that they are still taking place. We have
also been providing supporting communications regarding the coronavirus impact
on ASF Conferences, including Apache Roadshows and ApacheCon.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: all accounts are auto-renewing through
2020 to ensure we have constant service and access without interruption. We
have been experiencing some accounts issues with one of our vendors following
their acquisition and double-rebranding: it appears that their systems are
still not fully integrated, as we continue to simultaneously receive
confirmation of payment and overdue bill notifications. In addition, their
online press release distribution management system mis-assigned a
HALO-originating, non-ASF project to the ASF account. HALO will be reimbursing
the ASF for the amount and paid in error.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- The Infrastructure F2F in Nashville has been canceled. Our
  accomodations have been fully refunded. It is unclear whether
  flights will be refunded; we have spent about US$3250.
- One of our staff departed the Foundation on March 13, 2020. We will
  begin the hiring process to backfill this position.
- The Board requested specific reporting upon our CI/CD services. We
  have pulled together a page to gather insights:
    https://infra-reports.apache.org/cistats/
  We will continue to refine this page, specifically to delineate
  projects using their own build nodes vs those of shared nodes.

Finances
========
We submitted a revised budget to the President, incorporating a new
line item for the service which runs lists.a.o. This expense had
historically not appeared within Infra cost accounts, so we missed
carrying this forward into the FY21 budget.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- TravisCI renewal contract.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Continued CI/CD capacity growth.

General Activity
================
- blogs.a.o was migrated to 1804/p6, in coordination with M&PR.
- Groundwork for switching to AWS Route53 for DNS management.
- CI/CD statistics gathering and reporting.
- Working with our mirror provides to move them to https: if possible,
  in light of Chrome eventually disabling downloads from http: sites.
- Continued work on new Jenkins masters for project-specific groups of
  build nodes.
- Stood up pubsub.a.o as a new service to coordinate various actions
  across the Foundation. It is intended to replace the ad-hoc systems
  in use today, under a single cover. This will incorporate git/svn
  commit notifications, website publishing, PR/issue updates from
  GitHub, and more. Future work will incorporate better resiliency,
  replay, monitoring, and insights which are missing from today's
  variant systems.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

In light of the World Health Organization raising the threat level about the
COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, we have decided, after much consideration, to
cancel or postpone the three Apache Roadshows that were scheduled to occur in
the next few months.

Details have been posted to the blog:
https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/notice-on-apache-2020-conferences

Apache Roadshow, DC, scheduled for 25 March has been canceled.

Apache Roadshow, Chicago, scheduled for May 18-19, has been canceled.

Apache Roadshow, Seattle, scheduled for June 10-12, has been postponed until
further notice.

ApacheCon North America, New Orleans, scheduled for September 28 - October 1
is still planned to occur.

Two more events are being planned, but we have no published details on them at
this time.

* Apache Roadshow, Europe
* Apache Roadshow, China

Individual event reports follow:

Apache Roadshow, DC

Apache Roadshow DC 2020 is canceled.  Attempts were made to switch to a
virtual event but we were unable to get enough speakers interested.  Otherwise
everything to shut it down is now complete: All checks have been returned, all
tickets refunded, all vendors notified, all swag canceled, all food cancelled,
and all speakers notified.

Apache Roadshow, Chicago

Website updated. Tickets refunded. Speaker notified of cancellation. Venues
cancelled. Will file expense reimbursement for $30 fee at one venue (only
explicit cost for ARS-Chicago).

Apache Roadshow, Seattle

Seattle roadshow has been postponed. No new date has been selected as of this
time.

ApacheCon North America, New Orleans

We continue to move forward with this event. The Call for Presentation is
still open, and we have received 52 proposals so far. This is about on track
with what we usually see, with most of the proposals arriving in the last 2
weeks before the deadline, so we have no cause for concern here.

We are receiving queries about sponsorship, and many sponsorship opportunities
still remain open.

Apache Roadshow Berlin

Eu Roadshow Berlin is currently in preparation to go public (Homepage is in
preparation). The date although is not fixed and we will wait for more details
until we will fix a date but currently it looks like it will be August. We
will try to prepare everything (without signing contracts) to be ready to
announce a date as soon as we are confident with one.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Current Events
==============

No current events

Future Events
=============

TAC has an events Calendar that it shares with other Committees for the
purposes of cross-committee planning and collaboration. Currently filled our
up until October. Due to the cancellation of many events, currently the next
supported event will be ApacheCon New Orleans.

Any ASF Project putting on a Hackathon and/or Meetup should also talk to TAC
about supporting them getting folks there (Committers and Non Committers)

Short Term Priorities
=====================

We are looking into creating a new webapp, one that is independent on the
reliance of one or two volunteers, that can be maintained and serve TACs needs
for the next few years. The webapp would need to be ready and tested before
applications open for the next event.

Long Term Priorities
====================

Be ready for applications open for ApacheCon NA, applications should be open
by early June.

Mailing List Activity
=====================

No list activity since the previous report.

Membership
==========

No changes to the TAC membership since the last report.

[Outreachy activity report missing, will update once it's in]

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:

None

...

*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***

The first Outreachy program round has been concluded. 
The friction log has been sent to the intern and two co-mentors.

We set a reminder to get the friction log from intern and mentors.

Friction log templates have been filled up by mentors and mentee. We are going
to analyze the information of the friction log to improve the current process
and experience in the Outreachy program. 

We've got 3 projects for the second round of the Outreachy program: May-August 2020:
- Extend & Improve Apache Airflow REST API 2020 May to 2020 August round -
- Improve Apache Camel website 2020 May to 2020 August round
- Improve the UI of Apache Airflow 2.0 

Contribution period is open: March 5,2020 to April 7, 2020
We are working to create a FAQ page for the Outreachy program. [2]

## Health report:

The dev@ and diversity@ mailing lists continue to be slow, not too much
activity outside the work done for each ongoing project. The discussions have
been focused on topics that pertain to the projects we are running.


## Committee members changes:

None.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

Operational: First genuine GDPR request (removal) handled; but actual
governance & long term recording not yet sorted properly (e.g. making sure
that the details of this request are automatically purged when they hit
delaware record law limits, etc).

Strategic: Not made as much progress as I wanted - largely due to the chair
(personally) being swamped & not enough delegation.  The latter should become
unstuck as we start creating deliverables.

Next: Define these deliverables/plan; find 3-6 volunteers for the operational
part & write down SOPs; talk to infra to figure out what is practically
possible around retention.

Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're down 2 (to 20),
unresolved issues this month.

Henri Yandell has indicated that he may want to step in to replace Mark
Struberg as VP Jakarta EE Relations. With renewed involvement, hopefully we
can finalize discussions with the Eclipse Foundation.

Due to recent global events, progress on  various binary distribution
channels that ASF controls is slow, but it is still on my radar.

DLA Piper started to review our by-laws.

We reviewed (and approved with modifications) an Associated Partner contract
text from the KNX Association (LEGAL-509) and also Bylaws of the OPC
Foundation
(LEGAL-508).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 12: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

This month saw an issue in Tomcat CVE-2020-1938 which gained press
interest when it was given branding and a name and was disclosed by a
third-party co-ordination centre before Tomcat released an advisory
(although after the issue was fixed in new releases of Tomcat).
Although serious if exploited, it only affected Tomcat installations
which exposed an unprotected AJP Connector to untrusted networks
(which is already not a good thing to do even without this issue).
That limits the number of affected installations.

Stats for Feb 2020:

      20        [license confusion]
      26	[support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 23 (last months: 40, 23, 31, 29)

      6	        [dubbo]
      5         [site]
      2	        [tika]
      1	        [asterixdb], [cloudstack], [guacamole], [httpd], [iotdb],
      1	        [logging], [openwhisk], [sling], [spamassassin], [tomcat]

     In total, as of 1st March 2020, we're tracking 52 (last month:
     53) open issues across 30 projects, median age 81 (last month:
     69) days.  37 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     6 (last month: 4) of these issues, across 3 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  None require escalation.

## Project Activity:
Project activity has actually been very low indeed! No dev@ work 
has been logged in JIRA since 2019-10-17. Put simply, the project
is going through a very quiet period indeed.
In October of 2019 the PMC was actually working on a release...
this stalled as there were several Spotbugs issues which were
being worked on. That work did not finished so the release
was never finished. The next steps are for that work to resume and
for the project to make a formal release. Right now, no plan is in place
for when that will be!

## Community Health:
Although the community is not growing, as of Oct 2019, the small
community was responsive and quite eager to see a release. 
Once work is completed on the Spotbugs issues and we make a release
we will hopefully see a bit of community activity as we roll
out application upgrades.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Axis was created on 2001-01-19 (19 years ago).

There are currently 63 committers and PMC members in this project, a vote in
2010 made all committers automatically PMC members.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained.

There continued to be light but consistent traffic of new users this past
quarter on the Axis2 Java users mailing list.

While best known for SOAP, the future of Axis2 Java is with JSON and REST.
AXIS2-5943 applied some JSON message related bug fixes and fixes for the JSON
samples. Also, docs were added on how to send JSON via Curl as an HTTP client
for REST based web services.

The goals for the next Axis2 Java release continue to be JDK 11 support, by
removing the remaining deprecated com.sun dependencies from the code base.

Time was spent this past quarter on trying to get the nightly builds via
Travis working again - which depend on github syncing with our svn repo but
that stopped working. Discussions about our Github future (with 3+ PMC
members) are currently occurring on java-dev@axis.apache.org.

Axis2 C PMC member Bill Blough was "in the middle of making some
bugfixes/improvements to the build system" this past quarter. The
communication continues to be good.

## JIRA Activity for Axis2 java

- 3 JIRA tickets created in the last 90 days.
- 3 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 90 days.

multiple distributed analytic platforms, extending their reach with a
diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data sources.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:

contributions enhancing the existing extensions for both 
Apache Spark and Apache Flink.

There is a need to produce a new release of the Flink extensions but work
has not started by the community. 

There is also a need to catch up on Spark extensions release.

## Description:
Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Apache 
Hadoop ecosystem. The primary goal of Bigtop is to build a community around the 
packaging and interoperability testing of Hadoop-related projects. This 
includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, runtime, upgrade, 
etc...) developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather 
than individual projects. In short we strive to be for Hadoop what Debian is to 
Linux.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Cayenne Project  [Michael Ray Gentry]

# Apache Cayenne Board Report, March 2020

## Description

Apache Cayenne is a Java database persistence framework. It takes a
distinct approach to object persistence and provides an ORM runtime,
remote persistence services, and a cross-platform GUI database
mapping/modeling tool.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data

Apache Cayenne was founded 2006-12-19 (13 years ago).
There are currently 23 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Nikita Timofeev on 2017-06-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Arseni Bulatski on 2018-12-10.

## Project Activity

Development is focused on Cayenne 4.1 and 4.2.  Prior versions are
maintenance-only.

- Cayenne 3.1.3 (aging)
  - Maintenance only.

- Cayenne 4.0.2 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Cayenne 4.1.RC2 (beta)
  - Expecting to release Cayenne 4.1 as soon as final bugs are fixed and
    tested.

- Cayenne 4.2M1 (development)
  - Most development work is focused on this version.

### Releases

- Cayenne 3.1.3 on 2018-07-25.
- Cayenne 4.0.2 on 2019-10-14.
- Cayenne 4.1.RC2 on 2019-10-29.

## Community Health

Cayenne is healthy.  Development activity is stable and and we have a
stable user and developer community.

### Mailing List Activity

- dev@cayenne.apache.org had a 70% decrease in traffic in the past
  quarter (18 emails compared to 60).
- user@cayenne.apache.org had a 65% decrease in traffic in the past
  quarter (34 emails compared to 96).

Mailing list traffic decrease is hopefully due to fewer issues being
discovered with the 4.1 RC release.

### JIRA and GitHub Activity

- 8 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-68% decrease).
- 7 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-50% decrease).
- 37 commits in the past quarter (-76% decrease).
- 2 code contributors in the past quarter (-33% decrease).
- 7 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (75% increase).
- 4 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (400% increase).

JIRA and GitHub activity likely reflects the mailing list activity with
fewer issues arising from the 4.1 RC release.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Javier Puerto on 2012-07-06.
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
I don't really understand why the report last month was flagged as
'minimal' and 'last-minute report'. The report was approved by the PMC and IMHO 
there was nothing more to say. Project's activity is obviously low, but answers
are given quickly when required.
The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14 
The project is mainly in maintenance mode.

## Community Health:
Still very few activity on the
project. Still active PMC members around here. There was some activity on
users list showing that the branch 2.2 is still in use, while all activity was
previously mainly on branch 2.1

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Curator Project  [Jordan Zimmerman]

## Description:
The mission of Curator is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Java libraries that make using Apache ZooKeeper easier

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Curator was founded 2013-09-17 (6 years ago) There are currently 13
committers and 13 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Shay Shimony on 2019-04-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Shay Shimony on 2019-04-18.

## Project Activity:
- Interest in Curator has increased recently matching the increased activity
  from new committers in ZooKeeper.
- We have two new releases planned:
  - 4.3.0 is a bug fix release being voted on right now and will hopefully be
    released soon
  - A possible 5.0.0 is being worked on to make Curator compatible with the
    upcoming 3.6.0 release of ZooKeeper
- The Curator team is working on a number of things:
  - Some important bug fixes were merged from the community for 4.3.0
  - Refactoring and removing a bunch of cruft/tech debt for upcoming 5.0.0
  - Added new features to support corresponding ZooKeeper 3.6.0 features

## Recent Releases
- Apache Curator 4.2.0 was released on 2019-03-06.
- Apache Curator 4.3.0 is being voted on right now and will be released as
  soon as the community accepts this version
- We have plans for Curator 5.0.0 sometime in 2020

## Community Health:
Curator is healthier than it has been in a while. We now have 3 active
committers who are engaged. We also get regular input from community members
with bug reports, PRs, etc. We still need more active engagement from the
community, however. Given how widely used Curator is it can be frustrating
that there aren't more people active in the project. We continue to reach out
in various forums: Apache Slack, email, Stackoverflow, etc.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache DRAT Project  [Tom Barber]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Distributed Release Audit Tool is the creation and 
maintenance of software related to large scale code license analysis, auditing 
and reporting.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache DRAT was founded 2017-09-19 (2 years ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ahmed Ifhaam on 2018-08-30.
- No new committers. Last addition was Ahmed Ifhaam on 2018-08-28.

## Project Activity:
There’s  not much  going  on  since we were stalled a bit on the 1.0 release
since it was complicated and involved some bits and pieces from OODT. There
are still at least 3 active folks (Mattmann, Tom Barber, and Imesha, for one),
so I think we’re just slowly moving along.

## Community Health:
The project is a slow project, and intrinsically tied to OODT in many ways.
1.0 is basically done, we were just trying to pin it to a version of OODT that
didn't rely on Avro and still used XML-RPC (for now) and then upgrade to Avro
later. There is sufficient oversight and still enough people that care we just
move slow.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Druid Project  [Gian Merlino]

 ## Description

Apache Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database. It is
designed for workflows where low-latency query and ingest are the main
requirements. It implements ingestion, storage, and querying subsystems. Users
interface with Druid through built-in SQL and JSON APIs, as well as
third-party applications.

Druid has an extensive web of connections with other Apache projects: Calcite
for SQL planning, Curator and ZooKeeper for coordination, Kafka and Hadoop as
data sources, Avro, ORC, or Parquet as supported data input formats, and
DataSketches for scalable approximate algorithms. Druid can also be used as a
data source by Superset.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

We are currently hard at work preparing to create a branch for our 2nd
post-graduation release, 0.18.0, expected to be done within the next week,
targeting a release by the end of the month. 0.18.0 is currently weighing in
at over 200 commits from 41 contributors since our last release on Jan 26
2020.

In-person meetups and events have always been an important part of the Druid
community, but given the current global COVID-19 situation, they have become
untenable. Druid Summit, a larger event, was originally planned for April
13-15 and has recently been postponed to November 2-4. We are also
investigating alternatives to the smaller local meetups (typically 20-50
people) that we had been planning for New York City, Orange County, and San
Diego over the next two months.

## Recent PMC changes

 - Currently 27 PMC members.
 - No recent changes to PMC.

## Recent committer changes

 - Currently 35 committers.
 - No recent changes to committers.

## Recent releases

 - 0.17.0, our first release post graduation was released on Jan 26 2020

## Development activity by the numbers

In the last month:

 - 69 pull requests opened
 - 67 pull requests merged/closed
 - 56 issues opened
 - 30 issues closed
 - 275 comments on pull requests
 - 147 comments on issues

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Eagle Project  [Edward Zhang]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Eagle is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a distributed monitoring solution for identifying security and performance 
issues in real time on big data platforms, including Apache Hadoop and Apache 
Spark.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Eagle was founded 2016-12-20 (3 years ago)
There are currently 18 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Deng Lingang on 2017-05-08.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jay Sen on 2017-03-16.

## Project Activity:
Project refactoring has not started since PMCs discussed the new design a few
months back. Hopefully we can come up with some jira stories for the 
project refactoring in coming months. The idea is still to remove hbase 
dependency, and remove hadoop specific monitoring and make the monitoring 
framework more generic.

## Community Health:
There is no much activity from community in last 3 months. Hopefully after
we started development of the new design, community would have more feedback
and interactions.

## Project Activity:
- Existing implementations have been improved/enhanced based on community
  feedback.
- We did migrate from svn to git(box) and started reorganising around git
  repositories (including a rework of our website to reflect the changes).
- We are discussing breaking out some of our bigger subproject into additional
  git repositories.
- We accepted and integrated the "Atomos" contribution by Thomas Watson and
  attracted a new committer in the process (Stefan Bischof).

## Community Health:
- Overall the project is in ok health.
- Questions on the user list are answered, development concerns are either
  discussed on the mailing list or directly in the JIRA issues.
- The project as well as the OSGi community in general is still in the process
  of adapting to JPMS and Graal/substrate - however, we hope that Atomos and
  the new OSGi Connect RFC will help in that area.
- We need to be on the lookout for new committers. Atomos and the move to

## Project Activity:
- Except for several bug fixes, improvements and a security fix while
  considering development work, it has been a fairly quiet quarter for us.
- Several members of Gora PMC have volunteered to be mentors for this years
  GSoC to increase community participation.

  process of inviting one potential contributor for Gora PMC / Committership
  once his major contributions are merged.


## Community Health:
- Our main communication medium gora development mailing lists were mostly
  quiet for past quarter. We believe this is mainly due to holidays period. 
  We are hoping to bring some energy with GSoC and new development drive 
  work for the next release. However we could also observe some level of 
  JIRA and Github related activity for past quarter.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server. Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that makes
people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the projects to
collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems. The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well as
non-ASF projects and their dependencies. It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and OpenSSL.

# Summary

The Tomcat community seems to be the only one still using Gump actively. With
a new branch of Tomcat getting built the average build time of a full run has
gone beyond nine hours so that the number of runs has been reduced to two
runs per day.

# Releases

Gump has never done any releases. One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the time
following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

# Changes to the Roster

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure the ASF
installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark Thomas join
in November 2014.

Brett Porter has left the PMC in December 2019.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for March 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here:  
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/March2020

There are presently 45 podlings incubating. In February, podlings executed 
9 distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members, but two will be added 
shortly, and 2 IPMC members retired, a further 72 were removed by a board
resolution.

There was four requested IP clearance, some issue around previous IP 
clearances have been resolved. We have one new podling this month NLPCraft; 
another three are under discussion AgensGraph, HBlock and Rainbow. No 
projects graduated last month. Taverna has retired from the Incubator and 
Tamaya is discussing retirement. At least one podling is heading towards 
graduation in the next few months. PageSpeed which didn't report last month 
reported this month. Hivemall did not report and have indicated they will
report next month.

Most podlings have sorted out their private mailing lists. Three podlings 
MXNet, SDAP and Spot are still working on it.

The board proposal to remove inactive IPMC members was passed, and they have
been removed; everything went smoothly. When they were removed, a few
projects found themselves with fewer mentors, and a couple of people have put
their hand up to help mentor them.

A discussion about the announce email format turned into a discussion about 
release pages. Several podling that have made releases were discovered not 
to have download pages, they have been asked to fix this. A script found 
several other podlings with incorrect download links on download pages and 
those podling are working on fixing those.

    actively working with known users of Daffodil to encourage
    contributions, including virtual meetings and making time to help
    spin up with the codebase
  - An outside developer has shown interest in contributing to the
    code-generation runtime. Hoping to spin up that user shortly and
    start getting contributions.

    in private channel, because of some contributing groups known to each
    other. We have already warned everyone about the importance of
    discussing on open lists.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  * in the last few months we have focused on development of university 
  communities,
  we set up "Marvin-lab" at the university we have the partnership, and 
  several postgraduate 
  students in the artificial intelligence field started using marvin as 
  their main tool for their research.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  * Minor bug fixes.
  * Compatibility with MS Azure Blob for artifact persistence.

  After a series of release candidates, a first incubator release was 
  approved
  by both the developer group and the IPMC. However, while doing the final
  release preparation a blocking issue was observed: the scripts that 
  package
  the product would still point to dl.google.com as a repo source.
  This is being addressed.

## Spot

Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model 
and Apache Hadoop.
Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  - Revive community activity (Discussion in mailing lists, increase 
  frequency of commits)
  - Create a new roadmap and release plan that will improve adoption.
  - Make it easier to contribute to the project (e.g. documentation, 
  framework).

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  The number of active committers has increased over the past quarter, and 
  we also have several new potential community members looking to become 
  committers. We will work with our mentors to go through the process to 
  onboard them.

  Much of the activity from the community has been focused on stabilizing 
  the codebase and fixing known issues in the documentation and Spot website. 
  This will greatly benefit new users and reduce confusion when standing up 
  the Spot different modules.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Several projects have been proposed, discussed, and completed during the 
  past quarter. We're also working to close the remaining open PRs as soon 
  once the community finishes its review. Additionally there were some 
  Podling Website check failures in the Whimsy report that we began to look 
  into and resolve. These should be mostly resolved by the next Podling 
  report update.

  We've also begun discussions on the second version of the Open Data Model 
  (ODM v2). There were several problems seen in the implementation with ODM 
  v1 that need to be resolved before substantial adoption of Apache Spot 
  can take place. Its our goal to come to a decision on the design of ODM
  v2 this next quarter. Once a data model redesign is agreed upon this will
  serve as a catalyst to modernizing other Spot modules so everything is
  properly integrated.

## TubeMQ

TubeMQ is a distributed messaging queue (MQ) system.

TubeMQ has been incubating since 2019-11-03.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  At this stage, no community activities were initiated, but we internally 
  initiated 
  a vote for the project committer and selected the first committer of the 
  project. 
  I believe this will promote the subsequent development of the project 
  community. 

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  The project is nearing completion of the migration to the Apache 
  incubator: 
  at this stage, we have completed the change of the project's package 
  name, the standardization of file's LICENSE, and the launch of the project
  home page but the documentation and project home page content relatively
  lacking, this part needs to be improved in the next stage.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Marcel Reutegger]

Apache Jackrabbit: Board Report March 2020
==========================================

## Description:
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming implementation
of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content repository is
 stable, largely feature complete and actively being maintained. Jackrabbit
 Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
 repository as a modern successor to the Apache Jackrabbit content repository.
 It is targeted for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and
 other demanding content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak
 does not implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it
 is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All maintenance
branches and the main development branch are continuously seeing moderate to
high activity.

We continue making regular feature releases of Jackrabbit Oak. The most recent
release was Jackrabbit Oak 1.24.0 that was made available on January 28th.

The upcoming Jackrabbit Oak 1.26.0 release will finally remove usage of
java.security.acl.Group, a deprecated interface that will be removed in
Java 14.

A security issue was reported on January 22nd on the private list. The issue
was very well handled by Angela Schreiber and Julian Reschke and within a week
new releases were made available that contained a fix. The security issue was
initially discovered by Andrew Khoury and Russ Wright of Adobe. Details on the
security issue are available in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-8870
and https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1940

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of the work
going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly driven by
dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

## Health report:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all mailing
lists reflecting the activity of the respective component.

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user lists as
well as on the various JIRA issues.

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the JIRA issues
and the desire of the individual contributors to bring features and
improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.

Jukka Zitting contacted the PMC and expressed his desire to go emeritus. His
resignation from the PMC and committer base became effective after a 72 hour
wait period on March 6th.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Karaf Project  [Jean-Baptiste Onofré]

## Description:
Apache Karaf provides a modern and polymorphic applications runtime,
multi-purpose (micro services, cloud, integration, IoT, OSGi, etc).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Karaf was founded 2010-06-16 (10 years ago)
There are currently 31 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Francois Papon on 2018-11-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Francois Papon on 2018-05-19.

## Project Activity:
We prepared and plan first Apache Karaf European Meetup in Germany in April
30th. The formal communication (with CFP) will be sent soon (this week) and we
will plan to ask "support" to ASF com. In term of releases and "pure" project
activity, we released Apache Karaf 4.3.0.RC1 with a almost full support for
OSGi R7. It's an important milestone for the project as it heads to the next
major release (4.3.0). We also released 4.2.8 and 3.0.10 maintenance releases
to sustain our release cycle. Karaf 4.2.9 will be submitted to vote soon as
well. We also started a redesign of the Karaf tooling (maven plugins, etc) to
propose a much better developer experience. We had several feedbacks saying
that Apache Karaf is great once running, but the developer ramp up and
developer experience could be much better. That's why we started to work on
this area. About the subprojects, Apache Karaf Cave 4.2.1 has been released,
containing a complete refactoring of Cave, now more multipurpose repository
focused. We are also preparing Apache Karaf Decanter 2.3.0 as maintenance
release with lot of improvements and bug fixes. Finally, a complete Apache
Karaf Cellar refactoring has started, heading to new major Cellar release.
Here's a quick summary about recent releases:
- 4.3.0.RC1 was released on 2020-01-31.
- 4.2.8 was released on 2020-01-23.
- 3.0.10 was released on 2020-01-11.
- Cave 4.2.1 was released on 2019-12-02.

* The meetup was changed from an in-person meeting to a virtual meetup as a 
  result of the current COVID19 pandemic concerns.

## Community Health:
We are happy to see a growing interest around Apache Karaf, with new users and
potential contributors on Slack and mailing lists. We can see about 25% more
traffic on mailing lists proving this interest about Apache Karaf. We think
that first Apache Karaf Meetup will be a great opportunity for Karaf
communities to meet and discuss about the project. There are also discussions
with Apache ServiceMix and OPS4J communities to move some projects into Apache
Karaf. It's also a tremendous sign about Karaf community and branding. With
these new subprojects, Apache Karaf will be first citizen project in the
runtime ecosystem.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description:
Labs is a place for innovation where committers of the foundation can
experiment with new ideas.

## Issues:
Labs underwent a roll-call in January called by wave@ There were four responses.

## Membership Data:
Apache Labs was founded 2006-11-15 (13 years ago)
There are currently 31 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Simone Tripodi on 2011-06-14.
- No new committers. Last addition was Juan P. Gilaberte on 2018-05-30.

## Project Activity:
Labs is largely inactive but as it is a facility offered to committers for
their use, lack of activity on its own is not a symptom of disfunction.

## Community Health:
Labs' community is all committers. Demand for labs is currently non-existent
but this may change.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Anshum Gupta]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
The community is currently working on reducing the tech debt that Solr
currently carries, as mentioned in the previous board report. Several
committers are actively working on a much improved 9.0 release. The PMC feels
that the situation is now under control.

## Membership Data:
Apache Lucene was founded 2005-01-18 (15 years ago)
There are currently 82 committers and 54 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2. 

Community changes, past quarter:
- Nhat Nguyen was added to the PMC on 2020-03-02
- No new committers. Last addition was Bruno Roustant on 2019-11-22.

## Project Activity:We released Lucene and Solr 8.4.0 and 8.4.1 since the last
report.
With 8.4.0, we added numerous optimizations in Lucene. LatLonShape now supports
the "CONTAINS" relation, which enables to find all indexed shapes that contain
the query shape. Solr added a new package management system and improved
security out of the box.

Solr 8.4.0 release also announced CVE-2019-17558.

An 8.4.1 release was done to fix SSL support in Solr along with security
improvements in the newly added package manager. Overseer serialization was
also fixed to support rolling upgrades.

We are still working to change our entire build system from Ant to Gradle. A
lot has already been ported, and this task is very close to completion. 

The Lucene and Solr websites were revamped and ported from SVN to Git and
published as HTTPS only.

## Community Health:
Community health is very strong. Our two main user lists, java-user and
solr-user, continue to be widely used.

Our Jira issue activity and code contributions are also very strong. 450
issues were opened and 315 closed in JIRA in the past quarter. Our GitHub
activity has also been on an upward trend and more contributors are using
GitHub PRs as compared to patches now.

A Lucene/Solr track has been reintroduced to ApacheCon NA 2020. We are
actively asking possible speakers to submit talks and hope to see a good
lineup of talks by users and developers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.



== Summary ==

This quarter has seen some progress, mostly with addressing performance
issues:

  * NIOFSDirectory was modified to move buffered data in batches, rather than
    one byte at a time.
  * FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput was modified so it doesn't utilize the buffer in
    BufferedIndexOutput, since FileStream already has its own buffer.
  * TokenStream had Reflection code that ran at runtime, which has been
    replaced with a dotnet Code Analyzer and Fix which runs at design time.
  * Replaced Lucene's WeakIdentityMap with .NET's ConditionalWeakTable.
  * The scaffolding known as the Lucene.Net.Support namespace has been either
    moved to the J2N library or marked internal. Several types were optimized
    and consolidated in the process.
  * The caches in ICU4N were replaced with the cache from
    Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.
  * The API documentation has been cleaned up a lot and work is being done to
    set it up so each release has its own version.

Lucene.NET 4.8.0-beta00007 was released this quarter. A few bugs were reported
on JIRA, but the mailing lists have been mostly inactive.


== Remaining Work on 4.8.0 ==

We updated the itemized list of remaining issues for both Lucene.NET and ICU4N
and have arrived at the following estimates to production release:

Lucene.NET 4.8.0

* Hours Completed: ~4000
* Hours Remaining: ~450

ICU4N 60.x

* Hours Completed:  ~540
* Hours Remaining: ~260 (assuming we don't port any more of it)
* Hours Remaining: ~725 (ported to feature completion)

Lucene.NET 8.x Upgrade

* Hours Completed: 0
* Hours Remaining: ~1700

The primary items left to complete for the 4.8.0 release are identifying and
addressing performance issues, reviews of tests and usage of IDisposable, the
API docs, and ICU4N.


== Releases ==



* Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012

* Working toward 4.8.0 - Currently beta0007, released 2019-12-29



== People ==



* Last PMC Member added May 2017, Shad Storhaug (nightowl888)

* Last committer added Oct 2019, Shannon Deminick (shazwazza)

* PMC Chair rotated 20 June 2018 to Shad Storhaug (nightowl888)

The mission of the Apache PLC4X project is creating a set of libraries for 
communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a 
variety of protocols but with a shared API.

## Issues:
Currently nothing would require board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache PLC4X was founded 2019-04-17 (a year ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Łukasz Dywicki on 2019-07-28.
- Alvaro del Castillo was added as committer on 2020-01-29

- Lukas Ott was added as committer on 2020-01-03
- Dominik Riemer was added as committer on 2020-02-04

## Project Activity:
- 0.6.0 was released on 2020-03-01

In December we had a 3 day code retreat, where a large portion of the
core-team meet and worked on addressing some of the most important
architectural challenges in preparation to porting all of our drivers to the
new generated codebase.

In general we have started to maintain and fix a lot of reported issues in the
0.6 branch which we now consider a LTS release branch. The version 0.7.0 is a
huge refactoring as we completely rewrote the core of PLC4X and are currently
deleting all existing drivers, replacing them with new version which we
generate from our new code-generation tool. Still 1-2 drivers to port, but
most of the others are already finished.

We completely relaunched our website, giving it a way more appealing look and
feel as we think the old website was preventing people from giving PLC4X a
chance.

We are currently in the process of preparing the ASF to become member of a
list of 4-5 industry foundation in order to allow us to legally be able to
provide some drivers and or mention them on our website and other public
information material.

We have had Meetups/Conference-Talks/Workshops:
- PLC4X full day workshop: Building IoT (02-03-2020)
- Talks: Building IoT - Essen (03-03-2020, 04-03-2020)
- Talk: Stuttgarter Innovationstage (03-03-2020)
- Talk: OOP - Munich (05-02-2020)

Perhaps worth mentioning:
In December Christofer applied for European research funds via NLnet
Foundation and was recently informed that his application was granted. So if
this really will happen, then these funds will be used 100% for driving the
C-type drivers for PLC4X as well as an Apache MyNewt integration.

## Community Health:
This year the number of contributors has grown quite a bit. Also the number of
people showing up from different companies has increased significantly.

Also starting this year we started to invite people as committer first and
stopped instantly inviting them as PMC in one go, as we noticed some people
became less active after becoming PMCs. At the same time we lowered the bar
for committership a little and redefined how we interpret the term
"committer". We treat committers as people who are committed to PLC4X and PMCs
who have proven to be so for a prolonged period of time (not too long)

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent
interface to underlying platform-specific implementations. APR provides an API
to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if not
identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is
built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work
around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features. 
Consistent abstractions are provided both for host platforms and for utilities
such as databases.  In addition, APR provides a range of general-purpose
utilities.

## Issues:
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) was founded 2000-12-01 (19 years ago)
There are currently 67 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ivan Zhakov on 2019-11-05.
- No new committers. Last addition was Evgeny Kotkov on 2017-09-13.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:
 - Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup search of
   network services.  Services may be implemented in a number of languages,
   while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at least), to allow
   proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 -  Minimal activity at present, initial work on the modular build structure
    has commenced.  The current monolithic build is complex, with it's own
    build tool classdepandjar, it adds complexity for new developers. In
    recent months I have had work committments that have limited my ability to
    integrate the modular build.  The other committers are waiting for the
    modular build and I have done a lot of work on this locally, this work has
    been a significant undertaking integrating the works of Dennis Reedy, Dan
    Rollo and myself.  This is also a mature codebase, having been in
    development since the late 1990's.

- The monolithic code has been svn moved into modules into an initial maven
  build structure, next step is to move junit tests to each module.

- Until the monolithic build has been broken up into maven modules, we are
  likely to have difficulty attracting new contributors due to the appearance
  of complexity.

Release roadmap:

- River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&   binary release)
- River 3.2 - Input validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling
   & safe ServiceRegistrar lookup service.
- River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - River is a mature codebase with existing deployments, it was primarily
   designed for dynamic discovery of services on private networks.  IPv4 NAT
   limitations historically prevented the use of River on public networks,
   however the use of IPv6 on public networks removes these limitations.  Web
   services evolved with the publish subscribe model of todays internet, River
   has the potential to dynamically discover services on IPv6 networks, peer
   to peer, blurring current destinctions between client and server, it has
   the potential to address many of the security issues currently experienced
   with IoT and avoid any dependency on the proprietary cloud for "things".

- Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required
     prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and Gadget
     attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports IPv4
     multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so authentication can
     occur prior to downloading service proxy's, this addresses a long
     standing security issue with service lookup while significantly improving
     performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal of
     support for insecure cyphers.
   * Secure TLS SocketFactory's for RMI Registry, uses the currently logged in
     Subject for authentication. The RMI Registry still plays a minor role in
     service activation, this allows those who still use the Registry to
     secure it.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses classdepandjar, a
     bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
   * Updating the Jini specifications.

## Project Composition:

    There are currently 16 committers and 12 PMC members in this project. The
    Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Piotr Zarzycki]

## Description:
Apache Royale is a new implementation of the principles of Apache Flex,
designed for JavaScript instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes. Apache Royale
improves developer productivity in creating applications to run wherever
JavaScript runs, including on browsers as well as in Apache Cordova
applications, Node, etc.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- Apache Royale 0.9.2 was released on March 16 2018.
- Apache Royale 0.9.4 was released on November 14 2018.
- Apache Royale 0.9.6 was released on October 1 2019

## Membership Data:
- Greg Dove was added as a new PMC member on October, 2019. 

## Project Activity:
- We are still investing a lot of time in supporting users who wanted to port
  their applications from Flex to Apache Royale.
- Emulation of Flex components has been significantly improved. Developers can
  use emulation with success for porting most of their existing MX components
  and some Spark components.
- We have made significant refactoring towards better modularization of item
  renderers.
- Filled a gap in the Jewel UI set by adding ButtonBar and DataGrid.
- Added Jewel VirtualList and VirtualComboBox to improve performance managing
  large collections of data.
- Jewel Button got new "Outlined" and "Unboxed" styles.
- Jewel got theme switch feature, implemented in Tour De Jewel example, to
  change themes at runtime.
- Lots of improvements in Jewel UI Set (including resizing, themes, and
  disabling)
- Added Routing infrastructure classes to allow "routing" or "deep linking" on
  SPA applications.
- Added AMFLocalStorage to allow storing data on the user's machine with AMF
  encoding, removing the need to encode/decode to/from JSON.
- Royale compiler gets an improvement in data binding area.
- Royale Docs continues to be improved as the project develops.
- Royale Docs for Crux were added.
- We created two TodoMVC examples (from (todomvc.com)[http://www.todomvc.com]
  website), one using Jewel UI set and the other adding the Crux IoC
  framework). This example shows MVC good practices in Royale and many
  features like IoC, DI, Event Handling, Data Binding, Jewel Theme
  Customization, Routing and LocalStorage (with AMF).

## Community Health:
We think it is important to do this so people outside the project and not
following it on a daily basis can get a notion of how we are doing. The
numbers are:
    - Our Twitter account has 643 (previously 610) followers.
    - Our Facebook page has 147 (previously 144) likes.
    - Our LinkedIn Group has 131 (previously 129) people.
    - Our StackOVerFlow "apache-royale" tag currently has 44 (previously 43)
      questions.
- We recently added a Slack channel, "royale", in the-asf.slack.com workspace
  as an experiment to support real-time collaboration.

- users@royale.apache.org:
    - 79 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months)
    - 1% increase in traffic in the past quarter (358 emails compared to 351)

- dev@royale.apache.org:

  - the next Bundles and Specs releases

## Community Health:

Due to a low activity in the project and low interest to provide further 
releases of ServiceMix Assembly we are currently discussing about the future 
of the ServiceMix project. Our draft plan is to:
- move the Bundles and Specs to Apache Karaf or provide in Apache Karaf 
a descriptor mechanism which lets us to avoid to provide a bundle for each
Java library
- provide a documentation explaining how to "migrate" from ServiceMix 
to Karaf "ecosystem". The purpose is to provide smooth path to ServiceMix users.
- maybe provide an Integration distribution of Apache Karaf
- provide in Apache Camel or Apache Karaf project a documentation about running
integration in the Karaf "ecosystem"
- move the ServiceMix project to attic

## Community Health:

The community is really growing now, we have seen a lot of new (unknown)
people get interested in the project, and what is even more interesting is the
fact that they are quick to contribute.

A few new companies have been integrating the technology and their engineers
are contributing back to the project which is really encouraging to see, it
seems like the efforts around communication and onboarding have helped.

It is a focus of the PMC to get people involved quickly and easily, and a high
priority is put on answering PRs or any requests.

A lot of activity is also happening on the Slack channel, where people prefer
to go for short/quick questions. It would be great to be able to reflect this
somehow in the reports.

- dev@unomi.apache.org had a 1% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (302
emails compared to 305)

in the past quarter (32 emails compared to 21) 
- 13 issues opened in JIRA, past
quarter (18% increase)

## Project Activity:
On January we had a new release cycle involving version 7.x, 8.x and 9.x (this
last is in development). As result on the same month we reached a new
downloads record touching 480k downloads via Maven repositories. As of the
writing we are preparing to release a new Milestone (the fifth) before the
finally releasing Wicket 9. In this Milestone we have introduced the last
major feature which is CSP (Content Security Policy)  support. The development
of this feature has been lead by Emond Papegaaij. The release of Wicket 9
should shortly (a couple of months) follow this last Milestone.

## Community Health:
The community is stable and healthy. Questions to the user list and dev list
are answered, resolved and discussed. In the last quarter we have also seen
some very interesting Wicket-related activities and projects outside the
Apache community:

-On Udemy Ansgar Schulte created a German-based course on Apache Wicket:
 https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-wicket-kompakt/
-Robin Shen presented OneDev, an open source, Wicket-based, all-in-one devops
 platform that is rapidly gaining a notable interest on GitHub:
 https://github.com/theonedev/onedev
-Roman Sery has started his new blog almost entirely dedicated to Apache Wicket:
 https://www.coderdreams.com/ 
-Martin Grigorov has successfully tested Wicket with Apache tomcat 10 M1:
 https://twitter.com/mtgrigorov/status/1225359299570028546
-Bruno Borges has run some interesting experiments with Wicket and Quarkus

Attachment CA: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

Xerces-J 2.12.1 was released a the beginning of January. This is a bug fix
release which makes it possible to compile the source with Java 9+ and mostly
addresses issues in Xerces' XML Schema processor. As usual, the community has
been helping with publishing the binaries to Maven central. Since the release
there's been a couple updates to the documentation but no other activity to
report.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 80+ posts on the j-dev and j-users
lists since the beginning of December 2019.

The latest release is Xerces-J 2.12.1 (January 11th, 2020).

Xerces-C

Xerces-C has finally completed its migration to Git. The project has been
using it since the beginning of January. The community has already been
submitting pull requests with enhancement and bug fix suggestions. A few of
them have been reviewed. While doing that, the developers have been debating
what the threshold is for requiring a contributor to sign the Apache CLA
(trivial one-line fixes vs. substantial work) before accepting their pull
 request.

Since the beginning of March there's been discussion about the creation of a
branch for Xerces-C 3.3 to allow for some necessary changes to the API. It was
recently decided that master would be used for this purpose. Xerces-C 3.2 was
pushed to a branch.

Mailing list traffic has been high; roughly 240+ posts on the c-dev and
c-users lists since the beginning of December 2019.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-C
3.2.2 (September 19th, 2018).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity over the
reporting period.

XML Commons

No activity over the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in April 2017 (Xerces-C) and May 2017
(Xerces-J).

No new PMC members since the last report. The most recent addition to the PMC
was in June 2016.

Four committers have committed changes to SVN and Git since December 2019.

Attachment CB: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Allen Wittenauer]

## Description:
The mission of Yetus is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Collection of libraries and tools that enable contribution and release 
processes for software projects

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Yetus was founded 2015-09-15 (4 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-12-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-02-06.

## Project Activity:
Patches are trickling in for an eventual 0.12.0 release! It looks like
we have folks using Apache Yetus in new and interesting ways and hitting
bugs and/or missing features or usability problems.  Frankly, it is quite
exciting and hope it leads to more community growth which will lead to more
contributions which will lead to more committers which will lead to more
PMC members. 

That said, given some of the critical issues that have been filed,
a 0.12.0 will come sooner rather than later . . . 


## Community Health:
As usual, a new year == more activity.  But to me the interesting thing is how
much our workflows are moving to GitHub vs. JIRA+mailing lists:


While both have had interesting discussions just in the past month, there is
no denying where stuff is happening:

* dev@yetus.apache.org had a 8% increase in traffic in the past quarter (39
  emails compared to 36)
* gitbox@yetus.apache.org had a 280% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (133 emails compared to 35) 

Our workflow is basically open a JIRA, then either open a GitHub PR with your
change or attach a patch file to JIRA. 

  It's obvious what is the preferred path:

* 25 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (56% increase)
* 18 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (125% increase)

* 14 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (40% increase)
* 13 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (30% increase)

Attachment CC: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Paiva Junqueira]

## Description:
Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It enables
the implementation of a variety of primitives and mechanisms that are
critical for safety and liveness in distributed settings, e.g., 
distributed locks, master election, group membership, and configuration.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache ZooKeeper was founded 2010-11-17 (9 years ago)
There are currently 27 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Enrico Olivelli was added to the PMC on 2020-01-15
- No new committers. Last addition was Brian Nixon on 2019-09-24.

## Project Activity:
- Recent releases:
   * 3.6.0 was released on 2020-03-03.
   * 3.5.7 was released on 2020-02-14.
   * 3.5.6 was released on 2019-10-18.
- No new security vulnerability reported

## Community Health:
The community has worked on three releases in this period: two bug-fix
releases and one major release. The activity increase observed across
the dev list, issues opened/closed, commits and code contributions reflects
all the effort from the community to cut all these releases. It was certainly
a good quarter for the project.

Health indicators:
- dev@zookeeper.apache.org had a 13% increase in traffic in the
past quarter (1170 emails compared to 1034)
- issues@zookeeper.apache.org had a 27% decrease in traffic in
the past quarter (788 emails compared to 1065)
- 106 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (no change)
- 65 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (30% increase)
- 166 commits in the past quarter (107% increase)
- 30 code contributors in the past quarter (20% increase)
- 103 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (10% increase)
- 80 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (1% increase)
