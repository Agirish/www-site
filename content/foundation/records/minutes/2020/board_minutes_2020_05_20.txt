 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       I have been pursuing multiple initiatives this month to make
       it easier for our geographically diverse board to agree on a
       time to hold our monthly meetings. Part of that is finding a
       fair time to meet when all of us can attend, and the rest is
       reducing the time spent on the teleconference to only those
       discussions that require our synchronous attendance.

       Bertrand deserves credit for putting together a Javascript
       page for visual scheduling across time zones, and thanks go
       to the entire board and executive officers for participating
       through manual data entry. It all became a nice team exercise,
       without much falling backwards.

       For this meeting, the board will attempt to preapprove most of
       the items on our agenda during the week prior to the meeting.

       Technically, what that means is that we will open discussion
       on the board list and within the agenda tool for all of the
       items for which we have information supplied in the agenda.

       As usual, directors will review the reports, make comments,
       mark them for approval, and/or flag them for discussion.
       Similarly, if we haven't already discussed a resolution on list,
       a formal discuss thread will be started for that item.

       If we have comments on a report that are intended for the
       reporting officer, we should forward them during the review
       and attempt to complete any associated action items as well.
       This will give them an opportunity to expand on their report
       if additional details are requested prior to the meeting.

       Over the course of the week, I will construct a "consent agenda"
       within a special item (or in parallel to avoid breaking the tools)
       consisting of pointers to those agenda items which:

         1) have not been flagged for discussion by any director; and,
         2) either:  
            a) have been explicitly marked as approved by all directors; or,
            b) appear to have general consent of the board AND
               all relevant materials have been available in the agenda
               for at least five days prior to the start of the meeting
               (i.e., Friday at 21:30 UTC for this meeting).

       When the meeting starts (after roll call), directors will be
       given an opportunity to "remove items from the consent agenda",
       which essentially means flagging them for normal discussion.
       A director that wants to vote "no" on a resolution should flag it.

       I will then ask for any objections to approving the remaining items
       by general consent and, assuming that passes, the Secretary will
       minute all of those remaining items as having been approved by
       general consent, as if we had discussed them during the meeting.
       For our own sanity, I think we will do that by reference rather
       than attempt to move items around in the agenda/minutes.

       We will then work our way through whatever is left in the agenda,
       and hopefully finish just in time for a short executive session.
       Yay! If not, we will reconvene after the executive session to
       continue the remaining discussion items.

       Eventually, much of this will be automated, similar to how the
       reports are approved/commented/flagged already. Sam has made a
       lot of progress on migrating Whimsy's agenda tool to a Node.js
       version that will hopefully attract more developers. I will
       commit myself to learning that over the next month.

       Likewise, I think a proper issue management system will be
       necessary to allow both directors and non-directors to create
       trackable issues for the board, with or without the formalities
       of a meeting, as well as more consistent tracking of action
       items after a meeting. That means we use something like Jira
       or Github for our issues, or we find new volunteers for the
       Whimsy project who don't mind reinventing a custom wheel.

       Bertrand has been opening Jira issues and Sander has been
       experimenting with Jira workflows for managing and recording
       director votes within those issues. It is a bit too messy
       right now for real board work, but it looks like Jira can be
       extensively customized by someone with the right auth
       permissions and knowledge of Velocity/Java. However,
       I haven't had time to pursue it further.


    B. President [David]

       This month has largely been spent focusing on rebuilding the budget to
       deal with the impact of the pandemic.

       This month has uncovered some contract issues that have led me to
       believe we should be getting a bit more review of contracts that have
       a material impact on us. I broached this subject at the Ops meeting on
       the 13th. Ruth is going to end up leading the charge on this and we're
       working with Roman as VP Legal to understand how we might streamline
       this function. Expect more details on this in the coming month on the
       operations list.

       I've also spent a small bit of time working to get Ruth up to speed as
       EVP. She's settling into the work well and picking up plenty of
       things.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Operating Cash on April 30th, 2020 was $2,118.9K, which is up $29.4K
       from last month’s ending balance (Mar 20) of $2,089.5K.  Total Cash as
       of April 30th, 2020 is $3,562.4K (includes the Pineapple, Restricted
       Donation and project funds) as compared to $3,814.2K on April 30th,
       2019, (a decrease of $251.8K year over year). The April 30th 2020
       ending Operating cash balance of $2,118.9K represents an Operating
       cash reserve of 10.1 months based on the “Estimated” FY20 Cash
       forecast average monthly spending of $209.3K/month.  The ASF actual
       Operating reserve of 10.1 months at the end of April 2020 is
       significantly ahead of the April 2020 budgeted 7.6 months of reserve. 
       The ASF Operating reserve is above the ASAE standard average of 6
       months of reserve for Non-Profits.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Revenue ended the Fiscal year behind
       budget by $245.2K (this is due to timing of sponsor and donation
       payments.  In addition Conference income was lower than budget).  As
       compared to FY19, FY20 YTD revenue is ahead by $157.3K primarily due
       to FY20 Events exceeding Revenue as compared to FY19 ($352.7K higher
       Conference revenue in FY20 compared to FY19 with two conferences in
       2020 compared to one in 2019).

       YTD expenses through April 30th, 2020 are under budget by $478.4K,
       spread across all depts except for Infra, which was slightly over
       budget due to prepaying for TravisCI FY21 in March 2020.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$277.4K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$520K> NI, or $242.6K better than
       the Budgeted NI for FY20.  With regard to the Cash Forecast we thank
       all executive officers because in the March close we noted an
       estimated YE NI of <-$272K> and we finished with a <-277K>.  Being
       this close to our estimate shows that with the pertinent information
       about future activity as the year goes along, the cash forecast can be
       a very important management tool.   With regard to FY19, while we are
       ahead in revenue by $157.3K, as noted above, we are also ahead on
       expenses by $764.2K (due to ACNA19, ACEU19, and the Leaseweb payment
       which should have taken place in FY19, but did not); thus, year over
       year NI FY20 is behind FY19 by <-$606.9K>.  All in all the ASF,
       compared to its approved FY20 budget had a very good year.

       In April and May we have continued to make the transition to approving
       and tracking payable invoices with bill.com.  We have on-boarded
       officers, and tested invoice approvals and vendor on-boarding with
       each of them.  The transition hit some unexpected bumps.  In those
       cases we fell back to our previous processes to insure the invoices
       were paid.  Because of those problems, we may not be able to complete
       the transition by the end of May.  We also still need to onboard one
       officer.  We thank those who have worked hard to get us this far, and
       we will continue to move the transition forward.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In April 2020, the secretary received 51 ICLAs, 1 CCLAs, 34 membership
       applications, and 9 membership emeritus requests.

       During April, the secretary worked with the Whimsy PMC to develop a
       feature in the secretary workbench for processing membership emeritus
       requests. This has helped during the yearly members meeting where an
       increase in paperwork typically happens. Future enhancements to Whimsy
       as well as experiments with using DocuSign along with self-serve forms
       for certain scenarios are all being executed on in one form or another
       to further modernize some of the secretary processes.


    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       As I've spent the last month on-boarding (and subscribing to lists and
       leveling up in email filtering), I took on relationships with
       VP Conferences and VP Fundraising for roll-up. Still in the role of
       producing ApacheCon (in whatever form), I admit more of that time this
       month has been spent on conferences.

       I've also been working with David on assorted other issues, largely
       around budget and re-planning given new expectations for both income
       and expenses due to the pandemic.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsor status: we are pursuing renewals for one Platinum, one Gold,
one Silver, and three Bronze sponsors. One Silver has been acquired and their
renewal status remains unknown. We continue to wait for purchase orders to
invoice renewals for one Platinum sponsor. One Gold sponsor has upgraded to
Platinum, and one Platinum has downgraded to Gold. We are seeking new
points-of-contact for one Silver and one Bronze sponsor. One Platinum sponsor
is in arrears, and one Silver sponsor has chosen not to renew. An incoming
crypto-to-fiat donation has been postponed to Q2 FY2021 due to market
fluctuations. We received two queries regarding Bronze sponsorship and have
signed on one new Bronze Sponsor this month.

2) Targeted sponsor status: we continue to confirm Targeted Sponsor
commitments. Our efforts towards developing a new Targeted fund specifically
earmarked for TAC recipients to ASF Conferences continue, but will hold the
program until face-to-face events resume. We have been approached by a
candidate Targeted Sponsor interested in providing support to ASF
Infrastructure.

3) Sponsor Relations: we are responding to Sponsor queries regarding
opportunities to support ApacheCon.

4) Events: we are ready to reconfigure prospectuses and begin sales for ASF
Conferences once the planning team finalizes next steps for the remaining
events in 2020.

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $925 over the
past month. Individual giving, in general, has slowed down due to COVID-19
constraints.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — May 2020

I. Budget: we await approval for the FY2021 budget, which has been revised a
few times in light of COVID-19-related events. The contract with HALO
Worldwide has not yet been renewed.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising with Sponsor Relations, Sponsorship renewals and payments, and
Targeted Sponsor commitments. There is no denying that the novel coronavirus
has impacted Sponsor budgets, that has resulted in delays in some renewals and
payments. COVID-19-related cancellations, postponements, and reconfigurations
have put our work with ASF 2020 Conferences on hold until they are ready to
announce new approaches. We announced the new Board of Directors
https://s.apache.org/Board2020 ; welcomed the ASF's 34 new Members
https://s.apache.org/q14mx ; published the second post on the ASF
Infrastructure team "Inside Infra: Drew Foulks"
https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Drew ; issued the Apache Month in Review:
April 2020 https://s.apache.org/Apr2020 ; and published "Success at Apache:
bringing the Apache Beam firefly to life" https://s.apache.org/bmq4l. We are
preparing the FY2020 Annual Report. Post-production continues on the ASF
documentary, "Trillions and Trillions Served".

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 16 April - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® ShardingSphere™
   as a Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 9 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog,
including 4 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 310 news
summaries published to date. We tweeted 16 items to 56.8K followers on
Twitter, and posted 12 items to 40.5K followers  on LinkedIn that garnered
more than 57K organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are on hold, and 2 are in
development. Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well
as PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones, "Did You Know?" success
stories, "Have You Met?" highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are
requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice
for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to five media queries. The ASF received 972
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,178. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 1,241 press hits vs. last month's 1,821. ApacheCon received 3
press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received one briefing request during this time, and
have been working with an analyst regarding an Apache project featured in an
upcoming Webinar. Apache was mentioned in 2 reports by Gartner; 2 reports by
Forrester; 7 reports by 451 Research; and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team are fine-tuning the apache.org
homepage with some additional adjustments and are also in the final stages of
creating a new templated, customizable logo set for the new Apache Local
Chapter initiative. We are contemplating options for editorial production, as
volunteer availability is limited.

IX. Events liaison: support for events is on hold due to the coronavirus
impact on ASF Conferences, and will resume once the planning team roll out
their new strategy for events in 2020.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: we are considering establishing
standalone accounts for the ASF to avoid any possible conflict with billing
pass-throughs from HALO Worldwide.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
We have no specific highlights for the Board this month, beyond the
Finances section.

Finances
========
Per instructions from the President, and advisement from Treasurer,
Infra has trimmed its requested budget for FY21. Two particular
changes: holding off on backfilling an open headcount, so our Staffing
reduction reflects this delay; reducing Travel to represent only our
staff meetup, and skipping an ApacheCon North America for FY21.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Complete our migration to R53 for DNS management, to enhance
  reliability and management improvements.

General Activity
================
- Documentation balance between www.apache and infra.apache is nearly
  finished, with all infra-related docs moving. Work continues on
  clarity, updating, and expansion.
- Continued work on our email subsystems, particularly around the
  spamd servers.
- Ran a series of Infra-related payments through bill.com. This
  delivered some wins and losses. Infra/Treasurer are resolving.
- Migrating many Jenkins nodes from the shared Master over to the
  project-specific Masters running under our CloudBees Operation
  Center setup.
- New .asf.yaml feature so that projects can manage their github
  notification deliveries. This identified several projects that were
  misconfigured and dev/null-ing some notifications.
- Part of the above work: new github mailer work to combine and thread
  commit emails.
- archive.a.o has migrated to a new, larger system within Hetzner for
  better bandwidth costs (and more disk space, for a fraction of the
  price of the prior system).
- pubsub improvements to monitor LDAP changes, and to source events
  from AWS SQS. We deliver all github events to SQS so that we can
  manage our servers without losing events -- when our servers come
  back up, they drain the SQS queues.
- Purchased and replaced several TLS certificates.
- Renewed effort to improve our configuration management:
  - Move our older hosts off Puppet v3, over to Puppet v6.
  - Initial testing of new automation/deployment systems.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Budget
======

TAC is submitted a revised Budget, and shaved off almost half its original
budget request, which includes the addition of a new line item for new TAC
software (See more below)

Current Events
==============

No current events

Future Events
=============

TAC has an events Calendar that it shares with other Committees for the
purposes of cross-committee planning and collaboration. Currently the calendar
has been cleared of all events until further notice.

Any ASF Project putting on a Hackathon and/or Meetup should also talk to TAC
about supporting them getting folks there (Committers and Non Committers)

Short/Medium Term Priorities
=====================

We are looking into creating a new webapp, one that is independent on the
reliance of one or two volunteers, that can be maintained and serve TACs needs
for the next few years. The webapp would need to be ready and tested before
applications open for the next event. A new Budget line item has been created
for this purpose. TAC will investigate pricing and availability  but on the
advice of the Treasurer will not 'go ahead' on this line item until at least
later in the year when the general outlook becomes clearer.


Mailing List Activity
=====================

Discussion continues on getting a new stable TAC Application Software.

Membership
==========

No changes to the membership this month.

VP Finance continued to work and support Treasurers, Fundraising and
Conferences/Road Shows
- Identified a possible option for Investment/Endowment for the
  Foundation. More research is required before a proposal is warranted.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

Dirk has been recruited as a Special Adviser to the Dutch and EC with regard
to architecture, privacy, anonymity and what not around the Corona response
effort. Including the public oriented app. So, he won't have any available
time for the ASF over the next 3 to 5 weeks.

Christian Grobmeier has volunteered the following report for the privacy
effort:

So far, we have one missing report and also one open privacy incident (basic
request from deleting user data from the OOo forums). The incident has not
been responded so far.

I have asked on feedback of how I'd handle this request, but no response. I am
not happy with performing any actions without approval.

Does the board have any input/ideas/suggestions here?


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're up 1 (to 22), unresolved
issues this month.

We received a request for an affidavit, but after extensive discussions within
legal committee (with participation of DLA Piper folks) we've concluded that
it is not in our best interest to respond at this time.

I would like to draw board's attention to the discussion on LEGAL-515. It
appears that the current binary convenience artifacts published by MXNet are
in violation of ASF's release policy. So far we've advised the PMC to work
through the issues, but it isn't clear whether they are willing to do so.

ASF has appeared on the following docket
https://dm.epiq11.com/case/broadvision/claims however after further review it
was established that we have never had any commercial relationship with
BroadVision and as such there's no reason to do anything.

Due to recent global events, progress on various binary distribution channels
that ASF controls is slow, but it is still on my radar.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 12: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

Stats for Apr 2020:

      18        [license confusion]
      22	[support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 36 (last months: 43, 23, 40, 23)

      5	       [site]

               [sentry], [shiro], [spark], [syncope], [tika]

     In total, as of 1st May 2020, we're tracking 71 (last month:
     58) open issues across 43 projects, median age 65 (last month:
     61) days.  39 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     8 (last month: 8) of these issues, across 6 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  None require escalation.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 13: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations  [Henri Yandell]

Not much progress this month. There was discussion on board regarding the
request from Eclipse for a copyright license for Apache contributions to the
J2EE JSR.

My action items are:

 A1] Review documents for Apache joining Jakarta as a Guest Member and get
     these signed. 

 A2] Propose text to indicate that: Insomuch as the ASF licensed
     copyright to the JCP, said copyright is also licensed to Eclipse.

I note that this month's TomEE report indicates that the summer release of
Jakarta EE 9 will involve a large breaking namespace change. A third action
item is:

 A3] To communicate the topic to affected projects. This will probably mean a
     general communication to all committees visibly using Java, and directing
     them to jcp-open for follow-up.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Mads Toftum]

## Description:
The mission of Attic is to be Apache's home for dormant projects.

## Issues:
Activity has been very low recently which has led to a backlog. With 5 projects
retired so far in 2020 (more than all year in both 2018 and 2019), it will take
some time to work catch up.


## Membership Data:
Apache Attic was founded 2008-11-19 (11 years ago)
There are currently 21 committers and 18 PMC members in this project.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Herve Boutemy on 2015-07-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Herve Boutemy on 2016-01-27.

## Project Activity:
Sebb has improved the process for DOAP file updates.
Hervé has created http://attic.apache.org/tracking.html to improve the tracking
of project progress.
Hervé has closed out old projects and is very close to clearing the last of
2019.


## Community Health:
Attic is not a traditional pmc and doesn't produce code like almost every other
pmc. Hence traditional metrics are not a good measure.
The best view will be http://attic.apache.org/tracking.html

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

Releases
========

There have been no releases since the last report. The last release was
towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

Since the last board report there has been some discussion in the project
community suggesting that there is ongoing interest in continuing the
project outside of the Attic.

A request from the board for a roll-call resulted in the PMC confirming that
there are enough PMC members continuing to provide oversight. [1]

We have slowly continued some discussions with the community and this
ultimately resulted in some activity around email and experiments with the
ASF slack workspace where a number of us are now in the #bloodhound channel,
including a member of the community who is continuing to express interest in
contributing to the project reboot.

Further activity included work to restore access to the issue tracker for
the project with help from INFRA which was much appreciated.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:
BookKeeper is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage service
optimized for append-only workloads. It has been used as a fundamental service
to build high available and replicated services. It is also the log segment
store for Apache DistributedLog and message store for Apache Pulsar.

Apache DistributedLog is a high-level API and service layer for Apache
BookKeeper, providing easier access to the BookKeeper primitives. It is a
subproject of Apache BookKeeper.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache BookKeeper was founded 2014-11-19 (5 years ago) There are currently 23
committers and 16 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members.
- Rajan Dhabalia was added as committer on 2020-03-23

## Project Activity:
Recently, we've seen lots of activity from upstream consumers such as Apache
Pulsar. Companies such as Salesforce and Diennea contributing back to the
community. We are also seeing new interest from users at Dell EMC contributing
back and starting conversations. Several bugs (issues) were opened and fixed
from these upstream consumers which will be going into our next release.

Some of the important features being worked on/recently merged are:
- Bookkeeper Proposal - 38: Publish Bookie Service Info on Metadata Service
- Bookkeeper Proposal - 40: Audit Logging for Apache Bookkeeper
- Migrated Project CI from Jenkins to Github Actions on 2020-01-22.

Releases
- 4.10.0 was released on 2019-11-06.
- 4.9.2 was released on 2019-05-16.
- Supporting project Bookkeeper Visual Manager released v1.0.0 on 2020-04-12.

## Community Health:
The community has been active in making infrastructural changes to
Apache Bookkeeper this past quarter. We have had initiatives that moved us to
Github Actions from Jenkins and also cut down the build and test time by more
than 50%. Another development activity has seemed to go from mailing lists to
our slack channel (apachebookkeeper.slack.com) where we had around 38 new users
of Apache Bookkeeper. In the past quarter, the above activity has resulted in
the following GitHub activity:
- 38 PRs opened (8% increase)
- 40 PRs closed (48% increase)
- 50 commits (51% increase)
- 20 code contributors (66% increase)

Mailing List activity:
- 1272 emails in issues@bookkeeper.apache.org (4% increase)
- 30 emails in user@bookkeeper.apache.org
- 59 emails in the dev@bookkeeper.apache.org
- We'll be pushing to bring the discussions back to the mailing lists.

Meetups and Conferences:
- Several talks are scheduled for the Bookkeeper Track in the
  Apache Pulsar Summit 2020 to be held in 17 and 18th June 2020.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Brooklyn Project  [Geoff Macartney]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Brooklyn is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a software framework for modelling, monitoring and managing cloud 
applications through autonomic blueprints.

## Issues:
- there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Brooklyn was founded 2015-11-18 (4 years ago)
There are currently 16 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Duncan Grant on 2018-08-30.
- No new committers. Last addition was Duncan Grant on 2018-06-13.

## Project Activity:
We are delighted to announce the release of Apache Brooklyn 1.0.0 in this 
past quarter. You may already have seen the announcement at 
https://s.apache.org/m05ao. I can put it no better than in the words
of Richard Downer, the release manager:

Brooklyn has been an Apache project since 2014, and we spent the first few
years figuring out the cloud landscape, the ideal expression for
applications, the best API and UI. We've now stabilised these and many
other decisions, and we have been confident for some time that Brooklyn is
"production quality" and we, the PMC and the community, can support it for
the long term. Therefore, it was time to stamp it "1.0.0".

I'd like to thank everyone involved in bringing Brooklyn to 1.0.0 - there
are many people, no longe actively involved, who contributed code back in
the early days that is still here and actively used in Brooklyn today - and
on the flip side, we have new contributors who have just started making
their first contributions to Brooklyn in the last few months. All of you
are very important to this project. Thank you all!


## Community Health:
- The project continues with a recently high turnover of pull requests and
  commits.
- We continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
  members with the aim of regularly adding individuals.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
- We have released 1.5.8 in July. We haven't had any activity since.

This report is essentially the same as what we filed in February.
   
## Health report: 
 - We still have a small PMC presence of 3 active members still able
to vote releases.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Peter Donald on Tue Oct 15 2013 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 10 committers. 
 - Olle Jonsson was added as a committer on Wed Dec 12 2018 
   
## Releases:    
 - Last release was 1.5.8 on July 14th 2019


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues to report at this time.

This quarter, we were able to come to an amicable resolution with AWS
concerning the use of our Apache Cassandra trademark in their Cassandra SaaS
offering. The AWS folks were amenable and gracious through the whole process
and have rebranded to "AWS Keyspaces."

## Membership Data:
Apache Cassandra was founded 2010-02-17 (10 years ago)
There are currently 55 committers and 34 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Michael Semb Wever was added to the PMC on 2020-04-09
- Jordan West was added as committer on 2020-04-29

## Project Activity:
4.0-alpha4 was released on 2020-04-24 as we continue to gather feedback on our
upcoming 4.0 release.

The following maintenance releases were made for existing versions:
- 2.2.16 was released on 2020-02-14
- 3.0.20 was released on 2020-02-14
- 3.11.6 was released on 2020-02-14

## Community Health:
We have continued with weekly updates to the dev list on the progress of bugs
and issues open for 4.0. There has also been a significant uptick in
participation as more folks pitch in to help get our release out. The
following statistics show this increased effort:

- 232 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (51% increase)
- 217 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (143% increase)
- 242 commits in the past quarter (101% increase)
- 60 code contributors in the past quarter (66% increase)
- 168 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (162% increase)
- 119 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (376% increase)

Additionally, we have had some very robust discussions on guidelines for PMC
membership as well as process based votes in general. We are working to
produce some project level documentation so that we have a shared
understanding of this for ourselves as PMC members and, more importantly, for
our community.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Clerezza Project  [Hasan Hasan]

DESCRIPTION
Apache Clerezza models the RDF abstract syntax in Java and provides supports
for serializing, parsing, managing and querying triple collections (graphs).
Apache Clerezza modules aim at supporting the development of Semantic Web 
applications and services.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

COMMENTS OF THE BOARD
  druggeri: It's been a while since a new committer or PMC member has
            been added and this report is light on details of
            community engagement and health. Are there any
            contributors to watch? Also... Congratulations on 2.0.0!

  answer:
    Yes, indeed the community engagement is low. Active PMC members are 
    trying to find a solution for this. One possibility under discussion 
    is to define suitable GSoC tasks for the year to come.
    We are thinking of defining tasks which will leverage Apache Clerezza 
    in managing data used within P2P based applications.

RELEASE
The latest release was created on April 23, 2020.

ACTIVITY
Three modules were released in this reporting period:
1. Representation module version 2.0.0
2. SPARQL module version 2.0.0
3. Test Utility module version 2.0.0

At the time of writing this report, the Clerezza DataSet module version
2.0.0 is being prepared for release.

COMMUNITY
Latest change was addition of a new committer and PMC member on 27.12.2018
We have to admit that currently we lack contributions from the community.
We hope that with the release of all modules in version 2.0.0, community
will get motivated to contribute to further development of Apache Clerezza.

INFRASTRUCTURE
Latest update of the Apache Clerezza Website was in February 2018.
Surely, this is another construction site to be taken care of. We will
address this in the next reporting period.

## Description:
The mission of Cocoon is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Cocoon was founded 2003-01-22 (17 years ago)
There are currently 80 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Javier Puerto on 2012-07-06.
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
The project is mainly in maintenance mode. 
The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14 

## Community Health:
There was almost no visible activity in the last quarter, 
but there's still active PMC members around here.

Writing this board report has actually be the opportunity to start
a thread on the PMC list about the opportunity to continue the project 
or move to the Attic, and if so, to start a new release process, 
7 years after the previous one.

## Project Activity:
### GSOC
This year we have had 71 student proposals and 36 mentors. 33 proposals were
marked as "Want to mentor". We requested 21-24 slots, and 21 slots were
allocated to us by Google. Unfortunately due to a mailing list subscription
issue, mentors from RocketMQ and IoTDB didnt receive the reminders for scoring
their proposals. This resulted in both of these projects missing out in
participating in GSoC this year.The problem subscribing to the GSoC mentors
list has been reported to the Infra team [1]. In total we have 20 students
participating this year.

### Apache Local Community (ALC)
ComDev has been actively worked on Apache Local Community (ALC) initiative.
The ALC comprises local groups of Apache (Open Source) enthusiasts, called an
'ALC Chapter [2]

Here are some major activities for this quarter.

-- Establishment of ALC Beijing, China Chapter [3] on Feb 18, 2020
-- Establishment ALC Warsaw, Poland Chapter [4] on Mar 16, 2020
-- Establishment ALC Budapest, Hungary Chapter [5] on Apr 28, 2020
-- Discussion on ALC Branding (Website and Logo) Kenneth Paskett from ASF
   Central Services / Creative Lead is working on the ALC logo and has made
   good progress
-- Volunteers from 'ALC Indore' are mentoring new ALC Chapters so we have
   assigned mentors from Indore Chapter to the newly founded ALCs to provide
   guidance for the initial few months.
-- Every ALC Chapter had held regular internal meetings to plan their
   activities. These have been virtual meetings due to to Covid-19.
-- As the purpose of ALC is to connect with local their local audience, the
   ALC Chapters are prefer using native language.

Below are the details of activities organised by each ALC chapter during this
quarter.

#### ALC Beijing
-- Seven internal meetings held. [6]
-- ALC Beijing is working on creating a series of podcasts in Mandarin to
   promote the ASF and ASF projects. The first podcast has been published and
   is an interview with Apache Skywalking community.[7]
-- ALC Beijing is also working on writing/translating various ASF related blog
   posts into Mandarin and have written around 9 posts on the following
   topics.
- Why did we set up ALC (Apache Local Community) Beijing?
- DolphinScheduler Introduction
- How to become an ASF contributor
- ASF Annual General Assembly Procedure
- Apache Software Foundation Board of Directors Introduction in 2020
- ASF structure and governance
- How Apache Software Foundation incubates so many successful open source
  projects.
- Apache Graduation - Apache ShardingSphere - blog posts have been published
  about the the ups and downs on the road to open source [8]

#### ALC Indore
-- Five internal meetings held [9]
-- Webinar on Open-Source and ASF Awareness was held on 09 May 2020. It
   attracted over 80 attendees including students and professionals.Many
   registered for the event from the Indore region. [10]. The event was run in
   Hindi

#### ALC Warsaw
-- Three internal meetings held [11]
-- Webinar on Apache Local Community, The Apache Way, and Welcoming Community.
   The meetup was attended by 14 people. from the Warsaw region. All events
   were held in Polish.

### Feathercast
Efforts to get more regular content for our Feathercast podcast channel
Feathercast has been relaunched.[12] The initial focus is to get a basic
introduction to every ASF project. So far interviews with 5 projects (Sling,
Airflow, OFBiz, Mahout and Ignite) have been published.

### ComDev Website Migration
Following a discussion [13] and vote [14] on the mailing list  it was agreed
to migrate the content from our existing community.apache.org website from the
existing CMS/SVN to be Git based and use Hugo. Huge thanks to Roy Lenferink
for working on and managing the migration and in recognition we have invited
Roy to join the PMC.

## Community Health:
Our dev mailing list has seen a significant increase in traffic compared to
the previous quarter (703 emails compared to 243). This is probably due to a
combination of: GSoC where mentors and potential students have requested
information, and, also the activities and discussions around running and
establishing ALCs. It would be good to see if we can maintain these increased
activity levels into the next quarters.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
Apache CouchDB software is a document-oriented database that can be queried and 
indexed in a MapReduce fashion using JavaScript. CouchDB also offers 
incremental replication with bi-directional conflict detection and resolution.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention. However, various board members
requested clarification on this item from the last report:

- a rogue source that provided binary builds off of CouchDB master has been
  shut down. Unbeknownst to the project, a good number of critical fixes for
  the 3.0.0 release were found by users of this unauthorized binary provider.
  We are happy to continue to make sure the project complies with ASF policy,
  but we also want to highlight that we benefited from something that was
  technically forbidden, so maybe it is worth reconsidering some of this. Due
  to the release process, we are currently not in the position to bring this
  up in the form of a regular policy change request, we just wanted to flag
  this, in case someone wants to take up this cause.

df: this wasn’t a trademark issue, but rather a third party providing binaries
off of CouchDB `master` to the general public, rather than just dev@, which is
not permitted as per ASF policy.

da: done ;)

rb, curcuru: apologies for not being clearer, this wasn’t just third party
binaries, but binaries off of `master` for the general public.

—

In addition: we appreciate the guidance on permitting HTML emails on-list.


## Membership Data:
Apache CouchDB was founded 2008-11-19 (11 years ago)
There are currently 67 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:2.

Community changes, past quarter:

- Deni Burroughs was added as committer on 2020-02-15
- Alessio Biancalana was added as committer on 2020-02-27
- Juanjo Rodriguez was added as committer on 2020-02-07

## Project Activity:
- Released 3.0.0 to great success and accolades.
  - see https://blog.couchdb.org/2020/02/26/the-road-to-couchdb-3-0/ for details
- We’re seeing increased beginner support inquiries on our various channels
  which we attribute to the major version release.
- Started 3.0.1 and 3.1.0 release processes.
- Continued work on 4.0 design and development (see previous reports for
  details).

## Community Health:

Significantly increased mailing list, GitHub and (unofficial) Slack usage
supports increased project buzz post 3.0.0. We’re happy and chugging along.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Drill Project  [Charles Givre]

## Description:
The mission of Drill is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Schema-free SQL Query Engine for Apache Hadoop, NoSQL and Cloud Storage

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

## Project Activity:
Since the last board report there has been considerable work done to Drill in
preparation for the 1.18 release. Unfortunately the situation with COVID-19
has affected the development schedule. 

We have committed the following PRs of interest:
- RDBMS Metastore for Drill
- Significantly Refactored and Improved JSON Readers 
- Various Improvements to REST API 
- Time bucket and other UDFs to facilitate time series analysis
- Storage plugin for REST APIs (https://youtu.be/oEOhFWm3D9A for demo)
- Improvements to Excel Reader to allow large files
- Format Plugin for SPSS files


Additionally we have the following new functionality near completion:
- Storage Plugin for Apache Druid 

In response to the questions from the last Board report, the Drill community 
has held two hangouts. Since the main developers are based in the US on 
both coasts, and in Ukraine, we held them at 10AM ET which is 7AM PT, and 
1600 CET (Ukraine). The hangout was in English as everyone in the community
does speak English. We didn't take minutes, but there were some follow on 
discussions over email and one concrete result was that Drill's error messages
have been significantly improved.

## Community Health:
The Apache Geode dev and issues mailing lists both experienced upticks in
discussion traffic, up 15% and 44%, respectively, in Q1.

The number of JIRA tickets opened and closed remained robust, though down 16%
and 26%, respectively, from the previous quarter. Points of emphasis included
error recovery improvements, API extensions, and compatibility to accommodate
containers such as Kubernetes and BOSH.

- mod_http2, our HTTP/2 module
- mod_ssl (primarily improvements for OpenSSL 1.1.x)
- Two medium severity CVEs addressed (CVE-2020-1927 and CVE-2020-1934)

2.4.42 was cut but not released due to regressions in our APXS tool-chain.

There was a lot of good activity around this release, both before and after,
with many solid discussions surrounding the changes, various regressions and
fixes.

Our work with automated testing via CI is proving useful and is considered to
be in a stable condition now, after various tweaks were made and some testing
was skipped or minimized to reduce false positives from the CI platform. There
are still some issues surrounding false positives and the CI kicking off when
there is no need, but a large part of this is simply a learning curve for us
with regards to developing smarter and better memorized practices with regards
to committing code and documentation.

We have set up a dedicated mailing list for new types of notifications, for
now primarily GitHub PRs, with the aim of furthering our presence on this
platform and get cracking at outstanding and new PRs. We have not come to a
conclusion on whether switching to git for our development is the road
forward, but are also confident we can work with whatever the community
decides on. We are able to address PRs using subversion as well (thanks to the
git mirror), and thus do not rely on a specific version control system in
order to have a presence and work with communities on GitHub and the likes.

## Community Health:
Overall we are seeing a healthy influx of messages on our lists, as well as a
substantial increase in commits to our repository. Our dev@ list traffic was
up more than 140%, largely due to the 2.4.42+2.4.43 release discussions.
Likewise, it is common for our commits to pick up around a release, as things
are back-ported and bugs are found and addressed.

We have also seen a steady increase in the number of people actively
participating in providing code changes, now at 18 people this past quarter as
opposed to 15 in the previous quarter.

As with our developers list, we also saw a substantial increase in traffic on
our users list, primarily surrounding the release of and changes in 2.4.43.

PMC oversight remains very healthy, with more than 15 PMC members actively
participating in governance, Q&As and development this quarter.

Looking at the overall development group robustness (aka pony factor[1]), we
have also seen an increase in the number of people making up the bulk of code
contributions over this past quarter, compared to the previous quarter, which
in itself is a good sign that the project maintains a large group of
maintainers and is geared for unforeseen eventualities.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts. This monthly 
report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are not viewing 
this in that format, it can be seen here:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/May2020

There are presently 44 podlings incubating. In April, podlings executed 9 
distinct releases. NLPCraft and Pagespeed releases are not yet in the
offical release area. We added three new IPMC members and one retired.

There where no IP clearances in April. There are still four new podlings 
under discussion or VOTE; they are AgenisGraph (voted in but the name needs 
to change), BlueMarlin, HBlock and Liminal (was Rainbow). One project, 
ShardingSphere, graduated last month and one podling Tamaya retired. At 
least one podling is heading towards graduation in the next few months, the 
next one to graduate is likely to be Hudi. This month we were missing 
reports from Pinot, S2Graph and SDAP. All podlings were contact and 
no response so we will need to check if the PPMCs are active. PageSpeed 
didn't get mentor sign off in time. All will be asked to report next month. 

Last month Gobblin complained that they didn't get sign off from their 
mentors and that the IPMC or board should do something about this. The 
podling and mentors were reminded. The podling has been asked to check 
with their mentors if this happens again. Without changing policy not to 
require mentor sign off on reports, I'm not sure what more could be done. 
We have reports missing sign off a couple of times a year.

There was a couple of discussions about the incubator disclaimer notice, 
time limits to incubation and most on list traffic was around releases and 
new podlings.

Three podlings MXNet, SDAP and Spot still need to sort out their roster and 
private mailing list subscriptions.

## DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences.
Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a 
stream and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical 
guarantees, to computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude 
faster than traditional, exact methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Clearly, the most important issue for us is to add more committers.  
     From the Clutch and Podling Website reports, this is the last 
     major issue for us.  

     We have tried to encourage folks that ask questions or raise issues 
     to get more involved, and we have one or two folks that have 
     expressed interest in submitting PRs or even a new sketch. But, 
     alas, none have followed through, yet.  

     Developing sketch code is very tricky and understanding how these 
     algorithms work, and the math and statistics behind them, is a hurdle
     for most people. Yet, we have been very clear that we are prepared to
     train someone to become a committer.  All we ask is that the 
     candidate be open to learning about these fascinating algorithms and
     committed to work with us. We could use some active help from our
     Mentors or from the Board to help us find someone that would find 
     this work interesting.  

     I am convinced that there are folks in the greater Apache community
     that would really enjoy working on this library, we just need to
     discover who they are!  

  2. Referring to last month's report, we have made progress in setting up 
     TODO lists on our major sites: Java and C++. And we keep working 
     away at these lists.  We have also improved our Downloads page and 
     brought it up to Apache standards. I don't feel these should be 
     issues for graduation.  

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of? 

  The issue mentioned above. We could use some help in finding someone
  who would find working in the sketching algorithms area really
  interesting and would want to work with us to become a committer.  

### How has the community developed since the last report?  

  We have been accepted to present at two conferences this Summer, the
  USPTO technology conference and the Spark & AI conference.  

  We also have interest from Apache Flink and Apache Impala to 
  integrate sketches into their systems. There has also been interest
  from Apache Beam, but so far no action.  

### How has the project developed since the last report?  

  We have done a lot of work making the C++ code more robust and will 
  likely have a major new release of the C++ library before this 
  report is read by the Board.  We also in the voting process for a
  new Java release that cleans up some licensing glitches and fixes
  a bug found by Druid.  

  Our activity on Slack has increased quite a bit with 
  interesting queries from all over.  

  We also have done a lot of work on the website, adding content and
  improving navigation. The Community and Downloads pages are all new.
  Please have a look! 

  We continue to improve our release process with more guided scripts
  and fix issues as we discover them.

## ECharts

ECharts is a charting and data visualization library written in JavaScript.

ECharts has been incubating since 2018-01-18.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Redirecting echartsjs.com to echarts.apache.org. See reason in the 
  next question.
  2.
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  https://echarts.apache.org/ recently changed to a different CDN as a work 
  around for HTTPS CA expiration problem. (See 


  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-20185?page=com.atlassian.jira.pl
  ugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Aall-tabpanel )
  The CDN change makes the website slow, at least in China as we tested.
  Our next step is to use echarts.apache.org as domain name and use 
  echarts.cdn.apache.org as resource server.
  After fixing this problem, we will redirect echartsjs.com to 
  echarts.apache.org so that the website redirection problem can be finally 
  solved.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  The community has been more active on the mailing list and pull requests.
  We have been working on encouraging the community to contribute in varied 
  forms and it seems to take effect. We received 23 pull requests from 
  non-committers since last report.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  We release a new version since last report and is discussing and working 
  on the next big version.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

  https://github.com/echarts-maps This GitHub user is creating ECharts 
  related projects. We asked him to add notations stating that these are 
  not official Apache ECharts (incubating) project. It has this
  description now:
  "All projects are NOT associated with official Apache ECharts 
  (incubating)
  project and are independently maintained by chfw.". 
  We also asked the author to add this notice to the readme of each 
  projects but he has not finished this yet because there are many projects
  need to change. We are under communication with him about this.

## Hivemall

Hivemall is a library for machine learning implemented as Hive
UDFs/UDAFs/UDTFs.

Hivemall has been incubating since 2016-09-13.

  2. One or more Apache Releases as an Incubator project

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  We reported in April 2020. Why we need to report May 2020?

  PPMCs are considering exit approaches (retiring or graduate as Hive 
  subproject).

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  No enough progress since the last report in April 2020.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Almost nothing happened in April 2020. 

  The development has been calmed down since the last Apache release on Dec 
  2019 due to changes in PPMC member job roles.

  are back to your normal reporting schedule after missing
  reporting for some months.

  Drew Farris (shepherd): No mentors active on the mailing lists within the 
  past 3 months. Little project activity.

  mirrors the incubator site over at modpagespeed.com - but will work
  on transferring the domain name to the ASF this quarter.
  - It's not known if the VP, brand has explicitly approved, so that is 
  something we need to make sure about and resolve.

## Toree

Toree provides applications with a mechanism to interactively and remotely
access Apache Spark.

Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  In my opinion, I believe Toree is one of those small but useful projects
  that,
  except for being very active, would be ready to graduate. Having said that,
  where
  there is an important issue or for voting new members and releases the PPMC
  show up
  and participate (see example of last committer thread)

  1.Increase active contributors
  2.
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Few Q&A on both Gitter and mailing list. BTW, Gitter is the chat application
  that is common around Python/Jupyter extensions and here is the Toree one
  https://gitter.im/apache/toree

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Toree is somewhat a mature Jupyter kernel that provides good and stable
  support
  for both Scala and Spark. On this quarter there were some minor bugfixes
  around
  Scala corner cases.

  Are things falling through the cracks? If so, please list any
  open issues that need to be addressed.

  There was nothing requiring mentor intervention on the last quarter.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings
  name and brand? If not what actions has the PPMC taken to
  correct this? Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?

  No Trademark issues

  - [X] (toree) Ryan Blue  
     Comments:  I mostly agree with the assessment that Toree is near
                graduation, but is not very active. The community has
                demonstrated it is capable of making releases, adding
                new committers & PPMC members, and welcoming new
                members. My only criticism is how much discussion is
                taking place on gitter rather than the dev list. That
                makes it difficult to keep up, but I think it is
                important to let this community hold discussions in
                the forum that makes sense for it instead of trying
                to make it fit the mold.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## Training

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for
training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various Apache
and non-Apache target projects.

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Promote the information about Apache Training Project with increased 
     participation from community
  2. Create a tutorial on how the tools provided by this project can be 
     used to create own content
  3. Review current policies around contribution review and releases to 
     find a pragmatic compromise 

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Unfortunately, not much has happened since the last report in February.
  We did add one new committer but other than that there has been hardly 
  any activity.
  While we'd like to blame the current situation in the world for this it
  wouldn't be a fair assessment as we had the same problem in the previous 
  period.

  We still believe the idea of the Training project is a good one
  and E-Mails are being responded to so the project is not dead.
  It's a lack of time and dedicated resources that is at least partly
  to blame for this situation.
  We hope that development will pick up again in the future.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Activity on the dev list has declined even more since the last report with
  a total number of posts of 34 (most of which are automatted reminders).

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  n/a

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
  There are currently some issues with this podling that we are working to 
  address, we believe that the issues are not yet critical and can be turned
  around from within the community but want to make the board aware of this
  early on.

  The name search process has not yet been started, as there is still time 
  to do that if and when graduation draws nearer. The PPMC is actively 
  monitoring usage of the Podlings current name on other sites. 
  The Podling is not directly affiliating with any sponsors donating 
  content and presenting an independent image on the webpage.

## Tuweni

Tuweni is a set of libraries and other tools to aid development of
blockchain and other decentralized software in Java and other JVM languages.

Tuweni has been incubating since 2019-03-25.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Finish export notice for cryptographic elements
  2. Vote in a few more committers
  3. Keep release pace and adoption

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  No issues to report at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  We are seeing a few contributions in the bug reports and pull
  requests offered on the repository. The project is starting to
  gain good traction.

  We have seen adoption of the project downstream and a couple
  of fixes contributed as direct result.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project reached 1.0.0, which was a big milestone.
  The roadmap is on Github and more accessible.
  The project is also using Github actions
  to help kick faster CI for pull requests.

  1.0.0 took a long time to release, and it's mostly to blame on
  the difficulty to check the release bits.
  We will need to do better there.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  Yes. At present, there are no issues nor concerns with the Tuweni mark.
  We do not anticipate any issues with the mark regarding graduation.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform for efficiently storing
and processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========

We released 2.5.0, which includes the following new features:
- TLS 1.3 support (1.2 is now the default)
- Co-groups for Kafka Streams
- Incremental rebalance for Kafka Consumer
- New metrics for better operational insight
- Upgrade Zookeeper to 3.5.7
- Deprecate support for Scala 2.11

We also released 2.4.1, which fixes more than 39 issues.

We are actively working on replacing Zookeeper with an internal Raft based
consensus service. This will simplify the operation of Kafka and allow
Kafka to handle many more partitions.

Community

## Community Health:

We are pleased to see interest from CHAOSS, which we feel is an important
organization to be involved with to ensure the longevity of this project. But
we continue to be starved for new contributors.

While there was an uptick in commits towards the end of the quarter, they
were, once again, all from the same contributor.

is no work done in past quarter for the same. We will reinitiate the thread on
roadmap, and see if we can do any changes or improvements to the project. If
there is no clear roadmap, we will call for retiring the project next quarter.

## Community Health:
There has been no change in community participation. Since there is no
activity on project, community is mostly silent.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Libcloud Project  [Tomaž Muraus]

## Description

Libcloud is a Python library that abstracts away the differences among
multiple cloud provider APIs.

## Issues

There are no issues which require board attention at this time.

## Project Activity

We had three releases since the last report (2.8.1, 3.0.0, 2.8.2).

One of those releases was a milestone v3.0.0 release which includes many new
changes and also drops support for Python < 3.5 (this includes Python 2.7).

For a while, we will still maintain v2.8.x release series which still supports
Python 2.7, but we will only backport any serious security or bug fixes and no
new features will be added.

## Community Health

We have received a decent amount of activity on Github, this includes multiple
new provider driver contributions.

## Membership Data

- Currently 13 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

- Currently 22 committers.
- Clemens Wolff was added as committer on 2019-07-15

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Matt Sicker]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Logging Services project is to create and maintain of 
software for managing the logging of application behavior, and for related 
software components.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Logging Services was founded 2003-12-16 (16 years ago)
There are currently 35 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carter Kozak on 2018-07-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Andrei Ivanov on 2019-04-18.

## Project Activity:
- In February, we released Log4j 2.13.1 which was primarily a maintenance
  release with numerous bugfixes.
- In February, we began the release candidate process for Log4j Scala API 12.0,
  our first release of the Scala library that supports Scala 2.13 as well as
  using sbt instead of maven for builds which simplified that codebase a bit.
  This RC process took the entire quarter with some speedbumps, and we've
  released the new version in early May (technically the next quarter).
- Much work has been done with the maintainer of log4j2-logstash-layout to
  integrate the code from that library into Log4j itself. While this hasn't
  been released yet, we hope to have it integrated in time for Log4j 2.14.0.
- In March, we voted to move log4net to a dormant state due to the lack of any
  PMC members to maintain the subproject. The following month, this inspired
  some external contributors to step up and start working on reviving the
  subproject. The first major goal is to get a working CI environment for the
  build, and we have been examining AppVeyor as a potential solution already
  supported by Infra.
- In March and April, we migrated all our Jenkins jobs to use Jenkins pipelines
  which are typically better supported upstream by Jenkins than the previous
  job types.
- In April, we released Log4j 2.13.2 which primarily contained bugfixes as
  well as a security fix for CVE-2020-9488 which affected the SMTP appender.
- Throughout the quarter, we've received several contributions to log4cxx to
  help simplify its build system which should help release managers in the
  future.
- In May (next quarter), we announced CVE-2018-1285 for a fairly contrived
  security issue in log4net for which we have no released fix due to the
  dormant status of log4net.

## Community Health:
- We've seen an increase in log4j-user mailing list traffic, especially since
  we announced an old CVE for log4j 1.x which has led some confused users into
  panic upgrades.
- The vote to mark log4net as dormant has helped revitalize some discussion
  around how to revive that subproject, thus increasing dev@ traffic.
- Some increased development activity now that the holiday quarter is over. It
  seems like the pandemic hasn't directly affected development at this point.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.15 release on December
25, 2019.  The next major release was due on April 30, 2020, and is currently
undergoing voting.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Cihad Guzel as committer on 8/16/2019. We nominated
and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did not sign up
any new PMC members or committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the
lookout for new PMC members and committers.  There are several prospects who
we may ask in the near future.

In the latest quarter the team spent time bringing two more connectors into
the modern world: the Confluence connector (a new V6 version is now
available), and the ElasticSearch connector.  These have been necessary to
keep up with changes in these platforms.  We continue to rely on early
adopters to co-develop these connectors with us.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been fairly active this quarter.  Requests for
connector development continue to be significant.

I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

## Description:
Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data. Apache Marmotta was founded
in December 2012, and has graduated from the Incubator in November 2013.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Marmotta was founded 2013-11-20 (6 years ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mark A. Matienzo on 2016-08-18.
- No new committers. Last addition was Xavier Sumba on 2017-03-27.

## Project Activity:
Last month, the question whether the project should be moved to the Attic was
postend to the dev-list.

No committer or PMC member responded but two other people showed interest to
keep the project alive. Until now, no decision on how to continue was taken.

## Community Health:
Given the little response on the Attic-Question raised on the dev-list the
community seems mostly dormant or moved away. I will take the Attic-question to
the users-list to possibly attract further interest.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache OpenWhisk Project  [Dave Grove]

## Description:
The mission of Apache OpenWhisk is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a platform for building serverless applications with functions

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenWhisk was founded 2019-07-16 (10 months ago)
There are currently 49 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Rob Allen on 2019-07-16.
- Alexander Klimetschek was added as committer on 2020-03-12

## Project Activity:

A major code contribution from Adobe Inc. of an OpenWhisk debugger was
formally completed in February.  The first Apache release of this new module
(openwsk-debug-1.2.0) was made several weeks later.

The project continues to make some progress towards a long-awaited next
release of the core OpenWhisk system (the last release of the core system was
0.9.0-incubating in 2018-10-31). This will be the first release of our new
standalone configuration which enables a very simple single machine deployment
of OpenWhisk. It will also be the first time the project has released a
coherent set of all its releasable software components (currently 23 separate
packages). The last lingering todo item is completing a release of the
remaining two packages that have not made releases since the project
exited incubation.

Recent releases:
- openwhisk-package-alarms-2.1.0 was released on 2020-05-11.
- openwhisk-client-js-3.21.2 was released on 2020-05-08.
- openwhisk-apigateway-1.0.0 was released on 2020-04-13.
- openwhisk-wskdebug-1.2.0 was released on 2020-03-10.
- openwhisk-runtime-nodejs-1.15.0 was released on 2020-02-17.
- openwhisk-runtime-python-1.14.0 was released on 2020-02-17.
- openwhisk-runtime-rust-1.0.0 was released on 2020-02-14.

## Community Health:
Community health is good with plenty of activity on dev list and slack.

Although metrics such as PRs and commits have declined since the previous
quarter, the project is continuing to make progress and is still averaging
more than one commit per day. It seems plausible that at least some of the
statistical decline may be attributable to short-term disruptions due to
COVID-19.

After a couple of months of intermittent discussion, the community adopted a
light-weight process for Proposing Openwhisk EnhanceMents (POEM) to facilitate
discussion of proposed architectural changes to the core system.  Since POEM
was adopted at the end of March, it has yet to be utilized. It remains to be
seen whether this indicates a lack of need for the POEM process, or whether
the six or so weeks since adoption have not been sufficient time for new POEMs
to be proposed by the community.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe Chiasson]

--- mod_perl --

mod_perl 2.0.11 was released on October 5th 2019

As is usually the case after a release, things have quieted down with
no major bug or issues known.

-- Activity --

Nothing significant hapenning on the mailing-lists, as can be expected
at this tine.

Without significant bugs found or reported, it's not unusual to see this
level of quietness.

As been shown before, even though the project is quite stable and generally
quiet, when needed, the PMC members and commiters can mobilise and get things
done.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, as usual.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers. 

No new changes to the committer base since last report. 

Last Commiter addition was Jan Kaluza in April 2013

-- PMC --

Currently 11 PMC members. 

No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 

Last PMC addition was Steve Hay on Wed Feb 29 2012

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Phoenix Project  [Ankit Singhal]

## Description:
The mission of Phoenix is the creation and maintenance of software related to
High performance relational database layer over Apache HBase for low latency
applications

## Issues:
No issues to report to the board at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Phoenix was founded 2014-05-20 (6 years ago)
There are currently 51 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Ankit Singhal was appointed as a new PMC chair on 2020-04-15.
- Kadir Ozdemir was added to the PMC on 2020-02-25
- No new committers. Last addition was Gokcen Iskender on 2020-02-07.

## Project Activity:
- We had our last release of Phoenix 4.15.0 on 2019-12-20. Now, we have a RM 
  for our next 4.16.0 release and there is also an active development going on 
  our another parallel release line for 5.1.0 release.

- All our connectors which are required by third party libraries to access 
  Phoenix data are moved to a separate repo so that they can evolve with 
  newer versions of these libraries and can be released independently.

- I'm also happy to report that some committers had also taken up work to
  improve our build system, have put extra efforts in simplifying the code and
  consolidating branches to reduce friction for the new contributors.

- we are also working towards bringing our python connector in parity with other
  connectors to accommodate non-java users who are more comfortable in 
  writing applications in Python.

## Community Health:
We have not added any new committers in the last quarter though as PMCs,
we have taken this as an action item to continuously work towards 
evaluating and nominating new contributors.

There is a consistent drop on our user mailing list year over year and this 
quarter we also observe a slight drop on our dev list . However, our number of 
active contributors have increased and issues created-to-resolved ratio has
improved to 4:3.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Lee Whitcomb]

## Description:
The mission of Pivot is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Rich Internet applications in Java.

## Issues:
Community health has been very weak for many years already, and there are no
signs of it improving. It is likely that Pivot will go to the Attic soon.

## Membership Data:
Apache Pivot was founded 2009-12-16 (10 years ago)
There are currently 10 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Niclas Hedhman on 2016-01-14.
- No new committers. Last addition was Niclas Hedhman on 2020-02-06.

## Project Activity:
Activity is very low, and effectively a single developer effort, and very
little (but not none) external interest. There has been a small uptick of
activity after February, and there is work on-going, steady, albeit slow,
progress towards a 2.1 release, but it is difficult to estimate when 
(and if) that will be ready.


## Community Health:
Community health is not great, and the PMC should discuss whether the
project should be placed into the Attic. 3 PMC members are still available to
make decisions, but there are no new committers or PMC Members in sight.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
formats

The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache POI was founded 2007-05-16 (13 years ago) There are currently 39
committers and 32 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Axel Howind on 2019-11-11.
- No new committers. Last addition was Axel Howind on 2019-11-12.

## Project Activity:
 - Mostly bugfixing and some smaller features developed, mostly in HSLF/XSLF
   area, rendering of slides as well as some code quality work.

   Release 4.1.2 was published, another bugfix release may come up soon to
   release a few important regression fixes.

   Work has started to better support Jigsaw modules for JDK 9+.

## Community Health:
 - There are some ongoing discussions with users about features/behavior which
   indicates that the popularity of Apache POI is still high. Questions via
   email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   There is still activity from multiple committers. We are looking at ways to
   broaden the developer base but not many potential committers show up on the
   mailing lists currently.

   Overall issue count went down despite a number of new reports/discussions.
   However there are still a fairly large number of reported bugs in various
   states of triage, because many require lots of work get to a "fixable"
   state.

### XMLBeans
 - Nearly no changes for XMLBeans this quarter, the project is in maintenance
   mode.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode.

 - Will issue a minor release once we finish testing the new updates.
 - Finishing work on .Net elastic broadcast. Planning a new major release this
   year.

## Health report:

 - The engagement from the community has been declining perhaps because the
   codebase has been stable.
 - There's new activity towards an upcoming minor release (PRs pending review).
 - Work continues in the elastic broadcast pull request (600+ comments/fixes).
   There was a delay in this effort due to the principal committer's paternity

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:

 - Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup
    search of network services.  Services may be implemented in a number
    of languages, while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at
    least), to allow proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 -  Minimal activity at present, initial work on the modular build structure
    has commenced.  The current monolithic build is complex, with it's own
    build tool classdepandjar, it adds complexity for new developers. In recent
    months I have had work commitments that have limited my ability to
    integrate the modular build.  The other committers are waiting for the
    modular build and I have done a lot of work on this locally, this work has
    been a significant undertaking integrating the works of Dennis Reedy, Dan
    Rollo and myself.  This is also a mature codebase, having been in
    development since the late 1990's.

 - The monolithic code has been svn moved into modules into an initial maven
   build structure, next step is to move junit tests to each module.

 - Until the monolithic build has been broken up into maven modules, we are
   likely to have difficulty attracting new contributors due to the appearance
   of complexity.

Release roadmap:

River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&   binary release)
River 3.2 - Input validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling&
safe ServiceRegistrar  lookup service.River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - River is a mature codebase with existing deployments, it was primarily
   designed for dynamic discovery of services on private networks.  IPv4 NAT
   limitations historically prevented the use of River on public networks,
   however the use of IPv6 on public networks removes these limitations.  Web
   services evolved with the publish subscribe model of today's internet, River
   has the potential to dynamically discover services on IPv6 networks, peer to
   peer, blurring current distinctions between client and server, it has the
   potential to address many of the security issues currently experienced with
   IoT and avoid any dependency on the proprietary cloud for "things".

- Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes
     required prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and
     Gadget attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports
     IPv4 multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so
     authentication can occur prior to downloading service proxy's,
     this addresses a long standing security issue with service lookup
     while significantly improving performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal
     of support for insecure cypher's.
   * Secure TLS SocketFactory's for RMI Registry, uses
     the currently logged in Subject for authentication.
     The RMI Registry still plays a minor role in service activation,
     this allows those who still use the Registry to secure it.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses
     classdepandjar, a bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
   * Updating the Jini specifications.

## Project Composition:

    There are currently 16 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:
The mission of Apache SIS is the creation and maintenance of software providing 
data structures for developing geospatial applications compliant with the model 
of OGC/ISO international standards.

## Issues:
As pointed out by DA and DF comments, the project currently has three active
committers from the same company not communicating enough with the otherwise
quiet community. However the community has not yet expressed frustration to my
knowledge (RB concern). Efforts for trying to improve the situation are
discussed in the "Project Activity" section.

## Membership Data:
Apache SIS was founded 2012-09-19 (8 years ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johann Sorel on 2017-09-07.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexís Manin on 2019-07-05.

## Project Activity:
Previous report listed the main areas under development, together with the
fact that those developments were happening on a branch instead than on
master. Those details have been put in a "roadmap" page on the wiki [1]. A
"Report on SIS progress" email has been sent to the mailing list with those
points, together with an acknowledgement that we are weak on communication
[2]. The community reaction up to date are encouragements.

We are developing a JavaFX application in part as debugger tools, but also in
an attempt to help the community to grips with the project by visualizing what
the library is doing before to explore the API. A wiki page for the
application with screenshots has been created [3].

On more technical aspects, some emails proposing to choose between
alternatives have been posted [4][5], but it is hard to get feedback on
proposals such as [5] that require deep knowledge of the library.

We have skipped Google Summer of Code this year because of lack of time for
mentoring. Our effort for attracting a community shifted to the JavaFX
application, but we may come back to GSoC in the future.

## Community Health
Currently active PMC members are from 3 different organizations. Currently
active committers are from a single organization. Candidates as new PMC
members are either a developer from the same organization than current
committers (so not increasing diversity), or user interested in oversight but
otherwise not involved in daily operations.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Nathan Hartman]

The Apache Subversion® version control system exists to be universally
recognized and adopted as an open-source, centralized version control
solution characterized by its reliability as a safe haven for valuable
data; the simplicity of its model and usage; and its ability to
support the needs of a wide variety of users and projects, from
individuals to large-scale enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

* Community

  At the Subversion project, we believe that it is healthy for our
  community to change PMC chairs from time to time. This April, the
  PMC chair hat transitioned from Stefan Sperling to Nathan Hartman.
  Stefan served as PMC chair for a bit over two years, and we
  anticipate that our new chair will serve for about the same length
  of time. As we welcome Nathan to this role, we'd like to extend our
  heartfelt thanks to Stefan for his diligent service these past two
  years.

  This February, we celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the Subversion
  project, and, with the help of Apache Marketing, we recognized this
  occasion with a press release on February 27th. During this process,
  we collected testimonials and success stories from a few of our
  long-time users in the corporate world. We'd like to thank Apache
  Marketing and give a shout-out to Sally Khudairi for making this
  possible. Also we'd like to thank our own Daniel Shahaf for
  providing the inspiration to do it.

  This quarter, we have seen a noticeable uptick in activity, both
  from developers and users. Much of the increase is due to our
  upcoming release (see Releases below).

  There is now an ongoing discussion at our users@ list about a
  possible major new development, aimed at making Subversion even
  stronger than it already is at handling large binary files. This
  appears to be an important use case for work in video games,
  semiconductors, and other industries.

  Our user support forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and
  answers regularly and our dev@ list has been receiving patches for
  minor new features, bug fixes, and proposed optimizations.

  No new PMC members have been added since the last report. Our most
  recently added PMC member, Yasuhito Futatsuki (futatuki@), joined
  the PMC in November 2019.

* Releases

  Our most recent release, 1.13.0, was made on 30 Oct 2019.

  A large part of our development efforts this quarter have been
  focused on the upcoming release of Subversion 1.14.0. The 1.14.x
  series will be our latest Long Term Support (LTS) line, with planned
  support for at least four years. The latest release candidate is
  currently undergoing a four-week "soak" period, part of our process
  for creating quality releases. During this time, interested
  developers, users, and other stakeholders are highly encouraged to
  test the release candidate and report any issues that should be
  addressed. If no "showstoppers" are found, Subversion 1.14.0 is
  scheduled to be released later this month.

Managing digital identities in enterprise environments

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Syncope was founded 2012-11-21 (7 years ago)
There are currently 24 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Matteo Alessandroni on 2017-12-22.

## Project Activity:
We finalized both 2.0.15 (pure maintenance) and 2.1.6 (which also introduced
some improvements and new features).

CVE-2019-17557, CVE-2020-1959 and CVE-2020-1961 were successfully managed by
the PMC; fixes included in the relevant releases.

Project activity is now focused on next major version 3.0.0 which will
introduce great changes, still requiring a considerable amount of work.

Latest releases:

- 2.0.15 was released on 2020-04-29
- 2.1.6 was released on 2020-04-29

## Community Health:
Discussions about new features and improvements keep appearing and being
followed up in dev@.

Newcomers approach user@ and are getting supported by various members of the
community.

The numbers (ML subscribers and traffic) seem to support these trends.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache SystemML Project  [Jon Deron Eriksson]

## Description:
SystemML is a declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) system that 
allows the flexible specification of ML algorithms via an R-like syntax 
and automatically generates hybrid runtime plans of single node, 
in-memory operations as well as distributed operations on top of Apache 
Spark. SystemDS extends this scope to the end-to-end data science 
lifecycle (from data cleaning and preparation, over model training, to 
debugging and deployment) as well as privacy-preserving federated learning.

## Project Status:
- After an internal discussion and positive feedback, the SystemDS fork 
of Apache SystemML has been merged back into the Apache repository on 
2020-03-27. This merge preserved the history of individual commits (430) 
and respective contributors (16 of 17 new to SystemML).

- The name change to Apache SystemDS has been approved 
(PODLINGNAMESEARCH-179), and we intend (after this report has been 
approved) to work with the INFRA team to change the Github repo, JIRA, etc.

- Once the name change has been completed, we intend to release Apache 
SystemDS 2.0 (to continue the Apache SystemML releases, but clearly 
communicate the new scope).

## Membership Data:
- Apache SystemML was founded 2017-05-16 (incubator process entered 
2015-11-02)
- There are currently 30 committers and 23 PMC members in the project.
- 4 new committers have been added 2020-05-01 (Arnab Phani, Mark Dokter, 
Shafaq Siddiqi, and Kevin Innerebner).

## Activity and Health:
- Code activity is healthy with 149 commits in the last 3 months.
- Community growth is healthy with 4 new committers and 20 active 
contributors in the last 3 months
- Communication is healthy but mailing list activity can be improved.

## Releases:
- Apache SystemML 1.2.0 was released on 2018-08-24.
- SystemDS 0.2.0 was released (outside ASF) on 2020-03-24

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Health

In last report it was mentioned we had more than doubled contributors in the
last 14 months, from around 40 to now 98, however have only added one
committer in that same timeframe.  Discussion is ongiong on specific
candidates with one vote very likely to start any day.  Hopefully there will
be some more activity in this area.

## Activity

Conversation has started on how to handle the javax to jakarta namespace
migration.  Jakarta EE 8 is the last release with code under the javax
namespace and Jakarta EE 9, aimed for release this summer, has all code
migrated to the jakarta namespace in one large breaking change.  Aside from
the namespace change, the APIs are unchanged and intentionally identical.

TomEE 8.x currently implements Jakarta EE 8 with around 95% passing and some
work left to do to completely pass all TCK tests.  Several discussions are
ongoing presenting options on when to do the migration, including the
potential to use of bytecode transformation to produce a "jakarta" version of
TomEE allowing both Jakarta EE 8 and Jakarta EE 9 compliance to be worked on
in the same branch.

Additional discussion in this area is around which standalone APIs jars we
should continue to produce and use.  Historically, we've created ALv2
licensed API jars under the Geronimo project due to licensing restrictions of
the Oracle produced jars.  This is no longer needed as the new license, EPL
2.0 is an approved license.  However, some APIs are actually implementations,
such as javamail, so they may be continued for technical or industry health
reasons.  There is also discussion if there are still licensing advantages
that may justify the overhead of producing our own API jars across the board.

We have seens continued activity in the community, particularly in the area
of maintaining Docker images, and re-working the website.  Website activity
was very strong at the start of the quarter, but quieted down in the second
half about the same time COVID-19 began affecting everyone.  Hopefully we can
get that going again as significant amount of work was done.

The community has recently released TomEE 8.0.1 in January, along with
parallel releases of TomEE 7.1.2 and TomEE 7.0.7.

A vote for TomEE 8.0.2 was put up, however a potential security vulnerability
was noticed late last week which may cause the release to be aborted.  This
will be worked through the proper channels and no further details will be
given in this report or publicly till there is a fix.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Traffic Control Project  [David Neuman]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Traffic Control is the creation and maintenance of 
software related to building, monitoring, configuring, and provisioning a large 
scale content delivery network (CDN)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring the board's attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Traffic Control was founded 2018-05-15 (2 years ago)
There are currently 25 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Robert Butts was added to the PMC on 2020-03-12
- Matthew Jackson was added as committer on 2020-02-26

## Project Activity:
Apache Traffic Control 4.0 was released on 2020-03-26. This was a huge release
for Traffic Control containing over a year's worth of development. The
community is poised to release more often and as a result, a release for the
4.1 version of Traffic Control is already available for review. The community
is starting to plan the 5.0 release, targeting the end of Q2 for our first
release candidate.

## Community Health:
The community continues to be challenged in finding diversity, especially in
terms of contributors.  We continue to see new users joining the community and
we are retaining the users we have, but it seems as if the types of users that
are coming to the project are not the ones that contribute back.  We continue
to discuss ways that we can encourage more contribution for our user base.  We
still feel like we have a healthy community despite the continued lack of
diversity.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Whimsy is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information 
lookup activities

## Issues:
As I have now reported for a full year, I (Sam) remain concerned that there
are not enough developers on the board agenda tool.  There is an effort
underway to make this tool more approachable to developers, this effort
involves a rewrite to Node.js.  To date, this effort has yet to prove itself.

## Membership Data:
Apache Whimsy was founded 2015-05-19 (5 years ago)
There are currently 11 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Matt Sicker was added to the PMC on 2020-04-11
- Matt Sicker was added as committer on 2020-04-09

## Project Activity:
- One tool was found to have a security issue and was promptly retired
- It took a number of iterations to get the board agenda tool to deal with a
  GMT based calendar times.
- New support for emeritus filing in the secretary workbench
- Continuous stream of minor fixes, in particular in support for the members
  meeting and the download checker.

## Community Health:
More than enough oversight, increased interest in extending a number of tools.

One tool (as noted above) has a bus factor isssue.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
Apache Xalan exists to promote the use of XSLT. We view XSLT (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language Transformations) as a compelling paradigm that transforms 
XML documents, thereby facilitating the exchange, transformation, and 
presentation of knowledge. The ability to transform XML documents into usable 
information has great potential to improve the functionality and use of 
information systems. We intend to build freely available XSLT processing 
components in order to engender such improvements.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Xalan was founded 2004-09-30 (16 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 5 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-02-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-03-20.

## Project Activity:
The Apache Xalan project is seing some activity on the C side toward a
possible release. We have almost no activity on the Java side.

## Community Health:
The most activity I see on the mailing list is from my rejecting spam while
only maybe one or two 'real' message per month. As mentioned above, there is
some movement on the C side of the house so this will appear as a surge up
from previous reporting periods.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache XML Graphics Project  [Clay Leeds]

## Description:
Apache XML Graphics exists to promote the use of XML. We view XML as a 
compelling paradigm that structures data as information, thereby facilitating 
the exchange, transformation, and presentation of knowledge. The ability to 
transform raw data into usable information has great potential to improve the 
functionality and use of information systems. We intend to build freely 
available products for the conversion of XML to graphical output and closely 
related technologies in order to engender such improvements.

## Issues:
No Issues to report to the board

## Membership Data:
Apache XML Graphics was founded 2004-10-20 (16 years ago)
There are currently 21 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Simon Steiner on 2016-01-20.
- No new committers. Last addition was Matthias Reischenbacher on 2015-05-13.

## Project Activity:
Last FOP release v2.4 was on 5th November 2019. Batik v1.12 was 
released at the same time.
A new release has been prepared and is currently being voted on for all
3 sub projects, i.e. FOP, XML Graphics and Commons

## Community Health:
Users are continuing to ask questions and post bug reports. There 
were 39 e-mails to fop-user and 218 e-mails to fop-dev in the last quarter. 
The relatively small team of remaining committers continues to answer
questions and resolve some of the bugs. It would be good to find some
new committers but we find users tend to submit 1 or 2 patches and
then move on to other projects.
