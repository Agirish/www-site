 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       The Foundation continues to operate financially conservatively. A new
       budget proposal is being developed for the next fiscal year.

       We understand that Sam Ruby intends to step down as President, and is
       working with David Nalley on a transition plan.

       The coronavirus has significantly affected all Chinese people, and we
       hope that they can resolve the issue quickly and resume normal
       activity.

       We are working on developing a policy for Conflict of Interest. While
       we have no current issues, it is expected that foundations like the
       ASF will enforce a CoI policy.

    B. President [Sam]

       We continue to be on track to be on budget, modulo some timing issues
       of sponsor payments.  No officers in operations are reporting issues
       requiring board attention. I'm continuing to transition
       responsibilities to the EVP in preparation for my stepping down.

       I'm open to discussion as to when it would be best to step down -
       should it be the current board or the next board that names my
       replacement?  My recommendation for my replacement continues to be
       David Nalley.  Should the current board wish to defer this transition
       to the next board, my plans are to have David effectively acting as
       the President by the next board meeting, with me supporting him.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


       @David: determine top ten CI issues affecting projects

    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Operating Cash on January 31st, 2020 was $2,137.8K, which is down $1K
       from last month’s ending balance (Dec 19) of $1,738.8K.  Total Cash as
       of Jan 31st, 2020 is $3,531.7K (includes the Pineapple, Restricted
       Donation as well as the Tides Restricted Donations) as compared to
       $3,3,993.1K on January 31st, 2019, (a decrease of $461.4K year over
       year). The January 31st 2020 ending Operating cash balance of
       $2,137.8K represents an Operating cash reserve of 10.1 months based on
       the “Estimated” FY20 Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $249.9K/month.  The ASF actual Operating reserve of 10.1 months at the
       end of January 2020 is a bit ahead the budgeted 8.7 months of reserve
       for YTD through January 31st 2020.  The estimated YE Operating reserve
       of 10.6 months is ahead of the Budgeted YE reserve of 7.6 months.  The
       ASF Operating reserve is above the ASAE standard average of 6 months
       of reserve for Non Profits.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Revenue is behind budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $288.9K (this is partly due to timing of
       sponsor payments)  The open Accounts Receivable is very healthy at
       $593K, which as of the Jan 20 Fin Close is enough, if it comes in
       before 4.30.20, to achieve the FY20 Foundation Sponsorship Budget. As
       compared to FY19, FY20  YTD revenue is ahead by $133.6K primarily due
       to FY20 Events exceeding Revenue as compared to FY19, YTD.

       YTD expenses through January 31st, 2020 are under budget by $254.8K,
       spread across all depts except Conferences.  Which we expect to
       continue as the FY20 comes to an end.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$258.6K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$224.5K> NI or $34.1K behind the
       Budgeted NI for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  After being
       behind Budgeted NI by $117K, last month, with the timing of Sponsor
       payments, and expenses under budget,  we are getting closer to being
       back on track for FY20 as compared to budget.  The cash forecast has
       been updated, with the information we have at hand,  and at this point
       with about 3 months left in the Fiscal year, we are still on pace to, 
       if everything goes according to the Forecast,  possibly exceed our
       FY20 budgeted NI.  We have one slight change to the Monthly Financial
       Pkg.  We have added a tab for each department, that has their Cash 
       basis GL activity for the month, compared to the combined Cash Basis 
       GL detail that had previously been included.  We hope that this 
       provides a more efficient view for department budget holders to 
       review the details of their monthly spending.  That said,  as I have 
       done in previous months, I urge all dept heads to review their depts 
       in the Cash forecast, for the last 3 months of the Fiscal year,  and 
       let us know if there is anything that they are aware of that could 
       change the estimates for the remaining 3 months of FY20.  This effort 
       will make the Cashforecast a much more accurate management tool for 
       the Foundation.  With regard to FY19, we are ahead in revenue, by 
       $133.6K as noted above, but we are also ahead on expenses by $901.1K 
       (due to ACNA19, ACEU19, the Lease web payment which should have taken 
       place in FY19, but did not etc); thus, year over year NI FY20 is 
       behind FY19 by $767.5K.  It is estimated that this will even out, to 
       a degree,  as the FY20 progresses.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In January, the secretary received 67 ICLAs, 3 CCLAs, and 4 software
       grants.

    E. Executive Vice President [David]

       Things are largely working as intended. One new thing to the lineup
       this past month is that we held an operations call. The call went
       well.

       Budget
       ======

       Budget process is underway with most operational functions having
       submitted a proposed budget. In the process,​ we've identified some
       problems and misallocation of some expenses that may change things.
       We've additionally begun discussions around treating Conferences and
       Fundraising as their own distinct lines of business from an accounting
       perspective so that we have a more clear picture of the efficacy of
       money spent in those areas.

       Conferences
       ===========

       Conferences currently has 5 events in process and things appear to be
       well managed.

       Most exciting though is the Event Playbook - which should help
       mitigate Single Points of Failure as well as making it easier for
       folks to participate and help.

       Travel Assistance
       =================

       TAC successfully concluded a small committer-focused travel
       sponsorship at FOSDEM. Additionally, they are working on a calendar
       for future event support as part of the FY21 budget planning process.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Infrastructure suffered an outage to a critical service (LDAP) but
       quickly resolved it.

       Data Privacy
       ============

       Privacy seems to have reached critical mass to make progress. There
       are several requests pending that are being worked.

       Diversity
       =========

       Diversity has made good progress on a number of fronts. The most
       interesting bit is that our first Outreachy participant has been
       adding info into the friction log. I hope that in the coming months
       this is something that we can take time to review and learn from.
       Survey is in analysis mode and is on track for publication in coming
       months.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       Assisted Chairman with preparing records and emails relating to our
       upcoming Annual Member's meeting, where the Membership will elect a
       new board and potentially new individual Members.  Created an
       automated overview page and other tooling to simplify the meeting
       process.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Adopting a well-known COI policy

       As the ASF grows in number of paid positions and is working to secure
       more sponsors, we should adopt a well-known financial conflict of
       interest policy.  This is important to ensure that we have clear and
       consistent disclosures internally of financial interests in
       officer/director roles, as well as to show potential donors that we're
       following best practices for fiscal responsibility.

       I suggest the IRS example policy, which many non-profits use:
       https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1023#en_US_2018_publink100061018
       https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-1023-purpose-of-conflict-of-interest-policy

       This also includes an annual review statement, which should be simple
       to automate and is also reported in filing our 990s.

       By general consent, this discussion will continue on the lists.

    B. Long Running Topics of Board Interest

       I'd like to briefly touch on the subject of long running topics that are of
       interest to the board. Could we consider using "unfinished business" to track
       on-going items such as "distribution of binaries", "CI", and "CoI Policy" and
       assign a board shepherd and reporting date? I am concerned that the current
       set-up is optimised to deal with committee reports and time-boxed actions and
       doesn't really  incorporate the board keeping an eye on slow burning topics.

       @Craig: fill in unfinished business section for next board meeting

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

We continue operating nominally with regular renewals. Of note is that one
Gold and one Silver sponsor have been acquired and are sorting out their
future strategy. We have been seeking a new point-of-contact for one of our
Bronze sponsors. We have three sponsors that are in arrears. We welcomed one
new Bronze Sponsor, Xplenty, this month.

Our outreach to our Targeted Sponsors to confirm their commitment for the 2020
year continues. The majority of existing Targeted Sponsors have confirmed to
renew donated products and services.

We have also reached out to all Sponsors regarding their renewals, per their
usual sponsorship cycle. We have also pre-pitched sponsorship opportunities
for ASF Conferences in 2020.

We're continuing to engage with ASF Conferences team to provide support and
process documentation. With 3 Roadshows in North America and 1 in Europe, as
well as ApacheCon North America, we want to be sure the procedures we work up
are commonly understood and useful for all teams involved. Of note, we've
finalized our process for sponsorship sales and documented the procedure for
future events.

Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $1,950 over the past
month. Some sponsors are also using the donation interface to pay for their
sponsorship renewals using a credit card; we received a Silver Sponsorship
renewal payment this month. We experienced a high volume of repeat fraudulent
donation attempts, and are working with Hopsie  and ASF Infrastructure to
resolve the issue.

We are also working to socialize and improve understanding of the link policy
modification communicated in November. The sponsorship page has been updated
to indicate that all links are rel="sponsored" and we're planning an email
communication for all existing sponsors to let them know about the upcoming
change upon their renewal.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — February 2020

I. Budget: we remain on budget as planned. A few additional vendor invoices
have been forwarded for payment processing; we are also examining our spend on
the "Trillions" documentary: a portion of this budget may need to be carried
into the FY2021 budget as the work continues.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi supports ASF Fundraising by
securing ASF Sponsor renewals, pursuing outstanding sponsor payments, and
confirming commitments from ASF Targeted Sponsors. We have pre-pitched ASF
2020 Conferences to our Sponsors, and will liaise with the sales support team
as our work continues. We are promoting the CFPs for Apache Roadshow/DC and
ApacheCon, and have been assisting the Apache Roadshow/Seattle with any
questions. We supported ASF Diversity & Inclusion by inviting Apache PMCs to
submit proposals for internships through Outreachy.  We published "Apache in
2019 - By The Digits" https://s.apache.org/Apache2019Digits , the "Apache
Software Foundation Security Report: 2019" https://s.apache.org/tbyxg ; and
the latest “Success at Apache” post, "Literally", https://s.apache.org/xjcrj .
The ASF documentary, "Trillions and Trillions Served", is in post-production
and on schedule, and released its first teaser
https://s.apache.org/ASF-Trillions

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the newswire
service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during this timeframe.

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 6 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog.
5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 292 weekly summaries
published to date. We tweeted 27 items to 56K followers on Twitter, and posted
23 items on LinkedIn that garnered more than 78.8K organic impressions. We
have also begun to tweet again for the Apache Incubator after a 2-year hiatus.

V. Future Announcements: 3 announcements are in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?"
highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to two media queries. The ASF received 1,213
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,150. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 1,180 press hits vs. last month's 1,550. ApacheCon received 1
press hit.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received no briefing requests for at this time.
Apache was mentioned in 1 report by Gartner; 6 reports by Forrester; 4 reports
by 451 Research; and 5 reports by IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team has finalized tweaks to the
ApacheCon site https://www.apachecon.com/ . They have also relaunched the ASF
Fundraising landing page http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html , and
are continuing work on refining the Apache PLC4X theme, as well as updating
the Apache project logo page. Our work on a new home page for Central Services
that will enable both Creative and Editorial teams to standardize the process
to request assistance and track progress. We are rolling out new editorial
projects, but have scheduling gaps to accommodate volunteers' limited
availability.

IX. Events liaison: we continue to support ComDev-coordinated events, such as
FOSDEM and DevNexus, as well as ASF Conferences, including Apache Roadshows
and ApacheCon.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: all accounts are auto-renewing through
2020 to ensure we have constant access without interruption.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- Added Jekyll as a standard website builder. This is the default
  for GitHub Pages, so many people are familiar with it, and have
  been asking for it. This is provided via our ".asf.yaml" system.
- The certificate on our LDAP servers expired, causing havoc. We
  quickly generated a new cert and propagated that to the servers
  and clients needing it (including our vendor who operates the
  lists.a.o archive).
- Chris Thistlethwaite wrote a blog post for the "Success at
  Apache" series being produced by Marketing & Public Relations.
  https://s.apache.org/xjcrj

Finances
========
- The FY21 Infra budget has been developed and submitted to
  operations@ for inclusion into the overall budget.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Expand our agenda, for the team meetup.
- Get downloads.a.o running (see below)

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Turn off hermes, and get our mail infrastructure on modern systems.
- Rackspace may be ending their Open Source support program, likely
  at the end of 2021. We have no critical services operating there.

General Activity
================
- JMX monitoring has been added for deeper insights into our
  Java-heavy services (Jira and Confluence).
- Decided on time/location for Infra F2F: March 29 to April 3rd,
  in Nashville, TN, USA.
- Infra documentionat improvements are in-progress for three
  primary areas: www.a.o/dev, infra.a.o, and the INFRA cwiki.
- Project-specific Jenkins Masters are getting set up and tested,
  using CloudBees Operation Center for managing them.
- Several Infra people attended FOSDEM, and had good chats with
  community members and a couple of our vendors.
- The Apache Roller instance for blogs.a.o has been updated.
- Looking at "rundeck" to improve our tooling.
- The TLP servers have been failing. We are going to move the
  downloads off of www.a.o/dist/ to a new downloads.a.o server,
  as a way to stabilize the *.a.o websites.
- Two projects were identified as improperly using our primary
  servers to download distribution artifacts, contrary to our
  published policy (ie. use the mirror system). Given the problems
  that we've been seeing on the TLP servers (above), we notified
  the projects to fix their distribution points.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Conferences

We currently have 6 events “in flight”, with two of them happening in the next
3 months.

Apache Roadshow, Washington DC. March 25-26
http://apachecon.com/usroadshowdc20

Apache Roadshow Chicago. May 18-20
https://www.apachecon.com/chiroadshow20/

The ARS Chicago launched CFP, targeted to close 3/20. At the moment is
finalizing booking venues (will probably be done by board meeting), generating
prospectus, and devising /executing on Meetup/University/tech incubator out
reach strategy.

There is no link on the top page of apachecon.com to the roadshow at this
time, by design. We want to finish site build, which is waiting on
registration plumbing, finalizing venue bookings, etc.

Though we haven't finished prospectus yet, there has been some interest
expressed in sponsorship.

Budget has been approved.

Apache Roadshow Seattle. June 23-26
https://www.apachecon.com/searoadshow20/

Seattle Roadshow is in sponsorship and agenda mode, and we will be inviting
speakers starting this month. We have venue and amenities secured, and are
planning a BarCamp in the spring to promote the main event.

ApacheCon North America 2020, New Orleans, September 28 - October 3
http://apachecon.com/acna2020

The Call for Presentations is now open and we have received 35 submissions so
far. Registration is open (as of meeting time).

Apache Roadshow Europe is in planning. No details are available yet, although
a June timeframe has been suggested.

We are working on detailed Event Playbook documentation, at
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CONFERENCES/Event+Playbook , with
the hopes that our 2021 events schedule will be 1) planned further in advance,
2) have more consistency between events, and 3) be easier for our event leads,
who will not feel that they are making everything up from scratch every time.

Apache Roadshow China, October 24-26 Potentially in Beijing.
No details are
yet available.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Current Events
==============

Fosdem completed at the start of the month, and three TAC attendees had a busy
and good 2 days. Going around talking to other attendees - about what they are
doing in their Apache projects, how they got in via the Incubator etc. And
also what other attendees were involved in. They also spent some time on the
ASF Booth, talking with attendees there and handing out swag etc - this
allowed for the main person(s) on the booth to present and to attend talks.
Our TAC folks also got to attend many talks that they were interested in.

Informal conversations after the event showed that all our TAC folks had a
great time and learned much from the weekend. Also enjoying talking with long
time ASF people, current and ex board members, infra staff etc. More formal
feedback in the form of a survey will be sent out soon.

Future Events
=============

TAC has an events Calendar that it shares with other Committees for the
purposes of cross-committee planning and collaboration. Currently filled our
up until October we are looking at possibly supporting :-

Chicago Roadshow, Berlin Buzzwords, Seattle Roadshow, ApacheCon New Orleans.

Any ASF Project putting on a Hackathon and/or Meetup should also talk to TAC
about supporting them getting folks there (Committers and Non Committers)

Mailing List Activity
=====================

No list activity since the previous report.

Membership
==========

No changes to the TAC membership since the last report.

  their communities.

## Issues:

None
## Activity:

*** Project:  Survey revamp***

The survey application was wrapped up with 622 completed responses and we are
moving into survey analysis. We are focusing on moving the next sections of
the project along, these are: contributor experience interviews and community
metrics analysis.


*** Project: User Experience Research on new contributors ***

No status change here, so same information as previous report applies:

We have reviewed preliminary answers from the survey to draft interview
questions. The main focus for now is to write follow up questions to validate
early hypothesis, main topics gravitate around type of contributions,
demographic background specially spoken language, and challenges experienced
by newer members. We need to find at least 20 people we can interview with the
questions from this User Experience research. See the operations section below
to see how we're planning to do this.


*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***

First-round Outreachy program dec-march: Mentors and Outreachy intern are
getting assignments. The feedback provided is positive. The next steps for the
training toolkit are open to discussion in the mailing list dev@. See page [1]
We change the date of our weekly meeting to Mondays at 20h (UTC). [2] Second
round Outreachy program: Apache has been successfully accepted to participate
in the next round of the Outreachy program May-August 2020. [3] Sponsors: we
got fundings for 8 interns approximately. We started "calling for mentors"
with the help of PR, Sally. We also set up a reminder for this message. We
discussed alternative channels to promote the program and attract
mentors/interns such as meetups and talks in local universities. We made the
first contact. [4] We updated the blog. One page for the message "calling for
mentors" and a second page to update the instructions to become a mentor and
submit a project. [5] We are monitoring PMC mailing lists to see if projects
are getting developed. There are some potential mentors showing their interest
and asking for guidance. We are contacting mentors to see if they would like
to continue in the second round.
*** Operations ***

2021 Budget request was originally going to be $0, now we are considering
request a small amount around ~$15k for survey and community data analysis
next year to compare improvements.


## Health report:

The dev@ and diversity@ mailing lists continue to be slow, not too much
activity outside the work done for each ongoing project. The discussions have
been focused on topics that pertain to the projects we are running.


## Committee members changes:

None.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

My personal take is that there are now enough people on the list (-and- the 12
`sample' cases discussed sofar seem to all have headed for sufficient
consensus) that it is fair to now draft what should be our GDPR stance from
which we can derive a guideline and policy. And with that concept not coming
as a surprise.

We have about 6 more legal/complex points for expects sofar (such as to what
extent can you push things back for `self service' to the complainant). These
may require legal attention at some point.

Actual GDPR and similar requests: two in flight; neither contentious. Tracked
in JIRA.

Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Andy Seaborne (andy@) and Steve Blackmon (sblackmon@) have joined the W3C
Bridging GraphQL and RDF Community Group.

ASF has signed the W3C Community Contributor License Agreement for this
Community Group.

Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're up 1 (to 22), unresolved
issues this month.

John D. Ament has indicated that he may want to step in to replace Mark
Struberg as VP Jakarta EE Relations. With renewed involvement, hopefully we
can finalize discussions with the Eclipse Foundation

We were contacted by Technology Enforcement Division (Bureau of Competition)
from the Federal Trade Commission of the United States Government and offered
to participate in a study of "market participants" in the cloud services
industry. We had to decline on account that we are not, in fact, a market
participant.

I started collecting background information on various binary distribution
channels that ASF controls in preparation for a more comprehensive discussion
on the subject.

Attachment 12: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

This month we published a look at Security for 2019

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Ambari Project  [Jayush Luniya]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Materne]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Ant is the creation and maintenance of the Ant build 
system and related software components. 
It consists of 3 main projects:
 - Ant - core and libraries (AntLibs)
 - Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
 - IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
Additionally Ant provides several extensions to Ant (antlibs).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Ant was founded 2002-11-18 (17 years ago)
There are currently 29 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Magesh Umasankar on 2018-07-06.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jaikiran Pai on 2017-06-14.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:

    Ivy 2.5.0 was released on 2019-10-24. Ant 1.10.7 was released on
    2019-09-05. Ant 1.10.6 was released on 2019-05-08.



## Community Health:
For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done. But
basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development.

For IvyDE we lack the knowledge of building Eclipse plugins on actual Eclipse
versions. We hope to get the build running again so we could update that.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:
The mission of BookKeeper is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to Replicated log service which can be used to build replicated state machines

## Community Health:

### Community

We are leveraging Pulsar for growing BookKeeper community.
Pulsar Summit has a dedicated `bookkeeper` track for the
community to present bookkeeper related talks. This will
drive more participation from both communities.

### Committers

We did not add any new committer within last year.
We have a good amount of small contributions but no one is yet ready
to be invited as committer.
We are trying to engage more with current contributors.
Most of current contributions come from other downstream Open Source
projects that are using BookKeeper as building block.
We got recent feedback of usage of BookKeeper and DistributeLog by new
non open source projects.

### Activities

dev@bookkeeper.apache.org had a 80% increase in traffic in the past
quarter (123 emails compared to 68)
user@bookkeeper.apache.org had a 271% increase in traffic in the past
quarter (52 emails compared to 14)

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
- We have released 1.5.8 in July. We haven't had any activity since.
   
## Health report: 
 - We still have a small PMC presence of 3 active members still able
to vote releases.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Peter Donald on Tue Oct 15 2013

## Releases:    
 - Last release was 1.5.8 on July 14th 2019


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues to report at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Cassandra was founded 2010-02-17 (10 years ago)
There are currently 54 committers and 33 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Chris Lohfink on 2019-10-01.
- No new committers. Last addition was Dinesh Joshi on 2019-03-05.

## Project Activity:
We released 4.0-alpha3 on 2020-02-06 to gather community feedback and get more
folks actively involved in testing. We have started a detailed tracking board
on JIRA and have been sending out regular updates on status. An example email
can be found here: https://s.apache.org/r56u3

Other releases:
- 2.2.15 was released on 2019-10-29.
- 3.0.19 was released on 2019-10-29. 

Note: new releases of each 3.11, 3.0, and 2.2 branches are currently under vote.

## Community Health:
We've had a substantial uptick in traffic over the past quarter as a result of
folks getting back involved in the release of 4.0 after the holidays. The
following stats are pertinent:
- 79 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (21% increase)
- 115 commits in the past quarter (57% increase)
- 35 code contributors in the past quarter (40% increase)
- 63 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (36% increase)

We continue to see an increase in user participation in both #cassandra and
#cassandra-dev Slack channels. This is now our most popular avenue for helping
new users.

We are looking forward to our Apache Cassandra track at this years ApacheConNA
and have again requested three days. CFP announcements for such have been sent
to the dev and users mail lists.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

## Description:
The mission of Community Development is the creation and maintenance of
software related to Resources to help people become involved with Apache
projects

## Issues:
There are no issues needing Board feedback at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Community Development was founded 2009-11-01 (10 years ago) There are
currently 34 committers and 32 PMC members in this project. The
Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:8.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Swapnil Mane was added to the PMC on 2020-01-02
- Swapnil Mane was added as committer on 2020-01-02

## Project Activity:
We have had a very active quarter with discussions on a wide range of topics.

Apache Local Community (ALC) 
ComDev has been actively worked on Apache Local
Community (ALC) initiative. Swapnil Mane has been a key co-ordinator
responding to all community feedback. The ALC comprises local groups of Apache
(Open Source) enthusiasts, called an 'ALC Chapter'.[1]

Following various discussions we have agreed the following steps to help
ComDev establish solid oversight of the ALC initiative

-- Process to establish ALC Chapter and requirement for it (like it is
   mandatory to have at least 1 ASF member plus 2 PMC members in the ALC
   Chapter team)[2]
-- ALC Roles and Responsibilities
-- Code of conduct, rules, and regulations for ALC Chapter [3]
-- Process to dissolve the ALC Chapter [4]
-- Guidelines to organize ALC Event[5]
-- How we make sure that we are not having people use the Apache name to
   promote messages that are not *our* message. The guidelines to organize an
   event, qualifications to establish ALC and code of conduct will help us in
   spreading the right messaging.[6][7][8]

We have received the requests from the following places to establish the ALC
Chapters. ComDev PMC is analyzing these requests.
-- Beijing, China
-- Warsaw, Poland
-- Budapest, Hungary It is likely that our second ALC to be approved and
   formed, will be ALC Beijing.

The ALC Indore Chapter executed the following event in this quarter:
- Session on 'Open Source and ASF Awareness' for school students And their
  reports can be found at http://s.apache.org/alc-indore-reports

FOSDEM
Once again we had an ASF booth at FOSDEM. Volunteers from several
projects were present or spent time on the booth talking to attendees about
their projects or the ASF in general. We gave away stickers, ballons, hats,
pens and coffee cups and encouraged people to buy the ASF a coffee by donating
the cost of a cup of coffee to the ASF. We received invitations to participate
at other open source events so will be promoting this on the mailing lists.

GSOC
We have applied on behalf of the ASF to be a GSoC mentoring organisation
for 2020. Maxim Solodovnik from the ComDev PMC will be s the main
administrator with Kevin McGrail helping co-admOuin. A wiki page has been
created to collect GSoC ideas.[9]

Attachment J: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
Apache CouchDB software is a document-oriented database that can be queried and 
indexed in a MapReduce fashion using JavaScript. CouchDB also offers 
incremental replication with bi-directional conflict detection and resolution.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache CouchDB was founded 2008-11-19 (11 years ago)
There are currently 65 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Jonathan Hall was added to the PMC on 2020-02-12
- Juanjo Rodriguez was added as committer on 2020-02-07


## Project Activity:

- The release process for CouchDB 3.0.0 has started. We expect a release 
shortly. See board reports from last year about the exact nature of this
release, including a discussion on features and backwards compatibility.
- a blog post campaign to accompany the campaign is in the works as well.
- a rogue source that provided binary builds off of CouchDB master has
been shut down. Unbeknownst to the project, a good number of critical fixes
for the 3.0.0 release were found by users of this unauthorized binary provider.
We are happy to continue to make sure the project complies with ASF policy, but
we also want to highlight that we benefited from something that was 
technically forbidden, so maybe it is worth reconsidering some of this.
Due to the release process, we are currently not in the position to bring
this up in the form of a regular policy change request, we just wanted to 
flag this, in case someone wants to take up this cause.
- a large corporate contributor to CouchDB has an infrastructure policy of
only allowing outbound HTML emails, while the ASF mail servers allow
absolutely no HTML. This has lead to friction in getting individuals from that
corporation to participate in the official channels of the project. We’ve made 
due for the moment, but this is hurting our official activity as people will
go the route of least friction and start discussions outside of official
channels. While those discussions are not of a nature that make decisions for
the project, we are careful about keeping those on dev@, it leads to folks
missing out on discussions, if they don’t happen to be part of a discussion 
channel that’s more accessible than the plaintext mailing list. Again,
we are not in a position to pick up the mantle for this surely larger
discussion, we just bring up another data point on the issue.


## Community Health:
Community activity is in line with our expectations. We are seeing an uptick
of new contributions around in the lead up of 3.0.0, which people are genuinely
excited about.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Philipp Ottlinger]

## Description:
The mission of Creadur is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Comprehension and auditing of software distributions

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Creadur was founded 2012-04-18 (8 years ago)
There are currently 11 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Karl Heinz Marbaise on 2016-08-30.
- No new committers. Last addition was Karl Heinz Marbaise on 2016-08-30.

## Project Activity:
Minor bugs have been fixed in the current 0.14-SNAPSHOT. The RAT part of
Creadur is used most often. After ApacheCon2019 in Berlin some discussions and
feature requests were reported. Apache Rat 0.13 was released on 2018-10-13.

## Community Health:
The project benefits from the Github integration as it seems easier to
integrate/file issues/start discussions. Apart from that we successfully
changed the chair of the project.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache DeltaSpike is  a suite of portable CDI (Contexts & Dependency
 Injection) extensions intended to make application development easier when
 working with CDI and Java EE.  Some of its key features include:

 - A core runtime that supports component configuration, type safe messaging
   and internationalization, and exception handling.
 - A suite of utilities to make programmatic bean lookup easier.
 - A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans
   outside of a container.
 - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
 - JPA integration and transaction support.
 - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.

 Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
 your CDI enabled projects.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 We fixed some security related issues in our JSF module.
 Apart from that we've seen punctual fixes with no new features this time
 around.
 But this is fine for such a mature project.
 DS still has a really good reputation in the industry. We've been serving
 as a blueprint and idea supply for other projects like Microprofile.
 And many of our features even made it back to the CDI specification itself.

## Health report:
 We recently added a new committer. And we are always obsesrving the community
 for more active people. I think community is fine for a project of our age.

## Releases: 
 - 1.9.3 was released on 2020-02-05.
 - 1.9.2 was released on 2019-12-16.
 - 1.9.1 was released on 2019-08-19.

## Project Composition:
 - There are currently 35 committers and 19 PMC members in this project.
 - The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:5.

## Community changes, past quarter:
 - No new PMC members. Last addition was Harald Wellmann on 2016-05-19.
 - No new committers. Last addition was Christian Beikov on 2019-10-21.

The Drill Community had a Hangout meeting and will be working towards a number
of strategic goals:
1. Increase the size of community
2. Reduce obstacles to use, such as improving documentation and website.
3. Work on publicity

We have averaged about two releases per year.  Going forward, we will try for
smaller releases more frequently.  Our next release is targeted for early Q2.

Interesting work underway:
- Storage plugins for Apache Druid, Apache Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and
  general HTTP/REST.
- Significant code improvements to facilitate storage and format plugin
  development.
- Integrations with Docker and K8s. 
- Documentation improvements to include website re-work.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Druid Project  [Gian Merlino]

 ## Description

Apache Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database. It is
designed for workflows where low-latency query and ingest are the main
requirements. It implements ingestion, storage, and querying subsystems.
Users interface with Druid through built-in SQL and JSON APIs, as well
as third-party applications.

Druid has an extensive web of connections with other Apache projects:
Calcite for SQL planning, Curator and ZooKeeper for coordination, Kafka
and Hadoop as data sources, Avro, ORC, or Parquet as supported data input
formats, and DataSketches for scalable approximate algorithms. Druid
can also be used as a data source by Superset.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

We have done our first post-graduation release, Druid 0.17.0, containing
over 250 new features, performance enhancements, bug fixes, and major
documentation improvements from 52 contributors. Major improvements
include improved native batch indexing, performance improvements, LDAP
support, improved compliance with SQL standards, and much more. Work
on the upcoming 0.18.0 release is underway and on track for a likely
end of March release date.

Community activity continues to be strong, with a healthy rate of commits,
issues filed on GitHub, user mailing list posts, and ever increasing
activity in our ASF Slack channel #druid, which now has over 600 members.

Keeping boots on the ground to improve adoption, over the last month we
have had Druid meetups in New Delhi, London, Athens, and Tel Aviv, with
an additional meetup in Sydney scheduled in March. Planning for the
Druid Summit event is progressing with over 80 proposed talks currently
being evaluated, and half of the 40 scheduled speaking slots filled with
a diverse set of both PMC members and passionate users. The event will
take place April 13 - 15 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Rainer Döbele]

## Description:
Empire-db aims to provide a sophisticated approach to access SQL based
relational database systems and to make the full power of the RDBMS available
in applications. In contrast to object-relational-mapping it provides a easy,
intuitive and string-free way to create SQL-statements of any complexity in
order to query or manipulate data.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Empire-db was founded 2012-01-24 (8 years ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:10.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jan Glaubitz on 2016-07-10.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jan Glaubitz on 2015-10-05.

## Project Activity:
We have now just completed the work on our upcoming release and started a vote
to begin with the build and publication process. If no objections arise, we
will proceed and publish the release in the coming weeks.

## Community Health:
Our existing community is still alive and active, although as we have
mentioned before, for a small but mature project which is not about a hot new
topic, it is not easy to attract new committers.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache FreeMarker Project  [Dániel Dékány]

## Description:

Apache FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text
output based on templates. Apache FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class
library for programmers.

FreeMarker 2 (the current stable line) produces releases since 2002. The
FreeMarker project has joined the ASF in 2015, and graduated from the
Incubator in early 2018.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We have released a new version mid August, with some major features. We are
very close releasing 2.3.30, addressing feature requests from the users.

freemarker-generator sub-product has received significant amount of code, and
hopefully will yield releases in the foreseeable future.

## Health report:

Activity is low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User questions
(mostly on StackOverflow) and new Jira issues are being answered promptly. The
short term goal is to develop the next micro version (2.3.30). The long term
goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0 branch, so that the
project can innovate and the code base can become much cleaner and more
attractive for new committers.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
The mission of HTTP Server is the creation and maintenance of software related
to Apache Web Server (httpd). The project is celebrating its 25th anniversary
this month.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at present.

## Membership Data:
Apache HTTP Server was founded 1995-02-27 (25 years ago) There are currently
124 committers and 53 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio
is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Stefan Sperling on 2019-01-24.
- Dennis Clarke was welcomed as a new committer on 2020-02-07.
- Giovanni Bechis was welcomed as a new committer on 2020-02-16.

## Project Activity:
- There were no new releases this quarter, which isn't surprising. We are on
  version 41 of the 2.4.x release branch, and with our habit of burning
  version numbers for botched release processes, we have had around 27 actual
  releases over the past 8 years, or roughly one every 4 months. The last
  release was 2.4.41 in August 2019, and we are slowly looking at whether a
  new release makes sense[1]. As with many projects, we are not dictated by a
  release schedule, but rather work with the mantra "does rolling a new
  release at present add more value than it costs releasing?".

- We are having better luck with our CI testing this quarter, though there are
  still some issues with the more esoteric platforms that we need to iron
  out[2]. It is our hope that the new CI efforts can not only help us find
  bugs in patches quicker, but also have us work towards more reliable testing
  of specifications by utilizing a standardized framework of systems.

- Work is ongoing for better support for systemd on the various Linux variants
  that make use of this, with a mod_systemd making it to the 2.4.x branch of
  our software, and future features like systemd socket activation and
  journald support sitting in the pipeline.

- Our documentation build tool-chain may need an upgrade or automation, to
  remove issues when building with different java versions (as I understand
  it, we have - among other issues - problems with line endings and Unicode).
  Perhaps we can utilize the new ASF BuildBot 2.x service for this in the near
  future.

## Community Health:
The project experienced a very standard Christmas season, with commits and
email traffic being down for the usual three weeks around Christmas, leading
to an overall slower quarter (roughly 40% less activity as opposed to the
previous busier quarter). Activity on our GitHub mirror picked up a bit, which
may again nudge the question of moving to git.

A simple tally of the PMC activity this past quarter shows excellent oversight
in the project, and we have no concerns about community health. Likewise, the
number of active contributors to our code-base has remained steady at 16
people this quarter (same as last quarter).

Furthermore, we welcomed two new committers this quarter, and I would like to
heartily welcome them to the httpd family.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for February 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here: 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/February2020
There are presently 46 podlings incubating. In January, podlings executed
11 distinct releases. We added three new IPMC members and sixteen IPMC
members retired. There was two requested IP clearance, one had an issue
and the problem with last months IP clearance has been resolved.
We have one new podling this month YuniKorn; another is under discussion 
AgensGraph. No projects graduated last month. Myriad has retired, and 
both Tamaya and Taverna are considering leaving the Incubator. At least
one podling is heading towards graduation in the next few months.

Two podlings did not report and will be asked to report again next month;
they include PageSpeed and Taverna. This is the second time Taverna has
failed to report and looking on their list they are discussing retiring
from the Incubator. PageSpeed reached out to say they will report next
month.

It was noticed that a dozen of so podlings were missing multiple PPMC 
members signed up to their private mailing lists. Each podling was 
contacted, and just about all of them have corrected this. Three podlings 
MXNet, SDAP and Spot are still working on it.

Several IPMC members are not signed up to the IPMC private list and may not 
be providing the oversight needed by their role. A board proposal has been 
put forward to remove them from the IPMC.

These IPMC members have been emailed twice in the last month asking them to 
sign up. About 30% of the people identified have responded, and have signed 
up or asked to no longer be IPMC members. Most of them are ASF members, so 
even if they were removed, they could ask to join again.

A dozen inactive mentors were contacted offlist and asked if they want to 
continue in the role, several have responded they wish to step down, and a 
couple have done so. 

The IPMC roster was also cleaned up with the removal of several people who 
had previously stood down or passed away.

TubeMQ is no longer having issues bootstrapping, but needed guidance with
their report.

We were contacted by a researcher from the University of California to sign 
a letter of support for a project to study incubating projects. While the 
Incubator is supportive of research like this, some concerns were raised 
about the scope of the letter, and it was not signed.

## Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and
humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Grow contributions outside the PPMC.
  2. Establish release cadence.
  3. Improve documentation, and in particular articulate a roadmap.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  The podling missed reporting in January due to holiday disruptions and has 
  been
  slow to make its first ASF release. The release machinery is all in place 
  as of
  this month, and voting for the first release candidate should begin within 
  the week.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  The PPMC has been more actively communicating and plans to open up a weekly 
  call to more directly engage early users.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The release machinery is in place, with Apache Rat being used to verify that
  licenses are in order. The PPMC is resolved to release the current state of 
  the project and generate momentum from there.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

### Date of last release:

  Should begin voting within the week.

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

  No new committers nor PPMC members have been added since the last report.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  Mentors have been very helpful so far. They will be engaged around the 
  initial release, to help ensure that everything is in order.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

  All the proper incubation disclaimers should be in the repository and on the
  website. The project is aware of no incidents of misuse of brand or 
  trademark.

  Dave Fisher - It looks like the report will be done a day late. Mentors did 
  push for them and the project is active.

--------------------
## DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences.
Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream
and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to
computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than
traditional, exact methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Be more communicative and document our code changes more clearly.
  2. We need to have more substantive discussions on dev@ especially about 
     our growing 
     TODO list and how we plan to address them -- create a roadmap as a 
     guide for others to contribute.
  3. Find / Attract new code committers outside Yahoo!

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  No

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  We are presenting at more conferences which has attracted some interest.
  We are definitely getting more traffic on our forum, GitHub issues
  and email lists.  We recently added two channels on the-asf@slack: 
  #datasketches and #datasketches-dev. The traffic has been fairly low on
  Slack as well as the forum. We could do more to publicize the slack
  channels.  I could be optimistic and believe the low traffic is due to
  the holidays -- or that the code just works :)  
  
  Nonetheless, the download traffic measured by repository.a.o 
  has grown exponentially since our first Apache release on Sep 23. We are 
  over 1000 
  unique IPs/ month and had a recent high of 22K downloads/ month.  Bear in 
  mind
  that this is all traffic that has migrated from the older, pre-Apache 
  artifacts 
  at com.yahoo.datasketches and is already higher than our peak downloads 
  prior to 
  Apache. These numbers also do not reflect any downloads of our Zip 
  artifacts 
  from a.o./dist (which includes our C++ artifacts) or other external 
  download 
  repositories (for example, specific to PostgreSQL).

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  Our releases are becoming easier, more polished and routine.
  Nonetheless, our website needs a lot of work (as mentioned above) and 
  this will become our focus for the next month or so. 

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

## Doris

Doris is a MPP-based interactive SQL data warehousing for reporting and
analysis.

Doris has been incubating since 2018-07-18.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Continue to build our community. It is glad to see that more 
  developers joined us and became contributors. But we still need more 
  leading developers to join the community who can participate in the 
  discussion of Doris' road map, not just start-up members.
  2. Improve the documents and website as well. Currently, most of 
  documents are in Chinese and most of English docs are translated by 
  machine. We are working on it.
  3. The discussion on dev mail list is still very few. Most of discussion 
  and decisions are still make in private or in GitHub issues. We should 
  improve the utilization of mailing lists and discuss more public.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, we have added 21 contributors and 1 committer. 
There 
  are currently 79 contributors and 15 committers.

  More and more companies are considering choosing Doris as their solution, 
  and more people are contributing to Doris. In the past three months, the 
  number of contributors has increased from 58 to the current 79.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The community is working hard to improve the usability and functionality 
  of the product so that more people can use Doris more easily to solve their 
  problems. During this time, a total of 336 commits were merged and 333 
  issues were created.

  Our new storage engine refactoring is almost coming to an end. After this 
  work, some exciting features can be added, such as secondary index, etc.

## ECharts

ECharts is a charting and data visualization library written in JavaScript.

ECharts has been incubating since 2018-01-18.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Status page ( https://incubator.apache.org/projects/echarts.html ) has 
  not been updated and we are going to do this within a month.
  2. Official Website: We have redirected echarts.baidu.com to 
  echartsjs.com and put a banner in echartsjs.com stating that the official 
  Website is echarts.apache.org but we still need to come to a conclusion 
  about whether CDN still has a problem with the access in China. If so, we 
  should probably make echartsjs.com as a mirror site with a clear 
  specification about the main site. If not, we should redirect 
  echartsjs.com to echarts.apache.org.
  3. Currently the collaborator of [echarts npm 
  package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/echarts) is ecomfe and we should 
  move it to echarts.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  No.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  More people from the community become contributors, either in the form of 
  answering questions in the issues, fixing the document or making pull 
  requests with the code. We did more public introduction about the 
  community and welcome others to contribute and it did show some positive
  effects recently.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  The monthly release became quite on time recently and in each release, we 
  have several pull requests from the community.

  In the last month, our focus was on setting up some structures that help 
  growing the community:

  * Further people appeared on the mailing list expressing their interest 
  to develop StreamPipes components
  * We added issues in Jira that are targeted at new developers 
  (marked with a newbie tag)
  * We migrated the previously internal Wiki to Confluence and added 
  developer information to lower the entry barrier to contribute
  * Blog post on how to run StreamPipes on a Raspberry Pi, we now plan to 
  publish blog posts at regular intervals
  * Contact to sensor producer, and first integrations with their sensors, 
  which should help growing the ecosystem
  * Meeting with a manufacturing company to present StreamPipes and talk 
  about cooperation possibilities
  * We started to plan ApacheCon talks (also a joint talk together with 
  Apache PLC4X)
  * The number of Twitter followers has increased (currently at 103)
  * The number of Github stars has increased (currently at 109)

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  * Successfully migrated complete development cycle to new GitHub and 
  Docker Hub repositories
  * Optimized containers to run on ARM architectures
  * Implemented further algorithms to merge data streams and pre-process 
  data for machine learning tasks
  * Checking licences of the UI and adding checklist to Wiki
  * Checking licenses of the backend and populated the LICENSE-binary file
  * Currently, we are finishing a license review to properly create LICENSE 
  and NOTICE files

  In the next month, we plan to continue our work towards the first Apache 
  release.

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?
  No new committers were elected beyond the initial committers. Two people
  mentioned on the mailing list that they might be willing to contribute to
  StreamPipes.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  Our mentors are very responsive and provide good feedback. We discovered 
  an issue that some mentors are not subscribed to the private mailing list 
  and got in contact with them to fix this issue.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  * We are currently preparing a new logo 
  * Currently, no issues are known related to brand misuse, but there are
  still some open issues concerning the transition to the ASF infrastructure
  (e.g., shutting down the old streampipes organization on Github to avoid 
  confusion)
  * We've started to research best-practices related to brand management 
  (other ASF projects) and intend to add a section in the Confluence Wiki 
  on brand management.

## Tamaya

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Gain more active contributors and committers
  2. Decide how to ensure future development of Tamaya
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Since we lack a lot of committers and contributors we started a 
  discussion 
  on the mailing list about the future of the project.
  One way might be to let the code return to Github instead of becoming a 
  TLP 
  - it's an ongoing discussion with no decision yet.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  No changes in the project.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We released version 0.4-incubating and continue working on changes in

## Training

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for
training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various Apache
and non-Apache target projects.

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Promote the information about Apache Training Project with increased 
     participation from community
  2. Create a tutorial on how the tools provided by this project can be 
     used to create own content
  3. Review current policies around contribution review and releases to 
     find a pragmatic compromise 

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  - There currently is a lack of involvement by the PPMC in the project 
  which caused stagnation in mailing list participation and overall
  project progress.
  The PPMC is currently taking steps to address this by focusing on 
  promoting new committers and being more involved again. 
  - The current review and release process seems to be overly complex and 
  scary and hampers contributions. Discussions around relaxing this are
  ongoing.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Activity on the dev list has declined since the last report, total number 
  of posts was November 37, December 13, January (to be updated) 84.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  - We have refactored the Maven structure to make adding new projects much 
  easier by using an archetype, this should help make the project more
  accessible to a lot of people.
  - ApacheCon themed templates are under development that will be available 
  for speakers at future conferences
  - An introductory Hadoop slide deck was contributed and is currently 
  undergoing review.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
  There are currently some issues with this podling that we are working to 
  address, we believe that the issues are not yet critical and can be turned
  around from within the community but want to make the board aware of this 
  early on.

### Date of last release:

 No new releases as ongoing discussions around the Pixabay license in 
 LEGAL-479 have been blocking releases for months now.

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?
  Voting is currently ongoing to add a new committer to the projects roster.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  Mentors have been responsive and helpful when reached out to.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  The name search process has not yet been started, as there is still time 
  to do that if and when graduation draws nearer. The PPMC is actively 
  monitoring usage of the Podlings current name on other sites. 
  The Podling is not directly affiliating with any sponsors donating 
  content and presenting an independent image on the webpage.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

## Description:

The mission of Apache Kibble is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to an interactive project activity analyzer and aggregator.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

Apache Kibble was founded 2017-10-17 (2 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Rafael Weingärtner on 2017-12-08.
- No new committers. Last addition was Rafael Weingärtner on 2017-12-09.

## Project Activity:

Sharan gave a 20 minute talk[1] at chaosscon[2] (one of the events in the FOSDEM
Fringe - events surrounding FOSDEM in Brussels) featuring kibble. We got lots
of interest especially around the sentient analysis. Chaoss are keen to
include kibble but we need to do the work to highlight how we align (or not) to
the Chaoss definitions.

## Community Health:

The community is healthy, although still small, and struggling to add new
members. We continue to have a great deal of interest at events, but that
doesn't often result in actual new contributors. Meanwhile, the project has
sufficient oversight and continues steady forward progress.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

## Description:
The mission of Knox is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Simplify and normalize the deployment and implementation of secure Hadoop
clusters

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Knox was founded 2014-02-18 (6 years ago) There are currently 22
committers and 18 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - Sandor Molnar was added to the PMC on 2019-11-20
 - Sandor Molnar was added as committer on 2019-11-21

## Project Activity:
- Planning for the Apache Knox 1.4.0 release has begun and continues with the
  approach of using KIPs to communicate larger design and feature changes and
  goals.
- This release has been in the works for longer than anticipated but will land
  within a matter of weeks.
- We plan to concentrate on the client library and shell for interacting with
  remote Knox instances/Hadoop clusters and Cloudera Manager based service
  discovery.
- 1.3.0 was released on 2019-07-23.
- 1.2.0 was released on 2018-12-18.

## Community Health:
There does seem to be an uptick in use of Apache Knox in Hadoop and other big
data deployments across the industry. We have received contributions from new
contributors with varying sizes and level of impact. Pull requests are a
relatively new mechanism for the Knox community which explains the large
increase over previous quarters.

The large increase in email traffic on the dev list is likely a result of
additional traffic from github PR activity and commits.

- dev@knox.apache.org had a 21% increase in traffic in the past quarter (2194
  emails compared to 1813):
- user@knox.apache.org had a 32% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (24
  emails compared to 35):
- 102 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-28% decrease)
- 105 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-27% decrease)

The mission of the Apache Logging Services project is to create and maintain of 
software for managing the logging of application behavior, and for related 
software components.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Logging Services was founded 2003-12-16 (16 years ago)
There are currently 35 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carter Kozak on 2018-07-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Andrei Ivanov on 2019-04-18.

## Project Activity:
- In November, we received increased interest and contributions to log4php and
  log4net.
- In November, we continued discussions around the plugin dependency injection
  overhaul and learned some lessons from various CDI implementations.
- In December, we released Log4j 2.13.0 which is the first Log4j 2 release
  that requires Java 8. Other notable features in this release include
  backward compatibility with Log4j 1 properties and XML configuration files,
  new configuration integrations with Kubernetes and Spring Boot, a new logger
  builder API, additional message sub-layout configuration for GELF layouts,
  and numerous bug fixes and pull requests.
- In December, we announced CVE-2019-17571 for Log4j 1.x as a deserialization
  of untrusted data vulnerability in the log socket server. This is announced
  without a fix as the 1.x release line was EOLed in August 2015. A similar
  vulnerability was announced a couple years ago in Log4j 2.x in
  CVE-2017-5645.
- In December, we turned back to discussing what else is necessary for Log4j
  3.0. Some main changes considered include improved compatibility with the
  Java module system in Java 9+ along with trimming down the size of the core
  jar due to finer grained modules, an overhauled plugin system making plugin
  development more comparable to common dependency injection frameworks,
  backward-compatible API housekeeping, and a consideration around what level
  of backward compatibility is expected for this release line which concluded
  with a desire to continue backward compatibility with the 2.x API.
- In January, we received contributions from a couple new people for log4cxx
  including a build system simplification toward using CMake.
- In January, we began conversations with a contributor who is working on
  merging their highly customizable Logstash/JSON layout project into Log4j.
- In January, we received a contribution fixing our Travis build. This has led
  to discussions around the possibility of trying out GitHub Actions as a PR
  tester replacement in the future.


## Community Health:
- Renewed interest in log4php in improving its website and other rough edges.
- Doubling of dev@ mailing list traffic thanks to increased interest in all of
  Log4j, log4cxx, and log4php.
- Large increases in email, commit, and PR traffic this quarter (all at least
  doubled from last quarter). This was partially to be expected due to a
  decrease in traffic last quarter.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.15 release on December
25, 2019.  The next major release is due on April 30, 2020.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Cihad Guzel as committer on 8/16/2019. We nominated
and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did not sign up
any new PMC members or committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the
lookout for new PMC members and committers.  There are two prospects who we
may ask in the near future.

We are still not 100% done with the newest OpenText replacement connector;
some installations aren't able to connect and we're trying to diagnose why. 
It's a long process because of the lack of local installations for these
repositories available directly to our team.  Other connectors that will be
requiring this level of work in the near future include the SharePoint
connector, which suffers from the same issue.  We continue to rely on early
adopters to co-develop these connectors with us.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been fairly active this quarter.  Requests for
connector development continue to be significant.

I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

New releases have been managed by Arjan Seijkens, not by the PMC chair, which
is a nice change and good to get more involvement.

## Community Health:
The community isn't very active and we're mostly just adding maintenance
updates or smaller improvements. Whether this is a problem or not is not quite
sure - the project may not evolve a whole lot more, but still offers value to
it's users.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Huikyo Lee]

## Description:
- The OCW includes a Python open-source library for common climate model
  evaluation tasks as well as a set of user-friendly interfaces for quickly
  configuring a model evaluation task. OCW also allows users to build their
  own climate data analysis tools, such as the statistical downscaling
  toolkit.

## Issues:
- We could not make any new release last year. Community Health Score (Chi) is
  -2.65.

## Activity:
- We almost completed refactoring and testing OCW by using Xarray and pandas.
  The refactored code has been released in the main developer’s personal
  Github repository.

- 1.9.2 was released on 2019-12-30.

New features recently merged include improvements to the language detector,
documentation, and general clean up of code. As chair I would like to see
OpenNLP have more frequent releases and we will work toward that.

## Community Health:
The OpenNLP community remains healthy even though it is not extremely active.
The project added a new committer, Tim Allison, who provided valuable
contributions to OpenNLP last year. We have quite a few pending pull requests
that we are working on merging or asking the authors to update. These short
conversations will likely mostly take place directly the on GitHub pull
requests and will not be reflected in the OpenNLP mailing list statistics.

- Neeraj Mangal was added as committer on 2020-02-03

## Project Activity:

We are actively working towards a long-awaited next release of the core
OpenWhisk system (the last release of the core system was 0.9.0-incubating in
2018-10-31). This will be the first release of our new "standalone"
configuration which enables a very simple single machine deployment of
OpenWhisk. It will also be the first time the project has released a coherent
set of all its releasable software components (currently 22 separate
packages). This effort is driving a wave of component releases detailed below.

Recent releases:
- openwhisk-runtime-docker-1.14.0: 2020-02-11
- openwhisk-runtime-java-1.14.0: 2020-02-11
- openwhisk-runtime-php-1.14.0: 2020-02-11
- openwhisk-runtime-ruby-1.14.0: 2020-02-11
- openwhisk-runtime-swift-1.14.0: 2020-02-11
- openwhisk-client-js-3.21.1: 2020-02-08
- openwhisk-client-js-3.21.0: 2020-02-06
- openwhisk-composer-0.12.0: 2020-01-22
- openwhisk-runtime-go-1.15.0: 2020-01-17
- openwhisk-catalog-0.11.0: 2020-01-07
- openwhisk-runtime-dotnet-1.14.0: 2020-01-07

## Community Health:
Community health is good with plenty of activity on dev list and slack.

Statistical metrics (PRs, commits, list traffic, etc.) are stable.

The community is working on developing a light-weight process for Proposing
Openwhisk EnhanceMents (POEM) to facilitate discussion of proposed
architectural changes to the core system. There is a sense that by having a
documented series of steps for managing such changes we could increase community
involvement and project velocity.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe Chiasson]

--- mod_perl --

mod_perl 2.0.11 was released on October 5th 2019

Since that successfull release, activity has quieted down a bit, as is usually
the case.

CVE-2011-2767 can be put to rest thanks to that release.

-- Activity --

The activity levels went down a little, after a noticeable uptick leading up
to the final release.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, as usual.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers.

No new changes to the committer base since last report.

Last Commiter addition was Jan Kaluza in April 2013

-- PMC --

Currently 11 PMC members.

No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Last PMC addition was Steve Hay on Wed Feb 29 2012

Slow to start. The OSS-Bot project has gone quiet due to Lunar New Year
and Coronavirus. Will attempt to rekindle discussion next week.

Rumblings of a possible project coming soon.

## Community Health:
We need to spend some more time on the website. I think we are all mostly 
distracted by other things occurring in the Foundation.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Phoenix Project  [Josh Elser]

## Description:
The mission of Phoenix is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
High performance relational database layer over Apache HBase for low latency 
applications

## Issues:
No issues to report to the board at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Phoenix was founded 2014-05-20 (6 years ago)
There are currently 51 committers and 31 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Chinmay Kulkarni on 2019-09-09.
- Andreas Neumann was added as committer on 2019-12-03
- Terence Yim was added as committer on 2019-12-03
- Gokcen Iskender was added as committer on 2020-02-07
- Gokul Gunasekaran was added as committer on 2019-12-03
- Istvan Toth was added as committer on 2019-12-02
- Xinyi Yan was added as committer on 2019-12-26
- Yoni Gottesman was added as committer on 2019-12-03

## Project Activity:

Following up from the previous report, I'm happy to report that both the
former podlings Omid and Tephra have been successfully "adopted" under
the Apache Phoenix PMC. The PMC voted to grant committership to all
PPMC who desired it, transitioned all infrastructure (e.g. Jira projects,
Git repositories) under the Phoenix role, and did some basic updates
to our public facing user-documentation to make sure our users can be
aware of how these (now) sub-projects will continue to exist at the ASF.

I'm also happy to report that Phoenix 4.15.0 was released in December. As is
normal, we are also approaching a 4.15.1 bug-fix release in that release line.
Activity on the 4.x release line continues at the usual cadence thanks to the
dedicated work of the committers.

On the 5.x release line, we were largely blocked because upstream Apache
HBase changes caused us some API and runtime compatibility issues. Thankfully,
after some more discussion on the matter, we got traction by a developer to
chase down the problem and implement a solution. At this point, we are largely
unblocked to work towards a long-overdue 5.1.0 release.

## Community Health:

We've added 7 new committers since our last report which is fantastic. We have
not, however, added any new committers. We should take this as an action item
as a project.

I find the mailing list traffic largely status quo; user lists have a drop
year-over-year but the dev and issues list have an increase of a similar
percentage magnitude year-over-year. In general, I observe a steady stream of
user questions and developers created and resolving Jira issues.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
 - Apache POI was founded 2007-05-16 (13 years ago)
 - There are currently 39 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.
 - The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

 - Community changes, past quarter:
   - Axel Howind was added to the PMC on 2019-11-11
   - Axel Howind was added as committer on 2019-11-12

## Project Activity:
 - Some feature development in the area of HSLF/XSLF, mostly rendering of
   slides and support for more image formats. Also some charting enhancements.
   Otherwise mostly bugfixes, file-leaks fixed, Sonar issues resolved, ...

   Release 4.1.2 is currently finalized and should be available soon.

   Some testing of JDK 14 was performed to ensure newer JDK versions work as
   well.

## Community Health:
 - There are some ongoing discussions with users about features/behavior which
   indicates that the popularity of Apache POI is still high. Questions via
   email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   There is steady activity from multiple committers, 4.1.2 will contain
   commits from at least 6 different developers. We still should broaden the
   developer base but not many potential committers show up on the mailing
   lists currently.

   This time the holidays helped to resolve some bugs, however in general
   bug-numbers unfortunately increase steadily, some bug influx and some could
   be fixed, but overall the rate of creation is higher than resolving, also
   due to some invalid bugs being entered which need lots of time to be
   analyzed/triaged as well.

### XMLBeans
 - Nearly no changes for XMLBeans this quarter, the project is in maintenance
   mode.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode.

## Bugzilla Statistics:

### Apache POI

 - 564 bugs are open overall (+-0)
 - Having 158 enhancements (+4)
 - Thus having 406 actual bugs (-4)
 - 96 of these are waiting for feedback (+7)

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description:
The mission of Santuario is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
XML Security in Java and C++

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Santuario was founded 2006-06-27 (14 years ago)
There are currently 17 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Daniel Kulp on 2018-10-01.
- No new committers. Last addition was Daniel Kulp on 2018-10-01.

## Project Activity:
There were no releases over the last quarter. A new contributor has raised
several issues and submitted pull requests, so we anticipate geting a new
minor Java release out within a month for these fixes.

Work continued on a new major Java release. We also anticipate this over the
next quarter.

We discussed again the possibility of moving to GIT - there were no objections,
so we anticipate doing this over the next quarter.

Recent releases:

    Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java 2.1.4 was released on 2019-07-20.
    Apache Santuario - XML Security for Java 2.1.3 was released on 2019-03-29.
    Apache Santuario XML-Security C++ 2.0.2 was released on 2018-11-02.

## Community Health:
Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
the PMC.

to make development and deployment of cloud applications easier.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache ServiceComb was founded 2018-10-17 (a year ago)
There are currently 23 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was MabinGo on 2019-10-09.
- Lisen Sun was added as committer on 2019-12-27

## Project Activity:

ServiceComb Java Chassis 1.3.0 was released on 2019-10-31.

## Community Health:
Overall community health is good. We started to work with some Apache project
to address the multiple data center sync since issue last month. Although
there is a litter drop of the code contributors (-13%) as some developers just
switch the job, the developer activities are increase (PR and code commits
have 30% increase).

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:
The mission of Apache SIS is the creation and maintenance of software
providing data structures for developing geospatial applications compliant
with the model of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. Apache SIS also develops
project-specific API for functionalities not covered by OGC/ISO standards.

## Issues:
No issue to report this month.

## Membership Data:
Apache SIS was founded 2012-09-19 (7 years ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johann Sorel on 2017-09-07.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexís Manin on 2019-07-05.

## Project Activity:
All activities is happening on a branch (we develop on a branch anticipating
what may be future standards, and keep master aligned with currently released
standards). The last merge on master was on October 24, 2019. We usually merge
on master more often, but the merge is currently hold because of large
contributions committed on the development branch and not yet reorganized
in a way to minimize merge conflicts. The new functionalities include:

* Use of PostGIS spatial database, spatial filters, GeoJSON
  (cited in last report).
* JavaFX application is progressing well.
* Base class for portrayal (i.e. rendering of maps).
* Base class for reproducing some of the functionalities of
  Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) library.

The JAI library was developed ~25 years ago by Sun Microsystems, NASA and
others. It was a powerful library for processing large images, with advanced
features for defining and manipulating chains of image operations, lazy
computing and multi-threading on a tile-by-tile basis, handling interpolations
problems, etc. It was suitable to classical photos, medical imagery or remote
sensing data. Unfortunately JAI is not maintained anymore for about 15 years.
Nevertheless at least some of JAI functionalities are critical to Apache SIS.
In the last three months we started to reproduce in Apache SIS some
functionalities of JAI.

An Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) meeting was done in November 2019.
A report has been posted on the Apache geospatial mailing list:
https://s.apache.org/m0itz

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) does every year a "test bed" where new
standards are experimented. The test bed for 2020 includes an aspect in which
Apache SIS is particularly well suited. In short, the main trend of the last
20 years has been in the development of Web APIs for the discovery and
download of data. However the amount of Earth Observation data is so huge
(terabytes of new data every day) that space agencies want to change the
paradigm, and transfer algorithms close to the machine where data are located
instead than downloading the data. This may require the standardization of
programming languages APIs (as opposed to Web APIs). I will give more
details in next report if we get involved (indirectly) in this experiment.

## Community Health:
Traffic on user mailing list has increased thanks to new users in the process
of evaluating Apache SIS. They have not yet made their choice, so we do not
know yet if they will stay around.

Traffic on developer mailing list is probably too low compared to the amount
of commits. Since the 3 currently active developers are from the same company,
and all of them in a rush for getting projects done, we have difficulty to
spend the required amount of time for communicating better on the list.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- We have cut a release branch for Apache Spark 3.0, which is now undergoing
  testing and bug fixes before the final release. In December, we also
  published a new preview release for the 3.0 branch that the community can
  use to test and give feedback:
  https://spark.apache.org/news/spark-3.0.0-preview2.html. Spark 3.0 includes
  a range of new features and dependency upgrades (e.g. Java 11) but remains
  largely compatible with Spark’s current API.

- We published Apache Spark 2.4.5 on Feb 8th with bug fixes for the 2.4 branch
  of Spark.

Trademarks:

- Nothing new to report in the past 3 months.

Latest releases:

- Spark 2.4.5 was released on Feb 8th, 2020.
- Spark 3.0.0-preview2 was released on Dec 23rd, 2019.
- Spark 3.0.0-preview was released on Nov 6th, 2019.
- Spark 2.3.4 was released on Sept 9th, 2019.

Committers and PMC:

- The latest PMC member was added on Sept 4th, 2019 (Dongjoon Hyun).
- The latest committer was added on Sept 9th, 2019 (Weichen Xu). We also added
  Ryan Blue, L.C. Hsieh, Gengliang Wang, Yuming Wang and Ruifeng Zheng as
  committers in the past three months.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Streams Project  [Steve Blackmon]

## Description:
Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online
activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets
accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Streams was founded 2017-07-18 (3 years ago)
There are currently 8 committers and 8 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ate Douma on 2017-07-18.
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
- Three modules are new or materially improved this quarter.
- One module was submitted (and several reviewed) by a new project participant
  bhodge.

## Community Health:
- Mailing list and commit participation was low again.  Adding committers and
  growing the PMC needs to be a focus.
- Streams is over-due for a release to incorporate new ActivityStreams
  2.0 support and updates to several of our core dependencies.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

The Apache Subversion® version control system exists to be universally
recognized and adopted as an open-source, centralized version control solution
characterized by its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the
simplicity of its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of
a wide variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The Subversion development community is fairly quiet these days. A
  small trickle of development is ongoing. The community usually
  responds to bug reports and is willing to help the reporter or any
  other volunteer to develop a fix. However, in many cases there is no
  such volunteer, and those bug reports are filed but often remain
  unresolved. 

  Our user support forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers
  regularly.

  We have added no new committers/PMC members since the last report.
  Most recently added PMC members are Nathan Hartman (hartmannathan@)
  and Yasuhito Futatsuki (futatuki@).

* Releases

  The currently supported releases are Subversion 1.13.0 and 1.10.6.

  We are currently preparing for the 1.14 release which is expected in
  April: https://subversion.apache.org/roadmap.html#release-planning

  Discussions about the frequency of minor releases are still taking
  place on our dev@ list.
  Because funding for a developer who managed our time-based releases
  is no longer available the community is reconsidering the viability
  of time-based releases. One particular question is whether we should
  move towards a release model which is focused on maintenance in the
  long term, as opposed to development of new features.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiriccò]

## Description:

The mission of Syncope is the creation and maintenance of software related to
managing digital identities in enterprise environments.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:

Apache Syncope was founded 2012-11-21 (7 years ago)
There are currently 24 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Matteo Alessandroni on 2017-12-22.
- No new committers. Last addition was Misagh Moayyed on 2019-10-04.

## Project Activity:

Several fixes, improvements and small new features are being introduced for
upcoming maintenance release 2.1.6. Also, work on master branch for next major
release 3.0.0 is regaining strength.

Contributions via pull requests from GitHub remain quite high and seem to be
seen as a mean to double-check changes before getting into actual commits,
especially for new features. This not only for newcomers but also by
committers.

Latest releases:

   - 2.0.14 was released on 2019-09-12
   - 2.1.5 was released on 2019-09-12

## Community Health:

Besides Misagh Moayyed recently welcomed as new committer, we have been glad
to report an additional contributor to our team list page, Dmitriy Brashevets.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache SystemML Project  [Jon Deron Eriksson]

## Description:
SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at
flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid
runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to distributed
computations such as Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

## Issues:
Little development has happened in the main project in the last year. On the
private list, there is discussion about merging an active fork of SystemML
back into the main project. This fork is SystemDS, led by Matthias Boehm, the
largest contributor to SystemML. Matthias has proposed nominating the 4 most
active SystemDS team members to be committers. He has stated that he would
require that the project name is changed to SystemDS. He has discussed this
name change process with Mark Thomas. The responses on the private list
regarding merging of the active fork have been positive.

## Membership Data:
Apache SystemML was founded 2017-05-16 (3 years ago)
There are currently 26 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Arvind Surve on 2017-05-16.
- No new committers. Last addition was Guobao Li on 2018-08-28.

## Project Activity:
There was one commit to the project this quarter.
One pull request was opened and closed this quarter.
The most recent release was 1.2.0 on Aug 24, 2018.

## Community Health:
The community is currently unhealthy.
There is little email activity.
Community health should significantly improve if SystemDS is merged into the
main project.

## Answers to Board Questions:

myrle: Thank you for your clear and frank assessment of the state of
       the project community. Is it time to retire SystemML?

Henry Saputra initiated a discussion about possibly retiring SystemML to the
attic. In this discussion, the possibility of merging the active SystemDS fork
into the main Apache project was discussed. All responses on the private list
to the proposal to merge SystemDS into SystemML have been positive.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Thiago Henrique De Paula Figueiredo]

## Description:
The mission of Tapestry is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Component-based Java Web Application Framework

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tapestry was founded 2006-02-14 (14 years ago)
There are currently 27 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Dmitry Gusev on 2019-09-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Balázs Palcsó on 2019-01-17.

## Project Activity:
This was a pretty slow quarter for the project. Unfortunately, we weren't able
to release Tapestry 5.5 in the last quarter as we planned, but we definitely
are going to do that in this month or in the next. We expect a little increase
in community activity after the release.

## Community Health:
dev@tapestry.apache.org had a 87% decrease in traffic in the
past quarter (11 emails compared to 82)
3 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-50% decrease)
0 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-100% decrease)
1 commit in the past quarter (-92% decrease)

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Health

Our mailing lists are quieter this quarter than the previous quarter.  We do,
however, anticipate this as the project tends to see an increase in
November/December time as contributors enjoy spending some free time over the
holiday period contributing to the project, and the volume drops once the
holiday period is over.

We are seeing greater participation from the PMC in creating board reports,
in particular Jonathan Gallimore who created the majority of this report.  We
hope to see continued collaboration here.

There was a slight delay getting enough binding votes on our last round of
releases, which is a sign we should put some attention to expanding the PMC.

Additionally we've more than doubled contributors in the last 14 months, from
around 40 to now 98, however have only added one committer in that same
timeframe, which is a sign we should consider being more aggressive granting
commit.

## Activity

The community has recently released TomEE 8.0.1 in January, along with
parallel releases of TomEE 7.1.2 and TomEE 7.0.7.

The latest 8.0.1 release fixes compliance issues around JAX-RS, provides some
fixes for running with Java 11, removes some outdated and unused dependencies
(Xalan and Serializer), and upgrades other dependencies (Tomcat and CXF) to
mitigate the latest CVE vulnerabilities in those components, including:

CVE-2019-12419: Apache CXF OpenId Connect token service does not properly
   validate the clientId
CVE-2019-12406: Apache CXF does not restrict the number of message 
   attachments
CVE-2019-17563: Apache Tomcat Session fixation 
CVE-2019-12418: Apache Tomcat Local Privilege Escalation 

TomEE is not yet Jakarta EE 8 compliant, but work continues in this area.

The release of Jakarta EE 9 is in progress and set to deliver in the
June-August timeframe 2020.  This will involve a namespace break from javax
to jakarta that will impact not just TomEE but all Apache java projects that
implement former-Java EE specifications.  We expect a great deal of
project-to-project communication on this and it is likely something we should
ask projects to report on over the next year. All projects will need to know
each other's status and the board should be aware of overall progress and
potential project or community impacts.

We have seen new activity in the community, particularly in the area of
maintaining Docker images, and re-working the website. We're particularly
grateful for David Jencks' work on the website, and welcome the collaboration
between new contributors Rod Jenkins and Carl Mosca on the mailing list. We
continue to support their efforts, and strive to be as welcoming as possible
to new contributors.

Our community speaks a number of different languages, which has enabled
translations of our documentation, particularly around the large library of
examples we include with the project. We have seen translations to Portuguese
and Spanish, and have a new contributor translating documentation into
Russian.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Andy Gumbrecht on Tue Aug 11 2015

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 31 committers.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Traffic Control Project  [David Neuman]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Traffic Control is the creation and maintenance of 
software related to building, monitoring, configuring, and provisioning a large 
scale content delivery network (CDN)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Traffic Control was founded 2018-05-15 (2 years ago)
There are currently 24 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Derek Gelinas on 2019-03-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Brennan Fieck on 2019-07-27.

## Project Activity:
ATC 4.0 release candidate is out for vote.  We are up to RC4 and have been
getting good feedback on our releases. Our ATC Robots working group - designed
to discuss ATC automation - had it's first meeting.  The Traffic Control
working group has been working on defining our 3.0 API which will be
implemented in a future release. The working groups are doing a good job of
following up on list after their meetings.

## Community Health:
The communinity health is good.  We seem to be getting a lot of good
participations from new users which is encouraging even though it seems like
most of them are just users and are not necessarily contributing code.  We
recognize that providing good feedback is valuable and we are happy to see
more people active in our community.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Turbine Project  [Georg Kallidis]

## Description:
The mission of Turbine is the creation and maintenance of software related to
a Java Servlet Web Application Framework and associated component library.

Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the base
of many other projects. It allows experienced Java developers to quickly build
web applications.

## Issues:
No board-level issues currently.

## Membership Data:
Apache Turbine was founded 2007-05-16 (13 years ago) There are currently 11
committers and 9 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jeffery Painter on 2017-11-12.
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
- Code changes in components are on low/medium level.
- Continuing last quarter efforts the main focus has been on preparing the
  upstream related project Apache Torque 4.1 (version label may be changed to
  5.0) before the next Turbine/Fulcrum 5.1 releases.
- Last quarters backlog / discussion are still in follow-up work/work in
  process.
- No releases were done this quarter.
- Last main project was Turbine 5.0 Core release on Tue May 28 2019.

## Community Health:
- Some PMC members are currently more active in related project Db/Torque,
  this slows down the development process in this project.
- Turbine is at its core a user/group/role-based web application - it is very
  well-defined and definitely should not be considered as outdated. Moving
  Turbine core to Git (rw) may be one step, but to signal more recentness this
  may be also achieved by improving the front page
  (more responsive, text and design updates).

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Usergrid Project  [Michael Russo]

## Description:
Usergrid is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) composed of an integrated database
   (Cassandra), a query engine (ElasticSearch), and application layer and
    client tier with SDKs for developers.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Usergrid was founded 2015-08-18 (4 years ago). There are currently 28
committers and 25 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mike Dunker on 2016-01-18.
- No new committers. Last addition was Keyur Karnik on 2019-03-18.

## Project Activity:
 - CI setup with ASF Jenkins still in progress. Daily builds are in place but
   configuration needs to be investigated as builds are not green.
 - Experimentation with using newer versions(5.x) of Elasticsearch vs.
   supported older version (1.7). Recent releases:
 - 2.1.0 was released on 2016-02-18.
 - 1.0.2 was released on 2015-07-20.

## Community Health:
Growth is flat and use of Usergrid has been stable with no issues reported
recently. There is a new committer and additional interest for modernizing
Usergrid -- upgrading Cassandra/Elasticsearch to the latest version and
containerizing Usergrid. However, there has not been any significant
contributions for this yet. Getting the project to a healthier state will
continue to be a focus. This includes planning of a new release -- master
branch is currently stable and contains many stability fixes over the last
release in 2016.

There are currently 14 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2017-07-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2017-01-30.

## Project Activity:
Velocity Engine 2.2 was released on 2020-02-02. This release has improvements
to logging, custom parsing support, and a big effort toward improved backward
compatibility with 1.x versions.

## Community Health:
The active community is small but very capable. Coding continues to be handled
by a single PMC member, with others contributing to votes and discussion. The
dormant PMC members did a great job coming out of dormancy to vet and support
the 2.2 Engine release. Stability continues to be both intentional and
appropriate, but the more active PMC members are planning to reach out to a
few very active contributors, hoping to talk them into taking committer and,
eventually, PMC roles.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
Apache Xalan exists to promote the use of XSLT. We view XSLT (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language Transformations) as a compelling paradigm that transforms 
XML documents, thereby facilitating the exchange, transformation, and 
presentation of knowledge. The ability to transform XML documents into usable 
information has great potential to improve the functionality and use of 
information systems. We intend to build freely available XSLT processing 
components in order to engender such improvements.
