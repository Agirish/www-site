 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       Everything seems to be going fine, which is also amazing given all that
       is going on in the world. I had a second brush fire rip through the
       hills near my house and once again barely missed having to evacuate, so
       it seems only yesterday that we had the last meeting.

       It has now been several months since I stopped doing the consent agenda
       and there has been little difference in terms of how long our meetings
       run. I think we can safely do without it until we have a much larger
       slate of things on the agenda.

    B. President [David]

       This month has been busy.

       We successfully moved all of our employees to a new Professional
       Employer Organization (PEO) thanks to the ongoing work of Greg Stein.
       By the time of the Board meeting we should have completed the first
       pay cycle with the new PEO.

       We've additionally submitted our business license request to the city
       of Wilmington, DE and that has been approved.

       I've been working to help the Treasurer mitigate a single point of
       failure risk for banking by working on opening a  backup account at
       another institution. The minimum paperwork is in place, but we are
       waiting for​ some options to mirror our service offering from
       Citizens.

       Tom Pappas has tendered his resignation as VP Finance. At present, I
       don't have plans to make an immediate replacement.

       I've also, with the help of several others, been dealing with a code
       of conduct complaint.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       For the most recent quarterly financial report, please see:
       https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-operations10

       Our switch to a new account firm known as IgniteSpot Accounting also
       known as “Dashboard Accountants” in Utah is almost complete.  We have:
       * Completed the transfer of our accounting data to them
       ** successfully imported data into QuickBooks online
       ** created accounts for all relevant people to access this data, which
          includes President, Treasurer, and Assistant Treasurer.

       * Transitioned our invoicing process to IgniteSpot.
       ** created new invoice templates
       ** onboarded the IgniteSpot team onto fundraising tools and processes

       * Begun transitioning our accounts payable process to IgniteSpot.
       ** Set up IgniteSpot’s access to our bill.com accounts

       * Freshened up our mailing list structure and subscribers to
         facilitate communication and role clarity, while protecting data
         privacy.
       ** For all communications with our accounting team please use the
          team@treasurer.apache.org mailing list.
       ** For details, please see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-21126

       I have been very pleased with the energy and accuracy with which
       IgniteSpot has approached this transition.

       We still need to:
       * Complete the transition of our bank account out from under the
         previous accounting firm’s relationship with our bank, and provide
         the new accounting firm with read access to our banking data.
       * Complete the tax and audit of our books from the last fiscal year,
         which are still held by our previous accounting firm.
       * Complete the integration between bill.com and QuickBooks online, in
         order to automatically sync payment data.
       * Complete the migration of various other accounts such as PayPal,
         Boston Private, etc.

       Related tasks that we have also completed:
       * Moved PEO for our employees to ADP Total Source.  Kudos to Greg
         Stein for working through the details of this process.
       * Set up a new lock box in the State of Delaware, resulting in a new
         mailing address for our corporation.

       Our evaluation of virtualizing our credit card expenditures (mentioned
       in last month's report) is lower priority, but to facilitate progress
       on this in the future, we’re implementing solutions to support credit
       worthiness checks common to virtual card offerings:
       * moving money from CDARS into our bank account to support a minimum
         balance.
       * seeking a method to create read only access into our bank account.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In November, the secretary received 101 ICLAs, 10 software grants, and
       2 CoI affirmations. The secretary team is currently working with VP,
       Data Privacy, to revise policy related to access controls over ICLAs
       and other PII.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsors: we are working on renewals for two Platinum Sponsors, two
Gold Sponsors, and three Bronze Sponsors. One Platinum, two Gold, one Silver,
and one Bronze Sponsors have confirmed renewals. One Platinum Sponsor has
given verbal confirmation to renew but needs to secure budget in order to
officially proceed. We are in the invoicing process with one Platinum, four
Gold, one Silver, and two Bronze Sponsors. We have received payment from a
Silver Sponsor, and one Bronze Sponsor is in arrears. One Bronze sponsor is
unable to renew for the 2021 Sponsorship year.

2) Targeted Sponsors: we finalized the renewal of a Platinum Targeted
Sponsorship, which was actively reworked over the past year. We are awaiting
confirmation from an organization that committed resources with ASF
Infrastructure, and will be onboarding them as a new Targeted Sponsor. We will
soon be conducting end-of-year outreach with existing Targeted Sponsors.

3) Sponsor Relations: we have begun our end-of-year Sponsor outreach and are
working with three organizations considering ASF Sponsor promotional offerings
as part of their sponsorship. We held calls with three sponsors (one each
Platinum, Gold, and Silver), and coordinated queries with ASF Legal Affairs,
Brand Management, and the Apache Incubator.

4) Event Sponsorship: no activity (there are no Apache events being planned at
this time).

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we earned $2,891 during November
over 47 donations. We started the end-of-year campaigns, including Giving
Tuesday and corporate giving programs, and have begun to receive several
donations. We have been notified of an incoming corporate gift that would
qualify the donor recognition as an ASF Sponsor.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — December 2020

I. Budget: we are processing some vendor payments with the ASF's new bill pay
system.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support day-to-day
activities within ASF Fundraising, including Sponsor renewals, invoicing, and
promotions, as well as end-of-year fundraising campaigns. We were aiming to
launch a complimentary ad campaign to benefit Fundraising, particularly for
Giving Tuesday and related campaigns, but missed targeted deadlines whilst
awaiting proposal signoff. We promoted ApacheCon presentations
https://www.youtube.com/c/TheApacheFoundation/, issued the November Month In
Review https://s.apache.org/Nov2020, published Part II of the "Inside Infra"
interview with Gavin McDonald https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Gavin2, as well
as Part I with Andrew Wetmore https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Andrew. We
helped two Apache project community events with their promotions, are working
with a PMC on an upcoming Project Milestone announcement, promoted GSoC 2021
to all PMCs for ComDev, and handled two publisher reprint requests with Brand
Management. We issued the November Month In Review
https://s.apache.org/Nov2020 and are preparing the second FY2021 quarterly
report (Q3; August - October 2020). We are exploring additional
Foundation-wide campaigns to augment the "Success at Apache" series.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 30 November - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® TVM™ as a
   Top-Level Project https://s.apache.org/59g4a

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 9 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog,
including 5 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 349 news
summaries published to date. We tweeted 38 items to 58.8K followers on
Twitter, and posted 31  items to 45.1K  followers on LinkedIn. The ASF’s
YouTube channel had 18,205 views this month, and 8,144 total subscribers to
date.

V. Future Announcements: 1 announcement is in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?"
highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 7 media queries, and handled an ongoing
crisis communications issue with an Apache project. We also handled a media
request for stats on a Project, which were collected from Snoot and augmented
by data obtained from the PMC. We received a total of 3,441 press hits vs.
last month’s 2,543, inclusive of coverage on the ASF, Apache Projects, and
initiatives such as ApacheCon.

VII. Analyst Relations: we have been working with two analyst firms on reports
in serverless computing as well as AI service Clouds. Apache was mentioned in
a total of 21 reports by Gartner, Forrester, 451 Research, and IDC.

VIII. Central Services: Kenneth Paskett (Creative team) continues to make
adjustments to the apache.org homepage. We are preparing for the migration to
the new CMS. We used newly created promotional artwork for Giving Tuesday and
end-of-year fundraising campaigns. Swapnil Mane (Editorial team) continues to
help with drafting and publishing Weekly News Round-ups and Month-in-Review
summaries, and is exploring additional promotional outlets. We continue to
consider new ways to build on M&P projects.

IX. Events liaison: we have wrapped publicity for ApacheCon@Home. We continue
to work with various Apache projects with communications pertaining to events
promotion.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: We are phasing out billing pass-throughs
from HALO Worldwide and endeavor to have our accounts transferred for 1
January 2021.

XI. Miscellany: we handled a vendor request for promotional guidelines
pertaining to their team's participation with an Apache project, responded to
a Targeted Sponsor seeking additional marketing exposure, and approved a
vendor’s instructional video on deploying an Apache project in their software
solution. We also liaised the registration of the ASF as beneficiary of Season
of Docs, fulfilled a request regarding ASF Member participation in
professional associations, and responded to a query regarding the Trillions
and Trillions Served documentary on the ASF.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- We have signed all the paperwork with our new PEO, and will have
  completed onboarding our US employees by the Board meeting.
- Infra has started a monthly "All Things Builds" conference call,
  which has shown good interest. It allows for cross-connecting
  between projects.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Finish testing of the new mail systems.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- GitHub v2: on recent Ubuntu and Puppet, more reliability, improved
  codebase, etc. 

General Activity
================
- Mail server rebuild is progressing well, and we are performing
  various tests before moving more of the Foundation onto the new
  system. Individual mail routing is working fine, and testing some
  mailing lists is on deck.
- Continued some fixes on the account creation script.
- Initial work on moving from (ancient) Buildbot 0.8 to Buildbot 2.0
- Moving projects from travis-ci.org (deprecated and shutting down) to
  our paid-for service on travis-ci.com.
- Preparing a meet.a.o server for Apache audio/video meetups.
- Working/meeting with Atlassian on product issues.
- Wrote an analyzer for people who mark mailing list messages as spam,
  so we can track them down and unsubscribe them.

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in

Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

One more pretty uneventful month: we've had a regular amount of usual requests
flowing through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Committee members took good care
of resolving most of these in time. We're steady at 29 unresolved issues this
month.

The only three things worth noting are LEGAL-516 and a review of our bylaws.

Justin and I will be finally bringing LEGAL-516 home by the end of 2020. It
has remained open long enough and is clearly stalling.

DLAPiper is still slow to re-engage -- I'm hoping Mark will have more time
available for us before the end of the year.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 12: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

A couple of projects used our new CVE process web system for handling
their issues and we continue to work on it, waiting for Mitre to roll
out the production automation APIs.

Stats for Nov 2020:

     21        [license confusion]
     11        [support request/question not security notification]

Security reports: 45 (last months: 41, 32, 24, 38)

     14        [site]
     3         [httpd], [struts]
     2         [hive], [maven]
     1         [activemq], [airflow], [axis], [cxf], [flink], [hadoop], [hama],
               [kylin],  [mina], [netbeans], [nuttx], [ozone], [pulsar], 
               [shardingsphere], [shiro], [skywalking], [subversion], [tomcat], 
               [trafficcontrol], [trafficserver], [unomi]

     In total, as of 1st December 2020, we're tracking 64 (last month:
     69) open issues across 34 projects, median age 90 (last month:
     82) days.  33 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     7 (last month: 8) of these issues, across 4 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  None require escalation.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Axis was created on 2001-01-19 (19 years ago).

There are currently 63 committers and PMC members in this project, a vote in
2010 made all committers automatically PMC members.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## Health report:
As Axis commemorates our 20th year this upcoming quarter since the projects
first commit, we continue to have moderate activity of new and existing users
posting to the mailing lists and creating Jira issues.

Our goal for the next Axis2 java release is JDK 11 compilation, and upgrades
of dependencies. Notable upgrades this past quarter include moving to log4j2,
switching from com.sun.xml.bind to org.glassfish.jaxb, and fixing the
WSDL2Code.sh script for JDK 9 and later.

Documentation improvements this past include our Spring Framework integration
guide. JSON based web services doc improvements are in progress. Both of these
areas are key to growing our community and increasing committer growth.

Axis2 C PMC member Bill Blough continued to make progress this past quarter,
by working on fixes to the Rampart security components.

java-dev@axis.apache.org had a 189% increase in traffic in the past quarter
(136 emails compared to 47):

java-user@axis.apache.org had a 7700% increase in traffic in the past quarter
(78 emails compared to 1):

10 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (150% increase)

8 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (100% increase)

14 commits in the past quarter (-26% decrease)

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

## Description:
Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as
Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Currently, Bahir provides extensions to
multiple distributed analytic platforms, extending their reach with a
diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data sources.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Bahir was founded 2016-05-17 (5 years ago)
There are currently 40 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was João Boto on 2020-07-09.
- No new committers. Last addition was Łukasz Antoniak on 2019-01-21.

Also, related to previous report comment, the ratio of PMC/Committer
is related to, during project inception, all Apache Spark committers
being given committership access to the project. Note that, any active
committers that stayed active for a little while are now PMC members.

## Project Activity:
Apache Bahir community continues to see a steady medium flow of
contributions enhancing the existing extensions for both
Apache Spark and Apache Flink.

The extensions to Apache Flink has seen higher activity compared to
the extensions to Apache Spark. We are now investigating required updates
to support Apache Spark 3.0 and recently there are also some required
updates to support latest Apache Spark 2.4.x release which was just reported
and is being investigated.

## Community Health:
In general, this quarter had a lower mailing list and committs activity, but
steady number of new JIRAs.

### Releases
Apache Bahir for Apache Spark 2.4.0 released on 2019-09-23
Apache Bahir for Apache Spark 2.3.4 released on 2019-09-23
Apache Bahir for Apache Flink 1.0 released on 2017-05-24

## Trademark/Branding
* No known issues.

## Legal Issues
* No known issues.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Jun He]

## Description:
Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Apache 
Hadoop ecosystem. The primary goal of Bigtop is to build a community around the 
packaging and interoperability testing of Hadoop-related projects. This 
includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, runtime, upgrade, 
etc...) developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather 
than individual projects. In short we strive to be for Hadoop what Debian is to 
Linux.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Bigtop was founded 2012-09-19 (8 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 28 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Kengo Seki on 2020-04-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Yuqi Gu on 2020-06-10.

## Project Activity:
- Recreated CI with new instances and a couple of security fixes applied.
- Due to PowerPC worker node in CI is not available since Sept, and no response
  from IBM on community's request for resource, the community agreed to 
  temporarily drop the ppc64le support in v1.5.0.
- V1.5.0 release candidate is ready. Voting is in progress and will be closed on
  Sunday, December 13th, 2020.
- Bigtop Website is now automatically built and deployed with changes pushed to
  master.
- Started work on Hadoop upgrade to 3.2.1.

## Community Health:
- Community health is good. New users and contributors were seen in threads of
  user and dev mailing list, where developer documentation and release status
  were discussed.
- 7 code contributors in the past quarter (40% increase)
- 59 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (78% increase)
- 56 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (69% increase)
- 90 commits in the past quarter (221% increase)

recently welcomed Jean-Louis Monteiro to the PMC in recognition of his
participation and assistance with our last few releases.

## Community Health:
Our activity metrics for this quarter were raised across the board.
This is partially due to the community activity that led to our recent
release. Additionally, we have just begun exploring new opportunities for
extending the base specification for improved compatibility with CDI frameworks,
which was another contributing factor.

- We released Apache Camel 3.6.0 on 2020-10-20.
- The 3.4.x series of releases are part of the LTS on-going effort we are
  doing, so we are following this patch releases series. We're going to release 
  3.4.5 in the beginning of 2021
- The new LTS release will be the 3.7.0 which will be released in December.
- We are preparing the next patch release for 2.25.x, the 2.25.3
- We released Camel-K 1.2.0 on 2020-10-08
- We released Camel-K 1.2.1 on 2020-11-24
- We are improving the support of Camel 3 and improving the Camel-K experience
- We are continuing supporting Camel-Quarkus by releasing 4 versions this
  quarter
- We released the following Camel-Quarkus versions:
  - 1.1.0 on 9 Sep 2020
  - 1.2.0 on 15 Oct 2020

  - We are working on 0.7.x based on 3.7.0 and we'll release once Camel 3.7.0 
    will be released
- We moved our main chat from Gitter to Zulip

## Community Health:
- dev@camel.apache.org had a 2% increase in traffic in the past quarter (404
  emails compared to 393): This is mainly related to the fact we released the
  LTS 3.4.x and the little increase in the traffic is because we are about to
  release the second LTS train
- issues@camel.apache.org had a 7% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (2531 emails compared to 2698): Camel 3 is still in his early adoption so
   not all the users are moving from the 2.x version, but many of them are
   beginning. We are focusing on new features but also on backlog about stuff
   we'd like to have in 3.x, but we weren't able to complete
- users@camel.apache.org had a 1% increase in traffic in the past quarter (335
  emails compared to 330): This is more or less constant, people are starting
  to ask about Camel 3 and migration from Camel 2.
- 407 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (15% increase) 351 issues closed in
  JIRA, past quarter (no change) This is related to the new features we'd like
  to introduce in 3.7.0 and second LTS, in particular some stuff comes from
  the subprojects
- 4650 commits in the past quarter (18% increase) 150 code contributors in the
  past quarter (23% increase) We saw an increase in new contributors related
  mainly to documentation and migration, for the commits some of them are
  related to new features and code generation
- 1484 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (49% increase) 1477 PRs closed on
  GitHub, past quarter (47% increase) A Lot of new PRs are coming from some
  bot we are using. Related to the auto-generation of documentation mainly
- 371 issues opened on GitHub, past quarter (-2% decrease)
  319 issues closed on GitHub, past quarter (6% increase)
  We were closing some backlog github issues especially in subprojects

## Project Activity:
There was little to no activity in the last three months.
Last releases were in 2017.

## Community Health:
We have a mature code base. No major development is expected.
Because there hasn't been much activity in the last three years, we
consider moving the project to the attic after a final OpenCMIS release.
A few fixes and dependency updates have been accumulated over the years
and users have asked for official release of those.
So far, nobody volunteered to cut the release, though.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Jesse MacFadyen]



## Status report for the Apache Cordova project - December 2020

## Description:
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
   JavaScript.

## Activity
Recent work has been around keeping up with recent changes to iOS and Android,
our most used platforms.  We continue to work towards reducing technical debt,
and 'running the business'

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Health report:

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green -
failures are usually due to external service issues that do device testing.
Our nightly builds have been extremely stable.

ASF Project Statistics gives the project a Community Health Score (Chi): 6.33
(Healthy)

We are still only seeing contributions from a small group of dedicated
individuals. This makes it harder to make large changes. All the large
corporate sponsored development has ceased, but the project continues to see
good traffic, and usage has been stable.

The cordova-cli, the base tool used for creating/building/running gets 125k
downloads a week on npm, and has been consistent for the last year.  Various
core plugins see usage in the 50-80k/wk range.

Our primary channel for helping, and hearing from users is via our #slack
community, which has ~4k users and continues to be fairly active.  There has
been some interest in also exploring github discussions.

Our online video hangouts are happening more regularly, which helps give a
sense of team despite our varied distribution, and availability. All meetings
are recorded and shared on YouTube, and we hope to get more and more interest
from the community, as well as community participation.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Curator Project  [Enrico Olivelli]

## Description:
The mission of Curator is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Java libraries that make using Apache ZooKeeper easier

## Issues:
Currently there is not much activity on the project, basically we are
following the pace of Apache ZooKeeper, as Curator is mostly a wrapper over
ZooKeeper.

We recently started a discussion about the status of the project in 2020, and
community feedback was that Curator is pretty widespread, and it works well,
so this is why there is not so much activity. Currently most of the committers
are no more working on Curator in their main job

By the way we see users asking questions on the ML and recently we received an
offer about a contribution of some important new features. This new work will
add more liveness to the project.


## Membership Data:
Apache Curator was founded 2013-09-18 (7 years ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Guacamole Project  [Mike Jumper]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Guacamole is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to providing performant, browser-based remote access

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Guacamole was founded 2017-11-14 (3 years ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carl Harris on 2017-11-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Luke on 2020-02-07.

## Project Activity:
The scope of the upcoming 1.3.0 release was finalized on 2020-09-20. The
release itself did not occur in mid-September as originally expected. Most of
the in-scope work has since been completed, and it appears likely that the
release will still be ready by year's end. Closing out those remaining issues
and preparing a first RC remains the primary focus of the project.

Recent releases:
- 1.2.0 was released on 2020-06-28.

The community is active and healthy. There is a minor lull in overall
activity, presumably due to the usual seasonal demands on individuals' time.
Users and contributors otherwise continue to be engaged and responsive on the
mailing lists and within pull requests.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

## Description

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server. Gump's intention
isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that makes people look
beyond their project's boundaries and helps the projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version control
systems. The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well as non-ASF
projects and their dependencies. It started in the Java part of the foundation
but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and OpenSSL.

## Summary

We are moving to a new VM. Apart from that, nothing has changed over the past
three months and we honestly do not anticipate changes in the foreseeable
future.

The Tomcat community is the only one still using Gump actively and the only
activity in Gump is around keeping the infrastructure alive and tweaking
things for the benefit of Tomcat builds.

We will certainly support any other project that wants to get the benefit of
the early warning system for backwards incompatible changes Gump provides, but
we are not actively recruiting projects.

## Activity

We're moving over to a new VM which wasn't as easy as we had hoped because it
involved migrating from Python 2 to Python 3 (Gump itself is written in
Python). Many thanks to Adam Jack and Mark Thomas for carrying the burden of
the migration.

## Releases

Gump has never done any releases. One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the time
following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

## Changes to the Roster

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure the ASF
installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark Thomas join
in November 2014.

Brett Porter has left the PMC in December 2019.

## Project Activity:
We are preparing for a 0.7.0 release by end of Dec 2020, which will quite
literally be our most feature packed release so far. Some highlight include:
Clustering support, built-in metadata tracking to eliminate file listings,
Flink support, insert_overwrite operation, many bug fixes/perf improvements,
nClouds training session.

Our contributors, committers, users have written a number of blogs, delivered
talks since the last report. Talks include : ApacheCon talk, PrestoDB panel
discussion @PrestoCon, QCon China, DC_THURS Session.
New blogs have been also written: Grofers' Data lake article,
towards datascience article, aws blog, nClouds blog.

All of these can be found on our site
https://hudi.apache.org/docs/powered_by.html


## Community Health:
While we think the contributor health and overall community activity is healthy,
we do acknowledge the relative downward trend in the past quarter. Absolute
numbers are good. Below we try to explain them as best as we can

On dev mailing list, dev discussions have largely happened over PRs and cWiki
pages. We have had several design discussions over cWiki RFC pages, that don't
quite get captured here.  RFC-15,18,19 which form bulk of the upcoming release
all have great amount of cWiki activity

We use GH Issues primarily as a support mechanism. So lower issues can also
be sign of users facing less problems after our 0.6.0 release. We are actively
tracking the issues almost everyday for potentially unknown issues affecting
users.

On code contributions, we have landed a lot of larger PRs this time around. So
review process as well as number of PRs have taken a dip.

Before the next report, we plan to build out an analytics pipeline using Hudi
which will help us delve deeper into root causing these numbers.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for December 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 41 podlings incubating. In November, podlings executed 
10 distinct releases. We added one new IPMC member, and none retired. There 
were two IP clearances in November. We have no new projects, although a 
couple are under discussion, including Wayang. Superset and TVM graduated 
last month and Warble was retired.

This month we were missing reports from Annotator, BRPC and Liminal. 
Annotator has reached out to the IPMC, added a new mentor and will report 
next month.

BlueMarlin report mentions an unexpected release, and they still seem to be 
having trouble operating as an Apache project. One mentor has given up on 
them due to lack of communication.

Liminal has failed to report several times, but there is ongoing activity 
in the project. It also seems they are making unapproved releases which the 
IPMC will follow up on.

There was still no response from S2Graph, and unless there any objections 
they will be retired shortly.

Weex, who was considering retirement, tried to make a release and brought 
the release to the IPMC without the needed 3 +1 votes. They were asked to 
find the needed PPMC votes. It may be that they do not have enough of an 
active PPMC to do this.

SAMOA currently has no mentors, and little or no activity and the IPMC is 
considering retiring the project.

TubeMQ is considering renaming itself to something else.

NuttX made a release that was voted on the IPMC private list as it 
contained some critical security fixes.

There was no visible progress made on MXNet issues, and this will be 
discussed at the board meeting. An active mentor retired, and a new mentor 
was added to help them.

Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases and graduations. 
There were graduation discussions around ECharts, Flagon, DataSketches and 
Goblin.

## BlueMarlin

BlueMarlin will develop a web service to add intelligence functionality to a
plain ad system.

BlueMarlin has been incubating since 2020-06-09.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. DL-based performance forecasting
  2. DL-based spend recommendation
  3. DL-based Inventory allocation

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

### How has the community developed since the last report?

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  The following features were added to predictor_dl_model:
  1. We added new features of user residency and user IPL (IP location).

  2. We added pipeline and product tags to config file. Config file has 
  placeholders to resolve the names of intermediate tables instead of 
  having user to fill them up.

  3. We pushed model-stats into Hive instead of Elasticsearch. This makes 
  the pipeline to create one set of coherent tables that are associates 
  with a pipeline run instead of having the artifacts into different
  types of data storage.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  Are things falling through the cracks? If so, please list any
  open issues that need to be addressed.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings
  name and brand? If not what actions has the PPMC taken to
  correct this? Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?

     Comments: The podling has not yet done anything on list.
     The SGA was filed late October 2020 so they are just starting.
     They do not have a repository or a web page.
     They claim in this report to have done a release but there
     is no evidence of this.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Dave Fisher - I resigned from mentoring this podling. They refuse
  to discuss activity on the mailing list. They do not communicate.
  They claim to make a release. This report is the first time we've
  heard of it.

  Justin Mclean - The issues to be resolved before graduation need
  to be ones related to the community and how Apache operates not
  functionality. I'm concerned about the release and comments by
  other mentors. There are also section in this report that are
  unanswered.
  What can be done to get this project back on track?

  Dave Fisher - There is no back. This podling has never been on
  track.

critical data in distributed data processing jobs at
very high speed.

Crail has been incubating since 2017-11-01.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Grow developers community
  2. Convincing use cases
  3. Steady release cycles

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

 No reply.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We got one new contributors. We are looking forward to see
  him applying as a committer.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  A new contributor was working in the field of adding elasticity.

  Elastic scaling is a needed pre-requisite to use Apache Crail as
  an efficient ephemeral data store for serverless frameworks.
  We expect pull requests for code integration in the coming weeks.
  With added elasticity, a new release would be due.

## Livy

Livy is web service that exposes a REST interface for managing long running
Apache Spark contexts in your cluster. With Livy, new applications can be
built on top of Apache Spark that require fine grained interaction with many
Spark contexts.

Livy has been incubating since 2017-06-05.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Start preparing towards graduation
  2.
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  Apache Livy is a stable project that is used widely in conjuction with 
  Apache Spark.
  It seems to have met its project goals and there is not much active 
  development going on as a result. 2020 may definitely not be the best
  year for community activity and Livy certainly seems to have taken a hit
  on this aspect. Seeking guidance from the IPMC/Board on what could be next
  steps for the project. Its not very active but at the same time its not a
  defunct/unused project.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: As long as there is an active PPMC with at last 3 PPMC 
  members providing oversight the project should be fine. Is anything else
  needed to graduate the project? Have you looked at the ASF maturity
  model? I am concerned that users questions are going unanswered on the
  dev list.

## Spot

Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model
and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Increase community activity in mailing list and commits
  2. Make the product more approachable for new contributors and users
  3. Develop a roadmap that focuses on delivering one use case effectively

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Not at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We're continuing to work on a roadmap with the community that will allow 
  more contributors to focus and work on different levels of the project 
  (i.e. data modeling and schema design, use-cases, ingestion, ml, ui, dev 
  ops, docs, etc).

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We've started regular weekly discussions around several topics, including 
  configuration management, authentication, and authorization models within 
  Spot so that we have a better backbone for adding more features and can 
  also backport existing functionality to a stronger foundation. These 
  discussions were delayed this quarter due to COVID and getting schedules 
  aligned relative to other workloads so we don't have any proposals 
  documented yet, but that is our next step.

## Toree

Toree provides applications with a mechanism to interactively and remotely
access Apache Spark.

Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  In my opinion, I believe Toree is one of those small but useful projects 
  that, except for being very active, would be ready to graduate. Having
  said  that, where there is an important issue or for voting new members
  and releases the PPMC show up and participate (see example of last
  committer/release thread).

  The project will likely start graduation process on the next couple 
  months.

  1. Increase active contributors 
  2. 
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Similar pattern with a few Q&A on both Gitter and mailing list.
  We also saw increased flow of questions related to Spark 3.0.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We attempted a new release, but while waiting for vote process to
  complete the Incubator release process changed and we are working
  on adapting to the new rules.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Marcel Reutegger]

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained.
 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding 
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Membership Data:

## Project Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the main development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

We continue making regular feature releases of Jackrabbit Oak. The
most recent release was Jackrabbit Oak 1.36.0 that was made available
on November 17th.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

In October the team noticed security vulnerabilities with Apache
Solr versions in use by Apache Jackrabbit Oak (CVE-2020-13941,
CVE-2019-17558, CVE-2019-2386). The updated Solr versions with the
fixes required a change of the Java version supported by the
Jackrabbit Oak maintenance releases. So far Jackrabbit Oak 1.4.x
and 1.6.x releases were able to run on Java 7 or newer. With the
upgrade of Solr, the minimum version had to be lifted to Java 8
(https://s.apache.org/t40d0). 

Beginning of December the team decided to drop support and deprecate
the 2.18 branch of Apache Jackrabbit. Users are encouraged to upgrade
to the latest stable 2.20.x version (https://s.apache.org/llfe1).

## Community Health:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
lists as well as on the various JIRA issues. 

Commit activity is moderate mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues and the desire of the individual contributors to bring
features and improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.

## Releases:

 - jackrabbit-2.12.11 was released on 2020-09-10
 - jackrabbit-oak-1.34.0 was released on 2020-09-10
 - jackrabbit-oak-1.22.5 was released on 2020-10-12

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Karaf Project  [Jean-Baptiste Onofré]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Karaf project is to provide an application
ecosystem. Apache Karaf runtime is a modulith runtime allowing to run any kind
of applications. Karaf subprojects bring additional features for this runtime
and running applications.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Karaf was founded 2010-06-16 (10 years ago)
There are currently 31 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Francois Papon on 2018-11-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Francois Papon on 2018-05-19.

## Project Activity:
Following the DevX and Spring Boot (which helped as lab), Karaf 5 roadmap
preparation is in progress with a complete PoC ongoing (we will share details
on the mailing list for Christmas). We reach an important milestone for the
project with the release of Karaf 4.3.0. It's a major update for the project.
We also did Karaf 4.2.10 which is a maintenance release for our 4.2 users.
Couple of Winegrower releases have been done as well. Now that winegrower is
used in production, we will add a dedicated section on the website (a blog
post is in preparation to explain winegrower).

To summarize, here's the releases during the period:
- Karaf 4.3.0 was released on 2020-10-30
- Karaf 4.2.10 was released on 2020-10-12
- Winegrower 1.0.1 was released on 2020-11-22

## Community Health:
We are still working closely with other communities (Camel, ServiceMix, ...).
We also proposed our help for the Apache Brooklyn community, and asked for
feedback about their Karaf use case (Brooklyn uses Karaf). We are pretty sure
Karaf 5 will be very important and strong milestone for the project, opening
Karaf to even more communities.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Anshum Gupta]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Lucene was founded 2005-01-18 (16 years ago)
There are currently 87 committers and 60 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Houston Putman was added to the PMC on 2020-11-30
- Julie Tibshirani was added as committer on 2020-11-18

## Project Activity:
The community is continuing to work on reducing the tech debt in the project,
as mentioned in the previous board reports. Several committers are actively
working on a much improved 9.0 release.

We released Apache Lucene and Solr 8.6.3 and 8.7.0 since the last report.

With 8.6.3, Solr released a bug fix to stop adding duplicate response headers
to internally proxied requests. This release also contained fix for a
regression introduced in Solr
8.6.0 that affected HTTP multipart POST requests.

The Solr 8.6.3 release also announced CVE-2020-13957.

Lucene 8.7.0 released various improvements including better compression of
stored fields and faster sorting by field. This release also significantly
improves indexing speed in certain cases.

Solr 8.7.0 introduced various features and improvements including the circuit
breaker infrastructure along with JVM and CPU based breakers that improve
uptime by rejecting incoming search requests based on JVM heap and CPU usage.

As part of restructuring of the codebase, the community intends to move
towards the model of having multiple repositories with different release
cadence. This will allow the community to offer official modules with
different release cadence.

A code contribution from Bloomberg for the Solr Operator is currently being
worked on as SOLR-14994. The grant was accepted after a discussion both,
within the PMC as well as the wider community. This would allow Solr users to
converge on the operating process when running Solr on Kubernetes.


## Community Health:
Our developer as well as user lists had reduced activity the past quarter. Our
user list had an avg. decrease of ~35% while our developer list dropped by
26%. This could be most likely due to the current pandemic as well as due to
the holiday season.

Despite a significant drop in the number of commits, which was most likely due
to the heavy commits on a feature branch reducing, we had a 21% increase in
code contributors the past quarter and the Github PR activity stayed almost
steady.

We are also waiting for the 9.0 release that uses Gradle to move forward with
the creation of Apache Solr TLP, the vote for which passed a few quarters ago.

- Jens Melgaard was added as committer on 2020-10-20

## Project Activity:

Progress:
- Several user-reported bug fixes
- 44 PRs were submitted including some new website features and performance
  improvements to Lucene.NET
- We set up a nightly build
- We are continuing to expand testing adding x86 and .NET 5.0 targets
- We set up GitHub Actions to automatically run tests when PRs are submitted

We have also been steadily improving performance, refactoring APIs to be more
.NET-like than Java-like, and expanding testing.

Recent releases:
- Apache-Lucene.Net-4.8.0-beta00013 was released on 2020-11-16.
- Apache-Lucene.Net-4.8.0-beta00012 was released on 2020-09-19.
- Apache-Lucene.Net-4.8.0-beta00011 was released on 2020-07-24.

## Community Health:

Since our move to GitHub Issues, we are now getting bug reports that have been
long underreported. This new collaboration channel with end users is helping
us zero in on bugs, and is also helping to drive some PR activity from
contributors. There was some additional PR activity through our participation
in Hacktoberfest this quarter.

However, we are seeing less activity on the mailing lists due to the fact
collaborators generally contact us directly through GitHub Issues.

- dev@lucenenet.apache.org had a 86% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (411 emails compared to 220)
- user@lucenenet.apache.org had a 64% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (4 emails compared to 11)
- 258 commits in the past quarter (-18% decrease)

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gordon King]

Description: Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable
object-oriented programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. It
comes up with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code complexity,
avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing next generation
computing platforms. Mnemonic makes the storing and transmitting of massive
linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient. The performance tuning could
also be mostly converged to a single point of tuning place if based on
Mnemonic to process and analyze linked objects. The programmer is able to
focus on the durable object oriented business logic instead of worrying about
how to normalize/join, SerDe(un)marshal, cache and store their linked business
objects with arbitrary complexity.

Issues: There is a roll call to decide to retire this project, but it has been
supported by several contributors, so we decided to reboot it.

Activity: In this period of reporting (since Nov. 11, 2020) , 11 of tickets
have been created and 6 resolved, basically, we are working on migrating Maven
build to Gradle for efficiency and flexibility. Some technical challenges have
been well addressed and merged. Our community has held several regular
meetings every 2 weeks, the agenda mainly covered the following topics
- Gradle migration
- New PMC roles, responsibilities and actions
- Development workflow guidance
- Issues evaluation
- Tracking the release plan

Health Report: Our community and PMCs are working together on Gradle migration
and pushing the new release of Mnemonic, we are closely tracking the progress
of project and community activities. New PMCs are actively contributing and
participating in the project. The release plan got closely tracked and will
get updated according to the actual progress of project.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - 3 PMC joined in Oct. 2020.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 19 committers (corrected according to whimsy).
 - 3 same committers joined in Oct. 2020.

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.12.0 on Sep. 04 2018
 - Still active development on next major version (0.13)

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Pig Project  [Koji Noguchi]

## Description:
Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets on Hadoop.  It provides
a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with
infrastructure for evaluating these programs.

## Issues:
From previous quarter's report
> Still no 0.18 release. Got PIG-5253(Pig Hadoop 3 support) reviewed
> and ready to be committed. May require a bit more testing.
> Other remaining tasks include updating the dependent jars from
> owasp reports and cleaning up the unit&e2e test failures
> especially for pig-on-spark.
>
So sorry to report that we haven't been able to accomplish any of the above.
We will try to finish this by the next report.

## Membership Data:
Apache Pig was founded 2010-09-21 (10 years ago)
There are currently 31 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Koji Noguchi on 2016-08-04.
- No new committers. Last addition was Nándor Kollár on 2018-09-06.

## Project Activity:
Very low.  We need to work for 0.18 release.
(Last 0.17.0 release was on 2017/06/16. )


## Community Health:
Overall activity is low as the project is mostly stable and contributions are
mainly bug fixes. And with covid, activity has become even lower as people have
less free time but we are hoping to get into better shape next year.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Lee Whitcomb]

## Description
The mission of Pivot is the creation and maintenance of software related
to Rich Internet applications in Java

## Issues
Very little activity, but no issues arose this quarter. Three PMC members
are still available to vote, and some small amount of development toward
what is likely to be a final release is still ongoing.

## Membership Data
Apache Pivot was founded on 2009-12-15 (11 years ago).
There are currently 10 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

## Community Changes Past Quarter
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Niclas Hedhman on 2016-01-13.
- No new committers. Last addition was Niclas Hedhman on 2020-02-05.

## Project Release Activity
- The planned 2.1 release for the end of 2020 will likely now be Q1
  or Q2 of 2021.
- 2.0.5 was released on 2017-07-04.
- 2.0.4 was released on 2014-05-19.
- 2.0.3 was released on 2013-08-01.

## Project Activity
There was no mailing list activity this last quarter, and no commits
or issues changed. Some development activity continued in the
background, but without commits yet.

## Community Health
The same as the last several years, there is no visible community,
except for the one developer / PMC chair who is still doing work.
The Attic seems inevitable once the hoped for and planned 2.1
release is done.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache PLC4X Project  [Christofer Dutz]

## Description:

The mission of the Apache PLC4X project is creating a set of libraries for 
communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a 
variety of protocols but with a shared API.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

Apache PLC4X was founded 2019-04-17 (2 years ago)
There are currently 18 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.

- Stefano Bossi was added as committer on 2020-09-07
- Ben Hutcheson was added as committer on 2020-09-26

## Project Activity:

The project has invested a lot of time and effort into streamlining the Java
version of our drivers, especially regarding shared datatypes. Also a lot was
invested in testing and fixing issues reported by the community.

While we did see quite some reduced community activity in the last reporting
quarter, this time we can report a lot of initiatives have been worked on by the
community:

- PLC4Py
- PLC4Go
- A new CAN driver
- OPC-UA Server
- Refreshed Kafka Connect adapter
- Updated Connection Pool

A large group of the community is working on porting PLC4X to the language
Python. We have added a first successful port of the KNX and Modbus drivers to
Go and work has just begun porting things to C# and .Net.

Promotion-Wise we have also tried to take advantage of what virtual meetups
allow us and have participated in a number of virtual conferences and
webinars. Some of us have reached out to some of the biggest IoT meetups and
asked them if there was interest in a PLC4X talk.

- ApacheCon@Home 2020 (4 Talks about or partly about PLC4X)
- LIBRECON
- HiveMQ Webinar

For December he have planned the following

- "100 Orte virtuell erleben! beim FZI"
- Eclipse IoT Meetup
- Eclipse IoT Working Group presentation

Right now we're working hard on finishing some last work and are hoping to
initiate the release of version 0.8.0 within the next week or so.

## Community Health:

Right now we are very happy with the state of the community.

In order to help with onboarding and keeping the community engaged, we started
monthly community-calls via Zoom. Where we don't have an agenda, but can do
some hands-on help and mentoring and sort of hang our together.

- dev@plc4x.apache.org had a 17% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (424 emails compared to 505)
- issues@plc4x.apache.org had a 49% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (115 emails compared to 222)
- 13 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-67% decrease)
- 9 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-66% decrease)
- 466 commits in the past quarter (63% increase)
- 9 code contributors in the past quarter (-30% decrease)
- 23 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (4% increase)
- 25 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (56% increase)
- 260 Stars on GitHub (up by 35)
- 122 Forks on GitHub (must have missed this number last time :-/)
- 393 Twitter Followers (up by 20)

The decrease of email communication shouldn't worry us, as most gossip and
chatter has moved to our slack channel. If important things are discussed
there, we usually write up a summary and post that to the list.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and 
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface 
to underlying platform-specific implementations. The primary goal is to provide 
an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if 
not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is 
built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work 
around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.

## Issues:
No issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) was founded 2000-12-01 (20 years ago)
There are currently 68 committers and 43 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2020-08-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2020-08-29.

## Project Activity:
The project has again been quiet, with small amounts of activity concentrated
on matters of technical detail in two areas: build toolchains and Windows
platform esoterica.

No release since 1.7.0 (April 2019), nor is a new release imminent.  In the
absence of a major bug or security issue, the most likely trigger for a new
1.7 release is to resolve glitches reported with new/updated toolchains
including Xcode 12 (Mac) and autoconf 2.69/2.70 (Gnu).

## Community Health
The community remains stable, with ASF projects using APR always a prime
focus. As is often the case with APR, there has been no proactive effort,
but we are responsive to questions and issues raised by users.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Piotr Zarzycki]

## Description:
Apache Royale implements the principles of Apache Flex to support development
of applications designed for JavaScript instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes.
Apache Royale improves developer productivity in creating applications to run
wherever JavaScript runs, including on browsers, in Apache Cordova
applications, on Node, and on other platforms.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## RELEASES:

Apache Royale 0.9.4 was released on November 14 2018
Apache Royale 0.9.6 was released on October 1 2019
Apache Royale 0.9.7 was released on May 13 2020

Apache Royale was founded 2017-09-20 (3 years ago)
There are currently 19 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Hugo Ferreira became a committer on 5 October 2020.
- Christofer Dutz became a committer on 4 September 2020.

## Project Activity:
The Royale team offered four presentations at ApacheCon 2020. They are now
available as YouTube videos on the Apache channel.

We have done more work on stability over recent months, particularly for the
Jewel UI set, which we see more users adopting. We have continued expanding
documentation to cover all classes and components for Jewel. We are extending
documentation of compiler options that make it possible to reduce the size of
a compiled application.

Work toward the release of version 0.9.8 of the SDK is under way.

We had a lot of activity on social networks, sharing what is happening in
Apache Royale as we progress in the project. We think it is important to do
this so people outside the project and not following it on a daily basis can
get a notion of how we are doing. The numbers are:

- Our Twitter account has 697 (previously 677) followers. 
- Our Facebook page has 170 (previously 162) likes. 
- Our LinkedIn Group has 153 (previously 140) people. 
- Our StackOVerFlow "apache-royale" tag currently has 58 (previously 56)
questions. 
- Our Slack channel, "royale", in the-asf.slack.com workspace, makes
quick team consultations more convenient.

## Community Health:

We have been working intensively with several users who want to port existing
applications from Flex to Apache Royale. Each migrating application brings
specific challenges; as we answer those challenges, we make Royale stronger
and more useful to all users.

## Mailing list activity:
- users@royale.apache.org: 273 emails compared to 277 in the previous quarter
- dev@royale.apache.org: 781 emails compared to 857 in the previous quarter

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache SINGA Project  [Wang Wei]

## Description:
The mission of Apache SINGA is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a distributed deep learning platform

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Chris Yeung on 2020-04-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Zhang Zhaoqi on 2020-07-01.

## Project Activity:
The community has released SINGA version 3.1.0 on 30th October 2020.

The main features of this release include:
1. Update Tensor core module to support tensor transformation (reshape,
  transpose) for tensors up to 6 dimensions.
2. Add new tensor operators into the autograd module.
3. Reconstruct sonnx to support creating ONNX operators from both layer and
  autograd.
4. Replace the Travis CI with Github workflow. Add quality and coverage
  management.
5. Add compiling and packaging scripts to create wheel packages for
  distribution.

Apart from this release, the community has been working on:
1. Supporting half-precision floating-point format (fp16) in deep learning
  models and computational kernels.
2. Adding more SINGA onnx models to cover a wider spectrum of practical
  applications.
3. Looking for the best option to enable GPU unit tests on all the submitted PRs
  using Github actions workflow. The current Github test server doesn't
  provide a GPU to run the CUDA unit tests, so we are going to evaluate the
  self-host runner option.

## Community Health:
According to the statistic, there are 67 PRs opened and 87 PRs closed on
GitHub in the past quarter. It indicates that the community is active in the
development. Also, according to the statistic there is 33% increase of code
contributors, which may indicate that more people are interested in the
development of SINGA.

of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running our rule update infrastructure and
our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

SpamAssassin 3.4.4 was released on 28 January, 2020. It was primarily a
security release, fixing two CVEs, all then known outstanding open security
issues on the project.

Release of SpamAssassin 3.4.5 is imminent, fixing a subsequently reported CVE
level security issue.  3.4.5 Pre-Release 1 was built on June 21, 2020.

We intend to return our primary focus to development of version 4.0.0.  A
Pre-Release 1 of 4.0.0 is planned.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Unomi Project  [Serge Huber]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Unomi is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to providing a reference implementation of the OASIS Customer Data Platform 
specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical 
Committee

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Unomi was founded 2019-02-20 (2 years ago) There are currently 12
committers and 6 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was David Griffon on 2019-02-20.
- No new committers. Last addition was Taybou on 2019-04-01.

We have two new committers that have been voted in but not yet processed, and
also one PMC member that needs processing. Our work on the security releases
had to be completed urgently so this is still undergoing.

## Project Activity:
We've had 3 releases this month, mostly minor releases but very important ones
since they addressed some serious security issues and bugs. The security issue
was a critical remote code injection problem that needed some changes to the
way scripting is handled because OGNL was used and researchers found similar
issues to what Apache Struts has had. Fixing this required lots of changes
that introduced problems that required two more releases to fix completely.
The releases also include lots of contributions by new community members.

## Community Health:

The community is clearly growing. We now have over 111 users in the Slack
channel. Most users prefer this mean of communication to mailing lists, which
is reflected by the lower activity there. Of course as usually all decisions
and proposals stay on the mailing lists.

As a PMC chair I must say I am very happy about the way the community is
growing, it was a little slow on the uptake initially but clearly the project
is gaining more/new users. Can't wait to see what's next :)

Here are some stats (could we get some Slack stats somehow ?)

- dev@unomi.apache.org had a 49% increase in traffic in the past 
  quarter (482 emails compared to 323)
- users@unomi.apache.org had a 57% increase in traffic in the past 
  quarter (11 emails compared to 7)
- 29 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (31% increase)
- 22 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (69% increase)
- 94 commits in the past quarter (67% increase)
- 11 code contributors in the past quarter (22% increase)
- 33 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (22% increase)
- 35 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (40% increase)

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Allen Wittenauer]

## Description:
The mission of Yetus is a collection of libraries and tools that enable
contribution and release processes for software projects

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Yetus was founded 2015-09-15 (5 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-12-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-02-06.

## Project Activity:
The Apache Yetus 0.13.0 release was cut on 2020-11-27 and announced as
official on 2020-12-06.  It is by far the release with the most
JIRA issues and code changes since project inception.  While there
are significant features added, there was also a lot of code removed
and documentation enhancements as we push towards making the project
easier to use and adopt.  Part of that work included working with Legal
on LEGAL-537 which codifies our intent to publish a GitHub Action into the
GitHub Marketplace--a first for an ASF project.  (At the moment we are
prevented from publishing on the Marketplace as it looks like the agreement
needs to get re-signed, but we are unsure as to why.  Not an issue for
the board; just an FYI if you go looking for the Github Action in 
the Marketplace and isn't there yet.  :) )

With the publishing of the GitHub Action, we will almost certainly need
to get closer to the projects original founding goal of quarterly
releases. A lot of work was put into this release to speed up the release
process, so we will hopefully see that work pay off.

## Community Health:
As usual during a release effort, metrics pick up substantially:

* dev@yetus.apache.org had a 112% increase in traffic in the past quarter (53
  emails compared to 25):
* 91 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (333% increase)
* 94 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (308% increase)
* 128 commits in the past quarter (753% increase)
* 99 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (518% increase)
* 99 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (607% increase)

The only bad part is that most of the heavy lifting is still being done
by a small group of people:

* 4 code contributors in the past quarter (no change)
