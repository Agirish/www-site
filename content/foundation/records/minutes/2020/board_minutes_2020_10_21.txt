 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       Congratulations to the Conferences team for an incredibly
       successful first run of ApacheCon @Home! Please see Rich Bowen's
       report under Conferences (Attachment 5) for the details.

       I have nothing new to report. I do have a number of action items
       (actual and implied) that are beginning to pile up:

         1) prepare a notice for the members regarding the bylaws
            amendment approved last month so that the formal approval
            clock can commence;

         2) work on the binary release policy;

         3) find a way to make use of our github repo to assist with
            collaborative writing of ASF documentation and provide a
            place for meaningful tracking of board issues that is better
            than my officer's report.

    B. President [David]

       I attended ApacheCon@Home and gave a keynote presentation.

       It's been and remains a busy month. 

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       As previously announced, we will no longer provide full financial
       reporting within every board report.  Full financial reporting will
       still be available to the public as part of our quarterly and annual
       reports, the most recent of which can be found here:
       https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-operations10

       Monthly reports will still be provided to the board.  With this
       adjustment, we hope to make the treasurer’s office easier to fill for
       current and future volunteers.

       We are evaluating virtualizing some of our credit card expenditures. 
       Some of our officers need a physical card some of the time.  But
       officers who use a card for online purchases, may benefit from more
       flexibility, better protection against mistaken and fraudulent credit
       card charges, and better tracking of expenses against budget items
       through some of the current offers.

       We have adjusted the accounting of the Pineapple fund donation of
       $893K made in January 2018.  Previously this was a board restricted
       fund; we are now recognizing it as unrestricted funds.  This change
       makes a massive difference in our calculated operating reserves, and
       other key indicators.  These will now have to be footnoted so as to
       prevent misleading.  However the original donation was provided
       without restrictions; these funds were available to the board since
       the time of their donation to apply to appropriate uses within our
       organization.  So, while this represents an accounting adjustment, it
       does not have an impact on our underlying financial situation.

       I remain pleased with the officers’ execution in holding down costs
       and using foundation funds effectively to fulfill our mission. 
       Because of these efforts, our organization is well able to withstand a
       long economic downturn.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In September, the secretary received 53 ICLAs, 2 CCLAs, and 2 CoI
       affirmations.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       By all measures, the first virtual ApacheCon was a huge success. Many
       of our sponsors were arguably more involved than they are at in-person
       events! We also learned a lot, which is useful, as I anticipate next
       year's ApacheCon being virtual as well. The platform was a constantly
       moving target, as it's fairly new, and they're regularly adding new
       features. While sometimes frustrating, the up side is that we were
       able to provide sponsors with some event data that we didn't expect to
       be able to offer initially. Their feedback has been really positive,
       and I'm excited for all the first-time attendees we had as well.

       Details are in the VP Conferences report.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Mnemonic is rebooting

       After an unsuccessful PMC roll call, the community discussed how to
       continue. With an unresponsive PMC, community members discussed
       rebooting the project with the addition of three new PMC members.
       There was NOTICE sent to the board regarding these three proposed
       members. Craig suggests that we allow this process to continue but
       ask that the project also remove unresponsive PMC members.

       @Craig: ensure Mnemonic PMC roster is updated and pursue monthly
       reports for next three months

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Roy: work on binary release policy
          [ Unfinished Business 2020-05-20 ]
          Status: Stalled

    * Sander: work on guidelines for PMCs to request CI resources
          [ Unfinished Business 2020-05-20 ]
          Status: Stalled. The main observation is that there are mechanisms in
                  place to support CI needs for projects. The main deficiency at
                  this point seems to be in documentation; one place where one
                  can find all options available, level of support, and how to
                  add compute resources beyond what is available to the ASF.

    * Justin: pursue a roll call
          [ Drill 2020-08-19 ]
          Status: Done. Still have more than 3 PMC members providing oversight.

    * Roy: pursue a roll call for Any23
          [ Any23 2020-09-16 ]
          Status: Done. lewismc initiated a roll call in response to the board
                  comments and the project continues (see Any23 report)

    * Roy: follow up about resolution for Attic for Marmotta
          [ Marmotta 2020-09-16 ]
          Status: Done.

    * Sander: pursue a roll call for OODT
          [ OODT 2020-09-16 ]
          Status: Not done: the project is self-aware in its report and mentions
                  a roll call 6 months ago. The archive confirms this, and
                  showed 8 PMC members responsive.
                  While there is lack of activity on the dev@, I do not believe
                  there is an oversight issue here. I propose we suggest the
                  option of the Attic if activity remains at the same level at
                  next report.

    * Roy: follow up with OCW about formal expectations and roll call
          [ Open Climate Workbench 2020-09-16 ]
          Status: Done.

10. Unfinished Business

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsor status: we are working on renewals for three Platinum
Sponsors, four Gold Sponsors, two Silver Sponsors, and five Bronze Sponsors.
We have approached a corporate donor (one-time cash donation, valued above
the Gold Sponsorship level) for possible repeat donation. We have signed on
two new Bronze Sponsors, and have confirmed renewal of one Bronze Sponsor. We
have received payment for a Platinum renewal, and are processing payment for
one Silver Sponsor.

2) Targeted sponsor status: a Silver Targeted Sponsor upgraded to Platinum,
which supports ASF Infrastructure. We are considering approaching a Targeted
Bronze Sponsorship that was donated in support of an Apache Project for
possible renewal.

3) Sponsor Relations: Sponsor outreach, engagement, and communication
continue. We promoted ApacheCon@Home sponsorship opportunities and other ASF
activities. We had discussions with two Sponsors, one of which requested our
assistance with a request from a PMC. One of our official points-of-contact
is on leave, and we have been in semi-regular contact with them. Another
point-of-contact has left their organization and we’re on-boarding their
replacement.

4) Event Sponsorship: we have successfully processed all 11 ApacheCon@Home
sponsorships. Payments for all are nearly complete.

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $6,200 total
during September over 45 donations, which includes a Platinum Sponsor for
ApacheCon@Home. We have resolved an issue pertaining to a fraudulent charge
that took place in August. We are also preparing for this year’s Giving
Tuesday event, which is taking place 1 December 2020.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: all vendor payments are up-to-date.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support day-to-day
activities within ASF Fundraising, including outreach to new candidate
sponsors, coordinating and carrying a Sponsor request to a PMC, and
responding to ASF Sponsor queries regarding publicity opportunities with
ApacheCon. ASF Conference promotions ran through the conclusion of
ApacheCon@Home early October, and will continue as post-event materials are
released. We issued the September Month In Review
https://s.apache.org/Sep2020 , published Part I of the "Inside Infra"
interview with Daniel Gruno https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Daniel1 , and
are preparing to publish Part II shortly. We assisted with preparing and
providing metrics for an executive keynote presentation for the COSCON
conference in China. We responded to two queries regarding the history of our
name "Apache", and published a brief at http://apache.org/apache-name/ . We
prepared the first FY2021 quarterly report, but have yet to publish due to
some delayed submissions. We continue to make adjustments to the apache.org
master style templates and homepage.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 23 September: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® IoTDB™ as a
   Top-Level Project https://s.apache.org/3xv3c
 - 21 September: The Apache® Software Foundation Welcomes its Global
   Community Online at ApacheCon@Home https://s.apache.org/74zbx
 - 21 September: ApacheCon 2020 features Natural Language Processing for
   Electronic Medical Records in dedicated track on Apache cTAKES
   https://s.apache.org/x1051

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 7 items on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog, including 4 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 337
news summaries published to date. 2 posts were published on the "Conferences"
Blog. We tweeted 3  8 items to 58.1K followers on Twitter (29 of which were
promoting ApacheCon), and posted 54 items to 44.1K  followers on LinkedIn
that garnered more than 118.3K organic impressions. The ASF's YouTube channel
had 9,178 views this month, and 7,451 total subscribers to date.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are on hold, with 2 draft
announcements archived due to PMC inactivity. Projects planning to graduate
from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major project
milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?" highlights, and
"Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 5 media queries. The ASF and Apache
Projects have received a total of 3,520 press hits vs. last month’s 2,396.
ApacheCon received 113 press hits. We are planning to revise our clipping
report parameters for more accurate and inclusive results.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst requests. Apache was
mentioned in a total of 19 reports by Gartner, Forrester, 451 Research, and
IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team continues to tweak and publish
updates to the apache.org homepage and master template. We continue to work
with ASF Infrastructure on their content project across apache.org and are
preparing for their migration from the current CMS. We created 22 social
media promotional banners for ApacheCon. We will be reaching out to Apache
projects and invite those seeking creative assistance to do so using our new
intake form and process. The Editorial team continues to help with drafting
and publishing Weekly News Round-ups and Month-in-Review summaries.

IX. Events liaison: we are scaling down promotions for ApacheCon@Home, as the
event has ended, and will update as post-event materials become available. We
were approached by two organizations seeking cross-promotion with ApacheCon,
which we forwarded to ApacheCon@Home co-chairs for consideration.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: We will be changing primary ownership of
our accounts from HALO Worldwide to the ASF to phase out billing
pass-throughs from HALO Worldwide.

XI. Miscellany: In addition to reviewing and counseling organizations on
their promotions that highlight their relationships with specific Apache
projects, we are vetting press releases, blog posts, bylined articles,
educational videos, as well as Apache project event promotion by companies
holding/organizing the events. Sally was asked for advice by an ASF Sponsor
regarding community participation and was also approached by two groups
seeking to partner with the ASF to endorse their programs.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- "Attended" ApacheCon@Home so the staff could meet with the
  community, and they could meet us.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Continue some improvements on our DNS systems for initial project
  setup, to better-manage retired projects and podlings, and AWS R53.
- Stand up GitBox v2.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Get all projects off of the deprecated CMS service.

General Activity
================
- Jenkins' server had some bad RAM, so we had to move it
  unexpectedly. Thanks to our work with Puppet, this happened
  easily and quickly.
- Some projects have started with their migrations off of the CMS, and
  providing feedback on our migration documentation.
- Project and Infra VMs are continuing their migrations to Puppet v6
  and Ubuntu 20.04. The spam servers we had in PNAP have moved over to
  Hetzner, which freed up lots of space for projects VMs within PNAP.
- We stood up a new TLP server on v6/20.04. The other two TLP servers
  are on p3 and 16.04.
- Finally decommissioned the Fisheye service (unused).
- Lots of Jenkins work with upgrades, the move, adding more donated
  nodes to our various masters.
- GitBox is on an old p3/16.04 VM that needs to be migrated. We are
  doing this a piece at a time, to ensure that we don't break this
  critical service. Some redesign is occuring, so we call this v2.
- Documentation work continues, include a new "Infra 101". Andrew has
  been working with M&PR and Central Services to assist with the ASF's
  main website.
- Initial testing has started a shared 2FA solution for role accounts.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

## ApacheCon @Home 2020, Sept 29 - Oct 1

The main event in the past month was, of course, ApacheCon @Home 2020,
which we ran online - our first virtual conference. Overall, and by
all measures, we believe this event was a big success. We wrote more
about this here: 
https://blogs.apache.org/conferences/entry/apachecon-home-2020-was-a

We had 5743 registrations, of which 3348 actually attended some
portion of the event. (58.3%) Attendance was split fairly evenly
between North America, Europe, and Asia, with other parts of the world
being less well represented. However, we had more attendance from
Africa and South America than we have seen in the past.

The virtual platform gave us access to a new audience, as well as new
speakers, who would never travel to an in-person event.

66.7% of speakers who responded to the speaker survey reported that
this was their first ApacheCon presentation.

82.9% of attendees reported that this was their first ApacheCon.

One of the major stated goals of ApacheCon is community building, and
this event clearly brought in more of a global community than we have
seen at our events before.

All sessions were recorded, and we are in the process of uploading all
of that content to YouTube. As of this writing, all plenary sessions
have been uploaded. By meeting time, we expect most sessions to be
uploaded. They will be organized in per-track playlists, for easier
promotion by our various project communities. Videos will appear at 
https://www.youtube.com/theapachefoundation

A huge thank you goes to the track chairs, without whom this would
have been completely impossible:

Apache@China (Mandarin Track): Sheng Wu
Flagon: Joshua C. Poore (The Flagon track ended up being canceled, but
Joshua put in all the work anyway.)

Big thanks also go to:

Ruth Suehle, who handled most of the sponsor interactions, but also
helped enormously with the situation with the New Orleans Sheraton
earlier in the year, which, in turn, made this event possible.

Brian Proffitt, who helped with a ton of the back-end stuff, including
keeing the Hopin.to platform in sync with our schedule spreadsheets,
chasing down unresponsive speakers, managing our social media
feeds, and speaker training/support during the event itself.

Sam Ruby, who wrote handy scripts that converted between data formats,
to convert our schedule pages into actual calendar (ics) files.

## Lessons learned

While there were, of course, some technical challenges, the platform
performed well for most speakers and attendees. The platform vendors
have been very responsive to our feedback, and we anticipate
enhancements which will make any future events even better.

That said, doing an event of this scale - 24+ session tracks, and two
timezone blocks - had some significant challenges. Discussions around
how we might handle future events are already ongoing. Possibly doing
more regional-specific events, rather than trying to cover the whole
world at once, would result in better speaker/attendee experience. For
example, we had some speakers giving talks at 2 or 3am local time, and
of course many attendees could not see the content they were
interested in, because it was similarly timed for their local time
zone.

We are also watching other events with online models, and how they are
addressing these similar problems, without simply being a YouTube
playlist without any kind of interaction.

## 2021 and beyond.

Our contract with the conference platform vendor is for a whole year,
and so we are looking at ways to take advantage of that investment. We
would like to do smaller (smaller attendance, smaller range of topics,
smaller number of sessions) events in the coming months, and will be
reaching out to projects soon, once this event is completely put to
bed. We believe that this will be more manageable, and thus give
better experience to speakers and attendees, while also being more
attractive to sponsors, if we choose to make these sponsored events.

We currently do not anticipate doing any in-person events in 2021, but
continue to watch the travel policies at large tech companies, and use
that as a guide on whether in-person events make sense.

As we (hopefully) return to in-person events in 2022, we will be
investigating what a hybrid model looks like, maintaining the best of
both worlds, while still controlling costs.

We welcome your input into these conversations, on the
planners@apachecon.com mailing list.

## Pulsar Summit

The first post-ApacheCon event to use the Hopin.to event platform is
Pulsar Summit, which will be held November 28-29, 2020, and further
information is at https://pulsar-summit.org/en/event/asia-2020

## COSCon and Apache China Roadshow

The Apache China Roadshow will be held October 24-25, as part of
COSCon 2020. Further details are available at

Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

One more pretty uneventful month: we've had a regular amount of usual requests
flowing through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Committee members took good care
of resolving most of these in time. We're steady at 29 unresolved issues this
month.

The only three things worth noting are LEGAL-516, GitHub Actions and a final
commitment from DLAPiper to a timeline for review of our bylaws.

LEGAL-516 which has been dragging for way too long and at this point it feels
like stalling. I think we're past the point where we can expect NVIDIA to come
back and do the right things. My recommendation to the IPMC and board is to
declare a firm deadline (perhaps next board meeting) by which we will have a
ruling on how to proceed.

GitHub Actions AKA LEGAL-537 is an exciting new development where we entered
into an agreement with GitHub that allows a much more immediate consumption of
ASF software through GitHub Actions mechanism.

Finally, DLAPiper is now committed to do a final bylaws review by the November
board meeting deadline. Mark's availability was sadly affected by the
California wildfires in the month of Sep and early October.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Michael Wall]

## Description:
The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust, scalable,
high performance data storage system that features cell-based access control
and customizable server-side processing. It is based on Google's BigTable
design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift.

## Issues:
We continue to track the redirect or shutdown of http://www.accumulodata.com. 
The owner is still trying to reach an actual person at Amazon to figure out the
appropriate account that was used and reactivate it.

## Membership Data:
Apache Accumulo was founded 2012-03-20 (9 years ago)
There are currently 37 committers and 37 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Arvind Shyamsundar on 2020-04-15.
- No new committers. Last addition was Arvind Shyamsundar on 2020-04-16.


## Project Activity:
- We completed our rename of our git branch to 'main' [2] and have begun
making changes to transition away from other potentially harmfully terminology
such as renaming out 'master' component to 'manager' [3].  This effort will
take some time and potentially several releases to complete.
- Apache Accumulo 1.10 was completed, our first LTM or Long Term Maintenance
release [4].

## Community Health:
- Christopher Tubbs updated all our projects [5] with the tag #hacktober to 
increase community participation as part of Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest [6].
Hard to track actual metrics as a result of this change, but we have added 5 
new contributors since the last report and 2 in the past week [7].
- Mailing list particpation and github issues are at least consistent, perhaps
slightly increased.

The mission of Apache Airavata is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to executing and managing computational jobs on distributed computing 
resources including local clusters, supercomputers, national grids, academic 
and commercial clouds.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Airavata was founded 2012-09-18 (8 years ago)
There are currently 41 committers and 25 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Sudhakar Pamidighantam on 2019-12-19.

## Project Activity:
Our last release was in March 2019. We moved the reference implementation from
PHP to Python and re-organized the codebase into smaller chunks for
manageability. We are still behind on this one-time revamping of the release
process. As a community, we will make this a high priority goal for next
quarter.

## Community Health:
The community is doing well, the complex components of Airavata, the security
and file management have broken down into manageable repos and are attracting
contributions. The next step is to pull together all components towards
releasable artifacts.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Any23 is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to automatic crawling, parsing, analyzing, producing, validating and converting 
RDF (Resource Description Framework) data

## Issues:
Board feedback as of September 2020 was that the project required a rollcall.
This was initiated by the project with parallel threads on user@ and dev@.
The results indicate that the project community is healthy and that there is 
enough interest in Any23 to continue the project. The threads can be found at
https://s.apache.org/ydold and https://s.apache.org/y4zfd

## Membership Data:
Apache Any23 was founded 2012-08-27 (8 years ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Hans Brende on 2018-02-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Hans Brende on 2018-02-21.

## Project Activity:
Any23 2.4 was released on 2020-10-06. This is the first release for Any23 in 
over a year and fixed 39 issues. The release was previously blocked by some
Spotbugs issues but these were non-blocking and we decided to release.

## Community Health:
Some positive input from the community on user@ demonstrated that Any23 is 
in use and that it is worthwhile maintaining the project even if this means 
low activity.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Christian Schneider]

## Description:
Apache Aries software is a set of pluggable Java components enabling an 
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

## Issues:
- the project is blocked in migration from Apache CMS
- no other issues exist

## Membership Data:
Apache Aries was founded 2010-12-14 (10 years ago)
There are currently 58 committers and 41 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carlos Sierra Andrés on 2018-07-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Romain Manni-Bucau on 2020-01-29.

## Project Activity:
- a new sub-component `aries-typedevent` implementing the upcoming R8
  *OSGi Typed Event Service Specification* has started
- aries-rsa-1.15.0 is under vote.
- cdi-1.1.2 release is coming shortly.
- spifly-1.3.1 was released on 2020-10-15.
- jax-rs-whiteboard-1.0.10 was released on 2020-10-05.
- spifly-1.3.0 was released on 2020-05-28.

## Community Health:
- defects that are being reported are being handled quickly and efficiently
  over the past while.
- the reduction in commits is due to switch from dev of new sub-components
  toward more maintenance of said components
- an effort started to migrate the site from the old CMS to some new option
  (the selected option was "Antora".) The work was started but because the
   option is not well known and seems to involve a fairly complex setup we've
   hit a sort of roadblock and some uncertainty about direction to take
   (however the community agrees Aries really needs a new site) This is
    presently our biggest challenge
- the large number of sub-components and lack of good website/structured
  information is making it hard to produce a cohesive view of the activities
  and I feel this contributes to poor awareness/interest
- project traffic is low but respectable otherwise and most queries from
  community are answered.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Arrow is the creation and maintenance of software
related to columnar in-memory processing and data interchange

## Issues:
There are no issues needing board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Arrow was founded 2016-01-19 (5 years ago) There are currently 53
committers and 30 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Francois Saint-Jacques on 2020-03-04.
- Jorge Leitão was added as committer on 2020-09-29

## Project Activity:
The project has good activity with between five and ten commits most days. Dev
email list activity was down in August and September (~50% over earlier in the
year) but some of that is likely due to all the energy leading up to the 1.0
release. We should continue to monitor the mail trends to see if there are any
systemic changes or concerns.

## Community Health:
Github actions have substantially relieved the CI pain within the project.
Arrow continues to see a diverse set of contributions with the total number of
code contributors approaching 500. The project decided to move to a rotating
PMC chair, with the first rotation planned for this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Sean Busbey]

## Description:
Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

Our prior report received a question about the compliance of our CPAN
artifacts with foundation Release Policy. As far as the community is aware the
convenience artifacts are properly following policy. See discussion from the
dev@avro list subject line "ASF policy check on CPAN published artifacts"
(https://s.apache.org/g3erx). Specific concerns are welcome on the dev list.

## Membership Data:
Apache Avro was founded 2010-04-20 (10 years ago)
There are currently 34 committers and 24 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Ryan Skraba was added to the PMC on 2020-09-14
- No new committers. Last addition was Kengo Seki on 2020-07-08.

## Project Activity:
Our last release was Apache Avro 1.10.0 on 2020-06-29.

Since the last report the community has reached a consensus position to drop
Python 2 support in an upcoming major release. (https://s.apache.org/129n1)

Since the last report the community has accomplished a number of build updates
as well as fixes and improvements across several language libraries (Java,
python, php, ruby, c++). We are due for some additional releases.

## Numbers
For those who prefer metrics:

Mailing Lists:
 - dev@avro.apache.org had 454 emails (66% decrease)
 - user@avro.apache.org had 61 emails (49% increase)
 - issues@avro.apache.org had 121 emails (61% increase)

JIRA:
 - 39 issues opened (55% decrease)
 - 25 issues closed (78% decrease)

GitHub:
 - 32 PRs open (56% decrease)
 - 25 PRs closed (77% decrease)

Code Repository:
 - 32 commits in the past quarter (80% decrease)
 - 16 code contributors in the past quarter (64% decrease)

## Community Health:
Avro's community is doing well at slowly stabilizing and getting modest gains
in participation. This quarter's large activity drops compared to the prior
report I think are largely due to the unusually higher activity levels that
come from getting out a major release during the prior reporting period.

The PMC still has work to do on making sure a regular cadence of releases
happen, but it has managed to add several committers and PMC members over the
last year.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Stamatis Zampetakis]

## Description:
Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
There are currently 51 committers and 23 PMC members in this project. The
Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Ruben Quesada Lopez was added to the PMC on 2020-08-10
- Rui Wang was added as committer on 2020-09-07

## Project Activity:
Avatica Go 5.0.0 was released on 2020-07-16. It is a major release of Avatica
Go with a number of improvements and a breaking change affecting connection
metadata. Worth mentioning the support for batching query string parameters
in the DSN allowing updates to the server to be executed once Close() is
called on the prepared statement.

Calcite 1.24.0 was released on 2020-07-24, including more than 80 resolved
issues. Among those it’s worth highlighting some new features of the
optimizer for more efficient search space pruning as well as the support of a
new SQL dialect for Presto.

Calcite 1.25.0 was released on 2020-08-22, with fewer but important features
improving the parameterization of optimizer rules, adding support for new
spatial functions, and interval expressions. The release also introduced a
few breaking changes but so far the users seem to have embraced the changes.

Members of the community gave talks at ApacheCon 2020, bringing to the
surface Calcite through discussions about other projects. Although we didn’t
have talks dedicated to Calcite, it is nice to receive mentions and witness
the adoption of Calcite by other open source projects and people in Academia.

## Community Health:
The overall activity in the community has slightly decreased in the past few
months without this being worrisome. Releases occur often, the community is
growing, and most of the time users' questions do not remain unanswered.

The design discussions were fewer in the past quarter and people leading
these efforts had quickly led them to consensus. As a result, we didn't have
lengthy debates thus it's normal to see the activity of the dev@ and issues@
lists slightly decreased (5% and 9% accordingly).

The number of closed issues and pull requests decreased by 19% which can be
explained by the low number of active committers (~10 during this period) out
of which the majority pushed mostly individual contributions. The large
backlog of pull requests is an issue that we are aware of but we haven’t
found an effective solution yet.

## Community Health:
Activity has decreased over the summer, but this is normal for Celix. 
This is also reflected in the project activity (mainly bug fixes 
/ stability work). 
We did see an increase in code contributions which is good to see.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache CXF was founded 2008-04-15 (12 years ago)
There are currently 43 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andy McCright on 2019-02-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexey Markevich on 2017-12-29.

We have a few patches from various people, but nothing strong enough
for consideration as a committer.  We're trying to encourage some
additional involvement for those people.

## Project Activity:
The primary development activity this quarter was getting CXF 3.4.0 released. 
3.4.0 has several new features that users have been asking for.   However, one
of the biggest efforts was updating all the 3rd party libraries that CXF uses
to take advantages of fixes and security updates.   Many of the updates are
incompatible with older versions so some code changes, config changes,
documentation updates, migration guide updates, etc... were necessary.

3.4.0 was released on 2020-08-24
3.2.14 was released on 2020-06-30
3.3.7 was released on 2020-06-30 
Fediz 1.5.0 was released on 2020-06-23

## Community Health:
For the most part, the project is making steady, but not stellar, progress.
Many of the protocols and specs that CXF implements are mature specs and don't
really change much (other than the above mentioned package change from
javax->jakarta).   Thus, steady progress and regular releases are a good
thing.   We are responding to bug reports and security issues and getting
patch releases out.

  (INFRA-20929)
- JDO completed the migration of the code repository from svn to git 
  and the web presence to a new repository in git
- The Derby community has not yet made the transition from Jenkins
  to CloudBees. We are not blocked by anything; we just haven't
  yet found the time.

## Community Health:
It was a quiet quarter, possibly due to worldwide COVID concerns.
But overall the DB community continues to be healthy, with two
new PMC members added and a new release (Torque 5.0) published.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Radovan Semancik on 2018-09-28.
- No new committers. Last addition was Lothar Haeger on 2018-12-16.

## Project Activity:
Overall:

Activty continues to be low but not a concern because as previously reported
the project team remains intact and completing tasks as necessary.  The big
item that needs to be addressed this quarter is moving off of the old Apache
CMS/SVN system onto a new one using Hugo and Git.  Roy Lenferink and Andrew
Wetmore from the infra team have been helping us with this.  There is a lot of
content to manage and so we really appreciate their help.  We held a vote last
week and agreed to use Hugo and Git.  Challenges will be training the PMC (to
use the new system) we'll let you know how it goes.

There are also typical assignments like migrating unit tests off of builds.a.o
instance to work with the new Jenkins servers.  Stefan Seelman has been
handling that.

Per sub-project:

- ApacheDS: low activity: although we continue to see user input and PR's are
  up.

- LDAP API: very low activity.

- Studio:   low activity.

- Fortress: low activity: ApacheCon @Home presentation: A Groovy Apache
  Fortress.

- Kerby:    low activity.

- Mavibot:  low activity.

- SCIMple:  low activity.


## Community Health:
3Q activity continues to be low across the sub-projects, decrease in overall
mailing list activity, commits and JIRA. On the brightside, there is an uptick
in PR's showing the community remains interested and engaged.  Still plenty
left to do and we're optimistic about the future.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Druid Project  [Gian Merlino]

## Description

Apache Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database. It is
designed for workflows where low-latency query and ingest are the main
requirements. It implements ingestion, storage, and querying subsystems. Users
interface with Druid through built-in SQL and JSON APIs, as well as
third-party applications.

Druid has an extensive web of connections with other Apache projects: Calcite
for SQL planning, Curator and ZooKeeper for coordination, Kafka and Hadoop as
data sources, Avro, ORC, or Parquet as supported data input formats, and
DataSketches for scalable approximate algorithms. Druid can also be used as a
data source by Superset.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

We are currently finishing up our fourth major post-graduation release,
0.20.0, which we hope to have wrapped up and ready for release in October.
Additionally, we made our third major post-graduation release 0.19.0 on July
21.

Since our last board report we have had 9 successful user-focused virtual
meetups, with 3 more scheduled in October. In-person events are still on hold
due to COVID-19 related concerns around nonessential gatherings.

Mailing list activity (117 emails) is healthy and has increased since last
quarter. Our ASF Slack channel, #druid, has grown to over 1200 members, with
daily activity of users asking for and offering support to each other.

Commits (232) and unique contributors (45) are down from last quarter. It
looks like this decrease is mostly due to low activity from mid-July through
early September. In recent weeks, activity has gone back up to historically
typical levels. Just in case, I've started a discussion on the mailing list
encouraging everyone in the community to participate in timely PR reviews. At
this moment, there are 72 open PRs, any of which could potentially become a
commit. This is something we'll be keeping an eye on throughout the next
quarter.

## Recent PMC changes

 - Currently 27 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members. Last addition was Benedict Jin on 2019-12-17.

## Recent committer changes

 - Currently 41 committers.
 - Atul Mohan was added as committer on 2020-08-28.

## Recent releases

 - 0.19.0, a major release, was released on July 21 2020

## Development activity by the numbers

In the last quarter:

 - 252 pull requests opened
 - 244 pull requests merged/closed
 - 113 issues opened
 - 116 issues closed
 - 110 comments on pull requests
 - 204 comments on issues

- Dubbo 2.7.9 is undergoing (23 open/48 closed issues). It's delayed due to
  National Holiday in China.
- A side project from dubbo-go is donated and hosted under apache/dubbo-getty.

## Community Health:

In the past quarter, we continue to develop committers and PMC.
The discussion on the
next major version of Apache Dubbo has initialized in the mailing list, and
all involved in the discussion agree the main theme for this major update
would be Cloud Native support. Overall community health is good enough. We
observed less PRs and issues are opened, and we concluded that the current
branch 2.7 is stable enough, and it is a good time for the community to start
working on the next major update.


- dev@dubbo.apache.org had a 8% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (187
  emails compared to 203)
- 548 commits in the past quarter (-6% decrease)

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Awasum Yannick]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Fineract is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a core banking platform that provides a reliable, robust, and 
affordable solution for entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service 
providers to offer financial services to the world's underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Fineract was founded 2017-04-19 (3 years ago)
There are currently 41 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Aleksandar Vidakovic was added to the PMC on 2020-10-11
- Petri Tuomola was added to the PMC on 2020-10-06
- Graham was added as committer on 2020-08-25
- Manthan Surkar was added as committer on 2020-09-26
- Percy Enoabane was added as committer on 2020-10-02
- Petri Tuomola was added as committer on 2020-07-14

## Project Activity:
We have added more committers and PMC members over the past 3 months. Fineract
1.4 was released in September. Aleksandar Vidakovic , one of our committers,
stepped up to be the Release Manager for Fineract 1.x. Aleks while working in
collaboration with Ed Cable, Michael Vorburger and other PMC members, was able
to prepare and send out the much needed 1.4 release on 18 September 2020.
We're hoping to release Fineract 1.x every few months going forward (based on
the rate of contributions). Fineract 1.5 has been programmed to be released at
the end of 2020 or early 2021. There is a fair amount of bugs being fixed by
Petri Tuomola, Michael Vorburger  and a few other committers and volunteers.
In the run up to Fineract 1.4, a weekly "bug fixed" report was shared on list
which helped to highlight the progress made and encouraged additional
contributions. Since the 1.4 release had originally been contemplated in
mid-2019, the shift in momentum was noticeable on list and in the PRs.

GSoC and Outreachy ended in August with most of our students passing their
final evaluation and adding quality to the Fineract code base. A lot of bugs,
issues and code quality work was done during the summer by interns. (Add more
details on what each student did). Some our GSoC interns have already become
committers on the project and are doing great. Manthan Surkar contributed
Checkstyle (amazing), related error handling and logging, Spotless (so cool),
the SqlBuilder (WIP), and Swagger (check it out on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlVd-0YAo6c!). Percy Ayuk contributed Error
Prone violation fixes which improved the quality of Fineract 1.x. He also
fixed alot of bugs and did work related to migrating away from deprecated
dependencies like from Joda time to Java.time migration
(still pending to be merged). Yemdjih Nasser worked on updating Fineract CN
 dependencies especailly Spring and Spring boot, Did work on migrating from
 OpenJPA to EclipseLink ( pending ) and helped to mentor alot of other interns
 and volunteers. He earned committership before GSoC ended. Natasha Natarajan
 worked as an Outreachy intern to fix Fineract issues, migrate some old
 dependencies to new ones and did some QA work.

Highly informative and substantive ApacheCon Fineract/FinTech Track,
https://www.apachecon.com/acah2020/tracks/fineract.html and slides
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17ahcInsVSu5R00BaJKfCs_wh2XnCtLh4 .
There were panel sessions where discussions took place about the current ways
Fineract is implemented and the state of the community. We had talks on use
cases and ways in which Fineract can be improved. There were outreach talks
around encouraging more community contributions which will add more value to
Apache Fineract. Thanks to the work of Javier Borkenztain, Ed Cable and Myrle
Krantz for planning the Fineract Track at this year's ApacheCon. Birds of
Feather sessions were exceptionally valuable in facilitating brainstorming and
planning around future roadmap items including shared contributions to
scalability and performance as well as a phased approach to making Fineract
1.x more extensible through a plug-in like architecture starting with
reporting. These BoF sesssion resulted in actionable tickets that we are ready
to have members of the community assist with.

Fineract CN was proposed and anticipated as the next generation of Fineract,
containerized, microservice based, adding much needed flexibility:  These
discussions on the list around improving Fineract CN and eventually making the
first release.  These discussions hinge on some fundamental vs incremental
improvements to the micro service architecture and underlying technology
stack. There is an Outreachy Project for Fineract CN which focuses on
upgrading key dependencies over the next few months which will help take the
project closer to release.


## Community Health:

Communication on the Dev List has increased slightly as seen by a 1% increase
in traffic in the past quarter (582 emails compared to 575). This is probably
due to people reporting issues and asking questions as a result of the recent
Fineract 1.x release.

Issues created, PRs opened and closure rate have declined by approximately 50%
over the past 3 months mostly due to the conclusion of the GSoC and Outreachy
programs. The increase in these metrics in the summer were due to our interns
doing a lot of work at Fineract. We are back to steady state.

We have 26 code contributors this quarter showing a 23% increase mainly due to
the efforts made to release Fineract 1.4 and the recently ended ApacheCon in
September 2020.

Overall, the community is healthy with a steady rate of contributions from a
few dedicated committers, but we need to do better to attract more
contributors and enable providers serving Fineract in production to give back
to the Upstream project.

There are currently 13 committers and 13 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Karthick Narendran on 2020-04-16.
- No new committers. Last addition was Karthick Narendran on 2020-04-17.

## Project Activity:
 * Added ELK support to Fluo Muchos
 * Migrated from TravisCI to Github actions
 * Renamed Github branches from master to main
 * Reduced the size of Fluo's Docker image
 * Updated Fluo Recipes to work with Java 11, Hadoop 3, and Accumulo 2
 * Updated Fluo Uno to work with Accumulo 1.10
 * Updated Fluo Muchos to work with Centos 8
 * Simplified HDFS configuration in Fluo Muchos for HA and nameservices

## Community Health:
There was a good bit more activity on the project over the previous quarter.
There were 68 commits from 5 committers and 5 non-committers with 2 new
contributors.

Fluo is still long overdue for a release.  Some progress was made towards this
end in getting Fluo Recipes working with the latest Hadoop, Accumulo, and Java
version.  This enables work to get Fluo's examples working with the latest
snapshot which is a prerequisite for release.

- Jean-Baptiste Onofré was added to the PMC on 2020-10-05
- Jean-Baptiste Onofré was added as committer on 2020-10-05

## Project Activity:
Activity is stable, we got some releases - 2 maintenance releases and one big
upgrade for microprofile health implementation since the spec broke some API.

Recent releases:
- xbean-4.18 was released on 2020-09-24.
- health-2.0.0 was released on 2020-09-20.
- metrics-1.0.5 was released on 2020-09-20.

## Community Health:
Community is overall stable but we see some new faces coming from OSGi area.
We saw less activity on the lists/JIRA but it is also aligned with the fact
the specifications we implement didn't move that much and the small decrease
is mainly due to the fact we got some pick previously.

hbase-connectors is a collection of integration points with other projects.
The initial release includes artifacts for use with Apache Kafka and Apache
Spark.

hbase-filesystem contains HBase project-specific implementations of the Apache
Hadoop FileSystem API. It is currently experimental and internal to the
project.

hbase-operator-tools is a collection of tools for HBase operators. Now it is
mainly for hosting HBCK2.

We talked about the release plan to 1.7.0 and 2.4.0.
https://s.apache.org/w7t28
https://s.apache.org/g22v0

We migrated our jenkins jobs from builds.a.o to ci-hadoop.a.o.
https://s.apache.org/5ryjr

Xiaomi donated 10 machines as dedicated build machines for HBase project. They
are under the 'hbase' label of ci-hadoop.a.o. We migrated several jenkins jobs
to the new build machines so we will not eat too many resources of the shared
H nodes which are used by all Hadoop related projects. Thanks to the infra team,
especially Gavin McDonald for setting up the nodes and helping fixing
problems.
https://ci-hadoop.apache.org/label/hbase/
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-25106

We had a tough collaboration problem across developers who had different
opinions about how to implement a new feature. There are basically two ways to
solve the problem and we could not reach an agreement on which way to go. Then
we went both ways on different feature branches and delayed the final decision
to the point of merging. This is informational only, we are not seeking board
assistance at this time.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for October 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 46 podlings incubating. In September, podlings executed 
9 distinct releases. We added one IPMC members and none retired. There was 
one IP clearance in September.  IoTDB graduated last month.

This month we were missing reports from Livy, S2Graph, SDAP, Warble and 
Weex. S2Graph, SDAP, Warble and Weex have all failed to report for several 
months, and the podlings will be contacted to see about retirement.
For the third month, we've also seen more podlings needing to ask mentors 
and IPMC members to vote on releases. This may be a result of the current 
pandemic situation or a lack of mentor engagement or both, and it's hard to 
know for sure.

MXNet progress on resolving issues is still slow, conversation with NVIDIA 
about changing the licensing terms also seem to have stalled, and they 
didn't meet their self imposed deadline to resolve the issue.  What to do 
about this was discussed by the IPMC.

TVM made another release and is again proposing to graduate. There are also 
graduation discussions around Flagon and Superset.

Progress on the policy changes to distributing releases on various 
platforms has been made and documented on the Incubator web site. All 
podlings notified of these new guidelines.

The Apache Training project gave commit rights to all Apache committers.
The incubator organised a track for Apache@home conference and gave several 
talks. The talks have been recorded and posted on the ASF youtube channel.
Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases and graduations.

## MXNet

A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning

MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Address licensing and trademark issues for the binary releases in the
  community.
  - ONGOING. See update in the next section.
  2. Address release issues. Successfully and smoothly make releases
  without WIP disclaimer.
  - ONGOING.
  3. Improve development process and tooling to help reduce the overhead of
  releases
  - ONGOING.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  1. The community continues to work towards resolving license and branding 
  issues. See summary below.
  2. MXNet 2.0 first public beta, interoperable with NumPy, is on the way:
     https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/18
     RFC: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16167
  3. We are adopting Github Discussions 
  https://github.com/apache/mxnet/discussions in favor of Discourse forum 
  for closer connection between users and developers.
  https://discuss.mxnet.apache.org/ (previously discuss.mxnet.io) will serve
  as an archive for past user discussions.

#### Status on license and branding issues

  The PPMC continues to make progress in resolving license and branding
  issues. During the a recent release vote on 1.7.0, with the help from
  Justin, a few more source distribution and branding issues were found. 
  Here is the status on the issues, tracked in INCUBATOR-253. As of now,
  the PPMC resolved 15 issues, with 9 still left.

  Most of the outstanding issues hinge on one key outstanding question, 
  which is whether the components in MXNet that are produced by CUDA NVCC
  constitutes Category X code. PPMC member employed by Nvidia helped connect
  Nvidia's representatives including Michael O'Connor, Director of Deep
  Learning, who have been supportive in the efforts of clarification.
  Progress is tracked in LEGAL-516. At the moment, NVIDIA's legal is 
  actively exploring options on resolving this issue. Michael requested
  extension with MXNet PPMC to not treat the related component as Category-X
  and delay actions until Oct. board meeting.

  Also, we discoveredd that there was confusion around MXNet's status around
  integration with Intel products. In MXNet, there has never been public
  distribution of MXNet where MKL was included. There was an initial inquiry
  around whether MKL builds can be enabled but was rejected, so this never
  came into practice. Also, to my knowledge Intel has not produced custom
  MXNet builds with closed-source components.

  MXNet 1.7.0 release has completed.

  So far, PPMC members from Intel (Tao), Nvidia (Dick), and Amazon (Leonard,
  Henri, Qing, Sheng) have acted to help resolve the issues.

  Status on open issues since last update:
  1. Source and convenance binary releases containing Category X licensed
  code. (pending)

  Source code releases by the PPMC do not contain Category X code, no issue.
  Takedown of binary releases by the PPMC on repository.apache.org is on
  hold, see item 5.
  PyPI releases are made by third-party. See item 8.
  5. Maven releases containing Category X licensed code. (pending)

  Takedown of binary releases on repository.apache.org initiated [1]. The
  scope depends on the resolution of LEGAL-516 [2].
  6. PyPI releases containing Category X licensed code. (pending)

  There are no official PyPI releases. Whether the third-party releases are
  compliant with branding guidelines depend on the resolution of LEGAL-516.
  7. Docker releases containing Category X licensed code. (pending)

  There are no official Docker releases. Whether the third-party releases 
  are
  compliant with branding guidelines depend on the resolution of LEGAL-516.
  9. Trademark and branding issues with PyPI and Docker releases. (pending)

  There are no official PyPI or Docker releases. In addition, as they all
  contain binary from unmodified MXNet code, whether they are compliant in
  branding now solely depends on whether they contain Category X licensed
  code. Refer to item 6, 7.
  10. Trademark and brand issues with naming of releases. (pending)

  There are no binary releases by the PPMC besides the repository.apache.org
  releases in item 5.
  12. Releases and other nightly builds on https://repo.mxnet.io /
  https://dist.mxnet.io containing Category X licensed code (resolved)

  Neither of the two site contains releases. The binaries are only intended
  for testing pipelines and are made available only to MXNet developers. As
  part of the effort to resolve branding concern, public references to these
  sites are deleted [4].
  14. to 23. Branding and release of 3rd parties containing unreleased code.
  (pending)

  Known pages with issues:

  
https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/mxnet-release-notes/rel_20-0
  3.html (item 14, pending)
  PPMC reached out to Nvidia. Pending action from Nvidia on branding
  compliance and replying on whether unreleased code was included.
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/apache-mxnet.mirror/ (item 15, resolved)

  PPMC reached out to SourceForge. SourceForge added (incubating) in name. 
  As 1.7.0 release has completed, we removed release candidate tag from GitHub
  and the the mirror automatically deleted the it [3]. As such, the original
  issue is resolved. The PPMC will follow up with SourceForge on the
  functionality of filtering out non-release tags.
  AWS Marketplace related links
  
  https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07YW8HVLD?qid=1595741035764&sr=0-4&re
  f_=srh_res_product_title (item 22, pending)

  PPMC reached out to Bitnami directly regarding this listing. Bitnami
  responded and is working on the branding issues.
  
  https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=%22MXN
  et (item 23, pending)

  PPMC reached out to AWS through internal channel to fix branding issue.
  Will update in the next few days.
  In addition, MXNet PPMC identified several more listings that require
  correction according to the branding guideline on AWS marketplace that are
  related to AWS Deep Learning Container/DLAMI [5], and are actively working
  on addressing them.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  JM: Please answer all of the question in the report next time.

--------------------
## Sedona

Sedona is a big geospatial data processing engine. It provides an easy to
use APIs for spatial data scientists to manage, wrangle, and process
geospatial data.

Sedona has been incubating since 2020-07-19.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1.The name change in the source code
  2.The first release
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  N/A

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been active in the past month. We have received emails
  and Gitter chats from many users. The GitHub repo also received more 
  stars.
  However, we notice that, since we close the "Issues" function on GitHub,
  many users seem not to post questions to JIRA and mailing list. Some of
  them chose to send emails directly to the committers. We would like to
  figure out a way to guide the users to the right channel.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, we have published our new project website under the
  Apache domain: http://sedona.apache.org/

  We have almost finished our first big PR under the new name, Sedona:
  https://github.com/apache/incubator-sedona/pull/484

  The development progress was kind of blocked by this PR. We believe once
  this PR is accepted, we will move much faster.

## Teaclave

Teaclave is a universal secure computing platform, making computation on 
privacy-sensitive data safe and simple.

Teaclave has been incubating since 2019-08-20.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Improve project structure and documentation
  2. Grow the community (attracting more committers, contributors, users)
  3. Publish Apache releases (resolving logistics on Apache release)

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, we received contributions from a new contributor. 
  We also received many issue reports and questions regarding the usages, bugs,
  and roadmap of Teaclave. Also, we presented the Teaclave project in recent
  ApacheCon to the community and received some useful feedback.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The main goal of development since the last report is to resolve logistics
  towards the first Apache release. This includes license checking, building
  system improvement, documentation and write-ups. On Oct 9th, the Teaclave
  community and incubator has passed 0.1.0 release voting.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## TubeMQ

TubeMQ is a distributed messaging queue (MQ) system.

TubeMQ has been incubating since 2019-11-03.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1.Keep growing the community, attract more contributors and committers
  2.Release Apache standard releases regularly
  3.Continuously improve system performance and increase system features

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  We hope more IPMCs will pay attention to our project and give more
  suggestions.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Since the last report, the TubeMQ community has attracted many real users
  who have given feedback to the project many bugs,
  and enthusiastic contributors have made multilingual SDK contributions to
  the project and successfully applied them in the actual environment;
  the community periodically releases iteratively to provide stable and
  easy-to-use new features.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  This stage is mainly for the development and implementation of
  multi-language SDKs: the C/C++ SDK delivery has been completed;
  at the same time, SDKs for Go, Python, Rust and other languages are under
  development. In addition to the new features of the multi-language SDKs,
  the project initiated the development of the tubemq-manager module for
  cross-cluster control to make the project more usable;
  for details, please refer to our project issues:
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TUBEMQ/issues.

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?
  dockerzhang was added as committer on 2020-07-13

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  The mentors gave us a lot of help and guidance at the beginning of the
  project, but as the project deepened,
  the mentors paid less attention. We hope that the mentors can continue to
  pay attention to
  the development of our project and continue to provide help and 
  suggestions to the project.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  Yes, all good here.

## YuniKorn

YuniKorn is a standalone resource scheduler responsible for scheduling batch
jobs and long-running services on large scale distributed systems running in
on-premises environments as well as different public clouds.

YuniKorn has been incubating since 2020-01-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Gain more contributors and active committers.
  2. Establish a release cadence based on roadmap.
  3. Improve the ease of deployment and documentation quality.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No critical issues at this point in time.

  The community has given multiple presentations at ApacheCON@Home receiving
  good feedback.

  One new committer was added and multiple new contributors were added.

  Discussions around new or improved functionality have been started and are
  progressing in either jira or the mailing list.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  A second release was finalised and released. Planning for the next release,
  based on community use cases, is well on its way for later this year.

  A new website was released based on a community contribution using a new
  build system. The documentation was moved from separate repos to the
  website.

  As part of the latest release the release tool has been improved to remove
  almost all manual steps.

  Some statistics for the report period (2020-07-01 till 2020-09-30)  
  JIRA: 166 created, 129 resolved

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache IoTDB Project  [Xiangdong Huang]

## Description:

The Apache IoTDB is an IoT native database with high performance 
for data management and analysis on both the edge and the cloud.

## Issues:

There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache IoTDB was founded 2020-09-16 (a month ago)
There are currently 35 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- No new committers were added.

- Chao Wang was added as a committer on 2020-09-03 before IoTDB graduated.

## Project Activity:

Software development activity:

 - 0.10.1 was released on 2020-08-23.
- We are organizing the design documents on IoTDB's cwiki space
- We are working for v0.11
- Two proposals are submitted and accepted for Outreachy Intern

Meetups and Conferences:

- We had two public talks about IoTDB, one is "Use cases and 
optimizations of IoTDB" on ApacheCon 2020, and another is 
"IoTDB and Hadoop: Connecting the edge and the cloud open source 
ecosystem for IIoT" on Hadoop meetup in Shanghai, China.


## Community Health:

As IoTDB graduated less than 30 days, the statistics provided by 
the Board Report Wizard seems incorrect. I count the metrics manually.
As IoTDB has report in Sep, I just count the data in one month:

- Commit activity:
  - 434 commits in the last month
- GitHub PR activity:
  - 136 PRs opened on GitHub, last month
  - 108 PRs closed on GitHub, last month
- JIRA activity:
  - 81 issues opened in JIRA, last month
- Mailing list (dev@):
  - 196 mails were sent (down 35) and there are 35 participants (down 6)
    We think the data fluctuation is reasonable as (1) there are some 
    participants from China and they have 8 days National Holiday, 
    (2) there are some Chinese graduate students in the community and they
    have summar holiday and are busy at the beginning of a new semester.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Johan Doornenbal]

## Description:
The mission of Isis is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Isis was founded 2012-10-17 (8 years ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jörg Rade on 2020-04-12.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jörg Rade on 2020-03-23.

## Project Activity:
There continues to be substantial development work on v2.0, with the
framework being "re-platformed" to run on top of Spring Boot.

The main focus during the last quarter was the end-to-end regression suite
(developed using Cypress.io) and the demo/tutorial app (published to docker hub)
that the regression suite exercises.

Work has also started on support of JPA persistence, one of the last main
deliverables for the 2.0 release.

Last release was 2.0.0-M3 on Fri March 27 2020.
A fourth milestone (2.0.0-M4) is currently being prepared.

## Community Health:
This is a mature project. The framework is generally stable.  While there is
little activity on the mailing lists, there is general activity on the Slack
channel.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache James Project  [Benoit Tellier]

## Description:
The Apache James Project delivers a rich set of open source modules and
libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which build into an
advanced extensible mail server running on the JVM.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache James was founded 2003-01-22 (18 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Antoine Duprat on 2016-03-11.
- No new committers. Last addition was David Leangen on 2020-07-06.

## Project Activity:
Within the last 3 months, we continued our documentation effort, completing
the documentation for the Distributed server.

Our (still partial) implementation of the JMAP protocol (RFC-8621) now supports
reading emails and starts attracting new contributors.

We have been creating a dedicated mailing list for notifications, to not flood
server-dev important discussions.

Last release (Apache James 3.5.0) was performed on the 2020-07-23.

## Community Health:
 - notifications@james.apache.org had a big increase in traffic in the past
   quarter (360 emails compared to 0)
 - server-dev@james.apache.org had a 45% decrease in traffic in the past
   quarter (1283 emails compared to 2302)

This is due to both less activity in summer, and the notification mailing list
creation.

 - server-user@james.apache.org had a 40% decrease in traffic in the past
   quarter (39 emails compared to 64)

Despite the decrease, users are able to answer each others, for instance for
configuration problems. We also noticed some new community members expressing
their will to get involved.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud-agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We have upgraded our Guava and Guice dependencies, addressing several user
issues, and two community members expressed interest in upgrading gson and
OkHttp which would further modernize jclouds. We plan to release 2.3.0 in a
few months with or without these fixes.

There has been a member of the community that is contributing OSGi related
improvements that hopefully would help the project better support those
environments while helping us move forward without the limitations we had in
the past.

== Community ==

The project has merged a few small pull requests from 2 contributors over the
last three months. The overall activity remains low.

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Release 2.3.0 in 4Q2020.

== Releases ==

The last major jclouds release, 2.2.0, took place on 2019-10-21.
The last bugfix release, 2.2.1, took place on 2020-05-14.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:
The mission of Jena is the creation and maintenance of software related to Java 
framework for building Semantic Web applications

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Jena was founded 2012-04-18 (8 years ago)
There are currently 18 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:7.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Aaron Coburn on 2019-01-22.
- No new committers. Last addition was Greg Albiston on 2019-07-08.

## Project Activity:
Jena usually does a release every 3-4 months. As noted last report, 3.15.0 has
a problem with one of the server binaries, and new users have ran into
problems.  The project released 3.16.0 with a fix in July; user email and
StackOverflow questions about the issue have dropped off.

## Community Health:
The original Jena project (pre-ASF) celebrated the 20th anniversary of the
first code release!

The first public release of code was 28th August 2000. We held a community
event online, kindly hosted by the Lotico meetup, to mark the occasion.

Claude Warren (PMC) organised a successful Jena track at ApacheCon with talks
about Jena itself and from project using Jena.

While the statistics show a reduction in activity and emails, a dip in the
northern hemisphere summer is not unusual. The number of outstanding JIRA has
increased slightly, by about 5 tickets.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Bruno Demion]

## Description:
The mission of JMeter is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Java performance and functional testing

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache JMeter was founded 2011-10-26 (9 years ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 8 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

  contributions and participation in the JMeter project.
- The project working and discussing to release the next version (5.4)


## Community Health:
- The project has a good activity during last quarter.

## Project Release Activity:
Recent releases:

    5.3 final was released on 2020-05-15.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Johnzon Project  [Romain Manni-Bucau]

## Description:
The mission of Johnzon is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
JSR-353 compliant JSON parsing; modules to help with JSR-353 as well as JSR-374 
and JSR-367

## Issues:
here are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Johnzon was founded 2016-04-20 (4 years ago)
There are currently 8 committers and 6 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Reinhard Sandtner on 2016-08-30.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jonathan Gallimore on 2018-05-09.

## Project Activity:
We got several recent releases, it is mainly about bugfixes and a few new
features.

Recent releases:
- 1.2.8 was released on 2020-07-06.
- 1.2.7 was released on 2020-06-04.
- 1.2.6 was released on 2020-05-13.

## Community Health:
We saw a change in the activity where JIRA is less used in favor of Github
(thanks gitbox integration). It enables us to get PR and interact more easily
with contributors. Lists got a bit less traffic due to the fact we didn't get
a new version of the specification and Johnzon is quite stable at the moment.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Joshua Project  [Tommaso Teofili]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Joshua is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to statistical and other forms of machine translation.

## Issues:
- Very low activity in the project, however it seems that recent roll calls had
positive impact on finding new contributors and moving the project onto a more
appealing roadmap (switch from statistical ML to neural ML)

## Membership Data:
Apache Joshua was founded 2018-10-17 (2 years ago)
There are currently 10 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Felix Hieber on 2018-10-17.
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
- Apart from a few minor fixes, no coding activity is being performed
- A discussion is taking place on dev@ about moving Joshua to leverage neural MT

## Community Health:
- The PMC, following previous board recommendation, issued a roll call
- The roll call on private@ had three PMC members replying positively, hence
it should be possible to have a new release (as we could count on 3 binding
 votes)
- A roll call on dev@ triggered replies from two members of the Joshua community
who expressed interest in contributing to the project

- No new committers. Last addition was Dave Koelmeyer on 2016-04-06.

## Project Activity:
Almost no activity this quarter
- we missed our release train stop because there wasn't any new code since 
  last release at that date.
- there has been a little bit of development after the release train stop 
  date, regarding JSPWIKI-1114, JSPWIKI-1131 and dependency updates.
- we received a security vulnerability report, but was dismissed due to issue
  having been already reported.
- Infra asked us to migrate jspwiki-wiki.a.o to a newer vm image; progress 
  can be tracked at INFRA-20807.

## Community Health:
Although there is little activity, there's enough project oversight; questions 
get followed up on ML/Jira, and there's enough people to cut down a release.

- 1.10.1 was released on 2019-11-20.
- 1.11.1 was released on 2019-11-20.

## Community Health:
- Traffic to the dev mailing list increased slightly (3%) in the last quarter,
  though traffic to the users mailing list has dropped significantly (-49%).

- Website traffic decreased slightly, with between 0% and 6% decreases
  measured in users, new users, sessions, page views, and page sessions,
  according to Google Analytics.

- Public IM activity over the community Slack channel is down somewhat, with
  the average daily number of posts in public channels having dropped 23%, and
  weekly and daily active users averaged across the quarters dipping 14% and
  19% respectively.

- Development activity measured in the number of commits has dropped slightly
  (-2%) by 13 unique contributors (-35%), 6 of which were first-time
  contributors to Kudu. Development activity measured by opened and closed
  issues has decreased (-49% opened tickets, -84% closed tickets), likely due
  to the fact that a few larger features are currently being worked with

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

## Description:
The mission of Maven is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Java project management and comprehension tools

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Maven was founded 2003-03-01 (18 years ago)
There are currently 62 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mark Struberg on 2019-12-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Martin Kanters on 2020-07-10.

## Project Activity:
Last Maven Release: 3.6.3 (2019-11-25)

Plugins (ordered by date)
Maven Archetype Plugin 3.2.0 was released on 2020-07-21.
Maven Resources Plugin 3.2.0 was released on 2020-08-11.
Maven Project Info Reports Plugin 3.1.1 was released on 2020-08-30.
Maven EAR Plugin 3.1.0 was released on 2020-09-30.

Other (ordered by date)

Maven Shared Utils 3.3.3 was released on 2020-08-04.
Maven Filtering 3.2.0 was released on 2020-08-11.
Maven Dependency Analyzer - 1.11.3 was released on 2020-08-21.
Maven Resolver 1.6.1 was released on 2020-10-02.

## Community Health:
We've started a conversation with the Creadur team. The reason is that
we have 2 git repositories that actually contain ASF resources that are used
by ASF projects which are being built with Maven. It makes sense for 2 reasons:
As these are ASF resources, there should be a more global group to maintain them
, not just Maven committers. Also with this transition every other repo
has a clear reason why it is part of the Apache Maven project.

In concrete:
- https://github.com/apache/maven-apache-parent (parent pom for ASF projects )
- https://github.com/apache/maven-resources ( files/templates required by 
  every ASF distributable. Think of NOTICE, LICENSE, DEPENDENCIES, DISCLAIMER, 
  the license header )

Creadur looks like the most suitable project as they already maintain the RAT 
project. Both Hervé and me offered our help to maintain it as committer of the
Creadur project. Creadur project still has to make a decision.

## Community Health:
Our community health metrics are bleak, but commensurate with a project which
needs revitalization. I submitted my resignation in hopes of a new volunteer
who could help revitalize the project. At this point, we've had a quarter of no
takers, so I'm going to pose the question more broadly to the dev list to see
if we can find some interest in more radically changing the project.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
The mission of NiFi is the creation and maintenance of software related to
providing an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
distribute data.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
Java and C++ implementations.

Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
MiNiFi.

Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
NiFi classloader isolation model.

Apache NiFi Flow Design System is a theme-able set of high quality UI
components and utilities for use across the various Apache NiFi web
applications in order to provide a more consistent user experience.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

With the last board report JM continued the questions around communication
channels and noted we should beware the auto closing stale PRs can be bad for
community growth and that we should consider consolidating channels.

Regarding auto close of PRs, we agree there is downside and this is why we've
been slow to make changes here despite the clear challenges of action and
inaction.  We will eventually move beyond admiring this problem to some clear
path with pros and cons.

Regarding consolidation of the communication channels - we try to be where the
community is.  We use that presence to direct communications to the mailing
list. Limiting spread to twitter, stackoverflow, etc.. is its own challenge as
various community members have their own communication style and preferred
channel. What we can influence is the convergence to channels we can as a
community maturely support. It is going well overall but the popularity of the
on-demand communication style of Slack is certainly significant.
## Membership Data:
Apache NiFi was founded 2015-07-14 (5 years ago)
There are currently 48 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Arpad Boda on 2020-05-24.
- Marton Szasz was added as a committer on 2020-07-13

## Project Activity:
Apache NiFi 1.12.0 released on Aug 20 2020 with a stability release of 
Apache NiFi 1.12.1 following behind on Sep 29 2020. These releases include
significant features, bug fixes, improvements, and resolved CVEs.

Apache NiFi Maven Plugin Released on Sep 21 2020. This plugin helps Maven
users building NiFi extensions take advantage of our classloader isolation
model.

Apache NiFi Registry 0.7.0 released on Jul 20 2020.

Consistent with the last report there have not been any 
Apache NiFi MiNiFi Java releases in some time.  What is happening now 
is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MINIFI-422 which
will merge MiNiFi Java back into NiFi as a headless form of NiFi supporting
both broad use case patterns well and reduce the release/codebase burden. 
Important work is on going and almost made it into the NiFi 1.12 release but
had to be reverted as it created regressions.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi CPP 0.8.0 is in progress with over 92 issues resolved.
## Community Health:

Mailing list activity returned to growth across each of our lists notably
including dev with 15% growth and users with 8% growth this quarter. This
is in terms of number of emails of course.

We see strong growth in commit activity at 23% with 314 commits over that time
speaking of just Apache NiFi itself.  Along with that though we saw a decrease
in Github PRs opened and closed on the order of a 10% decline.

The Apache NiFi slack channel activity continues to grow with now over 1250
users dwelling in the general channel alone growing from 1071 in the previous
quarter.

Activity on twitter, stackoverflow, youtube, blogs remains interesting as it
has for many quarters now.

Our number of stale PRs has again grown and this remains an important topic
for us to determine a path forward.  We find community members are much more
motivated in contributing PRs than they are in reviewing them. Though building
a strong and broad reviewer base is important and indeed this is where people
really learn the framework.  We have not yet focused on resolving this problem
as current options we see happening in other communities like auto-stale 
PR closure also have downsides as noted in the board feedback above.

## Description:
Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene®, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop® data
structures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.


## Membership Data:
Apache Nutch was founded 2010-04-21 (10 years ago)
There are currently 21 committers and 21 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Shashanka Balakuntala Srinivasa was added to the PMC on 2020-08-01
- Shashanka Balakuntala Srinivasa was added as committer on 2020-07-25

## Project Activity:
Work on Nutch 1.18 continued (12 issues opened, 21 issues resolved).
Key aspects of the issues opened and worked on are improvements in the
build system (Github workflows for PRs, integration of Spotbugs
targets) and documentation of third-party licenses.

Notified from Infra about the end of the Apache CMS, we decided
to migrate the Nutch site to Hugo, following the Apache Jena
migration path. While initial steps are done, the long road of
converting content and templates is still ahead.

## Community Health:
Commit activity continued over summer but slowed down in the last weeks.
Traffic on the user mailing list is on a low but steady level.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Imesha Sudasingha]

## Description:
Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems. It provides components for data
capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

## Issues:
No issues persist that require board's attention

## Membership Data:
Apache OODT was founded 2010-11-17 (10 years ago)
There are currently 46 committers and 45 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Imesha Sudasingha on 2017-08-28.
- No new committers. Last addition was Imesha Sudasingha on 2017-08-29.

## Project Activity:
- Last release was in October 2019.

Project activity has been very low due to all the contributors being busy and
no major features/bugs are in the backlog.

However, there's a plan to fully integrate the new OPSUI developed in the GSoC
2019 into the next release. That will be a great step for OODT once completed.

## Community Health:
Activity point of view, project health is not satisfactory. However, in a roll
call initiated 2 terms back, 8 PMC members responded. I hope the health will
be better once we start working on OODT 2.0 as mentioned above.

## Description:
The mission of Sqoop is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Bulk Data Transfer for Apache Hadoop and Structured Datastores

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time There were couple
of questions about the community building and we wanted to do a community
release of Sqoop. This has not materialized in the last few months. If we
do that we hope the community activity can improve and the project can
become healthy once activity picks up.  We also need to make sure we are
engaged in reviewing PRs to foster more contributions.  Mooted the idea
of project retirement and that seemed to have some initial support.  If
we are not able to continue furthering the project community growth, will
follow up with the PMC team on this and take next steps.

- No new committers. Last addition was Pierre Smits on 2015-12-15.

## Project Activity:
No activity worth noting this quarter. As usual, we are in a maintenance state,
but not actively developing the project. Depending on cycles available, we may
see an uptick in activity next quarter, as well as the usual prep before the 
annual members meeting.

## Community Health:
The community health has remained steady for the past years. There is adequate
oversight on the PMC, although we should be looking to bolster the PMC from
its current 4 members to perhaps 6 or 7 (This would include attracting new
committers). There appears to be adequate oversight on any bugs/security
issues that may arise, although we have not had any new reports as of late.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support patterns and technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made one release in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.5.25 - Feature and bug fix release (2020-09-28)

The last Struts releases besides the core framework were
* Struts Master 14 - Apply Apache Parent POM and plugin upgrades (2020-02-05)
* Struts Annotations 1.0.7 - Enhancements in preparation for the next
  framework release (2020-02-23)

Within the last quarter we saw a slightly decreased activity. This goes both
for mailing list traffic and development activity, with 17 opened and 18
closed pull requests in the reporting period compared to 27/29 in the previous
quarter. This happens to be within the limits of usual ups and downs for a
mature project like Struts.

We released two new security bulletins in the last quarter: [1]
* S2-059 - Forced double OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in
  tag attributes, may lead to remote code execution (CVE-2019-0230) [2]
* S2-060 - Access permission override causing a Denial of Service when
  performing a file upload (CVE-2019-0233) [3]

Thanks to the Apache Security team for their support on chasing the issues and
updating MITRE information after disclosure.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Georgios Petasis]

## Description:
The mission of Tcl is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Dynamic websites using TCL. Apache Tcl is home to the Tcl-Apache integration
efforts. The purpose of our project is to combine the power of the Apache
web server with the capabilities of the mature, robust and flexible Tcl
scripting language. Currently only the Apache Rivet project is actively
maintained.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tcl was founded 2000-07-24 (20 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Brice Hamon De Crevecoer on 2014-11-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Brice B. Hamon on 2014-11-25.

## Project Activity:
Work has been done in preparing the 3.2 release.  In fact two artefacts have
been released, Rivet 3.2.0rc1 and Rivet 3.2.0rc2 New features mostly relate to
what has been reported in the previous report, mainly change in the thread
policy in the default response to the exit command.  It's stressed in several
points of the manual that 'exit' (shadowed by ::rivet::exit) is not a command
to be used in regular web development, but the exit command could be nested in
third party software and it's part of the Tcl language in the first place, so
it demands meaning.

With the worker bridge 'exit' now by default terminates a single thread. It
has been noticed that some extensions don't behave well when Tcl_InterpDelete
is called, but it seems a problem pertaining specific extension classes or
specific single extensions, so there is no point in having a more flexible
embedding of Tcl for fear of stumbling in one of them.

Setting "RivetServerConf SingleThreadExit Off" in the configuration restores
the old policy of demading all threads in a child process to exit and then
calling Tcl_Exit.

- Configuration parameters that are actually and inherently global only have
  been moved to the module globals structure, reliving the Apache
  configuration callbacks of the duty of creating and copying these parameters
  on the rivet_server_rec structures.
- The ::rivet::upload command argument checking has been rewritten in order to
  have a terse code for handling the several sub-command/argument combinations
  and also with the purpose of fixing a bug that caused server crashes.
- The new ::rivet::thread_id command has been introduced. ::rivet::thread_id
  returns an hex id printed in the very same format used by ::thread::id
  (package Thread). If you need this info for debugging or logging you don't
   need to depend on package Thread. Furthermore [::rivet::thread_id -decimal]
   returns an id in decimal form so that can be matched with the thread data
   in the apache logs.

Bug Fixes:
- The ::rivet::upload command argument checking has been rewritten in order to
  have a terse code for handling the several sub-command/argument combinations
  and also with the purpose of fixing a bug that caused server crashes.

## Community Health:
No news here. From previous report:
curcuru: Great roll call; in the future, include the results in your report
(i.e. how many people replied they were still active in the project - in this
case, plenty!)

In the roll call the following PMC members replied: Georgios Petasis, Massimo
Manghi, Brice Hamon, Harald Oehlmann, Damon Courtney and Ronnie Brunner. David
Welton has not participated.

rb: We remain concerned that it's been more than 5 years since you've added
any new committers or PMC members. I know that TcL has long been a
slow-and-steady project, but are there any contributors who might be
considered for committer?

Right now, no, we don't have any candidates as possible new committers.

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Tez Project  [Jonathan Turner Eagles]

## Description:
Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be 
used to process arbitrarily complex DAGs of data-processing tasks and also a 
re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.

## Issues:
ss:
"Just need to reach out to the community for an expert in setting this up." -
 As this was raised in previous report in April, did this reaching out get
 done? A relatively large number of people on the PMC Roster _appear_ not to
 be subscribed to the private@ list. Is there any particular reason for that?
 The list traffic in the past quarter has been mostly build failure
 notifications and issue creation notifications. I see no mention of a release
 on the dev@ list? Is communication taking place elsewhere?ata here]

Number of github PRs has slowed down. Still haven't resolved getting github
integration, but the issue is less pressing now.

PMC roster are not subscribed is likely an artifact of incubation
grandfathered members that were never active in the project. I will reach out
to see what can be done. Perhaps some will want to go emeritus for the
project.

A slack channel was setup and some offline discussion took place for release
planning. Realized this was a mistake and moved discussion to formal email
list.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tez was founded 2014-07-15 (6 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 35 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Tim Allison]

## Description:
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and

growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognized by IANA and other standards bodies.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

- No new committers. Last addition was Tilman Hausherr on 2019-10-03.

## Project Activity:
We're on the cusp of releasing 1.25.  We have a blocker with an accidentally
included, ASL-incompatible license in a dependency from Adobe
(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-3204).

We've made good progress in a major refactoring for Tika 2.0.0 that was based
on a significant amount of earlier work by committer/PMC Bob Paulin.  This
refactoring will allow for cleaner dependency management and more modularized
parsers.  Once we release 1.25, we should be ready to start releasing
2.0.0-ALPHA.

We completed the migration for our primary branch from 'master' to 'main.'

## Community Health:
We've seen an uptick in issues and in PRs.  Much of this increase in activity
is driven by a commons committer who has taken an interest in improving our
codebase.  We are on the lookout to expand our committership/PMC.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop released version 3.4.8 during this reporting period. This release
contained a variety of bug fixes and enhancements. We are well into
development of the next maintenance release of the 3.4.x series and continue
to work on our future major release of 3.5.0. We reached an important
milestone with 3.5.0 recently in finally being able to merge our official 
Java 11 support.

We've seen a bit of an increase in activity in the project recently as one
of our committers recently became re-focused on contributions in their daily
work. The activity increase has also come from a few new contributors which
may open the opportunity for a new committer.

We've had some discussions about bringing gremlint.com[1] into the project
as the official Gremlin language formatter. We have started the IP Clearance
Process in Incubator[2] to bring this in and are currently waiting on
confirmation that a CCLA has been submitted for the code.

In the wider TinkerPop ecosystem, we've learned of two projects that extend
our project:

* gremlin-ogm[3] - A PHP object graph mapper.
* IBM Db2[4][5] - IBM Db2 support for Gremlin

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Valentin Gutierrez on 2020-04-16.
- Brian Neradt was added as committer on 2020-08-31

## Project Activity:
We are working on our ATS 9.0.0 release and planning for the first
release candidate to be made on 11/2/2020. LinkedIn and Verizon Media have
fully deployed ATS 9.0.0 prerelease into production.  There is one other large
company that has deployed the prerelease on a few servers into production.

We are also continuing to support the 8.1.x and 7.1.x release branches.  ATS
8.1.0 was released on 8/28/2020 and large companies running 8.0.x have moved
over to the feature release.  ATS 7.1.x will stop being supported when the ATS
9.0.0 final release is made.  ATS 8.1.x will become our LTS release branch.

## Community Health:
We have been having monthly online meetups to help with getting the community
together and talk about the ATS 9.0.0 release and current projects and issues.
We are having our Fall Summit on 10/27/2020 and 10/28/2020 and have finalized
the schedule.  The summit will be remote and follow the format of the ATS
Spring Summit.

Activity on dev and users mailing lists is down significantly, by 44% and 47%
respectively.  However, there was a large increase the previous quarter.

Issues closures are up by 43%, due to closing issues in preparation of the ATS
9.0.0 release.  New GitHub PRs are down by 24% as we are focusing on
stability before the 9.0.0. release.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Web Services was founded 2003-01-22 (17 years ago)
There are currently 224 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2016-05-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2014-09-14.

## Project Activity:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required. However, user
questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed, and there are at
least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project can continue to
produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer
considered state of the art, we don't expect a major uptick in new development
efforts, new committers, etc...

There was very little work done this quarter.   There were a few minor fixes
in wss4j that we plan on releasing soon.  The only other changes were related
to picking up some snapshots of Apache Santuario to start testing with the
pre-release versions of Santuario to help them with their releases.

Past Releases: 
WSS4J-2.3.0: 2020-06-17 
XmlSchema-2.2.5: 2020-01 
Neethi-3.1.1: 2018-01 
Axiom-1.2.21: 2018-11 
Woden-1.0M10: 2015-09

## Community Health:
As mentioned, SOAP/WebServices is not considered state-of-the-art anymore and
we are getting very little contribution from anyone other than the 2 or 3
regulars" that are driving features and changes needed for CXF (which is
being driven by their employers).   Thus, we are not seeing any possibilities
for future new committers or PMC members.  However, there are plenty of
people around that can do releases and answer questions and respond to
security issues.  It's a mature project.
