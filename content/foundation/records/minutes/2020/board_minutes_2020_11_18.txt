 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       Well, this has been an interesting month. I've had an 80mph
       wildfire blow by my house, voted in the longest election day
       of my lifetime, babbled through endless consternation, and
       haven't quite prepared for the coming pandemic winter.

       In spite of all that, we seem to be doing fine. Thanks to
       everyone who has been helping the ASF run smoothly throughout
       these turbulent times.

       I still have a number of action items on my list, as indicated
       in my last report, but at least the backlog hasn't increased.

       Somewhat related, the QUIC and HTTP/3 protocols [1] are
       currently in last call within the IETF. I am also long
       overdue for completing the core HTTP specifications [2],
       which are supposed to be published at the same time,
       so that is going to absorb most of my free time until
       we get it done.

    B. President [David]

       From an administrative perspective the past month has been busy.

       Headquarters location has been settled. This took longer than expected
       due to exploring the potential for our HQ location to be in another
       state. The statutory requirements varied from state to state on
       whether we'd have to register as a foreign corp in that state, the
       rules around charities soliciting funds, and municipal business
       license requirements. Ultimately, the path of least resistance was for
       us to use a Headquarters service located in Delaware. Because we are a
       Delaware corp, no foreign entity registration is required. Our
       reporting and licensing requirements stay the same and we add a zero
       cost municipal business license filing to the mix.

       Our new corporate address is:

       The Apache Software Foundation 
       1000 N West Street, Suite 1200
       Wilmington, DE  19801

       Our new phone number is: +1.302.295.4884

       I've tasked our attorney to handle the business license registration
       and the upcoming (March) Delaware Annual Report.

       Tom helped us swap out our point person for our registered agent
       service. There are now three points of contact at the ASF who have
       accounts in Incorp's system for reporting deadlines and service of
       process. We also swapped out payment methods from a Virtual corporate
       card to one of the ASF's credit cards.

       I've also been working with Greg on PEO switch - primarily focused on
       benefits for our employees, though Greg is doing the bulk of the heavy
       lifting in collecting information and agreements and attending the
       majority of the vendor meetings. This remains the highest priority
       task as it effects our employees.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.

    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       We continue to evaluate virtualizing some of our credit card
       expenditures.  This has proved surprisingly complex, because virtual
       credit card offerings generally have underwriting requirements on our
       funding levels.  In order to keep their costs low, virtual credit card
       offerers generally try to verify those requirements via bank API
       access.

       The ASF Operating reserve is well above the ASAE standard average of 6
       months of reserve for Non-Profits.  A full financial report will be
       included in the Foundation’s next quarterly report.

       I remain pleased with the officers’ execution in holding down costs
       and using foundation funds effectively to fulfill our mission. 
       Because of these efforts, our organization is well able to withstand a
       long economic downturn.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In October, the secretary received 49 ICLAs, 4 CCLAs, 2 software
       grants, and 1 CoI affirmation.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       Nothing interesting to report that isn't noted in other reports.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Should we join Eclipse Foundation as an Associate Member?

       Please see Attachment 13 and message from Rob. This would be a
       prerequisite to joining the Jakarta EE Working Group as a Guest member.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Sander: work on guidelines for PMCs to request CI resources
          [ Unfinished Business 2020-05-20 ]
          Status: Done. I do not think this continues to warrant a Board AI.
                  https://s.apache.org/dccqp

    * Roy: work on binary release policy
          [ Unfinished Business 2020-05-20 ]
          Status: Stalled.

    * Roy: remind VP Jakarta EE about report
          [ Jakarta EE Relations 2020-10-21 ]
          Status: Not needed, since Rob posted a report on board.

    * Roy: follow up on roll call next month
          [ Eagle 2020-10-21 ]
          Status: Done. See attic resolution.

    * Roy: remind CoI slackers that affirmation is an ASF requirement
          [ Unfinished Business 2020-10-21 ]
          Status: Done.

    * Roy: follow up about community health
          [ Sentry 2020-10-21 ]
          Status: Done. Sean Mackrory has been initiating conversation but not
                  getting much feedback. However, there has been some recent
                  activity on issues, so there is still hope that the project
                  can revitalize itself. We should revisit on next report.

    * Justin: pursue a roll call for HAWQ
          [ HAWQ 2020-10-21 ]
          Status: Done

    * Craig: ensure Mnemonic PMC roster is updated and pursue monthly reports

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsors: we are working on renewals for two Platinum Sponsors, three
Gold Sponsors, two Silver Sponsors, and three Bronze Sponsors. One Gold, three
Silver, and one Bronze Sponsors have confirmed renewals. We have also received
renewal confirmation from two Platinum and one Gold Sponsors but are holding
on invoicing until they give us the go-ahead. We are in the invoicing process
with two Gold, four Silver, and four Bronze Sponsors. One Bronze Sponsor is
unable to renew for the upcoming year.

2) Targeted Sponsors: we are fine-tuning a Platinum Targeted Sponsorship,
which has been supporting ASF Infrastructure over the past several years, in
preparation of the upcoming year.

3) Sponsor Relations: Sponsor outreach, engagement, and communication continue
per usual. We have had three calls with Platinum Sponsors, all of whom are
seeking additional visibility for their contributions; one of which is
considering the Sponsor “Case Study” opportunity.

4) Event Sponsorship: all Event Sponsor payments have now been received for
ApacheCon@Home, and also received a corporate donation from the event.

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $3,907 total
during October over 45 donations. We worked with Central Services for this
year’s Giving Tuesday event, as well as end-of-year giving campaigns. We are
also working with Marketing & Publicity regarding launching a possible ad
program to benefit our giving campaigns.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — November 2020

I. Budget: all vendor payments are up-to-date.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support day-to-day
activities within ASF Fundraising, including engaging new candidate sponsors,
coordinating Sponsor requests across other Operations areas, providing project
and participation metrics, liaising introductions for ways to participate in
ASF initiatives, and preparing for end-of-year fundraising and Giving Tuesday
campaigns. Post-ApacheCon promotions continue, as all event presentations are
now online. We issued the October Month In Review
https://s.apache.org/Oct2020, published Part II of the "Inside Infra"
interview with Daniel Gruno https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Daniel2, and are
preparing to publish the next interview in the series. We helped finalize an
executive keynote presentation for COSCON conference, and helped ComDev
prepare to promote the ASF's role in the upcoming GSoC and encourage community
participation. We published the first FY2021 quarterly report (Q1; May - July
2020) https://s.apache.org/2mefr and issued a press release celebrating 20
Years of OpenOffice https://s.apache.org/86lex. We continue to seek
contributors to participate with the "Success at Apache" series.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 14 October - The Apache Software Foundation Celebrates 20 Years of
   OpenOffice https://s.apache.org/86lex

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 8 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog,
including 5 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 343 news
summaries published to date. We tweeted 21 items to 58.5K followers on
Twitter, and posted 20 items to 44.8K  followers on LinkedIn. The ASF's
YouTube channel had 22,683 views this month, and 7,869 total subscribers to
date.

V. Future Announcements: 1 announcement is on hold, with 2 draft announcements
archived due to PMC inactivity. Projects planning to graduate from the Apache
Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones, "Did
You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?" highlights, and "Project
Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 4 media queries, and handled two crisis
communications issues regarding two Apache projects, one of which had also
sought Media Training assistance. We received a total of 2,543 press hits vs.
last month's 3,520 (this number includes ASF, Apache Projects, and
initiatives).

VII. Analyst Relations: we are working on an analyst report on serverless
computing. Apache was mentioned in a total of 24 reports by Gartner,
Forrester, 451 Research, and IDC.

VIII. Central Services: Kenneth Paskett (Creative team) continues to update
the apache.org homepage. We are working with ASF Infrastructure on their
content project across apache.org and are preparing for their migration to the
new CMS. We created promotional artwork for Giving Tuesday and the end-of-year
fundraising campaign. We plan to reach out to Apache projects and invite those
seeking creative assistance to do so using our new intake form and process.
Swapnil Mane (Editorial team) continues to help with drafting and publishing
Weekly News Round-ups and Month-in-Review summaries. We are seeking additional
assistance with both creative and editorial teams so we can build on M&P
projects.

IX. Events liaison: promotions are winding down for ApacheCon@Home post-event
materials available on YouTube. We continue to assist an Apache project with
communications and brand alignment (working with ASF Brand Management) on a
new Project-focused event CFP, outreach, and site content.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: We will be changing primary ownership of
our accounts from HALO Worldwide to the ASF to phase out billing pass-throughs
from HALO Worldwide.

XI. Miscellany: we handled a co-branded partnership request; responded to a
publisher request for cross promotions on several Apache projects; addressed
some list moderation issues; advised a Sponsor on getting involved with
non-code contributions; prepared new individual giving campaigns; responded to
a vendor’s request for inclusion and link in an ASF press release; met with
some Sponsors regarding promotional opportunities; and liaised with the Apache
Incubator on behalf of a Sponsor with IP questions.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- PEO is progressing well, and should have an update around or soon
  after the Board meeting.

Finances
========
- Given that we have not rehired for the open position, we are well
  within budget for FY21. Finances will be a little unpredictable as
  we settle in with our new PEO firm.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Resolve PEO issues for the US-based staff.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Finish hermes (mail) migration. Almost there!

General Activity
================
- Testing 2FA within Crowd, specifically to require for root. Goal is
  to use Crowd for LDAP password changes (and retire id.a.o).
- Continued CMS and VM migrations.
- Uploaded historical ID mappings for lists.a.o for exploration.
- Progress on generating metadata for TLP, retirees, and fingerprints.
- Renewed work on configuring a CDN.
- Beginning moves from travis-ci.org over to travis-ci.com.
- Mirror work, due to Chrome deprecation of plain http: and ftp:
- Account creation revamp, along with supporting changes to asfpy.
- Gavin's "Inside Infra" is now live.
- Jenkins work on capacity, website generation, plugins, bintray,
  better job handling, etc.
- DockerHub fixes to deal with their upcoming rate limiting.
- rsync.a.o filled up, so we quickly rebuilt it.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

In the days since my last report, we have put all video from ApacheCon @Home
2020 - 306 videos! - on YouTube. They can be seen here -
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU2OcwpQkYCy_awEe5xwlxGTk5UieA37m - and
are also available divided into playlists for each track of the event.

Since getting that task done, we have been taking a break. In the coming
months we hope to have a plan to use the remainder of our Hopin subscription
for smaller, project/topic focused events.

Later this month, we will be hosting the Pulsar Summit Asia -
https://pulsar-summit.org/ - on our Hopin account. There are no other events
scheduled in the coming quarter.

Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

W3C have updated their process (Process Document and Patent Policy). It aims
to smooth the working group flow and also to have specifications to evolve
after publication (optional choice for the Working Group). This includes bug
fixes and also new features, and will help real-world implementations
experience to affect a specification where currently the input window for
implementation experience is quite short.

Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

One more pretty uneventful month: we've had a regular amount of usual requests
flowing through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Committee members took good care
of resolving most of these in time. We're steady at 29 unresolved issues this
month.

The only three things worth noting are LEGAL-516 and a review of our bylaws.

LEGAL-516 is clearly stalling at this point and as per suggestion from Justin,
I feel we need to resolve it once and for all by the end of the month -- it
has been outstanding for way too long.

DLAPiper is still slow to re-engage -- I'm hoping Mark will have more time
available for us before the end of the year.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 12: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Currently, each PMC is responsible for writing up their own CVE
entries and submitting them to Mitre. This leads to many delays in the
CVE database being updated with Apache issues as entries are often
rejected as the legacy format causes issues. We are working on a tool,
hosted on an infra-managed VM, that will provide PMCs dealing with
security issues a way to edit, validate, and submit their entries to
Mitre. We are leveraging upcoming changes to CVE automation that will
also allow us to request and allocate CVE names to projects
on-the-fly.  It may allow in the future us to delegate the entire
workflow to the PMCs that handle a lot of issues; with them able to
self-service request a CVE through to making it live in the CVE list,
but for others we can continue to help them through the process, this
will just make it simpler.

Also, continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects
reminded of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

Stats for Oct 2020:

     24        [license confusion]
     21        [support request/question not security notification]

Security reports: 41 (last months: 32, 24, 38, 46)

      11      [site]
       2      [apr], [fineract], [lucene], [openoffice], [sling],
              [trafficserver]
       1      [activemq], [airflow], [ambari], [cassandra],

              [oozie], [poi], [shiro], [tomcat], [tvm], [velocity],
              [xerces], [xmlgraphics]

     In total, as of 1st November 2020, we're tracking 69 (last month:
     69) open issues across 36 projects, median age 82 (last month:
     89) days.  30 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     8 (last month: 9) of these issues, across 4 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  None require escalation.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 13: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations [Rob Tompkins]

I have established contact with the Jakarta EE team, and actually attended
one of their Jakarta EE working group calls.

From what I can tell we have two Apache members that seem to have close
contacts with the Jakarta EE community: Romain Manni-Bucau and Mark Thomas. I
believe that Romain has potentially paved the way for us to potentially
become Guest Members.

Lastly, I would like to note that there is appetite that the Apache Projects
that implement the Jakarta EE standard, use some form of the Jakarta logo on
their websites or with their marketing materials. Having spoken with
Mark Thomas about this, I’m not certain what appetite we have in accommodating
these changes. I would think that such an appetite would reside at the
project level if at all.

I would love to hear your thoughts on these matters, particularly if you
would think it prudent for me to start us down the path of establishing a
guest membership at Jakarta because they would need to have requisite votes
for us to establish ourselves in that manner.

## Community Health:
For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done.
But basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development.

For IvyDE we lack the knowledge of building Eclipse plugins on actual Eclipse 
versions. We hope to get the build running again so we could update that.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues to bring to the board's attention at this time.


## Membership Data:
Apache Cassandra was founded 2010-02-17 (11 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 34 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.
Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Michael Semb Wever on 2020-04-09.
- Zhao Yang was added as committer on 2020-09-23

## Project Activity:
The project's focus remains on testing 4.0 beta, with the trunk code remaining
in feature freeze. A 4.0 GA release is looking likely in the next quarter. The
community continues to build momentum, with an increases in dev mailing list
traffic, number of jira tickets closed, and in commits. There have been more
releases than usual as the community has responded promptly to issues and bugs.

Notable activities in the past quarter are:
- Harry - a fuzz testing tool for the project, was donated, having gone
  through the Incubator's IP Clearance.
- Discussions on the various Kubernetes Operators and whether to promote one,
  merge, or re-invent, continue with a healthy and engaged diversity between
  implementations.
- The project's governance has become better agreed upon and documented, with
  the past quarter demonstrating it in play with the PMC trending to use the
  dev ML more than the private ML.
- The project's website, and its documentation, is undergoing efforts to
  redesign and improve layout and navigation around the bulk of documentation
  that continues to be donated to the project.

released and to end the feature freeze encouraging the larger contributions
and new contributors into the project. This has energised the community in
what appears to be the last stretch of testing for 4.0.

## Project Activity:
ApacheCon@Home 
Our Community track ran over 3 days and 2 timezones and
attracted a good audience. For the first time we presented content in Hindi.
Many of the sessions achieved a good interaction via audience questions.
Videos from all the sessions are now available on the ASF Youtube channel.[1]

During the event, we ran the Trillions video. We need to investigate new ways
for managing an online booth as it was difficult to understand when and how we
could interact with the community.

New Committers 
We welcomed 4 new committers in recognition of the community
building work they have done as part of the ALC initiative.[2]

GSoC 
We have started preparing for GSoC 2021 including our application as a
mentor organisation. An initial announcement has been sent out to gather ideas
for potential projects. [3]

ALC 
During this quarter the ALC Indore has held a range of meetings focussed
on promoting the Apache Way [4][5][6]

Other Events 
Around this time we usually apply for a booth at FOSDEM but due
to it being an online event for 2021 will be investigating how we can
participate. Other upcoming events have been promoted via our mailing lists
including the Apache Roadshow China and FOSS Backstage.

## Community Health:
Our dev mailing list has seen a significant decrease in traffic compared to
the previous quarter (257 emails compared to 566).Even with the decrease we
did get a lot of community involvement and activity in ApacheCon@Home which is
not reflected in the mailing list statistics.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Paul King]

## Description:
Apache Groovy is responsible for the evolution and maintenance of the Groovy 
programming language

## Issues:
No issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Groovy was founded 2015-11-18 (5 years ago)
There are currently 20 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Daniel Sun on 2019-05-06.
- No new committers. Last addition was Mikko Värri on 2020-06-03.
We are in the process of voting an existing committer to PMC status.
The vote will likely be concluded before the board meeting but after
this report was due. The outcome will be reported in the next report.

## Project Activity:
We continue to work on bug fixes for 2.5 and 3 and continue to assist
other non-Apache projects within the Groovy ecosystem move to 3.0.

We are also working on our roadmap for Groovy 4 and recently released
our first alpha version. Groovy 4 GA is expected next year.
Some interesting aspects (some have incubating status) of the release
include a contributed design-by-contract module, a language
integrated query module, move to org.apache.groovy maven coordinates
from legacy org.codehaus.groovy, additional built-in type checkers,
additional built-in macro methods, record-like classes and numerous
legacy consolidation activities.

Recent releases:
3.0.6 was released on 2020-09-29.
4.0.0-alpha-1 was released on 2020-09-29.
2.4.20 was released on 2020-07-22.

Downloads (Maven central/bintray only):
- For Aug/Sep/Oct quarter: approx 93 million
- last 12 months: ~310M
- since 2012 (when we started keeping stats from above repos):  ~670M

## Community Health:
The overall community status remains healthy. The community tries very
hard to be welcoming and interesting discussions continue to take place
at appropriate times. Large endeavours currently take a while to progress
due to the part-time nature of most contributors.

One key community building aspect for the project was our participation
in ApacheCon@Home. The project had a dedicated track and received interest
from numerous speakers. There were two days of talks, a workshop and
a hackerthon.

This quarter, 318 (575) commits were contributed from 12 (16) contributors
including 7 non-committer contributors (5 new) to the main
branch (all branches/repos).

Apache Groovy continues to rank well on the TIOBE index being 11th most
popular language for October 2020. There are flaws with the index and it
fluctuates somewhat but it is still nice to be not too far down the ranking.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Joe Orton]

## Description:

to Apache Web Server (httpd)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache HTTP Server was founded 1995-02-27 (26 years ago)
There are currently 125 committers and 54 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mario Brandt on 2020-04-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Mario Brandt on 2020-04-27.

## Project Activity:
To begin with a personal note in my first Board report, I'd like to sincerely
thank outgoing PMC Chair Daniel Gruno for his effort and dedication over the
three years holding this role.  Thanks, Daniel!

The 2.4.46 release in August (discussed in the project's previous quarterly
report) appears to have been successful.  The release resolved a number of
outstanding security issues, and no regressions have been identified by the
user community.

After the burst of activity leading up to that release, this was a relatively
quiet quarter for the community, with no new releases for httpd.  Commit
activity concentrated mainly around documentation updates, code cleanups
and minor bug fixes.

Contributors continue to enhance and adjust the Travis CI configuration,
trying to find the best balance of increasing test coverage against
minimisation of false negatives.

## Community Health:
Traffic on the development mailing list, the number of active committers and
commit activity are all down significantly on the previous quarter, reflecting
the lull after the release activity discussed above.

We continue to see an uptick in activity around GitHub, with an increasing
number of contributions coming in as new GitHub Pull Requests (up from 5 to 13
this quarter), which is encouraging.

There are 1253 open bugs for the Apache httpd-2 project in Bugzilla at time of
writing.

 - More Iceberg support, including ALTER TABLE, INSERT INTO for (non-partitioned
   tables), ORC, and more

 - Movement towards FIPS compliance

 - Error message readability and location improvements

 - System internals visibility improvements into artifacts like like queues and
   skews

 - Daily aarch64 build-and-test runs

 - Many more patches than a typical quarter about developer
   experience. Eyeballing it, maybe twice as much? This includes fixing some
   long-standing build and test issues.

 - Impala's first patches from contributors at @tencent.com

 - The addition of support for Alluxio

 - First SIMD support outside of the x86-64 family

## Community Health:

The community is overall healthy. This quarter has a common amount of
variability in some previous metrics. It is not infrequent that this
variability has no plainly obvious cause.

 - 4,278 reviews were sent to reviews@, 2% down from the previous quarter

 - 272 new JIRA tickets were filed vs. 315 last quarter

 - 184 patches were committed this quarter, 5% down from last quarter

 - user@ and saw traffic decrease (31 emails to 19), while dev@ saw it increase
   (73 emails to 89)

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for November 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 46 podlings incubating. In October, podlings executed 8 
distinct releases. We added 3 IPMC members and none retired. There was one 
IP clearance in September. We have one new project Hop, and no projects 
graduated last month. Superset was up for graduation last month, but it was 
submitted just before the board meeting, and there wasn't time to review it.

This month we were missing reports from Annotator, BlueMarlin, Livy, 
S2Graph, Toree and Warble. Livy, S2Graph, and Warble failed to report last 
month and Annotator didn't get sign off from its mentors.

BlueMarlin has bootstrapped after a long delay, but still didn't report.
A role call for S2Graph got no response and the IPMC will consider retiring 
the project. SDAP and Weex reported after missing several reports. Weex is 
considering retirement and Warble will be retired.

A new proposal Alita-validator is being discussed.

Progress on MXNet issues is still slow, with most problems being on hold 
waiting for NVIDIA or legal JIRA's to be resolved.  More branding and 
trademark issues have been found, and their latest release didn't pass an 
IPMC vote, and a new release is currently up for a vote. They needed a lot 
of help with branding issues for an upcoming conference and were late in 
asking for help. some irregularities where also found with roster and
the process for adding people to their PPMC.

NVIDIA has changed their licensing terms, but the terms are still
incompatible with the Apache license. It's likely that the legal JIRA
will be resolved as Category X and that will mean that the project 
will need to remove some of it own non-compliant releases from Apache 
infrastructure and ask 3rd parties to rename releases. The IPMC has had 
further discussions on what to do about the project.

There was a discussion on what criteria should be used to remove a podling 
from the IPMC.

Some minor changes were made to the distribution guidelines based on 
feedback from various people.

We had a slightly odd request from an ASF sponsor about IP governance, 
which seems to have been satisfactorily resolved.

Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases and graduations. 
There were graduation discussions around ECharts, Flagon, Superset and TVM.

## DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences.
Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream
and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to
computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than
traditional, exact methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Adding more committers. We added one last quarter and we have a
     few more individuals that we have been considering.
  2. We have created a draft Maturity model, which is undergoing review.
  3. Prepare for Graduation. We have a Graduation checklist that we are
     going through

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Public presentations since last report:

  - ACM-KDD conference in August.
  - DataCon2020 in Taiwan in September.
  - ApacheCon 2020 in September.

  We are seeing increased interest from scientific communities that 
  work with big data and platforms that want to use our code 
  (e.g. Apache Impala).

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We released a new minor release of C++: 2.1.0.

  Based on feedback from our community, we are developing a Docker 
  deployable version of our library, which hopefully will be 
  released soon.

  We are working on a brand new sketch as part of the Quantiles family.

  To the best of our knowledge all of our licensing and website issues
  have been addressed and have been implemented in formal releases or
  are in master-branch staging, awaiting the next release.

  We are continuing to respond to new user's requests for help.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  Generally our mentors have been very helpful. However, a
  little more help from our mentors on timely approval of
  our releases would be appreciated. Our last release took
  18 days to get 3 IPMC members to vote. We don't know what
  is typical, but this seems a bit long. Please advise. 

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

  To the best of our knowledge, yes.

  * Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings
   name and brand?

   As far as we know, yes.

  * If not what actions has the PPMC taken to correct this?

    We have not had to face this issue yet.

  * Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?

   Yes, and it is clearly stated as such on
   http://incubator.apache.org/projects/datasketches.html

  Yes.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

  - As far as we know the brand is respected by third parties. We-Amp
  mirrors the incubator site over at modpagespeed.com - but will work
  on transferring the domain name to the ASF this quarter.
  - It's not known if the VP, brand has explicitly approved, so that is
  something we need to make sure about and resolve.

  2. Improve committer participation
  3. Improve/create user guide documentation

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Thomas Huang delivered a (virtual) keynote address at the 2020 ApacheCon
  @Home on 9/29 and discussed our creation of the Apache Science Data
  Analytics Platform (SDAP) as a professional open source Analytics Center
  Framework (ACF) and its growing list of NASA and international 
  applications.

  The COVERAGE (CEOS Ocean Variables Enabling Research and Applications for
  GEO, https://coverage.ceos.org/technology/#software) development team at
  JPL completed an initial deployment of SDAP on European cloud platform,
  WEkEO (https://wekeo.eu/).  Paired with a previously deployed SDAP on
  Amazon Web Services (AWS), an objective of COVERAGE is to enable joint
  analytics leveraging geographically distributed SDAP installations that
  host distinct yet compatible American and European satellite-based and in
  situ ocean-related datasets.

  Additional deployments of SDAP that are currently being maintained:

   - NASA Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) (
   https://ecco-group.org)
   - NASA Gravity Recovery & Climate Experiment (GRACE) Follow-On (
   https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov)
   - NASA Sea Level Change Portal (https://sealevel.nasa.gov)

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Three new features:
  - SDAP-292 Add Cassandra authentication support to delete_by_query.py 
  script
  - SDAP-278 Cassandra authentication for webapp
  - SDAP-258 Update Deseason Algorithm to Use Precomputed Climatologies

  Two improvements:
  - SDAP-284 Collection Manager to support recursive directory structures
  - SDAP-285 Solr not indexing lat/lon

  Eight bug fixes:
  - SDAP-282 Support configuring dimension names and projection during
  ingestion
  - SDAP-291 netcdf parsing error with GMPE dataset in Granule Ingester
  - SDAP-280 Collection Manager should not block when checking ingestion
  history
  - SDAP-279 Collection Manager does not pick up fs events with NAS mount
  - SDAP-267 config operator, manage git url or branch update in the helm 
  chart
  - SDAP-261 bug fixes for new ingestion system (granule ingestion & 
  collection manager)
  - SDAP-277 Better error handling in Granule Ingester

## Training

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for
training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various Apache
and non-Apache target projects.

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Promote the information about Apache Training Project with increased 
  participation from community
  2. Create a tutorial on how the tools provided by this project can be 
  used to create own content
  3. Review current policies around contribution review and releases to 
  find a pragmatic compromise

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  The Training Project has opened up the commit permissions to all the 
  committers of Apache project to make is easy for experts in each area 
  contribute to Apache Training presentations. 
  This was announced in the last week of September 2020. This will open 
  up the project for contributions from other Apache projects.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Activity has increased since the last report.
  There were 144 posts in last 3 months.
  We have received queries for contributions from individual contributors.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  New training slides were added on three topics:

  * Apache Pulsar
  * Apache Samza
  * Apache Flink

  PR activity has picked up momentum since the last report.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
  There are currently some issues with this podling that we are working to 
  address, we believe that the issues are not yet critical and can be 
  turned around from within the community but want to make the board aware 
  of this early on.

  monitoring usage of the Podlings current name on other sites.
  The Podling is not directly affiliating with any sponsors donating 
  content and presenting an independent image on the webpage.

The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:

- We are releasing the first major version of IoTDB after its graduation, 
v0.11.0. A vote for the version has begun.

- In the version, 16 new features are introduced, include:
 - new compression method
 - enhanced deletion and query SQLs
 - data compaction in the backend

 etc..

- There are two talks about IoTDB on Apache RoadShow in China,
 one is for the project and the other is for the community.

## Community Health:

- 141 emails sent in Sep while 127 mails sent in Oct. Both the number of
participators are 33.
But, indeed we saw many new participators in Oct.  Besides, we think 
the number of the email is reasonable as in Sep we have many votes 
for graduation.

- 79 PRs are merged in Sep while 177 PRs are merged in Oct.

- Another good thing is some non-developers join the community,
for modifying the documents, etc..

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform for efficiently storing
and processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========
We are voting the 2.7.0 release, which includes the following key features.
- connection rate limit
- partition mutation quota
- sliding window aggregation in KStreams
- feature versioning support
- Support PEM format for SSL certificates and private key

We’ve continued steady progress toward the task of replacing ZooKeeper in
Kafka. Now there is a separate "raft" module containing the core consensus
protocol. Seven other KIPs are in active development to provide support for
more partitions per cluster, simpler operation, and tighter security.

Tiered Storage work continues and unlocks infinite scaling and faster
rebalance times via KIP-405.

Community
===========
Dev mailing list had a 22% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (2448 emails
compared to 3124).

User mailing list had a 23% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (572 emails
compared to 741).

We added 3 new committers, Chia-Ping Tsai and David Jacot on Oct. 15, 2020, and 
Sophie Blee-Goldman on Oct. 19, 2020.

We last added a new PMC member John Roesler on Aug. 9, 2020.

## Community Health

As I have mentioned in many past reports, we struggle with being, in reality,
a single-developer project. This quarter we broke out of that mold
dramatically, with two new committers added in October. We are very excited
to see what we hope is a new chapter in our project's life.

## Community Health
Metrics are lower again this quarter as team work conditions amid COVID
and other priorities are affecting engagement. At the same time,
the project seems to have matured to where new features are fewer.
More innovation seems to be possible in the near future as more cloud specific
features seem likely.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Matt Sicker]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Logging Services project is to create and maintain of 
software for managing the logging of application behavior, and for related 
software components.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Logging Services was founded 2003-12-16 (17 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 13 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 3:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carter Kozak on 2018-07-29.
- Davyd McColl was added as committer on 2020-08-04
- Robert Middleton was added as committer on 2020-08-04
- Stephen Webb was added as committer on 2020-08-08

## Project Activity:
- Note: August project activity detailed in previous board report.
- In September, we released version 2.0.10 of log4net which fixes
  CVE-2018-1285, adds support for netstandard2.0, and major build automation
  improvements.
- In September, we began migrating our Log4j tests from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5
  which has also provided a great opportunity for discovering ways to speed up
  the test execution time as well as identify gaps in APIs that may be
  addressed by adopting a more formal event-driven architecture in some areas.
- In September, we tried out Dependabot in Log4j which has turned out to be
  less helpful as we'd expected due to lack of integration with Jira as well
  as making it difficult to express or test backward compatibility with older
  dependency versions.
- In September, we started a release for log4net 2.0.11 which raised some
  process questions around signing and where to upload release candidates as a
  committer. We've been using the GitHub Releases functionality of the repo
  for copies of release candidates and releases marked as such while
  continuing to commit official releases in our usual distribution svn repo as
  well as uploading nupkg binaries to NuGet.
- In October, Matt and Ralph met with Davyd over video chat to do a GPG key
  exchange so that future releases of log4net can be signed by Davyd directly
  along with adding his key to our project KEYS file.
- In October, we released version 2.0.12 of log4net which includes some
  bugfixes for non-Windows platforms.
- The topic of Log4j 2.14.0, our next release, came up a few times during this
  quarter. We worked towards making Log4j release-ready, though the first
  release candidate was not published until the following quarter in November;
  stay tuned!

## Community Health:
- Mailing list traffic has increased on the dev list, partly from increased
  activity in log4net and log4cxx, partly from Log4j release preparations and
  discussions.
- PR activity has increased in log4net which has been greatly aided by having
  more active committers working on that component.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

## Description:
ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

## Issues:
Light activity, due to pandemic in all likelihood.  There are no issues
requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache ManifoldCF was founded 2012-05-15 (8 years ago)
There are currently 25 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Markus Schuch on 2018-01-04.
- No new committers. Last addition was Cihad Guzel on 2019-08-17.

## Project Activity:
ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.16 release on September
16, 2020.  The next major release is due on December 31, 2020.


## Community Health:
We nominated and approved Cihad Guzel as committer on 8/16/2019. We nominated
and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did not sign up
any new PMC members or committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the
lookout for new PMC members and committers.  The light level of activity this
quarter has limited our pool of new developers considerably.  I wish I had more
news but really there isn't much; all developers we have have extensive outside
commitments and the pandemic has, if anything, made that situation worse.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description: 
Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable
object-oriented programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. It
comes up with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code complexity,
avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing next generation
computing platforms. Mnemonic makes the storing and transmitting of massive
linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient. The performance tuning could
also be mostly converged to a single point of tuning place if based on
Mnemonic to process and analyze linked objects. The programmer is able to
focus on the durable object oriented business logic instead of worrying about
how to normalize/join, SerDe(un)marshal, cache and store their linked business
objects with arbitrary complexity.

Issues: 
There is a roll call to decide to retire this project, but it has been
supported by several contributors, so we decided to reboot it.

Activity: 
In this period of reporting, 6 of tickets have been created and 4
resolved, basically, we are working on migrating Maven build to Gradle for
efficiency and flexibility. There is a roll call to decide whether to retire
this project and we conclude to reboot. We have come up with a HL community
plan as follows. Project goal: To deliver a pre-product durable object model
library that is working along with abstract software layers of hybrid memory
and high performance storage, e.g. PMem, FS, KV Store at the end of next year
(2021). Project core values:
    • Unified durable object model
    • Reduced burden of SerDe process Project objectives 1) A stable and
      efficient CI system 2) An improved documentation and website
        ◦ Highlight core values
        ◦ Usage guide
        ◦ Performance benchmark 3) Verified code quality and testing
        ◦ Unified interfaces
        ◦ Quality test cases
        ◦ Building system / CI
        ◦ Release process 4) Adding Redis as one of back-ends of durable
          object 5) Supporting JDK14
        ◦ Leveraging an incubating feature of non-volatile mapped byte buffers
          Project Milestones 1) Dec. 2020, Gradle migration (v0.14.0) 2) May.

        ◦ feedback and improvement 2) Event based release meeting
        ◦ scope and objectives
        ◦ version release
        ◦ release process 3) Maillist, Jira, PR based discussion
        ◦ technical topics
        ◦ PR reviews, feedback 4) Management meeting on demand
        ◦ planning, road-map, growth
        ◦ goals alignment
        ◦ mentoring, training, events
        ◦ process improvement
        ◦ financial/budget advice We decided to keep current PMC unless
          explicitly requested. we don't expect to complete Gradle building
          before next project reporting (Nov.11). we expect a new minor
          release at the end of this year.

Health Report: 
After reboot, we have 3 more new PMCs, they like to manage this
project together, we have held 2 conference calls during this report period.
There are plans, actions and roles that have been fully discussed and defined.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - 3 PMC joined in Oct. 2020.

a recent security report. We'll probably have a release fixing the 
security issue in the next report period.
Oozie is still on Apache CMS, we'll work on moving away from that.

## Community Health:
Not much activity around, but tickets and patches are created and submitted 
from time to time.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Carl B. Marcum]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

### History

2012-10-17 - Apache OpenOffice was established as Top Level Project (TLP)
2011-06-13 - OpenOffice.org was accepted as Incubator project in the ASF
             with the new name Apache OpenOffice 

## SUMMARY

Latest Release (4.1.8) was in November 2020. The community activity in 
general is on a low but sustainable level. A major obstacle is the complex 
code and build system. Therefore it is not easy for new people to gain a 
foothold into the code when the first build is hard to be done. There is 
recent activity on the mailing list to update the building guides to make 
it easier to get builds working.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

The following is just for board awareness. There is no action that we expect:

During our celebrations for the 20th anniversary of OpenOffice as an open 
source project [1], The Document Foundation (TDF) published an open letter 
on their website claiming the OpenOffice brand [2].

The PMC was focusing on the release of OpenOffice 4.1.8 and didn't send a 
response. However we are concerned on this move, especially in combination 
with other incidents within the LibreOffice project.

[1] https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-celebrates3
[2] https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2020/10/12/open-letter-to-apache-openoffice/

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines:

1) 4.2.0 is the next minor release, planned to be released into a beta phase.
We have missed our goal on going into the beta in 2019. We managed only to
solve the biggest blockers. Currently a new dev test version is released
to be more widely tested. An alpha and/or beta release is planned
for the next quarter.

For that release we are improving the translation process. We are now able to
sync our translation server Pootle with the code.
Together with ASF Infra we were able to set up a new (updated) translate VM.

At the moment we support 65 languages in Pootle. We plan to add some new
languages to the 4.2.0 release.

2) We have just released AOO 4.1.8 and also have achieved the milestone
"300 million downloads" that we had a blog post about.
During the Release Candidate testing we had great help from many people for
testing the RCs! We are especially happy that we have seen help also from new
people. In general, the amount of work and contributions that went into 4.1.8
is much larger than it used to be in our previous "micro" releases.

The project had seen a code contribution from the AndrOpen Office project which
is porting OpenOffice to the Android platform.

The motivation in still maintaining the 4.1.x release line is not very high.
Therefore we will shut it down as soon as we have a stable release of 4.2.x.

## LATEST RELEASE HISTORY

2020-11-10 4.1.8
2019-09-21 4.1.7 
2018-11-18 4.1.6 

## COMMITTER & PMC DATA

There are currently 143 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members
  Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N. McKenna (knmc).
  Last PMC member withdrawal was on 2019-Sep-24 Roberto Galoppini (galoppini).

- No new committers
  Last committer addition was on 2020-Jun-30 Detlef Nannen (dnannen).
  Last committer withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid).

## COMMUNITY HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT

Community overall health is stable. Our user level support is stable. 
Translation teams are rising. We've started another attempt to rebuild a 
documentation team. We are not successful to bring volunteers on board for 
development.

Certainly, more people would be helpful and we continue to try to grow the
developer and especially the builder communities. We do have the process and
the people in place to enable us to continue development and, more
importantly, perform releases in a reasonable time-frame. We also struggle
somewhat with our commitment to continue to support, and being a viable
platform, for users who are "stuck" on older machines and OSs, since this makes
development and community builds more difficult. However, it also appears
obvious that this community is being neglected by other FOSS office platforms, 
who tend to focus on providing releases for newer platforms.

Our dev mailing lists had a 60% increase in traffic that could be attributed to 
PR and RC testing in the ramp-up to the 4.1.8 release.

We also had good participation at ApacheCon@Home with an OpenOffice track and
celebrated our 20 years with an online event.


### Download numbers

The project was happy to announce that OpenOffice (binary installation files)
were downloaded more than 300 million times. Counts were done from 2012-05-07
until 2020-10-24.

See the blog post:
https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/300-million-downloads-of-apache

The download numbers are pretty stable between 1.4 - 1.7 million per month.

Currently only ~2.4% of the downloads are initiated by OpenOffice, while ~95.3%
of the downloads are initiated by users directly. The low numbers from 
OpenOffice resulted because of a breakage of the update checker because of the 
end of support for SSL versions < 1.2, which some OpenOffice installations 
(especially older) seem to support as the only option.

The ~2.4% allocate to the following versions:

OOo 3.2.x 04.22%
OOo 3.3.0 10.27%
AOO 3.4.x 11.56%
AOO 4.0.0 05.91%
AOO 4.1.0 02.85%
AOO 4.1.1 12.27%
AOO 4.1.2 14.32%
AOO 4.1.3 17.98%
AOO 4.1.4 05.55%
AOO 4.1.5 06.46%
AOO 4.1.6 08.69%

Even if the numbers do only speak for a small part we can see that users are
updating from older versions to recent versions. We do believe that a great
portion of users remain loyal to OpenOffice even when the update notification
is broken, which could lead to the impression that OpenOffice is no longer 
alive.

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We have nearly completed the migration from the old Apache CMS to a Jbake site
for "www.openoffice.org". The repository is now in GitBox and GitHub. Jenkins
is used. The Infrastructure team has been very helpful. We still have to 
convert the "openoffice.apache.org" site.

Our Windows and Linux build bots are now functional again. Work still needs to 
be done on the RAT builds.

We are working on a Mac build bot in order to enhance our changes. The machine 
is sponsored by MacStadium. 

### Google Analytics

Apache OpenOffice uses Google Analytics. We are aware this is a controversial
topic within the ASF. Current setup is to collect as few data points as 
possible. We do not use Google Analytics for advertisement. Disclaimers are 
placed.

The data might be used in optimizing the web content. For example within the
migration of our web content.

The general controversy has reached the project. We are evaluating alternatives
that will meet our requirements. A log file does not meet our requirements, 
since nobody can read statistics from a bare text file.

## MARKETING

Due to corona all live action marketing has been currently postponed.

We have reorganized the flyer activity. Currently we are preparing material for
the next year.

### Facebook

We have one Volunteer representing Apache OpenOffice on Facebook. The activity 
is irregular. Most engagement is helping users with issues. Articles reach 
about 2.2K People.

### Twitter

Our Twitter account is maintained by one person.

## DEVELOPMENT

### Apple Code Signing

We have done one signed test build and the AOO 4.1.8 macOS DMG images are
also signed. However since Apple has changed the standards, user's may still
see a Gatekeeper warning (this is due to the AOO 4.1.x builds requiring an
older SDK). Signing is done manually but via scripting and follows Apple's
preferred process:

    https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow

### Windows Code Signing

We have signed all Windows installer for the 4.1.8 release.
There is some discussion to switch from the current Installer to a MSI
installer. But there are technical hurdles to be solved.
Windows code signing is currently a manual process.

### Unmaintained Python 2 code

Python 2 is unmaintained. We have in the development tree the external python3
support. Internal python 3 support is difficult. We are checking alternatives.
Planned for the next major release.

### New ODF Version

Our default file format, the Open Document Format, has received a new Standard
update. We plan to support this format.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache OpenWhisk Project  [Dave Grove]

## Description:
The mission of Apache OpenWhisk is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a platform for building serverless applications with functions

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenWhisk was founded 2019-07-16 (a year ago)
There are currently 50 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Rob Allen on 2019-07-16.
- Brendan Doyle was added as committer on 2020-09-26

## Project Activity:

The wave of releases in October was primarily driven by upgrading all GoLang
based components to Go 1.15 (latest release) since Go 1.12 has reached
end-of-life. As part of the openwhisk-runtime-* releases we also added support
for Swift 5.3 and updated to using the latest LTS releases of all our upstream
language runtimes.

More significantly, we finally reached the milestone of successfully releasing
openwhisk-1.0.0.  This is the first release of our core system in two years,
and the first non-incubating release of the core system. This is the first
release that includes our standalone configuration which enables a very simple
single machine deployment of OpenWhisk. We are now finally in a position of
being able to bundle the official Apache releases of our 23 separate packages
into a single coherent set of source downloads that will enable someone to
build the complete OpenWhisk ecosystem from source.

Recent releases:
- openwhisk-1.0.0 was released on 2020-11-10.
- openwhisk-client-js-3.21.3 was released on 2020-11-05.
- openwhisk-runtime-java-1.15.0 was released on 2020-10-08.
- openwhisk-runtime-php-1.15.0 was released on 2020-10-08.
- openwhisk-runtime-python-1.15.0 was released on 2020-10-08.
- openwhisk-runtime-ruby-1.15.0 was released on 2020-10-08.
- openwhisk-runtime-rust-1.1.0 was released on 2020-10-08.
- openwhisk-runtime-swift-1.15.0 was released on 2020-10-08.
- openwhisk-cli-1.1.0 was released on 2020-10-02.
- openwhisk-client-go-1.1.0 was released on 2020-10-02.
- openwhisk-wskdeploy-1.1.0 was released on 2020-10-02.
- openwhisk-runtime-go-1.16.0 was released on 2020-09-29.

## Community Health:
Community health is good with plenty of activity on dev list and slack.

Overall, it seems like development activity has somewhat increased since the
summer. Some of the statistical uptick in commits and PRs was driven by the
mechanics of making the wave of runtime releases. However, there has also been
progress on longer term feature work on the core repository.

I anticipate that we can make a splash around the long-awaited 1.0.0 release
of core OpenWhisk and the coherent unified release of all our components that
it enables.

High performance relational database layer over Apache HBase for low latency 
applications

## Issues:
No issues to report to the board at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Phoenix was founded 2014-05-20 (6 years ago)
There are currently 51 committers and 33 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Istvan Toth on 2020-07-06.
- No new committers. Last addition was Gokcen Iskender on 2020-02-07.

## Project Activity:

Apache Phoenix had its last release of 4.15.0 on 2019-12-20.
And, we were able to resolve maximum blockers for our 
next 4.16.0 and 5.1.0 releases but there are still some 
dependencies on the release of other projects. We are  
actively working towards it and expecting an RC soon. 
Thanks to RMs of these branches who are diligently 
tracking the progress.

We had our very first major release of PhoenixDB 1.0.0 on 2020-09-18. 
It's our native Python driver for accessing Phoenix via query server.

Phoenix-thirdparty 1.0.0 was released on 2020-10-26 to encapsulate 
Guava library in Phoenix. It was done to avoid 
conflict with the incompatible versions 
present in different Hadoop runtime for Phoenix.

We are also working towards the first time release of 
Omid and Tephra after the adoption of these projects 
under the Apache Phoenix PMC.

Build jobs were migrated on new Cloudbees infra 
and started using Yetus to validate new contributions. 
we appreciate the committers who worked on it.

We observe a steady flow of issues being created and resolved, 
and interactions continue to be active on mailing lists and PRs.

The trend of traffic on the user list continue to decline QoQ from the last 
few years, though more activity is observed on our dev list 
this quarter.

Even though the number of active contributors has declined by 23%, 
we were able to resolve 7% more issues from last quarter and 
our average resolution time has also improved by 32%.

PMC has not received any nomination in the last quarter 
for the new committers or PMCs, however, we should take this 
as an action item again and evaluate contributors more frequently.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
  Apache POI was founded 2007-05-16 (13 years ago) There are currently 40
  committers and 33 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
  roughly 1:1.

  Community changes, past quarter:
  - Sayi was added to the PMC on 2020-08-13
  - No new committers. Last addition was Sayi on 2020-08-04.

## Project Activity:
 - The buildsystem was reworked before the upcoming 5.0 release to better
   conform to changes in newer Java releases with full support being added for
   JPMS. Final remaining work items for a 5.0 release are discussed currently.

 - Also some ongoing bugfixing in various areas.

 - XMLBeans-4.0.0 was released on 2020-10-15, bringing a reworked packaging
   and code-structure as well as improved support for Java 9+.

## Community Health:
 - There are some questions about features/behaviour which indicates that
   Apache POI is used by a considerable number of people. Questions via email
   or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   Most activity is from a few committers. We are looking at ways to broaden
   the developer base but not many potential committers show up on the mailing
   lists currently.

   Overall issue count went up a bit there is still a fairly large number of
   reported bugs in various states of triage.

### XMLBeans
 - XMLBeans 4.0 was released, including reworked source-code structure and
   full support for newer Java versions.

   The main build for XMLBeans 4.0 is now modulized for Java 9+.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache REEF Project  [Sergiy Matusevych]

## Description:

Apache REEF, or Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework, is a library for
developing portable applications for cluster resource managers such as Apache
Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos. For example, Microsoft Azure Stream Analytics is
built on REEF and Hadoop.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

Apache REEF was founded in November 2015 (5 years ago).
There are currently 35 committers and 22 PMC members in this project.

The core developers' community is pretty stable, and we have not had
any new committers or PMC members since 2018.

## Project Activity:

we've finished a major overhaul of the project's dependencies this Summer.
That update had introduced some bugs that had blocked the release planned
for this quarter.

We've fixed the issues recently and are about to issue a new long-term stable
release of REEF 0.16.1 in November.

Following REEF 0.16.1, we will start a large experimental release of REEF 0.17
that will include a new elastic group communication functionality (currently
in a pull request, approved for merge immediately after the 0.16.1 release).

Other than that, we don't plan for any major changes in the API or the
functionality and will focus on maintaining our 0.16.1 branch.

## Community Health:

This quarter has been slow. We've completed most of the code updates in the
previous quarter, and this quarter was mostly for testing and bug fixing.

In all, we had with 1 PR opened and closed, and one commit merged into the
master. There were 9 emails in the dev mailing list.

We plan to keep the project stable and available to the public and don't expect
much new activity in the main branch after the 0.16.1 release.
We will continue our experimental work on the elastic group communication,
though.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Justin Erenkrantz]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Serf project is creating and maintaining of software 
related to HTTP and associated protocols.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Serf was founded 2015-08-18 (5 years ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Branko Čibej on 2018-09-12.
- No new committers. Last addition was Evgeny Kotkov on 2017-04-13.

## Project Activity:

Traffic remains low.

A JIRA (SERF-197) was filed around spurious Unicode characters appearing on
some of our web pages.  We worked with Infrastructure to try to identify the
source of it, but it appears to be a gremlin introduced in the ASF CMS content
workflow on some of the TLP servers (but not all).  Upon advice of ASF infra
team, we closed the issue as we could not reliably reproduce or resolve.

Responded to an old JIRA (SERF-176) around supporting easier SSL decryption
with Wireshark; no resolution or patch yet.

## Community Health:

In response to the concern raised in the prior report, the dev@ mailing list
remains the primary vehicle for communication.  However, JIRAs and Slacks are
also used as appropriate.

Posts and issues are responded in a relatively timely manner.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:
The mission of Apache SIS is the creation and maintenance of software
providing data structures for developing geospatial applications compliant
with the model of OGC/ISO international standards.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache SIS was founded 2012-09-19 (8 years ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johann Sorel on 2017-09-07.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexís Manin on 2019-07-05.

## Project Activity:
Development of new functionality continues with about 10,000 lines of code
and comment since last report (previous cycle was about 30,000 lines). However
they are still not yet the work needed for making a release. Current
development is driven by the needs of clients of SIS contributors, and we have
not been able to get the time to work on a release yet. I estimate to about 1
month the time needed for doing a release because of the need to review and
complete works in two packages. This review is desired for offering a release
with stable API and functionality. A proposed list of tasks has been posted
on user mailing list [1].

Screenshots of a JavaFX application (in very early stage) have been shown in
an ApacheCon presentation in September.

[1] https://s.apache.org/pe587


## Community Health:
The issues raised in last month report still apply:

- Low activity on the mailing list.
- All work is done on a branch not yet merged to master.

We have not yet addressed those issues because our energy is currently focused
on completing the tasks that are blocking us from doing a release.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, R and SQL as well as a rich set
of libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph
analytics.

Project status:

- We released Apache Spark 3.0.1 on September 8th and Spark 2.4.7 on September
  12th as maintenance releases with bug fixes to these two branches.

- The community is working on a number of new features in the Spark 3.x
  branch, including improved data catalog APIs, a push-based shuffle
  implementation, and better error messages to make Spark applications easier
  to debug. The largest changes have are being discussed as SPIPs on our
  mailing list.

- The new policy about -1 votes on patches that we discussed in the last
  report is now agreed-upon and active, although some developers in one area
  of the project are still concerned that their feedback was inappropriately
  ignored in the past. The PMC is communicating with those developers to
  understand their perspectives and suggest ways to improve trust and
  collaboration (including clarifying what behavior is acceptable).

Trademarks:

- One of the two software projects we reached out to July to change its name
  due to a trademark issue has changed it. We are still waiting for a reply
  from the other one, but it may be that development there has stopped.

Latest releases:

- Spark 2.4.7 was released on September 12th, 2020.
- Spark 3.0.1 was released on September 8th, 2020.
- Spark 3.0.0 was released on June 18th, 2020.

Committers and PMC:

- The latest committers were added on July 14th, 2020 (Huaxin Gao, Jungtaek
  Lim and Dilip Biswal).
- The latest PMC member was added on Sept 4th, 2019 (Dongjoon Hyun). The PMC
  has been discussing some new candidates to add as PMC members.

activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets
accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Streams was founded 2017-07-18 (3 years ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

## Community changes:
- Brian Hodge joined PMC on 2020-04-26
- Brian Hodge became a committer on 2020-04-26

## Project Activity:
- Numerous improvements made to the twitter SDK and example streams that use
  it since last report.
- Apache Streams 0.7.0 release (first binary/bytecode release) preparation is
  in progress; LICENSE work is done but NOTICE file work remains.

## Community Health:
- Adding committers and growing the PMC will remain a focus.
- We need to identify and execute strategies to reach out to likely
  interested users and developers.
- We need to conduct more regular roadmap planning, create and deliver based
  on a release schedule.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Nathan Hartman]

## Description:
The Apache Subversion® version control system exists to be universally
recognized and adopted as an open-source, centralized version control
solution characterized by its reliability as a safe haven for valuable
data; the simplicity of its model and usage; and its ability to
support the needs of a wide variety of users and projects, from
individuals to large-scale enterprise operations.

## Issues:
There are no Board-level issues at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Subversion was founded 2010-02-16 (11 years ago). There are
currently 87 committers and 49 PMC members in this project. The
Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Our developer and user community is all-volunteer and we'd like to
begin by thanking everyone for their support.

We have added one new partial committer since the last report:
Alexandr Miloslavskiy (amiloslavskiy@) received a commit bit in
Sepember 2020.

No new PMC members have been added since the last report. Our most
recently added PMC member, Jun Omae (jun66j5@) joined the PMC in May
2020.

## Project Activity:
This has been an eventful year for our project, starting with our 20th
anniversary and followed by our major 1.14.0 milestone release in the
first half of the year.

## Community Health:
This quarter, the community has been quieter than usual. Although our
developers and community members are monitoring the mailing lists and
responding to questions and discussions, our usually most active
developers have been more limited in their time. This may be a balance
for our action-packed first half of the year, or perhaps is attributed
to this year's unique challenges.

Having said so, there have been some important bugs fixed and user
requests implemented. Some of these are expected to appear in an
upcoming 1.14.1 patch release, which we have begun discussing.

Recently we learned that svn.haxx.se, "an unofficial Subversion
related mailing list archive," plans to shut down this month. Although
not part of Apache Subversion, it has been popular with our community
members for many years. The impact for our project is that the early
years of archived developer and user emails, from Subversion's birth
in 2000 through joining the ASF in late 2009, are not archived nor
available at lists.apache.org. In a community discussion about this,
there has been some indication that the popular site could be hosted
elsewhere, though it might be best if we could find a way to integrate
the early years of the archives and host them here.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Health

The project has been attempting to release more rapidly, and ideally this
would become a monthly activity, at least on the TomEE 8 branch, to follow
the Tomcat release cycle. As reported last quarter, one problem is being able
to obtain PMC votes in timely manner.  PMC activity on votes has increased
since the previous report, which is very positive.  The project still sees
the need to also add more PMC members to further address this.  Hopefully,
there will be more progress on that front next quarter.

## Activity

The project has successfully completed migration away from the Apache CMS,
which is an activity that has been in progress since February of this year.
Work continues on the website rebranding and updating of the technology
used. David Jencks has put considerable effort into migrating the website to
Antorra, which the project is still hoping to leverage.

Activity overall on the project was slightly lower this quarter as members of
the project played a significant role in getting the Jakarta EE 9 final
release out the door.  This includes 30+ specifications which all needed to
be in final form by last Friday.  With this major work done, the activity in
TomEE and many Apache projects that implement these specifications is likely
to dramatically increase as we all work to pass these newly completed TCKs.
This will be the first time in our history we can do this TCK work openly and
the project is very excited.

The project made TomEE 8.0.4 and 9.0.0-M2 releases available on August 7th.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Andy Gumbrecht on Tue Aug 11 2015

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 32 committers.
- Last committer added was Daniel Dias Dos Santos on June 23rd 2020.

## Releases:
- Apache TomEE javaee-api-8.0.5 on October 25th, 2020
- Apache TomEE 7.1.4 on September 25, 2020
- Apache TomEE 7.0.9 on September 25, 2020
- Apache TomEE 9.0.0-M2 on August 7, 2020
- Apache TomEE 8.0.4 on August 7, 2020

software related to building, monitoring, configuring, and provisioning a large 
scale content delivery network (CDN)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring the board's attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Traffic Control was founded 2018-05-15 (2 years ago)

## Project Activity:
The community is working on hard on both a 4.1.1 release and a 5.0.0 release.
Both have release candidates available are close to be approved.  Since we
have a couple of releases in flight, and since we had ApacheCon in September,
the project is currently very active.

## Community Health:
We added a new committer, Zach Hoffman!
We had a single day track as part of ApacheCon @ Home.  By all accounts this
was successful and the community was extremely excited that we were able to
get together, even if it was remotely.  We continue to see new users starting
to use our project which is encouraging however, we are still figuring out how
to get them to also be contributors.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Velocity Project  [Nathan Bubna]

## Description:
The mission of Velocity is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
A Java Templating Engine

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Velocity was founded 2006-10-24 (14 years ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2017-07-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Thomas Mortagne on 2020-03-09.

## Project Activity:
Most of the action has been in Velocity Tools with an important bugfix that
was much discussed. The fix is in, but we need some action to get a release
out soon.

Light work on Engine, with another important bugfix and a new branch to adopt
and integrate some orphaned Spring integration code waiting for integration
into the master branch and, of course, a release.

## Community Health:
Slow responses to PRs in Github. Bugfix releases need to happen for both Tools
and Engine, but there's little motion there.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Whimsy is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information 
lookup activities

## Issues:
The Whimsy PMC voted and puts forth a resolution for a new PMC Chair; we thank
Sam Ruby for his years of service.  No other issues.

## Membership Data:
Apache Whimsy was founded 2015-05-19 (5 years ago) There are currently 12
committers and 10 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Matt Sicker on 2020-04-11.
- No new committers. Last addition was Matt Sicker on 2020-04-09.

Astute system notification watchers may see that the Whimsy PMC regularly
tests Whimsy itself with well-marked "Test Sam Ruby" and similarly named
accounts; these notifications can be ignroed.

## Project Activity:
Maintenance of core Whimsy tools continues, albeit slowly, given the small 
number of active committers.  The Board Agenda and Secretary tool are the 
most active components.  While there are certainly a number of issues 
open on various other components, critical issues with core workflow 
for the Board or Secretary get dealt with. 

Many thanks to sebb for migrating the live Whimsy service to a new VM.

## Community Health:
While quiet, Whimsy has ample oversight and still has sufficient committer 
energy to maintain existing services.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
Apache Xalan exists to promote the use of XSLT. We view XSLT (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language Transformations) as a compelling paradigm that transforms 
XML documents, thereby facilitating the exchange, transformation, and 
presentation of knowledge. The ability to transform XML documents into usable 
information has great potential to improve the functionality and use of 
information systems. We intend to build freely available XSLT processing 
components in order to engender such improvements.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Xalan was founded 2004-09-30 (16 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 5 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-02-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-03-20.

## Project Activity:
All project activity has been on the Xalan-C side of the house while the
Xalan-J side has seen almost no activity. There are tickets that could be
worked on in Jira for Xalan-C but there are no been very little apparent
interest or availability from contributors.

## Community Health:
As noted above, the health of Xalan-C seems to be reviving while Xalan-J not
so much.
