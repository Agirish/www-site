 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       In a bizarre twist of fate, the past month has seemed almost "normal"
       for the ASF, at least in contrast to the previous few months. The
       world has bigger concerns than open source software, and our project
       communities continue to do their part (and more) in reaching out and
       helping where it is needed most.

       Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic looks to be getting worse for
       everyone because of the few who ignored public health warnings. We are
       all in this together, whether we all agree or not, so stay safe, stay
       home, and prepare for the long haul.

       Speaking of which, the new ApacheCon @Home finally has a green light,
       thanks to the perseverance and hard work of Rich Bowen and our
       conference volunteers. It will be exciting to see how well we can
       expand the scope and breadth of ApacheCon when we don't have to worry
       about parallel sessions and room limitations.

       Although there has been quite a bit of work summarizing the current
       status of binary builds and releases, we have yet to take any action
       that would clarify or remove restrictions on our projects. Hopefully,
       that can be discussed further (see item 10A) and accomplished over the
       next month.

       Our agenda remains light for this month's meeting. If we have enough
       preapprovals, I will skip ahead to the consent agenda (7A) after the
       roll call to confirm those items that already have consensus, and then
       we can spend the bulk of the meeting on the remaining discussion
       items. I expect this to be another 30 minute meeting, but try to
       reserve the full hour just in case we need it.

    B. President [David]

       I received 4 code of conduct complaints this month.

       Conflict of Interest Impact
       =========================== 
       The conflict of interest process continues
       to generate work. While I am sure that we'll end up being faster and
       more aware of processes the next go around, I still suspect that it
       will take us 3+ months to be able to properly execute, at least for
       volunteers, who can't devote their full-time energy to this. The 
       upside is that there are very few officers who have conflicts that
       will require us to move through the process. Still outstanding on 
       the process front is the canonical way to report conflicts and for 
       conflicts to be reviewed. 

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Operating cash on June 30th, 2020 was $1,987.7K, which is down $189.2K
       from last month’s ending balance (May 20) of $2,176.9K.  Total cash as
       of June 30th, 2020 is $3,413.6K (includes the Pineapple, Restricted
       Donation and project funds) as compared to $3,696.7K on June 30th,
       2019, (a decrease of $283.1K year over year). The June 30th 2020
       ending operating cash balance of $1,987.7K represents an operating
       cash reserve of 13.7 months based on the “Estimated” FY21 cash
       forecast average monthly spending of $144.9K/month.  The ASF actual
       operating reserve of 13.7 months at the end of June 2020 is slightly
       ahead of the June 2020 budgeted 13.5 months of reserve. The ASF
       operating reserve is well above the ASAE standard average of 6 months
       of reserve for non-profits.

       Revenue through June 30th 2020 was ahead of budget by $11.5K,
       primarily due to the timing of sponsor payments during the month. As
       compared to FY20, FY21 YTD revenue is behind by $72.1K.  This is due
       to sponsorship and registration revenue for ACNA in 2019, which is not
       happening in 2020, that is offset with more Foundation sponsorship
       payments received through June 30th 2020 as compared to Foundation
       sponsorship payments received as of June 30th 2019.

       Expenses through June 30th, 2020 are over budget by $15.9K. Some of
       this is due to some payments being missed in May 2020 and being
       released in June 2020, as well as the timing of a few payments, as
       compared to the FY21 Budget.  These have been accounted for in the
       updated cash forecast so they can be tracked.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY21 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$148.8K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$163.3K> NI or $14.6K better than
       the Budgeted NI as of June 30th 2020.  FY21 compared to FY20 as of
       June 30th 2020, while we are behind in revenue, by $72.1K as noted
       above, we are also behind on expenses by $40.8K.  So year over year as
       of June 30th 2020 we are behind in NI by $31.3K and holding to
       our FY21 Budget.  We are now two months into the new fiscal year, and
       we are doing well as compared to budget and last year.

       This month we completed the transition of our payment approvals 
       tracking from a subversion-based system to bill.com.  We are
       now able to track all approvals, and pay all of our vendors using this 
       new method.  This has already made our bill pay more reliable, and more 
       transparent, with less effort from our hard-working volunteers.  We
       will be going over the approved budget by about $4000 this year for 
       this  item because we have chosen to pay for API access.  We need API 
       access to regularly download our invoices and approvals data.  This 
       ensures that we continue to own Foundation data.

       Many thanks to Greg Stein who is writing the relevant script, and who 
       has been extremely helpful in general in getting our processes shifted 
       from subversion to bill.com.  And many thanks to our officers who made
       the shift in approvals process very easy.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In June, the secretary received 61 ICLAs, 6 CCLAs, and 2 CoI
       affirmations. We added a conflict of interest affirmation form which
       was initially tested by the secretary team. We expect to receive most
       of the remaining CoI affirmations next month.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       Main highlight: ApacheCon@Home is coming along quite swimmingly,
       especially financially, which is a huge relief compared to where we
       were a few months ago. I took over all the sponsor pursuing and
       relations for the event, and they are still rolling in and happy to
       participate, mostly at the platinum level. We have ~1,000
       registrations.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsor status: we are pursuing renewals for two Platinum, one Gold,
three Silver, and two Bronze sponsors. We await purchase orders to invoice
renewals for one Platinum sponsor. We are still seeking new points-of-contact
for one Silver sponsor, and have been trying various contacts within this
organization. One Platinum sponsor remains in arrears. Payments have been
received from one Gold Sponsor. Two Bronze Sponsors have renewed. We are in
the invoicing process with one Platinum, one Gold, and three Bronze Sponsors.
We are discussing Sponsorship options with two candidate organizations, and
continue to explore options for future sponsor prospecting.

2) Targeted sponsor status: We are in discussions with two candidate Targeted
Sponsors interested in providing support to ASF Infrastructure.

3) Sponsor Relations: We’ve connected with those Sponsors interested in
ApacheCon and have guided them to the ApacheCon@Home site and prospectus.
Ongoing Sponsor outreach, development, and communication continues.

4) Events: Sales for ASF Conferences launched 10 days ago with immediate
interest. Thus far, we have secured three sponsorship agreements and two in
flight.

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $2,670 over the

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — July 2020

I. Budget: all vendor payments are up-to-date.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising with Sponsorship communications, sales, renewals, payments,
Sponsor Relations, and securing Targeted Sponsor commitments. ASF Conference
promotions have begun across ASF channels (Weekly News Round-Ups, Monthly
summary, Twitter, and LinkedIn) now that ApacheCon@Home has been announced. We
issued the May and June Month In Review https://s.apache.org/May2020 and
https://s.apache.org/June2020 ; as well as published parts I
https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Greg and II
https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Greg2 of the "Inside Infra" interview with
Greg Stein. We're standing by on two Apache Projects for any media queries for
security-related reports. We’re coordinating translations of "Success at
Apache", and worked with ASF Brand Management on republishing ASF content as
well as several brand/logo requirements for swag production. We have also been
promoting new Feathercast interviews, liaised two third party event keynote
invitations and have updated a previously-developed executive keynote deck to
be presented at one event. We released the "Trillions and Trillions Served"
full feature documentary https://s.apache.org/Trillions-Feature and are
wrapping post-production on "Apache Innovation", the final short from the
"Trillions" documentary series with the aim of completing the project by
 mid-July. The Trillions documentary and supporting "Apache Everywhere" short
 are being translated for broadcast in China. The FY2020 Annual Report is
 ready to be published once outstanding content due has been received.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

5 June - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Hudi™ as a Top-Level
Project

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 8 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog,
including 4 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 321 news
summaries published to date. We tweeted 22 items to 57K followers on Twitter,
and posted 17 items to 41.5K followers on LinkedIn that garnered more than 49K
organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are on hold, and 2 are in
development. Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well
as PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones, "Did You Know?" success
stories, "Have You Met?" highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are
requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice
for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to six media queries. The ASF received a
total of 2,433 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we briefed one firm on a project for a Webinar. Apache
was mentioned in 19 reports, including coverage by Gartner, Forrester, 451
Research, and IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team have published minor updates to the
apache.org homepage, and plan to implement additional tweaks before the end of
the Summer. They have also launched the Apache Local Community logo, finalized
the layout for the Annual Report, added new section/playlist and uploaded new
ALC content to the ASF’s YouTube channel, consolidated/updated logos for the
FY2020 Annual Report and "Powered By" templates, updated the Fundraising page,
and is finalizing Central Services's intake form & process for new projects
before the end of the month.

IX. Events liaison: ApacheCon is back with a virtual, combined event, and we
have been helping promote the event's new format, CFP deadlines, registration
open, and sponsorship opportunities.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: we have not yet fully established
standalone accounts for the ASF to eliminate any challenges with billing
pass-throughs from HALO Worldwide, but plan to do so in the near future.

XI. Miscellany: We've counseled two organizations on promoting their
participation and products with specific Apache projects. We provided guidance
on a podling's conference participation, liaised introductions for mentoring
an incoming podling, and addressed a complaint on potentially culturally
sensitive language. We facilitated a Sponsor request to update a project blog
post from 2014, forwarded a request for petition endorsement, advised a
podling on anniversary communications, fixed podling entry metadata, provided
guidance on promotions on non-apache.org or ASF official channels, approved
image use request, facilitated request for logo use, liaised RedBubble
addition, and coordinated graduate student research interview requests.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- Much of the work this past month has been working on improving our
  basic systems (see the many details below), to provide services to
  our projects. There is no key feature to point out beyond "better".

Finances
========
Worked with the Treasurer's office around our bill.com deployment, and
testing their API system. The goal is to use the API to extract
month-end data for long-term archival and data ownership. This
workflow is not strictly about Infra, but occurred as part of the
Operations in assisting.

Infra has been able to correct all of its payment flows with bill.com
and has completed a final transition of its Accounts Payable to that
platform. The workflow has been improved for our service providers,
for the approval process, and for the final payment process. Small
refinements will be tried, related to currency conversion and wire
transfer improvements.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Consolidating Jira/Confluence accounts into Crowd, and updating the
  account selection process to avoid committers have preferential
  rights on "availid" names relative to the non-LDAP accounts.
- Deploy a new Jenkins Master. The current server is experiencing
  occasional warnings on its disk, and it is over-provisioned now that
  we've moved many systems off the shared-server to their *own*
  clusters.  Our new provisioned system will be at least as capable,
  and at half the cost.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- The team is getting closer on moving our email framework over to
  Ubuntu 20.04 and Puppet v6. This should be completed this year.
  Given the critical nature of email, we've been taking this *very*
  gradually and testing pieces. We're already running a mix of "super
  old" systems and "rolling out two weeks" systems.
- Move gitbox.a.o to a newer Python3, Puppet v6, Ubuntu 20.04
  deployement. Lots of moving parts. The team is working to untie as
  many as possible, to make "pulling the switch" less scary.

General Activity
================
- One of our staffers had traveled overseas, and then blocked from
  returning home due to the pandemic.  He was able to return in June,
  and remains healthy.
- Beginning some work on a Slack 'bot to perform various ASF functions
  for Infra, projects, and contributors. This led to a very helpful
  advancement in how we run Python services across our systems. Our
  core Python-based services (KIF, Blocky, Loggy) have been ported to
  Python 3.x and this new service-provision workflow.
- Beginning rollout of Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) systems. One particular note
  of hope is the inclusion of Apache HTTPd's mod_md in the base
  deployment, which will assist projects with LetsEncrypt certs.
- Apache Beam has migrated their donated nodes from the shared Jenkins
  Master over to a new Infra-provided cluster, so the project can
  refine their usage/control of those donated nodes.
- Many upgrades/migrations of old Ubuntu and Puppet v3 deployments to
  our new Puppet v6 and Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 systems. This process has
  stepped up its pace over the past month, and the Infra team is
  coordinating with many projects, regarding their VMs.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon @Home is progressing nicely. The event will be held
September 29 through October 1, and will use the Hopin.to platform for
the event.

The Call for Presentations (CFP) closes on Monday, July 13th, and we
hope to publish a schedule within a week or two after that date.

We are still looking for keynote presentations, and recommendations
are welcomed.

As of meeting time, we have 1078 registrations. While registration is
free, attendees have the option of making a donation as part of their
registration. Slightly less than 10% of registrants are choosing this
option.

As of this writing, we have three platinum sponsors.

Due to the removal of space and time limitations on the event, we how
have 25 different projects/topics that are organizing tracks at the
event:

* Karaf
* IoT
* Fineract
* Community
* Content Delivery
* Solr/Lucene (Search)
* Gobblin
* Ignite
* Observability
* Cloudstack
* Tomcat
* geospatial
* Graph
* Camel/Integration
* Flagon
* Cassandra
* Groovy
* httpd/Web
* HACKATHON
* Royale
* Pulsar/Bookkeeper
* Mahout
* Big Data
* cTAKES
* Incubator

Event details, registration, and call for presentations are all
available at the event website, https://apachecon.com/acah2020

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Current Events
==============

No current events

Future Events
=============

TAC has an events Calendar that it shares with other Committees for the
purposes of cross-committee planning and collaboration. Currently the calendar
has been cleared of all events until further notice.

Short/Medium Term Priorities
=====================

TAC Application Software is on the horizon, but is not urgent at this time. A
quote has been requested from one vendor at this time and we are still
awaiting a response to that request.


Mailing List Activity
=====================

No activity this month

Membership
==========

No changes to the membership this month.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

----

For some reason, the comment from 2020-06-17, didn't get to me. Apologies for
the delayed response.

I would find it difficult to give a regular overview of W3C activity because
to track activity across W3C is quite an investment of time. I try to watch
for items that might be of particular interest to ASF but mainly the role has
been to ensure members and committers can contribute to W3C groups.

Most ASF participation is in community groups, which are discussion forums.
They do not need an organisation such as ASF to support joining, but the
announcing affiliation to ASF helps promote ASF. Many community groups are
dormant.

There is representation on one Working Group (JSON-LD Working Group).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past month we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're up 2 (to 26), unresolved
issues this month.

We received Hen's resignation from two of his positions: VP Jakarta EE and
Assist VP Legal. Hen's contributions to this committee (and to the foundation
in general!) have been vital to the day-to-day operations but also to the more
strategic questions around ASF's general stance on various licensing and legal
issues. In short, we wouldn't be in nearly as good of a shape without Hen
around. We all eagerly await him coming back at some point! In the meantime
we're looking for volunteers to fill his position and hope to have this
resolved by the next month's board meeting.

Discussion around MXNet release compliance is still ongoing in LEGAL-515 and
LEGAL-516. Currently the ball is in the PPMC's court and we would recommend
Incubator following up in a few weeks on the progress.

There's been a fruitful discussion around binary distribution channels
culminating with Justin's proposal of a policy update:
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0db43d4124a1d09354e4dcebed2e5d78b311fcd16ca25d489ee03a7f%40%3Cgeneral.incubator.apache.org%3E

Progress on requesting DLA Piper help with review of the bylaws have been
slow. The reason for the slowness is surprising and somewhat embarrassing at
the same time: it appears that DLA MX has issues with email sent through my
GMail account. This has been noticed and fixed.

Thanks to KAM we've got our DMCA Designated Agent Directory - Renewal done.

Attachment 12: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

     In total, as of 1st July 2020, we're tracking 73 (last month:
     74) open issues across 36 projects, median age 61 (last month:
     53) days.  45 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     9 (last month: 9) of these issues, across 6 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  None require escalation.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 13: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations  [Henri Yandell]

With the Jakarta EE role, there are two 'open' items:

1) We have an open offer from Eclipse to sit as a guest on their EE committee.
   I don't think we have an individual who is interested in doing that however.
   It feels to me that we either find a Jakarta EE replacement, or if one is
   not available, let Eclipse know that we don't have anyone. I would like to
   inform Eclipse that I'm stepping away from the role.

2) There will be a Java package rename coming in the next few months (though my
   info is limited due to my lack of recent focus). Projects will rename
   reactively, but an active person in the role could help us be more proactive.

The Apr report listed a discussion about a trademark issue at
http://www.accumulodata.com [1], but the link was incorrect. The owner is
actively working with Amazon to reactivate the account that managed that
domain and is awaiting a response. The site will either be shutdown or
repointed to https://accumulo.apache.org.

## Membership Data:

Apache Accumulo was founded 2012-03-20 (8 years ago) There are currently 37
committers and 37 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Arvind Shyamsundar was added to the PMC on 2020-04-15
- Arvind Shyamsundar was added as committer on 2020-04-16

## Project Activity:

- No new releases this quarter, although 1.10 is still in the works.
The 1.10 releases will also be our first LTS release [2].
- There was a public chat on slack on May 13 [3].

related to executing and managing computational jobs on distributed computing 
resources including local clusters, supercomputers, national grids, academic 
and commercial clouds.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Airavata was founded 2012-09-18 (8 years ago)
There are currently 41 committers and 25 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Sudhakar Pamidighantam on 2019-12-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Aarushi Bisht on 2019-12-19.

## Project Activity:
Our last release was on March 2019. We are severely behind on releases and
this is an area we planed to focus in summer but delayed. Getting two releases
out by end of August will be our top priority.

## Community Health:
The community is doing well, we realize the need to change the culture from
working of master and develop branches to releasing at regular intervals. we
are mentoring 4 google summer of code projects. The pull request activity is
increasing steadily. Outside release catchup no other concerns on community
health.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Christian Schneider]

## Description:
Apache Aries software is a set of pluggable Java components enabling an 
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Aries was founded 2010-12-15 (10 years ago)
There are currently 58 committers and 41 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carlos Sierra Andrés on 2018-07-03.
- No new committers. Last addition was Romain Manni-Bucau on 2020-01-29.

## Project Activity:
spifly-1.3.0 was released on 2020-05-28. 
spifly-1.2.4 was released on 2020-04-12. 
cdi-1.1.0 was released on 2020-01-06.

Development activity mainly happens on jax-rs and CDI support as well as
maintenance on other modules.

## Community Health:
We have very low activity on the user list. This is partly as we just create
modules that are then used in bigger projects like Apache Karaf. Still it looks
a bit troubling.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

The mission of Apache Arrow is the creation and maintenance of software related
to columnar in-memory processing and data interchange. The project has some
level of support for 11 different programming languages.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Arrow was founded 2016-01-19 (4 years ago)
There are currently 52 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Francois Saint-Jacques on 2020-03-04.
- Liya Fan was added as committer on 2020-06-09
- Ji Liu was added as committer on 2020-06-09

## Project Activity:

- We made the 0.17.0 and 0.17.1 releases since the last board report. The
  community is readying a 1.0.0 release which will formally mark stability in
  the Arrow columnar format binary protocol and a move to semantic versioning
  of the Arrow libraries.
- We moved new JIRA issue notifications off of the dev@ mailing list to issues@
  and created a new jira@ mailing list to capture the full JIRA firehose. The
  reasoning is that this could help encourage more participating in mailing
  list discussions.
- We made changes in the codebase to remove uses of potentially non-neutral
  language that has been changed in many other open source projects.

## Community Health:

The project and contributor base continues to grow in size and
scope. We now have over 500 unique contributors since the
creation of the project.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

## Description:
Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as
Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Currently, Bahir provides extensions to
multiple distributed analytic platforms, extending their reach with a
diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data sources.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Bahir was founded 2016-05-17 (4 years ago)
There are currently 40 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:2.

## Project Activity:
Apache Bahir community continues to see a steady medium flow of
contributions enhancing the existing extensions for both
Apache Spark and Apache Flink.

As reported previously, there is a need to produce a new release
of the Flink extensions but work has not started by the community.
I hope that with the new PMC member that is focusing on this area
we can see more progress here.

As Apache Spark has released it's 3.0 release, the Bahir community
needs to identify any areas that need to be adjusted to support the
new Spark release.

## Community Health:

### Mailing List activity:
dev@bahir.apache.org had a 183% increase in traffic in the past quarter

### JIRA activity:
10 issues opened in the past quarter (66% increase)

### Committs activity:

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Stamatis Zampetakis]

## Description:
Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data not
residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Calcite was founded 2015-10-22 (4 years ago)
There are currently 50 committers and 22 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Haisheng Yuan on 2019-11-11.
- Forward Xu was added as committer on 2020-04-28
- Xing Jin was added as committer on 2020-04-28
- Vineet Garg was added as committer on 2020-04-24
- Yanlin Wang was added as committer on 2020-04-28

## Project Activity:
Avatica 1.17.0 was released on 2020-06-22. It is a small routine release that
includes a few dependency updates and bug fixes.

Calcite 1.23.0 was released on 2020-05-23, including more than 100 resolved
issues. It includes many new futures such as an SQL dialect for ClickHouse and
SESSION/HOP table functions (particularly useful for queries on streams),
along with significant improvements to the optimizer reducing optimization
latency up to a factor of 50x for some complex queries.

## Community Health:
The overall activity on the mailing lists has increased (-7% dev@, +27%
issues@) with many interesting topics some very important for the future of
the project such as the redesign of the optimizer, modelling indexes, and a
big refactoring of the ruleset.

Regarding opened/resolved issues the things are rather balanced. We had a
slight decrease in new issues (-6% JIRA, -13% GitHub) counterbalanced by a
small increase in closed issues (+14% JIRA, +4% GitHub). Since we have a large
backlog of PRs, the increased ratio of closed PRs/issues is a good sign.

Although the number of commits has slightly decreased in the past quarter
(-16%) we had more code contributors (+17%) among them some new faces which is
very promising for the future of the project.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache CXF was founded 2008-04-15 (12 years ago)
There are currently 43 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andy McCright on 2019-02-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexey Markevich on 2017-12-29.

Glen Mazza asked to go emeritus from the PMC (not committer) and that 
will be done shortly. (likely before the board meeting)

We have a few patches from various people, but nothing strong enough
for consideration as a committer.  We're trying to encourage some
additional involvement for those people.

## Project Activity:
The work this quarter was most "patch" related as we concentrated on
getting bug fixes out to users.  We also did a new version of Fediz 
which incorporates the latest CXF core release to pick up the CVE
fixes that have been done in the last few months.

As such, we released:

3.2.14 was released on 2020-06-30.
3.3.7 was released on 2020-06-30.
Fediz 1.5.0 was released on 2020-06-23.

Mater branch is now targeting 3.4 and does have a few additional
new features.   We have started a migration guide to document the
changes.   We hope to get 3.4 out this coming period as we work
with Santuario and WebServices to get the releases we need
from them.   The new release of WSS4J is now available so we 
can keep moving forward on this.

## Community Health:
For the most part, the project is making steady, but not stellar, progress.
Many of the protocols and specs that CXF implements are mature specs and don't
really change much (other than the above mentioned package change from
javax->jakarta).   Thus, steady progress and regular releases are a good
thing.   We are responding to bug reports and security issues and getting
patch releases out.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

## Description:
The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o Derby    : a relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
              testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
              persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache DB was founded 2002-07-16 (18 years ago)
There are currently 47 committers and 44 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Tilmann Zäschke on 2019-02-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Laura Stewart on 2019-03-08.

## Project Activity:
Derby-10.15.2.0 was released on 2020-02-18.

The JDO community continue to work on preparing the 3.2 release.

The Derby community has voted to sunset support for Java 9 and 10.

## Community Health:
The DB project communities have been fairly quiet. I think that the
overall reduction in activity is probably to a major extent due to
the international health challenges around COVID-19. But traffic
on the email lists and issue trackers continues at a mostly typical pace.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Shawn McKinney]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:

- ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in
  Java, which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides
  LDAP it supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.

- LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
  replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).
  This is a "schema aware” API with some convenient ways to access all types
  of LDAP servers.

- Studio: A complete directory tooling platform intended to be used with any
  LDAP server however it is particularly designed for use with ApacheDS. It is
  an Eclipse RCP application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.

- Fortress: A standards-based authorization platform that provides role-based
  access control, delegated administration and password policy services with
  an LDAP backend.

- Kerby: An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains various tools
  to access and manage kerberos principals and keytabs. It provides a rich,
  intuitive and interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
  facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2) as desired in modern
  environments such as cloud, Hadoop and mobile.

- Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC (Multi Version
  Concurrency Control) support.

- SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Directory was founded 2005-02-22 (15 years ago) There are currently 58
committers and 19 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 8:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Radovan Semancik on 2018-09-28.
- No new committers. Last addition was Lothar Haeger on 2018-12-16.

## Project Activity:

Per sub-project:

- ApacheDS: low activity: Status about the same as last quarter.  User
  questions and occasional security issues get brought to PMC, to be evaulated
  and acted on.

- LDAP API: low activity: Also had a release this quarter.

- Studio:   low activity: A release this quarter shows the project is still
  active and being maintained.

- Fortress: low activity: Also picking up a bit this past quarter with a new
  release and several improvements being made.

- Kerby:    low activity but also still being maintained and a release this
  past quarter as well.

- Mavibot:  renewed activity, transaction support added just recently.  This
  will be the new backend for ApacheDS and fix a longstanding problem with
  data corruption.

- SCIMple:  low activity:  More commits tricking into the git repository shows
  the project maintainers are still working.  Very low interaction between the
  team developing the software and the PMC.  Communication will have to
  improve to ensure this particular sub-project is moving on a forward
  trajectory.

## Community Health:

2Q brought a bit more activity in the subprojects with three releases and
renewed activity across all of the projects although still rather low.  The
PMC is active and responsive ensuring the necessary steps are being done to
keep the lights on, responding to questions, acting on pull requests, fixing
bugs, making minor improvements.

There are a few risks.  Low activity on the mailing list is a concern although
downloads are robust in directory, kerby, studio and the api and about the
same in fortress telling us that the software is still quite important to the
ecosystem.

Things are being tried to renew interest in the projects and bring fresh blood
in.  For example a new slack channel on fortress.  Also noticing an uptick in
commits.

## Releases:

- Apache Kerby 2.0.1 was released on 2020-06-03.
- Apache Fortress 2.0.5 was released on 2020-05-28.
- Apache Directory Studio 2.0.0-M15 was released on 2020-04-18.

## Mailing list activity:

Up a bit in fortress, about the same in api, down in users.

- api@directory.apache.org had a 93% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (1 emails compared to 13)
- dev@directory.apache.org had a 1% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (327 emails compared to 323)
- fortress@directory.apache.org had a big increase in traffic in the past
  quarter (11 emails compared to 0)
- notifications@directory.apache.org had a 51% increase in traffic in the past
  quarter (85 emails compared to 56)
- users@directory.apache.org had a 60% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (22 emails compared to 55)

## JIRA activity:

- 35 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (84% increase)

Attachment S: Report from the Apache DRAT Project  [Tom Barber]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Distributed Release Audit Tool is the creation and 
maintenance of software related to large scale code license analysis, auditing 
and reporting.

## Issues:
The project has little  to no activity.  A discussion ensued to shut down the
project. There is emerging consensus to do so. We propose to shut the project
down next month.

Chris Mattmann has requested a transfer of the Github repo of the project back
to his own personal github.com/chrismattmann repo. It will  not be referred
to as Apache DRAT and will just be DRAT. 3 members of the PMC agree and Roy
Fielding chimed in  that this is OK.

## Membership Data:
Apache DRAT was founded 2017-09-19 (3 years ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ahmed Ifhaam on 2018-08-30.
- No new committers. Last addition was Ahmed Ifhaam on 2018-08-28.

## Project Activity:
There is none. The project has no activity, emails, or development occuring.

## Community Health:
We propose to spin down the PMC and project next month and transfer the Github
repo back to chrismattmann/drat. It won't be Apache DRAT. It will just be
DRAT.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Druid Project  [Gian Merlino]

## Description

Apache Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database. It is
designed for workflows where low-latency query and ingest are the main
requirements. It implements ingestion, storage, and querying subsystems. Users
interface with Druid through built-in SQL and JSON APIs, as well as
third-party applications.

Druid has an extensive web of connections with other Apache projects: Calcite
for SQL planning, Curator and ZooKeeper for coordination, Kafka and Hadoop as
data sources, Avro, ORC, or Parquet as supported data input formats, and
DataSketches for scalable approximate algorithms. Druid can also be used as a
data source by Superset.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

We are currently finishing up our third major post-graduation release, 0.19.0,
which we hope to have wrapped up and ready for release in July. Additionally,
we made our second major post-graduation release 0.18.0 on April 20, followed
by a bug fix release, 0.18.1, on May 14.

To update on community happenings, since our last board report we have had 4
successful virtual meetups, with 3 more scheduled in July. In-person events
are still on hold due to COVID-19 related concerns around nonessential
gatherings.

Mailing list activity is healthy with 104 emails on the dev list
(dev@druid.apache.org) over the last quarter. Our ASF Slack channel,

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Dubbo Project  [Ian Luo]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Dubbo is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a high-performance, lightweight, java based RPC framework.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Dubbo was founded 2019-05-15 (a year ago)
There are currently 56 committers and 18 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Xinming He was added to the PMC on 2020-06-01
- Patrick Jiang was added as committer on 2020-05-05

## Project Activity:
- Dubbo 2.7.8 and its associated spring boot project are ramping down
- Dubbo Spring Boot 2.7.7 is released
- Dubbo 2.7.7 is released
- Dubbo hessian-lite 3.2.8 is released
- Dubbo go 1.4.0 is released
- Dubbo go-hessian2 1.6.0 is released

## Community Health:

In the past quarter, we continued to develop committers and PMC. All
candidates are developed from Dubbo-go community not only because this
community keeps active but also because we PMC all agree the golang
implementation of Dubbo can help us to adapt to cloud native trend better. We
observe two communities interact with each other more frequently in the
mailing list, and two teams start to marge into one, which is very good
phenomenon. Overall speaking, we continue to keep the reasonable good shape
with regarding to the community health.

- dev@dubbo.apache.org had a 37% increase in traffic in the past quarter (214
  emails compared to 156)
- notifications@dubbo.apache.org had a 33% decrease in traffic in the past
  quarter (1605 emails compared to 2381)
- 483 commits in the past quarter (-41% decrease)
- 89 code contributors in the past quarter (-10% decrease)
- 311 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-12% decrease)
- 293 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-18% decrease)
- 400 issues opened on GitHub, past quarter (43% increase)
- 280 issues closed on GitHub, past quarter (21% increase)

Overall community health is good, but we should do better on code commits.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Vishwas Babu A J]

## Description:
Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Fineract was founded 2017-04-18 (~3 years ago) There are currently 37
committers and 18 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- 1 new committer - Yemdjih Kaze Nasser

## Project Activity:

The Fineract community maintains two active projects.

Fineract 1.x - Current generation product which is widely used.


Fineract-CN - Next Generation framework which is still under active
development and has not been officially released


- Fineract 1.x

The 1.4 release is still pending as the community is working to find volunteer
release managers and maintainers to help cut the release. The community is
still anticipating a number of significant contributions for the 1.5 release
so would like to urgently get the 1.4 release shipped.  The community
recognizes that for the contribution model and upstream development to work
properly, contributions need to come from the individuals and committers
belonging to organizations building and using the software in production
environments (e.g. commercial solutions powered by Fineract). Despite a recent
uptick since April 2020 in contributions from volunteers and interns,
contributions from the ecosystem, especially ongoing maintenance and release
management from the ecosystem of expert fineract "users", is at relatively low
levels.

Three intern candidates have been brought on directly through Apache Software
Foundation for Google Summer of Code and are making great progress on
implementing checkstyles, refactoring the code, hardening the codebase,
upgrading core dependencies, implementing live API docs, migrating to
EclipseLink and more. In addition there is one Outreachy intern working on
some Fineract issues and several of the seventeen Mifos GSOC interns who are
contributing to Apache Fineract via Fineract CN Mobile, Credit Bureau
integration module, and more. To learn more about each intern, visit this blog
post from the Mifos Initiative at https://mifos.org/blog/gsoc-2020/.

PMC members, Awasum Yannick and Michael Vorburger are continuing to do timely
reviews of pull requests being submitted and have overseen a 5x increase in
the number of resolved ticket over the past quarter. Great work to their
leadership, hard work, and strong example they're setting for the rest of the
community.


- Fineract-CN

The community is still trying to push towards a stable first release of
Fineract CN centered around a minimum set of mature and stable microservices.
There is discussion regarding the twin goals of a) deployable MVP solution,
and b) base level of libraries to ensure upstream contribution models from the
organizations using the code in production. Progress is still slow on getting
the few organizations, actively using the codebase, and their expert "users", 
to contribute back.  Focus is currently on sufficient deployment tools to make
the project more approachable for new devs.

Work is still ongoing to get the public demo server live. GSOC projects
related to live API documentation as well as additional UIs on top of Fineract
CN are in progress. Work is ongoing to provide an Open Banking API layer on
top of Fineract CN to all third party and trusted first-party apps to securely
connect.


## Community Health:

Both projects continue to retain healthy discussion with 534 mails sent to our
dev mailing list, which amounts to a minor seasonal (~25%) increase in traffic
compared to the previous quarter (425)

Activity rates on JIRA have seen a sharp increase (nearly 5x) thanks to the
tireless efforts of Michael Vorburger to encourage contributions, review pull
requests in a timely manner and recognize incoming contributions in a weekly
Fineract Weekly Resolved Issues update and Dashboard on JIRA. Thanks as well
to Petri and Awasum for their contributions, mentorship and reviews of code
along with our Fineract interns.

- Fineract 1.x.
- 200 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (50 in the previous quarter)
- 129 JIRA tickets resolved in last 3 months (26 in the previous quarter)

- Fineract CN
- 8 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (29 in the previous quarter)
- 0 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months (3 in the previous
  quarter)

Community members, Javier Borkenztain and Edward Cable, are working with the
ApacheCon committee to plan out a Fineract track for ApacheCon @Home.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Fluo Project  [Keith Turner]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Fluo is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to the storage and incremental processing of large data sets

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Fluo was founded 2017-07-18 (3 years ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 13 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Karthick Narendran was added to the PMC on 2020-04-16
- Karthick Narendran was added as committer on 2020-04-17

## Project Activity:
For Fluo added getAsync() methods, updated build for JDK14, and removed
redundant code in the scripts.

For Muchos a lot of work was done to automatically format, test, and
statically analyze the source code. These steps ensure consistency of, and
minimize the chance of syntax-related regressions, in new contributions. Muchos
was updated to use the simplified WAL config for cloud storage AND log4j2 in
Accumulo 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT. Muchos improved support for working with SNAPSHOT
versions of Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Accumulo.  Muchos was updated to correctly
handle multiple installed java versions.

## Community Health:
There was less overall activity this quarter than the last, less commits and
PRs.  There was more activity on the dev list though, emails from new
contributors seeking help. There were 27 commits from 6 committers and 2
non-committers. Both non-committers were first time contributors.

Fluo has not done a release in a long time and this is not good.  I reported
this on the last board report. We have a lot of good unreleased changes.  I am
going to work on making a release vote happen in the upcoming quarter.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli]

## Description:
The mission of Hadoop is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Distributed computing platform

## Issues:
As Ozone gearing towards the GA release, Marton started a thread to discuss
the plan to make Ozone a TLP. There is a general consensus within the
community to move Ozone out of Hadoop. The proposal is still being discussed,
no actual steps are taken yet. [DISCUSS] making Ozone a separate Apache
project https://s.apache.org/wpc3m

## Membership Data:

## Project Activity:

Diversity&inclusion has recently received attention. A discussion thread
is happening in the private mailing list
to take actions to make the Hadoop project more inclusive, including removing
offending branch names, source code and etc.

Sammi Chen is the RM for Ozone 0.6 release. Brahma Reddy Battula is
continuing on the Hadoop 3.3.0 release and preparing the initial release
candidate. Since the Submarine project has become its own TLP, the Submarine
code is removed from the Hadoop 3.3.0 release. Gabor started releasing
Hadoop 3.1.4

## Community Health:
The weekly Ozone dev community sync is going strong. Recently, a separate,
Asia-Pacific time zone friendly sync for the Ozone community is started.

The new user-zh@ mailing list is not being well utilized in this quarter.
We should promote to make the project more inclusive.

Community Diversity:
Of the new committers added to the project, 4 out of 7 are affiliated with
Cloudera. 4 out of 7 are located in Asia.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Duo Zhang]

## Description:
Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational
database. Apache HBase gives you low latency random access to billions of rows
with millions of columns atop non-specialized hardware.

hbase-thirdparty is a set of internal artifacts used by the project to
mitigate the impact of our dependency choices on the wider ecosystem.

hbase-connectors is a collection of integration points with other projects.
The initial release includes artifacts for use with Apache Kafka and Apache
Spark.

hbase-filesystem contains HBase project-specific implementations of the Apache
Hadoop FileSystem API. It is currently experimental and internal to the
project.

hbase-operator-tools is a collection of tools for HBase operators. Now it is
mainly for hosting HBCK2.

hbase-native-client is a client library in C/C++, in its early days.


## Issues:

## Membership Data:
Apache HBase was founded 2010-04-21 (10 years ago)
There are currently 89 committers and 53 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Lijin Bin was added to the PMC on 2020-05-25
- Wei-Chiu Chuang was added as committer on 2020-05-13

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:

2.2.5 was released on 2020-05-21.
hbase-thirdparty-3.3.0 was released on 2020-04-29.
2.1.10 was released on 2020-04-08.

2.3.0 is about to come out but the RC0 sank because we found some compatible
issues. New RCs is in place for voting.

We made progress on hbase-native-client. We got some new commits for cleaning
up the build system and testing.

2020-4-21 is our 10th anniversary, the foundation posted a blog about it
https://s.apache.org/m2pxf

Josh Elser has done a feathercast to talk about the history and the current
state of HBase.
https://s.apache.org/1m3gw

We discussed about 'Removing problematic terms from our project'
https://s.apache.org/cpk1y
Of the four individual proposals articulated in this discussion, there is
consensus on three, and differing opinions on the fourth, but sufficient
numbers of PMC have been supportive to sustain a release vote, unless the vote
becomes controversial, which we can deal with at the time. There is sufficient
support to move forward with contributions on the JIRAs highlighted in the
discussion.

## Community Health:
- Mailing list activity:
dev@hbase.apache.org:

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Hudi Project  [Vinoth Chandar]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Hudi is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to providing atomic upserts and incremental data streams on Big Data

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Hudi was founded 2020-05-19 (2 months ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- No new committers were added.
- 4 committers, 1 PMC candidates in the pipeline

## Project Activity:
Apache Hudi released 0.5.3, which marks the first release since graduation.
Release contained more than 30+ bug/performance fixes. The community also used
this opportunity to rework the release guide as a TLP. This sets us up well
for future releases.

We continued to make steady progress towards the 0.6.0 release, which delivers
several large features. To this end, we have merged ~25 pull requests,
contributors have proposed ~15 new pull requests.

Press/Articles:
- Uber published an article on Apache Hudi graduation
  https://eng.uber.com/apache-hudi-graduation/
- PMC Member Nishith Agarwal presented Hudi at BerlinBuzz words

## Community Health:
158 emails (-33%) on dev mailing list, across 38 topics, 41 participants.
1841 (-25%) interactions across Github Issues, Pull requests, JIRA issues.
~500 messages on Slack

Engagement metrics are lower month over month, even as the absolute values 
remain healthy. 
We don't clearly understand any patterns here (seasonal or otherwise).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Iceberg Project  [Ryan Blue]

## Description:
Apache Iceberg is a table format for huge analytic datasets that is designed
for high performance and ease of use.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Iceberg was founded 2020-05-19 (2 months ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
In July, the community held one sync meeting to discuss general topics, and
one specifically to discuss how to include both groups that have been working
on integration with Hive.

To address the question on the last board report, the community sync meetings
are video conferences that anyone in the community is welcome to attend. The
discussion is documented and summarized for anyone that can't attend. We have
found these to be a good way to exchange context and ideas more quickly, but
recognize that this isn't the best way for some people to participate and so
we don't consider these a forum for making decisions or voting. If we come to
a tentative conclusion on a topic, it is still open for further discussion
on the dev list. The idea for this comes from the Parquet community that has
been doing this for several years.

Development activity:
* Spark vectorized reads for flat schemas was merged and benchmarked
* The Spark 3 integration branch was merged into master
* Name mapping for Parquet files without IDs was committed
* And action to compact data files was added
* Support was added for managing and adding delete files in table metadata
* Refactoring to support reuse Spark components for Flink
* Several PRs for Flink support have been committed and more are open
* CI tests for JDK 11 have been added

The community also plans to release 0.9.0 with Spark 3 support soon.

## Community Health:
Most community metrics have again increased in the last month, although dev
list traffic is a bit lower. More importantly, the community has made further
progress on several large areas with different groups leading the efforts,
like Hive support, Spark 3 support, and Flink support.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for July 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 45 podlings incubating. In June, podlings executed 8 
distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members and two retired.

There was one IP clearance in June. There is one new podling Pegasus, 
HBlock is still being discussed, and one new proposal is being prepared. No 
projects graduated last month.

This month we were missing reports from AGE, Annotator, Livy, Warble
and  Weex. All will be asked to report next month. This is the second time 
that Warble has failed to report. It's uncertain why a large number of
podling failed to report but it's likely to be related to current external
events.

As reported last month, MXNet podling releases and download page were not 
in line with ASF release and distribution policy. Since then, further 
issues have been found, as well as trademark and branding issues. The 
project has taken steps to correct these issues, but there are still some 
outstanding concerns. There may not be an active PPMC, as only two people 
seem to be dealing with the issues.

There is currently an ongoing conversation on providing clear guidance to 
podlings who want to distribute releases on various platforms. This 
guidance has existed for some time but has been marked draft.

The Incubator will organise a track at the upcoming Apache@home conference.

A couple of mentors have been added and removed from projects.

Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases and release and 
header policy graduations and new proposals.

Two podlings SDAP and Spot still need to sort out their roster and private 
mailing list subscriptions. They have been reminded again to correct this.

## Community

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  APISIX have already completed all issue, here is a review since the last 
  report.
  1. We released APISIX 1.2, APISIX 1.3, those release are done by 
  twenty-eight contributors
  2. We added five committers and two PPMC members
  3. Resolved branding issues, such as:
    - The website(http://apisix.apache.org/) shows more clearly that it is 
    an Apache incubator project
   - The APISIX luarocks package site shows more clearly that itis an 
    Apache incubator project
   - Removed external links in github's readme document

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  - We have released APISIX 1.2, APISIX 1.3,
  which brings more new features to APISIX and makes APISIX more 
  user-friendly,
  such as support for ETCD cluster, support for CORS, etc.,
  please check CHANGELOG for details
  - Since the last report, APISIX has elected two PPMC members and five 
  committers.
  Now APISIX has a total of 23 committers and 85 contributors.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  APISIX developed very quickly in the first half of 2020.
  We elected two PPMC members and five commiters,
  as well as a large number of new features and performance improvements,

## Liminal

Apache Liminal is an end-to-end platform for data engineers & scientists, 
allowing them to build, train and deploy machine learning models in a 
robust and agile way. The platform provides the abstractions and 
declarative capabilities for data extraction & feature engineering followed 
by model training and serving. Apache Liminal's goal is to operationalise 
the machine learning process, allowing data scientists to quickly 
transition from a successful experiment to an automated pipeline of model 
training, validation, deployment and inference in production, freeing them 
from engineering and non-functional tasks, and allowing them to focus on 
machine learning code and artifacts.

Liminal has been incubating since 2020-05-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Bootstrapping resources and code donation
  2. Building community
  3. First release

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Liminal is in early incubator stage, creation of resources has been done 
  (gitbox, jira, etc).
  The initial committer list submits ICLA and we are preparing the code 
  donation.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  This is the first report for Liminal.

## Milagro

Milagro is core security infrastructure and crypto libraries for
decentralized networks and distributed systems.

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Continue to build relevant and useful crypto libraries and
  applications for decentralized networks in order to grow the
  ecosystem of users and contributors to the project.
  2. Continue to improve compliance with the Apache Way. In
  particular to update the Milagro website and other project
  sites (e.g. Whimsy) in accordance with Apache policies.
  3. Further releases to increase the scope of the Milagro
  project, extend the capability of existing releases
  and to demonstrate improved compliance with the Apache Way.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No significant issues, however, similar to the last report, several
  administrative aspects of the project still have not been dealt with
  (updating Whimsy, countersigning code signing keys, checking download
  links, confirming brand/trademark compliance etc.).  In addition to
  this, the private mailing list subscriber list needs clearing of any
  non-PPMC members and Kirk Baird still needs to be officially added
  to the list of committers.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  No change.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Development has progressed on the Multi Party Computation (MPC) library
  working towards an official release.  The library has been successfully
  reviewed by the NCC Group and renowned cryptographer Dr. Michael Scott.
  Their recommendations have been implemented and their reports will be
  added to the library prior to release.  There are plans to improve upon
  the library post release - in particular to extend the capability from
  a 2 of 2 threshold to an arbitrary m of n threshold.

  Development has also progressed on the version of the core cryptographic
  library written in Rust.  More work is required for this to be in a
  release ready state.

## MXNet

A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning

MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Address licensing and trademark issues for the binary releases in the
  community.
  - ONGOING. See update in the next section.
  2. Address release issues. Successfully and smoothly make releases
  without WIP disclaimer.
  - ONGOING.
  3. Improve development process and tooling to help reduce the overhead of
  releases
  - ONGOING.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  1. Binary Distribution Licensing Issue
  2. MXNet 2.0 first public beta, interoperable with NumPy, is on the way:
     https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/18
     RFC: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16167

#### Issues with releases and distributions

##### Background
  In May 2020 The MXNet PPMC has proactively initiated a ASF policy 
  compliance
  review [1] and a license review [2] with the Apache Legal team.

  The license review uncovered that

  - Building unmodified MXNet release source code with the optional NVidia 
  GPU
  support enabled results in a binary subject to restrictions of NVidia 
  EULA.
  - PPMC members and committers uploaded convenience releases to
  repository.apache.org which contain Category-X components. Both GPL and
  NVidia EULA components were found.

  The policy review uncovered that:

  - Prior ASF guidance to the PPMC (December 2018 legal review [3]) was
  incomplete
  and did not include a reference to the "unwritten" rule that convenience
  binary distributions created by third-parties using ASF Trademarks must 
  not
  include Category-X components. Based on this discovery, the Draft 
  Downstream
  Distribution Branding Policy was updated in June 2020 to include the
  "unwritten" requirement. Based on the updated guidance, PPMC discovered
  various third-party trademark infringements.

  The policy review did not yet conclude on the questions if

  - The PPMC may create nightly development builds (audience restricted to 
  dev
  list subscribers as per Release policy [4]) for the purpose of testing and
  developing MXNet;

##### List of issues and their status

  Justin classified the issues into 14 items.

  1) Source and convenance binary releases containing Category X licensed
  code.

  See summary from license review in Background section. Source code 
  releases do
  not contain Category X code; Takedown of binary releases on
  repository.apache.org is pending on Apache Infra. (Trademark infringements
  of 3rd-parties such as on pypi are discussed separately)

  2. Website giving access to downloads of non released/unapproved code.

  Website contained links to nightly development builds which have been
  removed [5];
  Going forward the PPMC intends to begin periodical voting on Alpha and 
  Beta Releases which will then be linked from the website.

  3. Website giving access to releases containing Category X licensed code.

  Website contained links to third-party distributions incorporating
  Category-X
  components (see summary from license review above). Disclaimers were added
  to the website clarifying the third-party status of the releases and their
  licenses. [5]

  4. Web site doesn't given enough warning to users of the issues with non
  (P)PMC releases or making it clear that these are not ASF releases.

  Website contained links to third-party distributions incorporating
  Category-X
  components (see summary from license review above). Disclaimers were added
  to the website clarifying the third-party status of the releases and their
  licenses. [5]

  5. Maven releases containing Category X licensed code.

  See summary from license review in Background section. Source code 
  releases do
  not contain Category X code; Takedown of binary releases on
  repository.apache.org is pending on Apache Infra. [6] (Trademark
  infringements of 3rd-parties are discussed separately)

  6. PyPI releases containing Category X licensed code.

  There are no PiPy releases by the PPMC. Please refer to the trademark
  infringement section of the report.

  7. Docker releases containing Category X licensed code.

  There are no Docker releases by the PPMC. Please refer to the trademark
  infringement section of the report.

  8. Docker releases containing unreleased/unapproved code.

  There are no Docker releases by the PPMC. The existence of third-party
  releases
  containing unreleased code was approved in [3] and is also in line with 
  the current Downstream Distribution Branding Draft Policy. ("using any
  particular revision from the development branch is OK" [3])

  9. Trademark and branding issues with PiPy and Docker releases.

  There are no PiPy releases by the PPMC. Please refer to the trademark
  infringement section of the report.

  10. Trademark and brand issues with naming of releases.

  There are no binary releases by the PPMC besides the repository.apache.org
  releases discussed above, which are being removed.
  Please refer to the trademark infringement section of
  the report.

  11. Developer releases available to users and public searchable
  https://repo.mxnet.io / https://dist.mxnet.io

  Links to the nightly development builds were removed from the MXNet 
  website and
  a robot.txt file was added to prevent indexing of the sites. These 
  websites are removed from Google search index.

  12. Releases and other nightly builds on
  https://repo.mxnet.io / https://dist.mxnet.io containing category X
  licensed code.

  Neither of the two site contains Releases. It is an open question of the
  policy
  review (see Background section above) if nightly development builds may or
  may not contain Category X components.

  13. Lack of clarity on all platforms for what is an ASF release and what 
  is not.

  https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/releases?after=1.2.0 previously
  did not distinguish MXNet releases prior to MXNet joining the Incubator.
  Disclaimers
  were added. Other PPMC platforms do not contain references to non-ASF
  releases
  (MXNet releases made prior to MXNet joining the ASF). The PPMC is aware of
  old third-party releases created prior to MXNet joining the ASF which are
  still
  available, but can be clearly separated from the ASF MXNet releases due to
  the lack of reference to the Apache foundation. PPMC was able to find an
  exemplar
  such release at [7]. If there are concerns from the Incubator, PPMC can
  request
  the third-parties to take down these releases, as editing their 
  Description to include
  references to events (MXNet joining Apache) is not
  supported due to immutability constraints. [8]

  14. Branding and release of 3rd parties containing unreleased code.
  (e.g.


  https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/mxnet-release-notes/rel_20-0
  3.html)

### Date of last release:

  2020-02-20

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

  2020-03-02

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  Yes. In particular, Bob has provided guidance on the license and 
  trademark issue.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

  PPMC notes that there are multiple trademark infringements based on both 
  the redistribution of MXNet with addition of unreleased code and the
  redistribution of MXNet with Category-X GPL and Category-X NVidia
  components. PPMC intends to handle both issues separately.

#### Unauthorized redistribution of unreleased code by third-parties

  PPMC members have reached out to the offending third parties (Nvidia
  Corporation
  and Amazon Web Services) via inofficial channels and notified them of the
  problem. If the problem is not resolved by the end of July 2020, PPMC will
  request guidance from the Brand Management Team on how to formally notify
  the offenders of their trademark infringement.

#### Unauthorized redistribution of Category-X GPL and NVidia CUDA EULA 
  components by third-parties

  PPMC members note that the issue of "NVidia CUDA EULA infecting any
  application
  built with CUDA support" is an industry-wide problem. PPMC is not aware of
  any individual or corporation correctly labeling their binary 
  distributions
  subject
  to the NVidia CUDA EULA. Instead, PPMC found that for example Facebook
  claims distribution of PyTorch under BSD License (BSD-3) and Google claims
  distribution of Tensorflow under Apache 2.0 License, despite both being
  subject to the CUDA EULA. Thus, PPMC has contacted NVidia Corporation and 
  requested
  NVidia Corporation to add clarifying language that applications based on 
  the CUDA SDK with material additional functionality may be licensed under
  a license
  of the application owner's choice, consistent with existing industry
  "practice".
  The issue was also discussed with NVidia and other Deep Learning Framework
  implementers during the Nvidia Deep Learning Framework Developer Council
  meeting,
  during which NVidia promised to conclude their internal review and 
  follow-up with the PPMC.

  PPMC thus recommends to give NVidia the chance to clarify and improve 
  their
  license. As NVidia employs a team for working on MXNet, the PPMC is
  optimistic
  about receiving a detailed clarification and resolution from NVidia.

  If NVidia fails to clarify their license or the resolution is 
  unsatisfactory
  within Q3 2020, the PPMC will notify any third-parties about their license
  infringement and ask them to take down or rename their redistributions
  containing Category-X pieces.

  Due the substantial overhead of trademark-infringement takedown notices 
  for any
  involved party, PPMC is further awaiting NVidia's clarification prior to
  contacting third-parties about trademark infringement due to inclusion of
  GPL
  components. This is to avoid sending two separate takedown notices in case
  of an unsatisfactory response by NVidia.

  The following downstream software distributors are known to the PPMC to be
  using the name MXNet while redistributing Category-X components

  - pypi.org
  - hub.docker.com
  - ngc.nvidia.com
  - aws.amazon.com

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: Good to see progress on these issues. But I have two concerns
  a) you may not have an active PPMC b) branding all release as "3rd party" may
  not be the best way to solve the issue. Hopefully the license discussion will
  be fruitful.

## Spot

Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model
and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Increase community activity in mailing list and commits 
  2. Make the product more approachable for new contributors and users 
  3. Develop a roadmap that focuses on delivering one use case effectively

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Not at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have on-boarded new contributors in the past quarter, who are very
  excited to help us increase our capacity to address issues and move
  us to a new level of maturity.  One of the new contributors has adopted
  the responsibility of secretary and ensuring process compliance and 
  improvement for the project facing Apache leadership. 

  We have continued to make further strides towards compliance with all
  Apache Software Foundation requirements for incubating projects,
  particularly ensuring that all contributors are on the private list.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  As the project has a large backlog of issues inherited from before its
  contribution, we continue to emphasize finding issues that are still 
  relevant and blocking progress, and addressing them.  We have engaged 
  with a dozen issues and resolved quite a few of them.  There is work
  that is ongoing to remove a third party dependency which is a major
  impediment to installing the product.

## Teaclave

Teaclave is a universal secure computing platform, making computation
on privacy-sensitive data safe and simple.

Teaclave has been incubating since 2019-08-20.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Improve project structure and documentation
  2. Grow the community (attracting more committers, contributors, users)
  3. Publish Apache releases (resolving logistics on Apache release)

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, we started to reach out to people using the
  project and collect suggestions and encourage them to join in the
  community. We have found four organizations and eight projects that
  are using either the Teaclave platform and Teaclave's Rust SGX SDK.

  We also created a website for the project:
  https://teaclave.apache.org/, which contains project description,
  community, contributors, documentations and blog posts.

  We started a thread to discuss the logo design, but haven't received
  any proposal for now. We will drive this issue in the next few weeks.

  We observed more people posting feature suggestions and
  build/deployment issues. More than five new contributors begin to
  contribute bug fixes and introduce new examples.

  We started preparing the first Apache release such as logistics on
  licenses of third-party libraries.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, we have completed the development roadmap
  towards the first public release
  (https://github.com/apache/incubator-teaclave/issues/121) proposed
  last year. We began to put more efforts on improving documents and
  building community.

  We wrote many documents in recent weeks including:

  - Try: Tutorials on using the Teaclave platform.
  - Design: Some explanations of design choices we made.
  - Contribute: Documents on contributing to Teaclave, such as
  debugging tips and Rust development guideline.
  - Codebase: Documents for each sub-directory (i.e., libraries in 
  Teaclave).
  - API Docs: Generated API documentations like APIs of Client SDK.

  We also provided more examples to help beginners to understand the
  basic usages of the projects.

  project more approachable for newcomers. Additionally, we see some
  regular contributors recently mainly focus on helping to improve
  examples, SDK, etc.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  Yes, our mentors help us with the website development and logo design.
  Also, our mentors provided valuable thoughts regarding Intel's recent
  security issues.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

  We don't find any 3rd parties incorrectly using the podling's name and
  brand. The VP, Brand has approved the project name.

## Project Activity:
There continues to be substantial development work on v2.0, with the
framework being "re-platformed" to run on top of Spring Boot.
The main focus during the last quarter was the UI:

- Common UI model as the basis for multiple viewers
- UI regression suite - using Cypress.io
- groundwork for Vaadin (w.i.p.)
- kroviz viewer (w.i.p.)
- a new JavaFX viewer

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache James Project  [Benoit Tellier]

## Description:

The Apache James Project delivers a rich set of open source modules and
libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which build into an
advanced extensible mail server running on the JVM.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:

Apache James was founded 2003-01-22 (17 years ago)
There are currently 38 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Antoine Duprat on 2016-03-11.
- David Leangen was added as committer on 2020-07-06

## Project Activity:

A lot happened during the past few months. We onboarded a new community member
struggling with running Apache JAMES, and proposing himself to refresh the
Apache James documentation. This effort triggered many interesting
discussions:

 - About the documentation, which mixes different servers together and is not
   organized by version. We started working on a new documentation website
   based on Antora to address these limitations.
 - We decided to reorient our server branding from a technical perspective
   into a use case oriented perspective.
 - We decided to improve the developer experience by migrating our build
   system to Gradle and re activate builds on Apache infrastructure.

We encounter procedural issues with the James 3.5.0 release, these technical
concerned will be addressed and a new vote triggered.

## Community Health:

 - server-dev@james.apache.org had a 113% increase in traffic in the past
 quarter (2224 emails compared to 1042) reflects the increase of discussions
 on the list.

 - We hold our first community call, which should happen on a regular basis 
(at least every three months). In order to be inclusive, the topics were 
first exposed on the mailing list, and the discussion summary posted 
on the mailing list too.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud-agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

The project is modernizing several stale dependencies that have caused issues
for our users and developers: Guava, gson, and OkHttp. Otherwise, the activity
remains low.

Modernizing gson is challenging due to our dependency on OSGi and on some gson
packages that were removed from the OSGi bundle in newer versions. Keeping
OSGi support has become challenging due to the lack of expertise across the
active members. We are discussing different approaches and the tradeoffs of
dropping support for that (and probably offloading that to Karaf or other
projects) so that we can move forward the project without being blocked on
this while providing a way for existing OSGi users to keep using jclouds.

== Community ==

The project has merged several small pull requests from 7 contributors over
the last three months.  Notably, one user stepped forward with a solution to
the gson dependency issue.

There was also interest from a user in helping us modernizing the builds and
improve our Jenkins setups. We voted on welcoming him as a committer to
facilitate as much as possible getting involved (he was a well-known member of
the community that has been maintaining jclouds-related projects for a long
time), but even though communication was fluid at the beginning, just before
the vote and after it, all communication attempts failed and we never heard
from him again, so he was not added to the committer group in the end.

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Complete dependency upgrades and release 2.3.0 in 3Q2020.

== Releases ==

The last major jclouds release, 2.2.0, took place on 2019-10-21.
The last bugfix release, 2.2.1, took place on 2020-05-14.

framework for building Semantic Web applications

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Aaron Coburn on 2019-01-22.
- No new committers. Last addition was Greg Albiston on 2019-07-08.

## Project Activity:

Jena 3.15.0 was released on 2020-05-19. This release has introduced a problem
with one of the server binaries, and new users have run into problems as
witnessed by StackOverflow and users@ messages. The project is starting a new
release rather than wait for usual 3-4 months between releases.

## Community Health:

Overall community health is good with normal levels of email on users@, JIRA
tickets, GitHub PRs and StackOverflow questions.

Of note, is a report from a user that they had loaded 12billion triples (a 
WikiData dataset) into a Jena TDB database. This is the largest publicly
reported load for Jena. Query performance was reported to be satisfactory.

- No new committers. Last addition was Dave Koelmeyer on 2016-04-06.
  Glen Mazza requested to step down as a committer, due to 
  inactivity last past years

## Project Activity:
2.11.0.M7 was released on 2020-05-28, featuring a public API while mantaining
backwards compatibility with current 3rd party extensions, and workflows'
state saved between restarts. After that we've had a very quiet quarter, with
almost no questions on MLs, and no further commits.

## Community Health:
There is enough oversight, with questions getting answered on MLs and enough 
people to vote on releases. Decline on MLs activity probably related to the 
absence of development post 2.11.0.M7, but it is not unusual for the project
to have these kind of periods once in a while.

- 1.10.1 was released on 2019-11-20.
- 1.11.1 was released on 2019-11-20.

## Community Health:
- Traffic to the dev mailing list had a 55% increase since the past quarter.

- Website traffic has remained mostly steady, increasing between 0% and 7%
  across users, new users, sessions, sessions per user, page views, and page
  sessions; and decreasing 2% in average session duration.

- Public IM activity over the community Slack channel is down somewhat, with
  the average daily number of posts in public channels having dropped 36%, and
  both weekly and daily active users averaged across the quarters changing
  less than 3% each.

- Development activity measured in number of commits has reduced significantly
  (-54%), likely due to a combination of developers shifting roles, a couple of
  projects being in the design phase for much of the quarter, and several
  developers' changes in  working environments and schedules on account of
  COVID-19. Code was authored by 14 contributors (down 46% since last
  quarter), 2 of which are new to the project.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description:

place for innovation where committers of the foundation can experiment with new 
ideas

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at the current time. 

## Membership Data:

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Simone Tripodi on 2011-06-14.
- No new committers. Last addition was Juan P. Gilaberte on 2018-05-30.
## Project Activity:
Labs remains largely inactive. The one "open" lab we have has seen no activity
for over a year. 

## Community Health:
The community is neither healthy nor unhealthy, the PMC continue to be 
able to offer governance and could respond to a roll call, but 
there is little going on beyond that.
I intend to open the debate about the future of labs before
the next baord report is due. Past cycles have seen 
volunteer energy offered for Labs itself but limited interest 
from commiters who might benefit from creating a lab of their own. 
It feels like this cycle should address that head on.

Maven Resolver Ant Tasks 1.2.1 was released on 2020-05-29.
Maven Reporting Exec 1.5.1 was released on 2020-06-19.


## Community Health:
I've mentioned the maven-wrapper already earlier, but I can now
confirm that all is in place. There's a new maven-wrapper-plugin and
the wrapper code is now part of the Maven Distribution. This request
was mainly driven by the community and will make it easier to create
reproducible builds.

Another long standing wish has made it to the master branch of Maven:
the build/consumer pom. Up until now the pom.xml has been distributed
(installed/deployed) as is to both local and remote repositories.
The good thing is that it is fast and there is no magic.
However, it sometimes implies adding redundant information and it 
also blocks any chance of improvement for Maven.
With the build/consumer pom we can improve the local pom, while 
keeping the distributed pom compatible.
We've announced this change, informed the 4 leading IDEs so they have
enough time to provide feedback to hopefully embed its support before
the final release.
We've now investigating some edge cases and there are some plugins 
that need to be updated, but it all looks very promising.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Justin Leet on 2017-12-03.
- No new committers. Last addition was Shane Ardell on 2018-11-16.

## Project Activity:
There have been no software releases since the last board report. 
We do not see as much interest in the normal big data conferences
and meetups as we have in the past.

## Community Health:
As I indicated in the last board report, we have seen a significant drop
in developer interest in this project:
* We have had only 3 code contributors in the past quarter
* dev@metron.apache.org had a 14% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
 (25 emails compared to 29)
* user@metron.apache.org had a 75% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
 (30 emails compared to 119)

I believe that Metron benefited from robust corporate investment from
early on.  A combination of the natural ebb and flow of interest with 
our main corporate investment shifting has drawn away the core committers.

I started a discussion shortly after the last board report which had
some engagement on dev@, but the interest soon petered out again and that
did not translate into PRs or dev@ discussion. The discussion brought to
light that we could use some rearchitecture and simplification, but as
of yet, there has been no real engagement to bring this to a reality.

As such, I believe the appropriate next steps is for me to resign the 
Vice Presidency and to try to draw someone into the position who will
spearhead a community and developer engagement initiative. I have notified
private@ of this and have called for volunteers.

This is a good project and many of us have contributed our blood, sweat
and tears to its advancement.  It deserves better engagement and better health.
I urge the ASF to give us some more time to figure out a solution to our
community engagement issues.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

With the last board report JM asked if there was anything we can do to
ensure we don't have many threads go unanswered on our dev list. In reviewing
threads that appear to have zero replies and thinking of what we've seen over
time the following patterns are observed:
1. Users asking for help on dev list.  We try to be specific for mailing list
   purpose. We redirect to users usually.
2. Many of these types of dead-end threads end up getting asked on numerous
   channels at once including stackoverflow, twitter, slack, both mailing
   lists.
3. Many conversations occur over multiple channels including mailing list,
   slack, JIRA and there is generally very little traceability across them.
   For a specific example of this pattern here is someone wanting to
   contribute.  They filed a PR and want engagement on it.
   https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rc7b1d28ab43567f21818dd1258650e4d236094dc9166598b950bcc27%40%3Cdev.nifi.apache.org%3E
   Indeed though the mailing list thread looks unreplied but in reality there
   has been vibrant discussion on the PR as seen here
   https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/3543

A few threads might genuinely slip through the cracks but they're the
exception. No specific action appears needed at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache NiFi was founded 2015-07-14 (5 years ago)
There are currently 47 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Arpad Boda was added to the PMC on 2020-05-24
- Andrew M. Lim was added to the PMC on 2020-05-24
- No new committers. Last addition was Peter Turcsanyi on 2019-10-25.

Discussion is underway for voting in a new committer at the time of writing
this board report.

## Project Activity:
Apache NiFi Registry 0.6.0 we released in April containing security and bug
fixes and minor features.

Since the release of Apache NiFi 1.11.4 in late March the community has
continued aggressively working toward Apache NiFi 1.12.0. There are already
240 fixes, improvements and features in this release and again it is shaping
up as another high impact release.  There have been considerable improvements
to the many Public Cloud provider integrations.

There have not been any Apache NiFi MiNiFi Java releases in some time.  What
is happening now is https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MINIFI-422 which
will merge MiNiFi Java back into NiFi as a headless form of NiFi supporting
both broad use case patterns well and reduce the release/codebase burden.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi CPP 0.8.0 is in progress with over 76 issues resolved.

## Community Health:
Mailing list activity overall seems to have leveled off.  In the previous
reporting period for the mailing lists we saw an increase and in the one prior
a decrease. In this period we see a significant decrease in dev threads with a
slight increase in users list.

However, and as we noted previously the activity and growth seems to have
moved heavily to the Apache NiFi slack channels. In the past many quarters
we've reported 394, 523, 707, 895, and now 1071 persistent users in our
general slack channel. So while the mailing list activity looks leveled or
possibly declined we're seeing dramatically higher engagement on slack.  The
nice thing we're seeing there is more people engaging who do not have
committer status that normally might not say much on email but now willing to
engage in slack. Just a more comfortable communication mechanism for some it
appears.

Activity on twitter, stackoverflow, youtube, blogs remains impressive.

Community activity level as measured in overall commits has regressed a bit
this quarter versus last but that is pretty clearly related to release pushes.
We see roughly the same number of unique authors. As we push to NiFi 1.12.0
I'd expect a rise again.

Keeping up with the review/merge of pull requests remains a challenge.  We're
reviewing and merging at an overall impressive rate but it remains difficult
to close the gap.  We're likely to setup an auto-close based on age mechanism.
The fundamental challenge is it is easier for new contributors to put up a PR
that fixes some issue they have than it appears to be for those same types of
folks to engage in reviewing and testing others PRs.  Indeed that part while
critical for the community is less exciting/interesting. The delta in opened
versus closed this quarter was just 25 commits but add that up quarter over
quarter and we end up with quite a backlog.

We've done well with both PMC and committer pipeline and as noted above we
anticipate a new committer being named very soon.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Carl B. Marcum]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

### History

2012-10-17 - Apache OpenOffice was established as Top Level Project (TLP)
2011-06-13 - OpenOffice.org was accepted as Incubator project in the ASF
             with the new name Apache OpenOffice 

## SUMMARY

Latest Release was in September 2019. The community activity in general is on
a low level. A major obstacle is the complex code and build system. Therefore
it is not easy for new people to gain a foothold into the code when the first
build is hard to be done. There is recent activity on the mailing list to 
update the building guides to make it easier to get builds working.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

No issues

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines:

1) 4.2.0 is the next minor release, planned to be released into a beta phase.
We have missed our goal on going into the beta in 2019. We managed only to
solve the biggest blockers. Currently a new dev test version is released
to be more widely tested. An alpha and/or beta release is planned
for the next quarter.

For that release we are improving the translation process. We are now able to
sync our translation server Pootle with the code.
Together with ASF Infra we were able to set up a new (updated) translate VM.

At the moment we support 64 languages in Pootle. We plan to add some new
languages to the 4.2.0 release.

2) We are currently planning to release AOO 4.1.8 around the 20th anniversary
of the OpenOffice.org project in October (2020-10-13).
The motivation in still maintaining the 4.1.x release line is not very high.
Therefore we will shut it down as soon as we have a stable release of 4.2.x.

## LATEST RELEASE HISTORY

2019-09-21 4.1.7 
2018-11-18 4.1.6 
2017-12-30 4.1.5

## COMMITTER & PMC DATA

There are currently 143 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members.
  Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N. McKenna (knmc).
  Last PMC member withdrawal was on 2019-Sep-24 Roberto Galoppini (galoppini).
- We welcome 3 new committers. Pedro Lino (plino), Czesław Wolański (cwolan)
  and Detlef Nannen (dnannen) have accepted our invitation.
  Last committer addition was on 2020-Jun-30 Detlef Nannen (dnannen).
  Last committer withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid).

## COMMUNITY HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT

Community overall health is stable. Our user level support is stable, 
Translation teams are rising. We start another attempt to rebuild a 
documentation team. We are not successful to bring volunteers on board 
for development.

Certainly, more people would be helpful and we continue to try to grow the
developer and especially the builder communities. We do have the process and
the people in place to enable us to continue development and, more
importantly, perform releases in a reasonable time-frame. We also struggle
somewhat with our commitment to continue to support, and being a viable
platform, for users who are "stuck" on older machines and OSs, since this makes
development and community builds more difficult. However, it also appears
obvious that that community is being neglected by other FOSS office platforms, 
who tend to focus on providing releases for newer platforms.

### Community Metrics

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We have initiated the migration from the old Apache CMS to Pelican CMS. We
face the issue that we have 9 GB of content to move. A plan has been made.

Our build bots are now functional again. Work still needs to be done on
improving upload speed (Linux bots) and the RAT builds.

### Google Analytics

Apache OpenOffice uses Google Analytics.
We are aware this is a controversial topic within the ASF.
Current setup is to collect as few data points as possible. 
We do not use Google Analytics for advertisement. 
Disclaimers are placed.

The data might be used in optimizing the web content. For example
within the migration of our web content. 

## MARKETING

Due to corona all live action marketing has been currently postponed.

We have reorganized the flyer activity. Currently we prepare material 
for next year.

### Facebook

We have one Volunteer representing Apache OpenOffice Facebook.
There was an error on the Page subscriptions. We have almost 16 000 
subscribers. The number is constant despite very low activity in new 
information. The page is currently still used as support channel.

### Twitter

Our Twitter account will now be maintained by Jim Jagielski.

## DEVELOPMENT

### Apple Code Signing

We have done one signed test build. However we need to do another one,
since Apple has changed the standards. This is an open topic.
Signing is done manually.

### Windows Code Signing

We can successfully create Windows installer with digital signature. There is
some discussion to switch from the exe Installer to a clean msi Installer. But
there are technical hurdles to be solved.
Windows code signing is currently a manual process.

### Unmaintained Python 2 code

Python 2 is unmaintained. We have in the development tree the external python3
support. Internal python 3 support is difficult. We are checking alternatives.
Planned for the next major release.

### New ODF Version

Our Main Format, the OpenDocument Format has received a new Standard update.
We plan to support this format.

such, at the very least not before the overhaul effort mentioned in the
previous report has begun.

## Community Health:
There is still ample oversight on the PMC. The usual ping provided 4 quick
responses from PMC members.

Not much in activity, code or email-wise, but we're used to that. There are no
pressing issues to deal with.

- We need to identify and execute strategies to reach out to likely
  interested users and developers.
- We need to conduct more regular roadmap planning, create and deliver based
  on a release schedule.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support patterns and technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team no releases in the last quarter.

The last Struts project releases were
* Struts 2.5.22 - Feature and bug fix release (2019-11-29)
* Struts Master 14 - Apply Apache Parent POM and plugin upgrades (2020-02-05)
* Struts Annotations 1.0.7 - Enhancements in preparation for the next
  framework release (2020-02-23)

Within the last quarter we saw a significant uplift in activity. This goes
both for mailing list traffic and development activity, with 27 opened and 29
closed pull requests in the reporting period. Interesting new features for the
Struts framework are discussed or already worked upon.

Currently we are voting on Struts Maven Archetypes release 2.5.22. Also a
release test build was made for the Struts 2.5.23 candidate, but we seem to
face some technical issues which we hope to be able to resolve soon.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

## Issues:
None identified.

## Membership Data:
Apache Synapse was founded 2007-12-19 (13 years ago)
There are currently 34 committers and 26 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:7.

- We just closed the vote for onboarding a new committer.

## Project Activity:
We continued to get contributions from a new contributor during this period as
well. So PMC decided to start a vote to elect the new contributor as a
committer. The vote has been closed with a success and we are in the process
of completing the process. Hope to see more contributions from new
contributors.


## Community Health:
dev@synapse.apache.org had a 31% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (76
emails compared to 110)

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Georgios Petasis]

## Description:
The mission of Tcl is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Dynamic websites using TCL. Apache Tcl is home to the Tcl-Apache integration
efforts. The purpose of our project is to combine the power of the Apache
web server with the capabilities of the mature, robust and flexible Tcl
scripting language. Currently only the Apache Rivet project is actively
maintained.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tcl was founded 2000-07-24 (20 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Brice Hamon De Crevecoer on 2014-11-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Brice B. Hamon on 2014-11-25.

## Project Activity:
Work has been done in preparing the 3.2 release. New features include: 
- Threaded bridges (such as the worker bridge) needed the capability of
having single threads terminate by calling ::rivet::exit without affecting
other threads. This feature can now be enabled by setting the SingleThreadExit
configuration parameter. The prefork bridge is unaffected.
- New command ::rivet::thread_id that returns the thread identification in a
format that emulates command ::thread::id (saving the need to load the
Thread package in order to get this information). The command returns the
thread id also as a decimal number, which is the way it is printed in the
Apache error log.

Bug Fixes:
- The lazy bridge has been simplified by removing some counters and
variables used during its development for testing. Also the access to
some variables has been protected by requiring lock on a mutex.
- Rivet_Upload modified. The upload command crashed under some
circumstances (invalid argument list) due to wrong argument checking.

## Community Health:
curcuru: Great roll call; in the future, include the results in your report
(i.e. how many people replied they were still active in the project - in this
case, plenty!)

In the roll call the following PMC members replied: Georgios Petasis, Massimo
Manghi, Brice Hamon, Harald Oehlmann, Damon Courtney and Ronnie Brunner. David
Welton has not participated.

rb: We remain concerned that it's been more than 5 years since you've added
any new committers or PMC members. I know that TcL has long been a
slow-and-steady project, but are there any contributors who might be
considered for committer?

Right now, no, we don't have any candidates as possible new committers.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Tez Project  [Jonathan Turner Eagles]

## Description:
Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be 
used to process arbitrarily complex DAGs of data-processing tasks and also a 
re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.

## Issues:
nh: "What "Some assistance...may be needed" are you referring to? Is it help
from Infra or "just" individuals who knows the workflow on how to get PRs into
the codebase?"

Just need to reach out to the community for an expert in setting this up.

Next Tez release was delayed due to community members conflict during this
time. Likely next quarter, but need to get on a more regular release schedule.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tez was founded 2014-07-15 (6 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 35 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Kuhu Shukla on 2018-03-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was László Bodor on 2020-01-22.

## Project Activity:
Continued work on Hadoop 3.x compatibility. Continued work on JDK 11
compatability

## Community Health:
Overall there is good activity. There is a high number of open jiras that need
to be analyzed and closed to bring the number from 1000+ to a more manageable
size.

## Project Activity:
 * 0.13.0 was released on 2019-10-16.
 * Still working on release 0.14.0

## Community Health:
We experienced increased activities on both the mailing lists and via Github
pull requests. The project attracted a number of engaged individuals in the
past months, three of which have been nominated to become committers (two see
above, plus one still in "progress"). Largest "pain" we currently have is the
number of regularly active reviewers - even though the activities in this area
also slightly increased there's still room for improvements.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Tim Allison]

## Description:
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from, a
growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognized by IANA and other standards bodies.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tika was founded 2010-04-20 (10 years ago)
There are currently 31 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Tilman Hausherr on 2019-10-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Tilman Hausherr on 2019-10-03.

## Project Activity:
We released 1.24.1 on April 21.  This release included numerous security fixes
(CVE-2020-9489) which we identified through a new fuzzing module.

We've moved our regression testing server and corpus from Rackspace to a new
server kindly hosted by a committer on PDFBox.  We started a new mailing list
(corpora-dev@tika.apache.org) for this resource to enable cross-project 
discussion (POI, PDFBox, Tika and Commons Compress) and to encourage 
contributions and input from a wider audience.

We've removed whitelist/blacklist terminology from the project, and we are in
the process of migrating from 'master' branch to 'main'.

## Community Health:
Our Community Health Score of 6.33 suggests we are doing well. We've seen a
slight increase in traffic on our dev list.  Commits, issues and traffic on
the dev list have decreased slightly, but nothing worthy of board attention.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop released versions 3.3.11 and 3.4.7. Both were releases containing
important bug fixes and minor improvements. The 3.3.11 release is the last
release in the 3.3.x release line. The first release in that line of 3.3.0
occurred in August 2017, so it has seen a long run of maintenance. As most
graph providers have long since moved on to 3.4.x and some development
efforts have shifted to our latest release line of 3.5.0, it seemed time to
stop support on 3.3.x.

A number of new projects came to light in this last reporting period that
showed the continued growth of the wider TinkerPop ecosystem:

* ignite-janus[1] - Apache Ignite Storage Backend for JanusGraph
* graph-explorer[2] - Extendable data visualiser for Apache TinkerPop
supported graph databases.
* Hackolade TinkerPop Plugin[3] - A graph data modelling tool
* Clownface[4] - Clownface is a graph traversal library inspired by Gremlin
which allows querying any RDF dataset in a concise and readable way.

A new book was published by O'Reilly called "The Practitioner's Guide to
Graph Data"[5] by Denise Gosnell and Matthias Broecheler. It uses Gremlin
for its code examples and covers many important graph topics that should be
extraordinarily helpful to new users.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.3.11 (June 1, 2020)
- 3.4.7 (June 1, 2020)

## PMC/Committer:
- Last PMC addition was Jorge Bay-Gondra - October 2018

- Brian Olsen was added as committer on 2020-05-13
- Walt Karas was added as committer on 2020-05-29

## Project Activity:
We are working on our ATS 9.0.0 release, which will be finialized this
quarter. Three companies have deployed prerelease versions of 9.0.0 to some of
their production servers.

We are also continuing to support the 8.0.x and 7.1.x release branches.  We
made two security releases on each of our release branches,
which closed out two CVEs.

## Community Health:
We had our ATS Spring Summit remotely.  We had at least 30 people attend and
had a guest speaker from Apple talk about MPTCP (the author of the RFC).  We
are planning on having monthly meetups to discuss releases and significant
bugs.  Also, we are planning on having our fall summit remote this year.

Activity on dev and users mailing lists has increased significantly, by 77%
and 85% respectively.

Attachment BX: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Web Services was founded 2003-01-22 (17 years ago)
There are currently 224 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2016-05-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2014-09-14.

## Project Activity:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required. However, user
questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed, and there are at
least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project can continue to
produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer
considered state of the art, we don't expect a major uptick in new development
efforts, new committers, etc...

The main development efforts this quarter were on WSS4J. We released a new
version (2.3.0) with support for Java 11+ as well as a bunch of other updates
(ehcache versions, etc...) that are needed by CXF.

There is also some work being done on Axiom for Java 11+ support.


Past Releases: 
WSS4J-2.3.0: 2020-06-17. 
XmlSchema-2.2.5: 2020-01.
Neethi-3.1.1: 2018-01 
Axiom-1.2.21: 2018-11 
Woden-1.0M10: 2015-09


## Community Health:
As mentioned, SOAP/WebServices is not considered state-of-the-art anymore and
we are getting very little contribution from anyone other than the 2 or 3
regulars" that are driving features and changes needed for CXF (which is
being driven by their employers).   Thus, we are not seeing any possibilities
for future new committers or PMC members.  However, there are plenty of
people around that can do releases and answer questions and respond to
security issues.  It's a mature project.
