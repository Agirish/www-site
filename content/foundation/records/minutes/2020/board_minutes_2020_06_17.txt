 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       This has been a tumultuous month, in so many ways. Our foundation's
       normal challenges and concerns seem tiny by comparison. Fortunately,
       we accomplished the bulk of the board's annual business at the last
       meeting, and only have a short list of items to discuss for this one.

       Since the agenda is light and our projects need forgiveness more than
       rules, I haven't been moving late reports off of our agenda. Instead,
       I will skip the Consent Agenda this month and we'll run through the
       normal agenda as in the past. However, we still won't be summarizing
       reports or performing roll call votes, unless either is requested by a
       director.

    B. President [David]

       Overall things appear to be running relatively smoothly given the
       disruption past months have provided.

       Conferences has finished canceling all of the in-person events.

       We've run into a situation where we had an unpaid invoice from our
       legal vendor from last FY. We've now paid that, but it's highlighted
       that while we've had litigation expenses in the past, we've typically
       charged them against the Brand Management budget. Thus we have some
       unplanned litigation expenses that are for non-trivial amounts. The
       fact that it isn't budgeted is my fault. I've asked Myrle and Virtual
       to ensure that we have a litigation expenses GL account going forward
       and we'll try and track backwards historically and figure out what we
       should budget going forward, though I'll note that the cost is likely
       to be highly variable as it is dependent on the actions of outside
       parties.

       We've also begun sending contracts out for legal review before
       signing.

       As a user, I've been thrilled with the work on our new AP system.
       It's made it much more transparent and obvious what is outstanding,
       who is approving, etc. It also appears, from my vantage point, to be
       better for our vendors as well. They have a dedicated email address
       to send invoices to, and rather than pay them once per month, they
       can be actioned faster.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Operating cash on May 31st, 2020 was $2,176.9K, up $40.4K from last
       month’s ending balance (Apr 20) of $2,136.5K.  Total cash as of May
       31st, 2020 is $3,602.8K (includes the Pineapple, Restricted Donation
       and project funds) as compared to $3,754.1K on May 31st, 2019 (a
       decrease of $151.3K year over year). The May 31st 2020 ending
       operating cash balance of $2,176.9K represents an operating cash
       reserve of 15 months based on the “Estimated” FY21 cash forecast
       average monthly spending of $145.3K/month.  The ASF actual operating
       reserve of 15 months at the end of May 2020 is slightly ahead of the
       May 2020 budgeted 14.2 months of reserve.  The ASF operating reserve
       is well above the ASAE standard average of 6 months of reserve for
       non-profits.

       Revenue through May 31st 2020 was ahead of budget by $18.9K, primarily
       due to timing of Sponsor payments during the month. As compared to
       FY20, FY21 YTD revenue is behind by $44.8K.  This is due to
       sponsorship and registration revenue for ACNA in 2019, which is not
       happening in 2020, which is offset by slightly higher sponsorship
       payments in May 2020 vs May 2019.

       Expenses through May 31st, 2020 are under budget by $97.6K, spread
       across all departments, primarily due to some vendor payments that
       missed the 5.31.20 cutoff.  These expenses missed the cutoff due to
       necessary delays in expense approval outside the control of the
       Treasurer's office.  They are accounted for in the cash forecast for
       June 2020.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY21 the ASF finished with a positive
       $40.5K NI vs a budgeted negative <$76K> NI or $116.5K better than the
       budgeted NI as of May 31st 2020.  In comparison with FY20, as of May
       31st 2020, as noted above, we are behind on revenue by $44.5K, but we
       are also behind on expenses by $145.3K. Had all expenses been paid on
       time in May, we still would have been more than $45K lower in expenses
       in May of 2020 vs May of 2019. So one month into the new fiscal year
       we are doing well.

       In addition, the Treasurer's office is reviewing our financial risks. 
       In that context we have made minor adjustments to credit card issuance
       and credit limits (mostly lowering) to reflect current responsibility
       and current budget needs.  We can review and increase those limits
       again when, for example, it becomes possible to do in-person
       conferences again.  Also in the context of improving our risk profile,
       we will be moving $750k out of Citizens into Boston Private CDARS
       where that portion of our money will be interest-bearing and
       FDIC-insured.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In the month of May, the secretary received 59 ICLAs, one software
       grant, and two membership emeritus requests. We have begun work on the
       conflict of interest policy and tooling around it over at the Whimsy
       project.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       It's been a long and eventful couple of months squaring away events,
       but we're about ready to launch ApacheCon@Home, which I'm excited
       about.

       We were also one of 10 organizations chosen to benefit from the FOSS
       Responders work
       (see https://twitter.com/TheASF/status/1263799630829060097), which was
       a welcome contribution towards the expenses we did have in canceling
       our live events.

 8. Discussion Items

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Shane: pursue potential Attic resolution for Crunch
          [ Crunch 2020-04-15 ]
          Status: Done. See 7B.

    * Shane: help out Zeppelin with their security issue
          [ Zeppelin 2020-04-15 ]
          Status: In progress, figuring out what is still needed.

    * Justin: pursue a report for DRAT
          [ DRAT 2020-05-20 ]
          Status: Contacted and there's discussion about moving the project
                  under Creadur

    * Niclas: follow up with River on reports
          [ River 2020-05-20 ]
          Status: River is on Subversion, and the github integration doesn't
                  pick up the commit from svn to github, hence the GitHub
                  history looks more empty, i.e. nothing since a year ago. In
                  svn there are about 30 commits in the last 12 months... The
                  discrepancy is probably related to a non-ttb layout of the svn
                  repository. Peter has agreed to explain the "maintenance mode"
                  and ambition (or lack of) in the next report. He also points
                  out that they have recently started discussion/vote on moving
                  to Git.

    * Roy: pursue a better report for Sentry
          [ Sentry 2020-05-20 ]
          Status: Done.

    * Roy: start working on binary release policy
          [ Unfinished Business 2020-05-20 ]
          Status: In progress. Collecting background info.

    * Craig: start working with Matt and Sam to create a CoI form and process
          [ CoI Affirmation 2020-05-20 ]

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsor status: we are pursuing renewals for one Platinum, one Gold,
and two Bronze sponsors. We continue to wait for purchase orders to invoice
renewals for one Platinum sponsor. We signed a 5-year agreement with a
Platinum Sponsor, and confirmed one Sponsor upgrade from Silver to Gold. We
are seeking new points-of-contact for one Silver and one Bronze sponsor. One
Platinum sponsor is in arrears. Two Silver Sponsors have chosen not to renew,
whilst one Gold and one Silver Sponsor have asked to delay their renewals to
Q3. We signed on one new Bronze Sponsor this month. Payments have been
received from one Gold, one Silver, and one Bronze Sponsor. We await payment
on renewals from one Platinum and one Gold.

We Performed an audit of Sponsors with multi-year commitments, specifically
those who had locked in their rates prior to our first-ever increase in 2017,
as well as Bronze Sponsors who secured a linked listing with through a
multi-year commitment. We also changed all the Sponsor links at
http://apache.org/foundation/thanks to rel="sponsored" per our updated policy
set last month.

We had a misfire with an appeal email from a service provider that was sent to
an improperly vetted list, and worked with Marketing and Publicity to craft
statements and address any backlash. We are also exploring options for future
sponsor prospecting.

2) Targeted sponsor status: we continue to confirm Targeted Sponsor
commitments. Our efforts towards developing a new Targeted fund specifically
earmarked for TAC recipients to ASF Conferences are on hold until face-to-face
events resume.  One Sponsor who committed support for ASF Infra have
apparently terminated support with no notice; we are seeking clarity on this
action. We are also exploring options with a candidate Targeted Sponsor
interested in providing support to ASF Infrastructure.

3) Sponsor Relations: Sponsor queries regarding opportunities to support
ApacheCon have subsided as those interested are still awaiting information,
and we await information from ASF Conferences. It has been a somewhat quiet
month otherwise, as the coronavirus continues to impact budgets and headcount
at some sponsor organizations.

4) Events: we are ready to begin sales for ASF Conferences once the planning
team finalizes the prospectuses and plans for the remaining events in 2020.

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $1,100 over the
past month. We participated in #GivingTuesdayNOW, a COVID-focused campaign
earlier in the month. Individual giving continues to slow down in light on the
pandemic.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — June 2020

I. Budget: the FY2021 budget allocation for ASF Marketing & Publicity has been
approved. We are working to ensure that any delayed vendor payments are
initiated and reconciled

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising with Sponsor Relations, Sponsorship renewals and payments, and
Targeted Sponsor commitments. COVID-19 continues to impact Sponsor budgets and
payment cycles, as well as event participation. Much of our work to support
ASF Conferences are on hold until further notice. We published the April Month
In Review; announced our participation in the #GivingTuesdayNow giving
campaign https://s.apache.org/GivingTuesdayNow2020 ; issued press releases for
Apache CloudStack, Subversion, and the 10th Anniversary of Apache HBase;
issued the Apache Month in Review: April 2020 https://s.apache.org/Apr2020 ;
published "Success at Apache: Remote Collaboration in the Time of Coronavirus"
https://s.apache.org/dkff ; and published "Apache Everywhere", the first short
from the "Trillions and Trillions Served" documentary
https://s.apache.org/ApacheEverywhere . We are working on the third "Inside
Infra" interview, preparing the FY2020 Annual Report, and continuing
post-production on the ASF documentary feature, "Trillions and Trillions
Served".

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 13 May - The Apache Software Foundation Announces the 10th Anniversary of
   Apache® HBase™
 - 28 May - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Subversion®
   1.14.0-LTS
 - 28 May - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® CloudStack® v
   4.14

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 10 items on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog, including 5 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 316
news summaries published to date. We tweeted 22 items to 57K followers on
Twitter, and posted 17 items to 41.5K followers on LinkedIn that garnered more
than 49K organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are on hold, and 2 are in
development. Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well
as PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones, "Did You Know?" success
stories, "Have You Met?" highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are
requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice
for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to six media queries. The ASF received 941
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 972. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 1,633 press hits vs. last month's 1,241. ApacheCon received
11 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received one briefing request during this time, and
have been working with an analyst research team with fact-checking a report.
Apache was mentioned in 3 reports by Gartner; 2 reports by Forrester; 6
reports by 451 Research; and 6 reports by IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team are updating some elements of the
apache.org homepage, and have delivered a new templated, customizable logo set
for the Apache Local Chapter initiative. They have also developed the
template, supporting pages, and project logos for the FY2020 Annual Report as
well as select graphics for the "Trillions" documentary.

IX. Events liaison: we have been asked by VP Conferences to cease promotion of
2020 events until their future strategy is in place.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: we are taking steps to establish
standalone accounts for the ASF to eliminate any challenges with billing
pass-throughs from HALO Worldwide.

XI. Miscellany: numerous "invisible" items cross the desk of VP M&P every day
that often fall outside of the direct remit of ASF Marketing & Publicity or
obliquely touch our day-to-day efforts. This month's activities include
participating on a conference call and responding to a request for
communication support/direction for ASF Diversity & Inclusion; fielding a
request for partnership from a government entity; handling several requests to
promote third party events that involve Apache projects; helping re-open
jobs@apache.org; helping with an issue involving GSoC; working with a PMC
regarding an ASF Sponsor's request to adjust the copy in a legacy
blogs.apache.org post; coordinating third party support promotion of an Apache
project milestone; being on-boarded onto a new payment system; coaching the PR
team of an ASF sponsor regarding promoting their participation in the ASF,
among other activities. In addition: Feathercast. Established in 2005, the
Feathercast podcast series is the "voice of the ASF". Originally established
as a personal project co-created by ASF Members Rich Bowen and David Reid,
Feathercast grew within ComDev and showcases an array of Apache projects and
people, as well as promotes ApacheCon, before, during, and after the event.
Feathercast's day-to-day operations continue to be run by ComDev team members,
and Rich has recently initiated a series of regularly-scheduled interviews.
There are currently five new interviews on https://feathercast.apache.org/
during this time period. ASF M&P has added Feathercast to its promotional
channels helps highlight their interviews on social media and news updates.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- bill.com looks like a solid replacement for our archaic svn-based
  payment/invoice workflow. The svn workflow grew out of our tech
  mindset, but is inappropriate for the Foundation at this point in
  our evolution. bill.com is providing needed controls, auditing, and
  archival of our payments/invoices. Operations/Treasurer is working
  through the process adjustments with Virtual.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Migrate away from mail-*.apache.org.

General Activity
================
- Working through some backup issues as the amount of content we're
  managing has increased over the years.
- Lots of work/completion on p3->p6 migrations.
- Crash-moved a service after it died horribly. There are a few other
  critical services in that datacenter which we will move in a
  planned fashion.
- Apache CouchDB is testing GitHub Discussion with great results.
- Continued development with bill.com.
- Widespread issues due to an upstream/intermediate certificate
  expiration. New chains had to be deployed. Still working through
  this issue with a 3rd party service.
- Confluence has been upgraded.
- Supporting M&PR with an "Inside Infra" interview and annual report.

No current events

Future Events
=============

TAC has an events Calendar that it shares with other Committees for the
purposes of cross-committee planning and collaboration. Currently the calendar
has been cleared of all events until further notice.

Short/Medium Term Priorities
=====================

TAC Application Software is on the horizon, but is not urgent at this time. A
quote will be obtainted in the next month or so.


Mailing List Activity
=====================

Discussion continues on getting a new stable TAC Application Software.

Membership

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

Date
18 May 2020

Contributors: 
Gris Cuevas
Katia Rojas

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contribute towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:

None
## Activity:

*** Project:  Survey***

Preparing presentation to share final findings from survey, if you're
interested in attending live follow this thread [1] Will work on documenting
survey process and how to re-apply it, thinking of doing it every 2 years

*** Project: User Experience Research on new contributors ***

We have narrowed down the list of projects we'll continue to evaluate with a
quantitative analysis. Talking to privacy@ about best way to analyze project
data. Interview questions have been finalized by Bitergia. Recruiting for
interviews is moving along; we're reaching out to folks who indicated
interest in participating through the survey. Bitergia will share an invite
to extend the opportunity to be interviewed to folks who left an ASF project,
we're looking to have referrals from PMCs.

*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***

Don't forget to read the notes from the weekly working meetings; they are in
the D&I Wiki[2] and shared via the mailing list. Google donated $52k to
continue with the ASF internships next year. Still pending discussion items:
how to continue program funding and finalization of friction logs from
previous intern. Our four interns started the internship on May 19th.
Internships period: May 19th, 2020, to August 18th, 2020. Feedback received
from all interns after following up regarding communication channels to use
to contact mentors and contribute to their projects. The feedback was good
and we also sent them an invitation to the Slack channel. Feedback received
from all mentors after following up regarding the first weeks of internship.
The feedback was good so far. We provided feedback to Airflow about ensuring
their interns have tasks to work on while they untangle their technical
decision preventing progress on the main project. We had a discussion in the
mailing list [3] about how to improve the way we are promoting the Outreachy
program and the problems we are facing now. Finished Report friction log and
feedback: the report includes the feedback of mentors, interns, and
coordinators.

*** Operations ***

Google sponsored $52k to continue supporting the Outreachy internships
through the next two rounds.

## Committee members changes:

None.

Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past month we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're up 2 (to 24), unresolved
issues this month.

In the previous report, we've alerted the board about LEGAL-515. At this point
it seems that the MXNet PPMC and the Incubator are fully on top of this issue
and are trying to make it right.

Re-started binary distribution channels work based on the 'prior art' from the
Incubator:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/Distribution+Guidelines

Had a conversation with DLA Piper regarding recent charges relating to
services that go beyond their pro-bono offer to us. Overall, it was a very
constructive discussion. Still it may behove the board to act on a recent
thread titled 'Rethinking our approach for procuring day-to-day legal services
for the ASF'

TechTarget's reporter has requested an hour meeting to clarify our position on
ICLAs, CCLAs and SGAs.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 12: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

Stats for May 2020:

     22        [license confusion]
     21        [support request/question not security notification]

     Security reports: 41 (last months: 36, 43, 23, 40)

      3        [airflow]
      2        [camel], [cloudstack], [hive], [httpd], [infrastructure], 
               [tomcat], [trafficserver]
      1        [activemq], [archiva], [atlas], [cordova], [cxf], [hc],
              [jackrabbit], [kylin], [ofbiz], [openoffice], [opennlp],
               [samza], [shiro], [synapse], [syncope], [tomee],
               [trafficcontrol], [unomi], [usergrid], [vxquery],
               [wicket], [xmlgraphics], [zeppelin], [zookeeper]

     In total, as of 1st June 2020, we're tracking 74 (last month:
     71) open issues across 44 projects, median age 53 (last month:
     65) days.  37 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     9 (last month: 8) of these issues, across 6 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  None require escalation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 13: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations  [Henri Yandell]

This month I communicated with Eclipse that:

* We won't claim exclusive rights to any contributions made to the JCP
  forums/lists/specs for <relevant JSRs>.
* But we won't sign something in which the ASF is claiming ownership of
  contributions made by our contributors to a third party (JCP).

I noted that I doubted there would be any energy to resolve differences of
opinion on interpretation of the JSPA, and they agreed that this wasn't worth
pursuing further. This closes out last month's A2 action item.

Remaining action items are:

 A1] Review documents for Apache joining Jakarta as a Guest Member and get
 these signed.

 A3] To communicate the topic to affected projects. This will probably mean a
 general communication to all committees visibly using Java, and directing
 them to jcp-open for follow-up.

- No new committers. Last addition was Jaikiran Pai on 2017-06-14.

## Project Activity:


Tests with early version of JDK 15 worked. But with the finding that 'rmic'
not more a part of the JDK. The JDK team will update their changelog while we
tune our testsuite to give a meaningful message and skip these tests on
JDK15+.

Also the final removal of the Nashorn JavaScript engine has to be adressed in
our testsuite. First tests with GraalVM started. Nice observation: running
plain scripts in GraalVM (graal.js) is much faster than compiled script on
Nashorn. Our test assertion that the compiled script should run faster has to
be modified ...


Discussion about retiring Ant 1.9.x (our Java5) went to public. When retiring
the 1.9-branch users would have to upgrade to Java8+ for running Ant 1.10.x.
Pros:
 + getting a Java5 for development is difficult
 + APIs between Java5 and Java8 are too distinguished Cons:
 - some projects are running on Java<8 and require a fitting build tool
 - Java6 JUnit tests could be impossible to run on Java8 with Ant 1.10.x.

## Community Health:
For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done. But
basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development.


For IvyDE we lack the knowledge of building Eclipse plugins on actual Eclipse
versions. We hope to get the build running again so we could update that.

## Description:
The mission of Apache Any23 is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to automatic crawling, parsing, analyzing, producing, validating and converting 
RDF (Resource Description Framework) data

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

- No new committers. Last addition was Hans Brende on 2018-02-21.

## Project Activity:
Project activity is low. Not really much going on since April 2020. 
This is characteristic of Any23 and nothing out of the norm.
For some time work on Spotbugs issues has prevented a 2.4 release.
A thread relating to pushing off that primary issue such that 2.4
the release is unblocked is underway on dev@any23.

## Community Health:
The Any23 community is quiet but we have not struggled with 
getting VOTE's when needed. This statement will be tested
when the community is required to VOTE on 2.4 release
candidate.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary
components (both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:

Axis was created on 2001-01-19 (19 years ago).

There are currently 63 committers and PMC members in this project, a vote in
2010 made all committers automatically PMC members.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on
   May 9th 2018.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained. 

The goals for the next Axis2 Java release continue to be JDK 11 support, by
removing the remaining deprecated com.sun dependencies from the code base.

This past quarter we moved Axis 1.x Java, Axis2 Java, and Axis2 C from svn to
github. A big thanks to Bill Blough for making it happen, and Andreas Veithen
for fixing the Java unit tests.

Most of our users are running legacy SOAP services based on XML, so we are
lacking committer growth. As our day jobs move to JSON, we continue to
improve our docs and support for JSON based REST web services in order to
gain new users.

We continue to receive patches from the community, including AXIS2-5724.

Axis2 C PMC member Bill Blough has "identified/tagged a lot of issues that
should probably be addressed before the next release". The communication
continues to be good.

## JIRA Activity for Axis2 java

- 2 JIRA tickets created in the last 90 days.
- 3 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 90 days.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Kenneth Knowles]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Beam is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing, 
enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution engines and 
providing extensibility points for connecting to different technologies and 
user communities.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Beam was founded 2016-12-20 (3 years ago)
There are currently 71 committers and 21 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:2.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Pablo Estrada on 2019-05-13.
- Robin Qiu was added as committer on 2020-05-18

## Project Activity:

Some updates:

- Last report, the community had received drafts of our new mascot, the
  firefly. Now the final drafts are done and committed to the website.
  [mascot]
- Last report, website migration to Hugo/docsy was just beginning. It is now
  complete, ready for i18n.
- Last report, we were working on moving to a dedicated Jenkins instance. That
  stalled for a bit, but in the last couple of days moved rapidly and is
  almost done.

[mascot] https://beam.apache.org/community/mascot/

Other milestones:

- As of April, docker containers that Beam releases adhere to the guidance of
  LEGAL-503. [LEGAL-503]
- Beam's "cross-language" features are maturing, with a focus on making Beam
  Java features available for Beam Python. This is not just bridging
  languages, but communities/ecosystems. Only some runners support executing
  such a pipeline for now; as each one fully migrates to Beam's
  "portability framework" this will be enabled. What can Pythonistas use on
   enabled runners now?
    - SQL (Java-based, built on Apache Calcite)
    - KafkaIO (a connector to Apache Kafka authored in Java)
- New IO Connectors: Beam now has IO connectors for Snowflake and Google
  Healthcare APIs.

[LEGAL-503] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-503

Some work on project health, removing things we don't want/need to maintain:

- Following Gearpump retiring from the incubator, the Gearpump runner was
  removed.
- Following Apex moving to the attic, the Apex runner will be removed.

Other highlighted activity:

- The community discussed how many / which Python 3.x versions Beam should
  support concurrently, with the conclusion that 3.5 and 3.7 were highest
  priority. [py3]
- A Beam "fixit" week was proposed. Contributors would add testing /
  reliability / quality related Jiras to a label `beam-fixit` and we could fix
  some. 105 Jiras were added to the label, and about 30 were fixed.
- Beam has 3 Google Summer of Code students working on Beam SQL and Beam
  Python
- Beam was accepted to Google Season of Docs program. Currently the project is
  accepting proposals for tech writers to improve documentation.
- We moved to our own Jira priority scheme, strictly numerical (P0, P1, etc)
  with tooltips we authored, and explanations on the Beam site
  [jira-priorities]. This reduced friction for users and release managers,
   since Jira's built-in priorities like "Blocker", "Critical", "Major" were
   amgibuous and caused confusion.
- We activated Jira automation to:
  - Unassign issues that were likely forgotten. This identified many issues
    that could be picked up by new contributors, and many that could be
    closed.
  - Lower priority from P2 ("default") to P3 ("nice to have") for unassigned
    issues that were very old, to match how they were prioritized in practice.
    This identified many issues at the wrong priority, and also prompted
    discussions between users and Beam developers.

[py3] https://s.apache.org/beam-py3-discussion
[jira-priorities] https://beam.apache.org/contribute/jira-priorities/

In the current pandemic situation, conferences have been altered or canceled,
but we have activity to note:

- "Distributed Processing for Machine Learning Production Pipelines" presented
  at Flink Forward Virtual 2020 (https://www.youtube.com/embed/jV1WFTmm4qg)
- Beam Summit organizers committed to working more transparently with the
  community [beam-summit-transparency]. In June we have received weekly status
  reports. [beam-summit-20200603] [beam-summit-2020-0610]
- Beam Summit 2020 rescheduled and converted to Beam Digital Summit.
  [beam-digital-summit]
- Organized a May digital learning month, to keep community engaged with
  weekly talks during COVID19. Hosted 4 webinars introducing different
  features of Apache Beam. Received 100~200 viewers on average for each
  webinar.

- The 3.4.0 release will be a LTS release, so we'll maintain the 3.4.x
  baseline by backporting fixes, while innovating with new versions
- Actually we are doing a big effort on stabilizing the codebase for 3.x
  branch, there is an ongoing effort and we are doing really well on this
  particular side.
- We released a new 2.x version, the 2.25.1 on 16 Apr 2020.

  persons are two and we are already working with them.

## Community Health:
- dev@camel.apache.org had a 1% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (657
  emails compared to 658) More or less the activity is the same with questions
  about migration from Camel 2 to Camel 3
- users@camel.apache.org had a 5% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (488 emails compared to 513) This is related to the questions coming in
   about migration from camel 2 to 3, but since we are stabilizing the
   codebase and improving the documentation, the questions coming in are way
   more less
- 442 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (+2% increase) Just a little
  increase related to new stuff and housekeeping plus the on-going work for
  Camel 3.4.0
- 409 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (+13% increase) We closed a lot of
  stuff for 3.3.0 and for 3.4.0
- 3187 commits in the past quarter (-14% decrease) The code is stabilizing and
  we are focusing on less material now, that's why the commits are less
- 823 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (+28% increase) This is for the
  stabilization, so feature contributor are continuing to work on them and we
  have also new contributors opening PRs for documentation and little fixes
- 826 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (+28% increase) This is for the
  stabilization, so feature contributor are continuing to work on them and we
  have also new contributors opening PRs for documentation and little fixes
- 292 issues opened on GitHub, past quarter (-3% decrease) This is for the new
  projects in the ecosystem, we are opening more or less the same number of
  issues on the subprojects
- 320 issues closed on GitHub, past quarter (+42% increase) This is because we
  went through the existing issues in camel-k and camel-k-runtime before
  releasing the 1.0.0 GA

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Jesse MacFadyen]

## Status report for the Apache Cordova project - June 2020

## Description:
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
   JavaScript.

## Activity
 - We have not made a decision how best to use last year's generous donation
   since our plan to contract a specialist for UX and technical writing to
   update our documentation and create getting started guides was denied.  We
   will likely use the funds to purchase test devices for committers who need
   them, pending Apache approval, and acceptance by the donor.

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Health report:

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green -
failures are usually due to external service issues that do device testing.
Our nightly builds have been extremely stable.

We are still (slowly) working to resolve existing issues in JIRA, while also
maintaining all the new issues and pull requests in Github.

## Recent Releases
- Apache Curator 5.0.0 was released on 2020-05-28

## Project Activity:
- We had a major release last week
- We are currently voting on a new PMC/committer

## Community Health:
While I still think the Curator community is healthy I was disappointed by the
lack of engagement recently with an important issue with Curator (see thread
here:
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/curator-dev/202005.mbox/%3cE5511DF7-06EB-43B9-851E-E08FCDA8A204@jordanzimmerman.com%3e).
I tried to get engagement as hard as I could - email, Slack, cross-posting to
ZooKeeper, Twitter - still only the 3 active Curator committers responded. I
don't know what to do about this. I know that Curator is used throughout the
Tech industry - why don't they take more interest in it? I don't know.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Olaf Krüger]

## Description:
Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop. Because the
FlashPlayer reaches its EOL at the end of 2020, we won't be able to
target the browser with Flex after 2020.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Flex was founded 2012-12-19 (7 years ago)
There are currently 69 committers and 45 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Olaf Krüger on 2017-08-28.
- No new committers. Last addition was Greg Dove on 2016-09-07.

## Project Activity:
After a few uncertainties, it turned out that Harman feels obliged to pay
attention to Flex in case of AIR updates. Adobe has removed the entire Flex,
AIR and Flash documentation from their website and put it into an accessable
archive. The community started a discussion about saving this stuff and making
it available through Apache.

## Community Health:
There is nearly no activity on the dev list. On the users list, questions
about the Flex framework itself are getting fewer. Most of the users list
activity is related to AIR, recurring issues with the Flex installer and
migration paths.

The newest committer is Benchao Li, joined on June 8th, 2020.

There are currently 59 committers and 29 PMC members in this project.

## Releases
The following releases were made since the last board report:
  - Apache Flink 1.9.3 was released on 2020-04-26.
  - Apache Flink 1.10.1 was released on 2020-05-12.
  - Stateful Functions (StateFun) 2.0 was released on 2020-04-07.
  - Stateful Functions (StateFun) 2.1 was released on 2020-06-09.
  - Flink-shaded 11.0 was released on 2020-05-29.

## Project Activity:
  - The community is currently finalizing the 1.11.0 release, the first
    release candidate has been published. Besides the common usability
    improvements and hardening, the release brings a major update to
    Flink's checkpoint mechanism, supports better handling of
    change-data-capture streams, integrates streaming data with Hadoop/Hive,
    adds better support for common libraries for Python users, and more.

  - The contributed Stateful Functions project has now undergone two releases
    as part of Apache Flink, meaning the integration has been successfully
    completed. 

  - The Flink Forward San Francisco conference took place as an open virtual
    event due to the COVID-19 situation. While this worked well for the part
    of knowledge and experience sharing, the feedback from many committers
    was that they prefer an in-person event once it becomes feasible again.

  - For the same reason as above, the next Flink Forward conference (taking
    place in late October) will be again a virtual event, open and free to
    everyone. 

  - There is a request to use the Apache Flink brand for a fan page. The PMC
    is handling the discussion. The main point is how to strike a good trade-off
    between making it clear that this is not an official website of the
    Apache Flink project, and making it recognizable at first glance that this
    website is about Flink.

  - The Flink community migrated most of the CI infrastructure to a sponsored
    Azure Pipelines account. That reduced Flink's usage of ASF Travis resources
    significantly. The remaining ASF Travis CI use will probably be phased out
    incrementally along with older releases that still rely on the Travis setup.

  - The community published its first CVE based on a third-party report and
    fix. We found the process to be well documented.

  - There is an ongoing discussion in the community about adding more
    localized contents, triggered by the contribution of a Japanese translation
    of (parts of) the website. At this point, the conclusion was that we
    need to first invest into better tooling before being able to handle
    more versions of the documentation (website being a bit easier, because
    it is less frequently updated).

## Community Health:
The Flink community is proud that Flink continues to be among the most active
projects in the ASF.
  - user@f.a.o (2452 mails/quarter)
  - user-zh@f.a.o (1930 mails/quarter)
  - dev@f.a.o (3914 mails/quarter)

JIRA continues to be very active as well, 1622 JIRA tickets created,
1351 JIRA tickets closed in the last 3 months.

## Description:
The mission of Apache Guacamole is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to providing performant, browser-based remote access

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Guacamole was founded 2017-11-14 (3 years ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:

## Community Health:
The community is active and healthy. Project website traffic more than doubled
at the end of March due to COVID-19 and the widespread need to work from home.

The increased traffic has subsided somewhat since then, but is still at least
50% more than normal. Activity on the user@ mailing list is also substantially
higher.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server. Gump's intention
isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that makes people look
beyond their project's boundaries and helps the projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version control
systems. The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well as non-ASF
projects and their dependencies. It started in the Java part of the foundation
but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and OpenSSL.

# Summary

In essence, nothing has changed over the past three months and we honestly do
not anticipate changes in the foreseeable future.

The Tomcat community is the only one still using Gump actively and the only
activity in Gump is around keeping the infrastructure alive and tweaking
things for the benefit of Tomcat builds.

We will certainly support any other project that wants to get the benefit of
the early warning system for backwards incompatible changes Gump provides, but
we are not actively recruiting projects.

# Releases

Gump has never done any releases. One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the time
following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

# Changes to the Roster

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure the ASF
installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark Thomas join
in November 2014.

Brett Porter has left the PMC in December 2019.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- No new committers were added (since graduation).

## Project Activity:
Apache Hudi is currently in the process of finalizing 0.5.3 release, which
delivers large performance, usability improvements.

Community continues to work towards the next 0.6.0 major release, planned over
the next month or so. We are also adding more testing to further improve
developer velocity and quality. Community also participated in a bug bash,
that ran over 10 days.

We have had 4 major design proposals (RFCs) submitted and under review,
targetting major releases beyond 0.6.0.

Blogs/Talks
- Blogs have been moved over to the hudi.apache.org site and contributors have
  written some useful new blogs
- Hudi PMC has authored a very popular info.cn article on technical
  underpinnings of Hudi, that was featured as a top story.
- Couple of planned talks were cancelled due to COVID.

## Community Health:

Dev mailing list activity is a mix of user questions and technical
discussions, which have been pretty steady.

We continue to steadily ship code, with contributors driving a large chunk of
them.

We use Github Issues as the support channel, and there was a lot of growth in
users engaging with us on Github to file support issues.

We are triaging some flaky test issues now, that has slightly affected our
ability to land PRs quickly. Community is actively working on mitigating this.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for June 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 43 podlings incubating. In May, podlings executed nine 
distinct releases. We added one new IPMC members and three retired.

There was one IP clearance in May. There are still two new podlings under 
discussion or VOTE, and they are HBlock and Pegasus. Two projects, Hudi and 
Iceberg, graduated last month. 

At least one podling is heading towards graduation in this or the next 
board report, the next one to graduate is likely to be APISIX. This month 
we were missing reports from Liminal, Spot, Hivemall and Warble. Liminal and 
Spot asked to report next month. Hivemall and Warble didn't report and will 
be asked to report next month.

It was found that the MXNet podling's releases and download page were not 
in line with ASF release and distribution policy. The project had been 
distributing releases with Category X code and distributing unreleased 
code. There has been a lengthy discussion both on legal-dicusss and the 
incubator general list on this. The project has taken some small steps to 
correct the issues but seems to be hesitant to do so and currently. These 
issues are still publically unresolved. The Incubator PMC may need to take 
further action on this.

A couple of established podlings seem to be having trouble following the 
correct process for adding PPMC members. It's not clear why this is the 
case as the process is well documented and simple.

Huddi graduated, but there was a small issue with its proposed PMC list 
that was corrected. Iceberg also graduated, there was some discussion about 
some issues with its license and notice files in its releases.

A couple of mentors have been added and removed from projects. Most on list 
traffic was around releases and graduations.

Two podlings SDAP and Spot still need to sort out their roster and private 
mailing list subscriptions.

## Crail

Crail is a storage platform for sharing performance critical data in
distributed data processing jobs at very high speed.

Crail has been incubating since 2017-11-01.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Grow developers community
  2. Grow Crail use base
  3. More steady release cycle

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  no.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We see increasing traffic on the dev mailing list from
  Crail users. A recent proposal from Adrian to add elastic
  scaling got positive feedback from other committers.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Crail went through a phase of limited visible activities on
  the code base. It is critical the Crail developers
  community resumes to be more active to keep the project
  making decent progress. Using Crail as an ephemeral data
  store for serverless computing emerges as a very suitable
  use case. Pushing this forward, aiming at inclusion
  in a next release is of common interest among the
  committers.

  2. Grow the developer community
  3. Attract more users

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  There are no issues right now.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  In the past three months, the community developed rather well: New users
  appeared on the mailing lists, and we were able to elect the first
  external committers. The mailing list activity has increased and many 
  discussions on development-related tasks were done on the developer 
  mailing list. Overall, we feel that the community is more and more 
  following the Apache way.

  Some specific community development activities include:
  - We updated the wiki with developer information, getting started guides
    and step-by-step manuals for release management (see
    https://s.apache.org/ocz7t)
  - Updated website to include better overview of existing pipeline elements
  - Intensified work with manufacturing company to use StreamPipes for IIoT
    analytics
  - We published a blog post on how to run StreamPipes on Kubernetes, we now
    plan to publish blog posts at regular intervals
  - Added "communication channels & strategy" page in the wiki and gathered
    potential communication channels in close exchange with our mentors
    planning to intensify community growth
  - Took part in webinar series about open source for small and medium 
    sized companies (video on YouTube, currently only in German)
  - Number of Twitter followers increased (last report: 103, currently: 128)
  - Number of Github stars increased (last report: 109, currently: 144)

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  - We successfully released our first official Apache release (version
    0.66.0) including several improvements (see release notes
    https://s.apache.org/2grsk), to name the most prominent changes:
    completely new dashboard and notification design in UI, more pipeline 
    elements and improved connectors  
  - Many new pipeline elements have been added by newly elected committers
  - Both documentation and website were improved in order to increase the
    adoption of Apache StreamPipes and grow the user base

  In the next month, we plan to add better support for edge computing and
  improve the UI.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Marcel Reutegger]

## Description:
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming implementation
of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content repository is
 stable, largely feature complete and actively being maintained. Jackrabbit
 Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
 repository as a modern successor to the Apache Jackrabbit content repository.
 It is targeted for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and
 other demanding content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak
 does not implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it
 is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:

Apache Jackrabbit was founded 2006-03-15 (14 years ago) There are currently 56
committers and 56 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - Fabrizio Fortino was added to the PMC on 2020-05-22
 - Vinod Holani was added to the PMC on 2020-05-11
 - Martijn Hendriks was removed from the PMC on 2020-06-05
 - Fabrizio Fortino was added as committer on 2020-05-21
 - Vinod Holani was added as committer on 2020-05-09
 - Martijn Hendriks was removed as committer on 2020-06-05

## Project Activity:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All maintenance
branches and the main development branch are continuously seeing moderate to
high activity.

We continue making regular feature releases of Jackrabbit Oak. The most recent
release was Jackrabbit Oak 1.30.0 that was made available on May 27th.

The Apache Jackrabbit FileVault component successfully moved from SVN to GIT
(INFRA-20285).

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of the work
going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly driven by
dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

On March 26th the team retired the Apache Jackrabbit 2.8 branch. Users of
Apache Jackrabbit are encouraged to upgrade to 2.20 for Java 8, 2.14 for Java
7 or 2.12 for Java 6.

On March 31st the team retired the Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.0 branch. Users of
Apache Jackrabbit Oak are encouraged to upgrade to 1.26.0 for Java 8, 1.6.20
for Java 7 or 1.2.31 for Java 6.

On April 6th the team retired the Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.10 branch. Users of
Apache Jackrabbit Oak are encouraged to upgrade to the latest release of the
newest maintenance branch (1.22.3).

## Community Health:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all mailing
lists reflecting the activity of the respective component.

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user lists as
well as on the various JIRA issues.

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the JIRA issues
and the desire of the individual contributors to bring features and
improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.

The report about a potential vulnerability to the security mailing list
revealed that only a small group of mostly passive PMC members are subscribed
to the security list. The PMC members were asked to subscribe to the security
list in order to add active members to the list.

In the last 3 months the project added two new committers and PMC members.

Martijn Hendriks contacted the PMC and expressed his desire to resign. His
resignation from the PMC and committer base became effective on June 5th after
his confirmation that he also wants to be removed as a committer.

## Releases:

 - jackrabbit-2.18.5 was released on 2020-03-06
 - jackrabbit-oak-1.22.2 was released on 2020-03-16
 - jackrabbit-oak-1.8.21 was released on 2020-03-23

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Karaf Project  [Jean-Baptiste Onofré]

## Description:
Apache Karaf provides a modern and polymorphic applications runtime,
multi-purpose (micro services, cloud, integration, IoT, OSGi, etc).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Karaf was founded 2010-06-16 (10 years ago) There are currently 31
committers and 17 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Francois Papon on 2018-11-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Francois Papon on 2018-05-19.

## Project Activity:
The first Apache Karaf European Meetup stood "virtually" using Zoom with the
help of Codecentric. We had 80 people registered and around 50 people during
the meetup. We can say the event has been a success. Three talks were given:
 - Karaf on the cloud (JB Onofré, Apache)
 - Karaf at Netflix (Dmitry Vasilyev, Netflix)
 - Karaf roadmap (open discussion) We saw lot of interest and enthusiasm about
   Apache Karaf. The meetup has been recorded and available on YouTube:
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYXT5y8gwAg On the other hand, resulting to
   the discussion with the community and during the meetup (and after), a new
   PoC has started about Karaf: Karaf DevX. The purpose is to provide a way
   better developer experience with Karaf. DevX PoC started and we will
   communicate on the mailing list as soon as we have something "showable" to
   the community. About the release front, Apache Karaf Decanter 2.4.0 has
   been released with new collectors (ConfigAdmin, OSHI, ...), new layer named
   processors (allowing to perform any processing between collectors and
   appenders, for instance aggregation), and some fixes. About Apache Karaf
   runtime, 4.2.9 will be submitted to release soon, especially to fix issue
   with the shell. Karaf 4.3.0.RC2 is also in preparation as new step to 4.3.0
   GA release.

## Community Health:
As we thought, Apache Karaf Meetup has been very interesting and a great
opportunity to promote the project and the community. We already planned a
second meetup around the end of this year. We postponed the move of ServiceMix
Bundles and Specs to Apache Karaf as some bundles were required by third party
projects (like Camel). However, the "technical" standpoint started and it's
still the target asap.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Anshum Gupta]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
The community is currently working on reducing the tech debt that Solr
currently carries, as mentioned in the previous board report. Several
committers are actively working on a much improved 9.0 release.

## Membership Data:
Apache Lucene was founded 2005-01-18 (15 years ago)
There are currently 85 committers and 54 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Nhat Nguyen on 2020-03-02.
- Alessandro Benedetti was added as committer on 2020-03-18
- David Eric Pugh was added as committer on 2020-04-05
- Mayya Sharipova was added as committer on 2020-06-08

## Project Activity
The Apache Lucene PMC after a vote on the public list has decided to promote
Apache Solr to its own TLP. This vote[1] happened after a reasonable amount of
discussion[2] on the private list. The Lucene PMC would require the help of
the board in the creation of this project as there are differing opinions
around bootstrapping the PMC of the new Apache Solr project. The Lucene PMC
plans to send a resolution proposal after finalizing on the PMC list for the
Apache Solr project.

We released Apache Lucene and Solr 8.5.0, 8.5.1 and 8.5.2 since the last
report.

Solr 8.5.0 introduced the ability for Solr to run with a Security manager
enabled. Lucene 8.5.0 release introduced more spatial search features and
improvements in addition to various performance optimizations.

An 8.5.1 release was done to fix a bug in Lucene that could cause index
corruption with docValues update.

Lucene and Solr 8.5.2 were released to fix a memory usage regression from a
bug that affected Fuzzy queries.

We also released Apache Lucene and Solr 7.7.3 since the last report. Solr
7.7.3 release back ported a fix for performance regression from a previous
release. Lucene release back ported the bug fix for index corruption during
docValues update.

## Community Health:
Our Jira issue activity and code contributions are also very strong. Though
the numbers overall were lower, most likely due to the COVID pandemic, 322
issues were opened and 216 closed in JIRA in the past quarter.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.


== Summary ==

This quarter has seen some progress with moving both the project and the
community forward:

 * We held a vote to move from JIRA to GitHub issues, which passed unanimously
 * We have migrated all of the open issues from JIRA to GitHub and set up new
   milestones
 * Lucene.NET 4.8.0 is now "feature complete"
 * The release procedure has been fully documented, and Shannon Deminick
   released 4.8.0-beta00008 as proof of concept
 * The API documentation has now been set up so each release has its own
   documentation version
 * We added a new PMC member and a new committer, who are both actively
   engaged in the project
 * The CI process has been streamlined a bit so a build/test cycle is about 5
   minutes faster
 * The Lucene.Net NuGet package is now being downloaded more than 2000 times
   daily (across all versions)

Lucene.NET 4.8.0-beta00008 was released this quarter. Since we have directed
our GitHub Issues to the mailing list, it has been more active than usual. A
few bug reports and user issues have also been reported, and several pull
requests have been submitted.


== Remaining Work on 4.8.0 ==

We updated the itemized list of remaining issues for both Lucene.NET and ICU4N
and have arrived at the following estimates to production release:

Lucene.NET 4.8.0

* Hours Completed: ~4200
* Hours Remaining: ~400

  17.12.03 was released on 2020-04-27.
- The community has revived our traditional "Community Days" celebration with
  the addition of associating a theme (i.e. focusing on specific
  tasks/topics): during a long weekend we work together at resolving as many
  tickets as we can in the selected theme; the community has widely accepted
  the theming and has been accomplishing more with the contributions.
- Details about the community activities are published in the official blog
  [1], on Twitter [2], YouTube [3] and other social media [4].
- Trademarks: we do not have trademark related concerns at the moment and our
  backlog of non-compliant parties is mostly empty
- Vulnerability reports: as anticipated in our last report, with the
  publication of two releases in the 17.12 series, we have resolved the last
  two CVEs in our backlog: CVE-2019-0235 and CVE-2019-12425

## Community Health:
As anticipated in our last report we have invited new PMC members (3) that
were in our watchlist of active committers; one new committer has been invited
as well. The migration to Git is complete and the community is still refining
the documentation and workflows around the new source repository. As usual the
community is engaged in improving the trunk, fixing vulnerabilities,
stabilizing the two active release branches, publishing new releases (2 in the
last quarter) and in various discussions and support requests posted in the
mailing list and in our issue tracker.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specifications which are defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0), JSR-346
 (CDI-1.1 and CDI-1.2 MR) and JSR-365 (CDI-2.0).

 The OWB community also maintains  a small server as
 Apache Meecrowave subproject. Meecrowave bundles latest releases of
 the ASF projects Tocmat9 + OpenWebBeans + CXF + Johnzon + log4j2.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 We've shipped a new bugfix release which also contains a few
 features to improve running on GraalVM and micro environments.
 We also improved eventing performance a bit. 
 We go through a phase of not so many changes. The last
 official CDI spec release was quite some time ago and the new
 JakartaEE based spec is not yet around the corner.
 Given that fact the activity was really ok.
 We also have a GSoC project going on which looks promising.

## Health report:
 Same as the last time: The project is still reasonably active and 
 we also will see some fresh demand once (if) JakartaEE picks up speed.
 We also saw some PRs and people coming back to the project.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 13 PMC members, 20 committers
 - Last PMC addition was Reinhard Sandtner on 2017-10-09.
 - Last committer addition was John D. Ament on 2017-10-09.

 - 2.0.15 was released on 2020-02-18.
 
## Project Statistics:
 Increased JIRA and mailing list statistics.
 - dev@openwebbeans.apache.org had a 84% increase in traffic 
   in the past quarter (240 emails compared to 130)
 - 27 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (58% increase)
 - 28 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (55% increase)

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Pig Project  [Koji Noguchi]

## Description:
Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets on Hadoop.  It provides
a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with
infrastructure for evaluating these programs.

## Issues:
Still no 0.18 release. Activity was already low for this project but after
Covid, we are almost silent.  Personally, I haven't been able to work in the
past 3 months mainly taking care of my family.  So the same issues from last
quarter's report remain.

"We still haven't released 0.18 with Hadoop version 3 support but we are
 making progress now. We are working on updating owasp known vulnerabilities
 and also dealing with conflicts moving to newer dependencies and supporting
 newer versions of dependent stacks.  Also, working on fixing unstable
 pig-on-spark unit&e2e test failures."

We will try to work with the active committers and PMC to see if they can make
time to wrap up the release depending on their Covid situation (daycare/school
opening, etc).

## Membership Data:
Apache Pig was founded 2010-09-21 (10 years ago) There are currently 31
committers and 17 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Koji Noguchi on 2016-08-04.
- No new committers. Last addition was Nándor Kollár on 2018-09-06.

## Project Activity:
Very low.  We need to work for 0.18 release.
(Last 0.17.0 release was on 2017/06/16. )

## Community Health:
Overall activity is low as the project is mostly stable and contributions are
mainly bug fixes.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Lee Whitcomb]

## Description:
Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the Java
platform.

## Issues:
Community health has been very weak for many years already, and there are no
signs of it improving. Since the PMC Chair (and only active committer) has
been going through personal issues, discussion about moving to the Attic has
once again picked up.

## Membership Data:
Apache Pivot was founded 2009-12-16 (10 years ago)
There are currently 10 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

## Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Niclas Hedhman on 2016-01-14.
- No new committers. Last addition was Niclas Hedhman on 2020-02-06.

## Project Activity:
Activity is very low, with a flurry of new activity this quarter from
the single developer still active, but little external interest. The
current activity is still aimed toward what we anticipate to be a final
2.1 release with possible conclusion this year.

## Community Health:
Community health is not great, although 3 PMC members are still available to
make decisions, but there are no new committers or PMC Members in sight.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache PLC4X Project  [Christofer Dutz]

## Description:

The mission of the Apache PLC4X project is creating a set of libraries for
communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a
variety of protocols but with a shared API.

## Issues:

None

## Membership Data:

Apache PLC4X was founded 2019-04-17 (a year ago)
There are currently 16 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Lukas Ott was added to the PMC on 2020-03-17
- Etienne Robinet was added as committer on 2020-03-28
- Otto Fowler was added as committer on 2020-04-30

## Project Activity:

- 0.7.0 was released on 2020-05-25

This quarter was pretty much dominated by us porting the last drivers to
the new generated drivers system. Also were we working hard on preparing
things for the 0.7.0 release which was our first release of the new
generation of drivers.

Also did Chris start on his EU research funded project on porting PLC4X to
the C language with a final goal of running PLC4X drivers on Apache
MyNewt.

This new initiative brought to the table a number of new contributors.
Otto who was invited to join the project was one of these.

In general the number of conference talks dropped to 0 in this period due
to COVID-19, but quite a number of online meetups have been talked about:

- "Hands On": Reading Siemens S7 with PLC4X" was in German on 2020-04-01, 
  and english was 2020-04-09
- (Industrial) IoT with Open Source - an Overview on "Monthly Industry
  4.0 and IoT Meetup Stuttgart" was 2020-04-21
- IoTSydney: 2020-04-30

We’re continuing to make good progress on most topics.

As it is one of the projects major barriers, that we usually aren’t
allowed to officially mention which companies are using PLC4X, we decided
to add a page of “adopters” to our website, where companies can get
themselves listed. We decided that the process should generally work via
GitHub pull requests as this way we would have the responsibility on file.

 https://plc4x.apache.org/users/adopters.html

So far we haven’t had any requests to adding other companies.

## Community Health:

The community is in great shape and due to the increased diversity of the
codebase we have seen new folks join in on discussions or even joining the
project. We are hopeful that this trend will continue.

It also seems that in the past few weeks the inter-project cooperation has
increased. Here I’d especially like to point out the Apache StreamPipes
and the Apache IoTDB project.

Stats may be different, as at the time of creating the report the report
tool wasn't working so I had to compile them myself

- dev@plc4x.apache.org had a 56% increase in traffic in the past quarter 
  (655 emails compared to 419) 
- 15 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-42% decrease)
- 13 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-35% decrease)

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent
interface to underlying platform-specific implementations. APR provides an API
to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if not
identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is
built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work
around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.
Consistent abstractions are provided both for host platforms and for utilities
such as databases.  In addition, APR provides a range of general-purpose
utilities.

## Issues:
  I'm sorry, I don't know if this merits highlighting here.  It is not
  an issue of tension or conflict, or any ill feeling.
  An ongoing issue marked private in this report highlights historic
  segmentation in our community, with Windows platform expertise being
  relatively sparse compared to *X.  Our most recent community members
  have windows expertise, but are dealing with arcane detail while
  others (including your humble scribe) have nothing to contribute.

## Membership Data:
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) was founded 2000-12-01 (19 years ago)
There are currently 67 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ivan Zhakov on 2019-11-05.
- No new committers. Last addition was Evgeny Kotkov on 2017-09-13.

## Project Activity
Activity has again been low.  Apart from Windows platform issues, the
main topic of discussion has been the question of back-compatibility
vs build cleanup for a prospective APR 2.0.

Last releases:
  APR 1.7.0 was released on April 5th, 2019
  APR-util 1.6.1 and APR-iconv 1.2.2 were released on October 22nd 2017

## Community Health:
The community remains stable and broadly healthy.  In the absence of
substantial new development we are slow to attract interest, but
neither are we losing people!

## Project Activity:
We are working on a Jetspeed release 2.3.2 including:
* Security improvements
* Better Spring integration with portlets
* Various bug fixes

Pluto has not been very active, but is looking 
into some minor security improvements

## Community Health:
The project health is same as last report. 
Not much activity. Maybe the 2.3.2 release
 of Jetspeed will generate more interest. 
No commits in the last quarter to any of
 the sub-projects. I have some outstanding commits
 going in next quarter.

source stack, that enables developers to manage and deploy production-ready 
predictive services for various kinds of machine learning tasks

## Issues:
Update: We have not received sufficient interest from the community to take
over the project. If nobody else objects, it would be time to consider moving
the project to the attic.

Last report: A community member, who's a committer and PMC of another Apache

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Piotr Zarzycki]

## Description:
Apache Royale is a new implementation of the principles of Apache Flex,
designed for JavaScript instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes. Apache Royale
improves developer productivity in creating applications to run wherever
JavaScript runs, including on browsers as well as in Apache Cordova
applications, Node, etc.

## Issues:
1. One of our PMC member notified us that he is no longer paid for a full time
   work on our project. It may have significant impact on our progress.
2. Disagreement between two PMC members which involved a contributor who is
   not yet a committer broke down communication and personal accusations were
   made.

## Releases:
Apache Royale 0.9.7 was released on May 13 2020

## Membership Data:
No new PMCs nor committers in the most recent quarter. We are discussing
adding someone as a committer.

## Project Activity:
- We have started long discussion about changing the release process. The
  resulting release process should be easier, letting us create new releases
  more frequently.
- Two PMC members started the current release process in order to understand
  it better and have better insight into potential changes.

- Discussion about merging three repositories into one has been started on the
  list.

- We are still investing a lot of time in supporting users who want to port
  existing applications from Flex to Apache Royale.

- Emulation of Flex components has been significantly improved. Developers can
  use emulation with success for porting most of their existing MX components
  and some Spark components.

## Community Health:
- We had a lot of activity on social networks, sharing what is happening in
  Apache Royale as we progress in the project. We think it is important to do
  this so people outside the project and not following it on a daily basis can
  get a notion of how we are doing. The numbers are:

- Our Twitter account has 661 (previously 643) followers.
- Our Facebook page has 147 (previously 144) likes.
- Our LinkedIn Group has 131 (previously 129) people.
- Our StackOVerFlow "apache-royale" tag currently has 50 (previously 44)
  questions.
- We recently added a Slack channel, "royale", in the-asf.slack.com workspace
  as an experiment to support real-time collaboration.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Sentry Project  [Kalyan Kalvagadda]

## Description:
The mission of Sentry is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Fine grained authorization to data and metadata in Apache Hadoop

## Issues:

Contributions to this project are down from the last few quarters. Like me,
some folks who were active in the project started working on other stuff which
brought down the contribution.

We had roll call for PMC's to see if there are enough PMC's willing to help to
make releases and fix vulnerabilities. We received responses from 3 PMC's.

We also started a community roll call in the dev list invitation folks
interested to get involved in the community. Here is the link for the roll
call.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

## Description:
Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Issues:
There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache ServiceMix was founded 2007-09-19 (13 years ago)
There are currently 50 committers and 21 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andrea Cosentino on 2017-03-15.
- No new committers. Last addition was Andrea Cosentino on 2016-03-13.

## Project Activity:
- During the last period we have released 3 sets of OSGi bundles and Specs
  - Apache ServiceMix Specs (jaxb-api) on March 08 2020
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2020.03 on April 03 2020
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2020.04 on May 04 2020
  - Apache ServiceMix Bundles 2020.05 on June 08 2020
- During the next period we are going to provide
  - the next Bundles and Specs releases

## Community Health:
- During the last period the activity of the community (mailing lists, JIRA,
  releases) has been slower than during the last period.
- As stated in the previous report, due to low interest to provide further
  releases of ServiceMix Assembly we are preparing the project to move it to 
  Attic:
  - We are going to provide the ServiceMix user a smooth path to migrate to 
    Karaf ecosystem by writing an migration guide and a documentation about 
    running integration in the vanilla Karaf.
  - We are going to move the Bundles and Specs to Apache Karaf or provide 
    there another mechanism to consume Java libraries as OSGi bundles. Until we
    achieve this we are going to provide next releases for the required bundles 
    and specs.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for June 2020

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running our rule update infrastructure and
our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

SpamAssassin 3.4.4 was released on 28 January, 2020. It was primarily a
security release, fixing two CVEs, all then known outstanding open security
issues on the project.

Release of SpamAssassin 3.4.5 is imminent, fixing a subsequently reported CVE
level security issue.

We intend to return our primary focus to development of version 4.0.0.

We voted to replace use of "blacklist" and "whitelist" with words such as
block/deny/allow, after seeing similar action by UK National Cyber Security
Centre and Chromium. The changes will be phased to avoid breaking existing
installations, with technical details now to be worked out in our normal
development process.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.4 on 28 January 2020.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

  Included names and starting date in this report.

  > td: It worries me that you have such a small PMC and so many more
  >   committers and contributors. Are the PMC members from a wide

  Regarding PMC from wide varity of companies. Yes, 8 PMCs are from 5
  different companies.

  Regarding #PMC v.s. committers, adding more active committers to PMC is
  always our goal, and now we're getting more new members deeply involved in

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Unomi Project  [Serge Huber]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Unomi is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to providing a reference implementation of the OASIS Customer Data Platform 
specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical 
Committee

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Unomi was founded 2019-02-20 (a year ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 6 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was David Griffon on 2019-02-20.
- No new committers. Last addition was Taybou on 2019-04-01.

## Project Activity:

The project just had a major release (1.5) that was focused on ElasticSearch 7
support (and offering an automated migration path from ElasticSearch 5), JDK
11 support, Docker/Cloud improvements as well as initial Kafka integration.
Also, the project is initiating with this release a more rapid and regular
release schedule, and immediately released 1.5.1 to fix some minor issues
following the major release.

The focus will now be two-fold:
- Maintaining the 1.5 stable version
- Start working on the 2.0 major release, that will introduce a new GraphQL
  API to be compliant with the final release of the OASIS Customer Data
  Platform specification. Other major changes such as refactorings are
  expected in planning of this release.

Recent releases:

    1.5.1 was released on 2020-05-14.
    1.5.0 was released on 2020-05-12.
    1.4.0 was released on 2019-05-24.

## Community Health:

The community is really becoming more and more active, especially in the
#unomi Slack channel where most of the activity now happens. The PMC is
careful to make sure no decisions are taking in Slack and that major
discussions and votes are always only happening in the mailing lists. There
are currently - at the time of writing - 65 members in the Apache Unomi Slack
channel.

The community has also diversified, with commercial entities now starting to
integrate Apache Unomi directly into products, and becoming regular users and
contributors to the project. For example, the GraphQL implementation (over 200
Java classes!) was contributed by people that were not original contributors.

The PMC is really focused on growing the community as much as possible, in a
sustainable way and focusing on making it easier than ever to get on-board.

Some community metrics:

- 65 members in Apache Slack #unomi channel
- dev@unomi.apache.org had a 144% increase in traffic in the past quarter 
  (587 emails compared to 240) 
- users@unomi.apache.org had a 48% decrease in traffic in the past quarter 
  (13 emails compared to 25)
- 61 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (144% increase) 
- 74 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (825% increase)
- 137 commits in the past quarter (92% increase)

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Aaron Coburn on 2012-06-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Mike Jennings on 2019-01-04.

## Project Activity:
- Last release: 2019-07-25
- VCL is software for running a private cloud and is uniquely suited for
  universities. With university instruction moving online due to COVID-19
  we've seen a notable uptick in interest in VCL. Traffic on our user list and
  in our IRC support channel is up significantly.
- VCL is mainly run on CentOS. There are some changes in CentOS 8 that we are
  working through in order for VCL to run on it. Once we work that out, we'll
  be getting a new release out.

## Community Health:
-The health of the VCL community is good even though we are small. Hopefully,
 we'll pick up some more participation with the increased interest in the
 project.
- There are 3 committers not currently part of the PMC. We are in the process
  of voting to invite one of them. The other 2 have not been heard from in
  over a year. If they become actively involved again, we'll definitely
  consider inviting them to be part of the PMC.

do with non-technical stuff like the official announce, site update, etc...
I'm quite confident we can finalize the release this month (June).

## Community Health:

Community is active and healthily. We saw an increasing participation with both 
user mailing list and with GitHub PRs.
Thomas Heigl, a long time user of Wicket, has been elected PMC after proposing
some remarkable changes to improve the overall page rendering performance.

While it was delayed, we did finally release 0.12.0 on 2020-04-13. It was
primarily geared towards some high level bug fixes and adjusting to changes in
the larger CI ecosystem.  This was followed by the usual break in activity as
everyone works on upgrading, etc.

There has been little activity of late.

Since then, we've had a global pandemic, job loss, social unrest, and a
society that has woken up to police brutality and racism.  A lot more
important issues going on than a tertiary level project even within the ASF.
Expecting activity right now isn't particularly realistic.

## Community Health:
To give some raw numbers has to how down things are:

* 15 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-44% decrease)
* 12 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-42% decrease)

* 14 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-17% decrease)
* 15 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-11% decrease)
