 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       We held the 2020 Annual Members Meeting at the end of March and
       elected a new board and voted to invite 34 new members to join us.
       Congratulations to the new board and thanks to all members who helped
       with the pre-, during-, and post-meeting technology that helped make
       the meeting run smoothly.

       The IRS-inspired Conflict of Interest policy was approved by the
       board, and board members and executive officers will need to confirm
       annually that they have read and understood it.

       The pandemic has not yet directly affected the operations of the
       Foundation except for postponement or cancellation of some
       face-to-face events and the possible postponement or cancellation of
       this year's ApacheCon that is currently scheduled for late September.
       But we also recognize that our sponsors may be less able to
       contribute, and we may need to adjust our expectations.

    B. President [Sam]

       At this point, David is effectively (in both senses of the word)
       operating as President.

       I am ready to step down as President as soon as the board is ready to
       name my replacement.  It is my recommendation that the board does so
       at the time of the April board meeting, and it is my further
       recommendation that David be named as my replacement.

       If the board chooses not to do this at this time, I am willing to
       continue for a short while, and will continue to defer to David to the
       extent possible.

       It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as ASF President these
       past three plus years.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 9.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       The Treasurer has been working with Infrastructure to migrate our bill 
       approvals and payments to a SaaS system.  We spent our Easter holiday 
       marveling at new features and increased usability as compared to our 
       current processes which use only SVN and Gsuite.  We have started a test
       run with a first invoice, and hope to complete that test run by the end 
       of April, with enough time to ensure that, if it fails, that invoice 
       can still be paid using traditional methods.

       As already discussed at the previous board meeting, but worth 
       reiterating, the financial uncertainty currently resulting from the 
       COVID19 pandemic will not directly touch our bank balances.  All our 
       funds are in low-interest FDIC-insured investments called CDARS, or in
       our bank account.  However the we are concerned about the 
       possible effects of the current uncertain economic situation on our 
       sponsors.  In an abundance of caution, we request that all officers look
       for ways to reduce or freeze costs.  We ask that the board hold us to 
       that.  We also ask that everyone be on the look out for financial risks 
       to the foundation, avoidable or unavoidable.  Please share those with us
       in a timely manner.

       Operating Cash on March 31st, 2020 was $2,089.5K, which is down $17.9K
       from last month’s ending balance (Feb 20) of $2,107.4 K.  Total Cash
       as of March 31st, 2020 is $3,510.4K (includes the Pineapple,
       Restricted Donation and project funds) as compared to $3,895.4K on
       March 31st, 2019, (a decrease of $385K year over year). The March 31st
       2020 ending Operating cash balance of $2,089.5K represents an
       Operating cash reserve of 10 months based on the “Estimated” FY20 Cash
       forecast average monthly spending of $209.1K/month.  The ASF actual
       Operating reserve of 10 months at the end of March 2020 is a bit ahead
       the budgeted 8 months of reserve for YTD March 31st, 2020.  The
       estimated YE Operating reserve of 10.2 months is ahead of the Budgeted
       YE reserve of 7.6 months.  The ASF Operating reserve is above the ASAE
       standard average of 6 months of reserve for Non-Profits.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Revenue is behind budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $384.6K (this is mostly due to timing of
       sponsor payments and Conference and Donations lagging a bit behind
       budget at this point in the Fiscal)  The open Accounts Receivable is
       at $467.1K, which as of the end of March 2020 Financial Close is
       enough, if it all arrives in the bank, before 4.30.20, to achieve the
       FY20 Foundation Sponsorship Budget. As compared to FY19, FY20 YTD
       revenue is ahead by $28.6K primarily due to FY20 Events exceeding
       Revenue as compared to FY19, YTD.

       YTD expenses through March 31st, 2020 are under budget by $478.4K,
       spread across all depts except Infra due to prepaying for Travis CL
       FY21 in March 2020.  The updated Cash forecast expects this underage
       in expenses to continue as we conclude the current Fiscal year.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$306.8K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$400.6K> NI or $93.8K better
       than the Budgeted NI for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  The
       cash forecast has been updated, with the information we have at hand,
       and at this point with one month left in the Fiscal year, we are still
       on pace to, if everything goes according to the Forecast, exceed our
       FY20 budgeted NI.

       We want to thank the Dept heads for their review of the FY20 actual
       activity which has allowed us to move some expenses to the correct
       accounts and departments, which has made the cash forecast a much more
       valuable management tool as we move forward and close out FY21.   With
       regard to FY19, we are ahead in revenue, by $28.6K as noted above, but
       we are also ahead on expenses by $746.5K (due to ACNA19, ACEU19, the
       Lease web payment which should have taken place in FY19, but did not,
       as well as other expenses that occurred in FY20 and not in FY19);
       thus, year over year NI FY20 is behind FY19 by $717.9K.  It is
       estimated that this will even out, to a degree, as we conclude FY20 at
       the end of April 2020.

       Budget
       ======

       See the current draft of the budget here
       https://s.apache.org/FY21-Draft-Budget
       If this were a normal year, we'd likely move forward
       with the current state of the budget. Due to the 
       pandemic, I plan on one more iteration to plan on 
       slightly tighter budget before I present it the Board
       for consideration. 

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Infra has canceled it's F2F Event - work is almost
       don on clawing remaining expenditures back from 
       airlines.
       Backfill the open sysadmin position is currently
       on hold as we figure out the fallout from the 
       Pandemic 

       CI stats are here: 
       https://infra-reports.apache.org/cistats/

       Infra has enabled BuildKite for Apache 
       Arrow. 

       Conferences
       ===========

       ACNA is still on track for end of September, beginning of October,
       Plenty of time remains if that decision needs to be revisited in 
       light of the current situation.

       Travel Assistance
       =================

       TAC is not currently entertaining travel funding but are working
       on a more sustainable application for intake and evaluation. 
       Requirements are currently been scoped. 

       Diversity & Inclusion
       =====================

       Movement on the analysis from survey, initial results have been
       reviewed from the vendor. Expect more on this next month.

       Five Outreachy-funded interns are expected for the next term. 
       This is a substantial increase from the last term. 

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Work continues here largely as expected, though seemingly quieter than
       normal.

       Fundraising
       ===========

       This work continues at the expected pace, which is good news.

       Brand Management
       ================

       Work continues at a steady pace. Please see the private section of the
       Brand Management report

Conferences.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

ASF Sponsor status: we are pursuing renewals for one Platinum, one Gold, five
Silver, and three Bronze sponsors, of which one Gold and one Silver have been
acquired and their renewal status remains unknown. We continue to wait for
purchase orders to invoice renewals for one Platinum and one Gold sponsor. We
are seeking a new point-of-contact for one Silver and three Bronze sponsors.
One Gold sponsor remains in arrears. We have had no new Sponsors this month.

Targeted sponsor status: we continue to confirm Targeted Sponsor commitments.
We are developing a new Targeted fund specifically earmarked for TAC
recipients to ASF Conferences. We have a new Targeted Sponsor that will mostly
focus on promoting ASF Conferences as a media partner for all events.

Sponsor Relations: we have been following up with Sponsors on the ASF 21st
Anniversary and other Foundation updates.

Events: we have suspended sales for ASF Conferences that were cancelled or
postponed due to the coronavirus.

Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we have earned $790 over the past
month. Worldwide donations have been generally directed towards efforts
supporting the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past quarter we experienced a high
volume of ongoing fraudulent donation attempts that are now easily blocked
through the Hopsie dashboard.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — April 2020

I. Budget: we continue to reconcile a bill presented by a vendor that has
already been paid in 2019. Given the circumstances surrounding the pandemic,
there have been delays on this front, but hope to get this resolved by the end
of the fiscal year.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising with Sponsor Relations, Sponsorship renewals and payments, and
Targeted Sponsor commitments. There have been delays over the past quarter
that may impact our end-of-year targets with respect to renewals and
receivables. Our work with ASF 2020 Conferences is on pause due to
COVID-19-related cancellations and postponements. We announced the ASF’s 21st
Anniversary https://s.apache.org/21stAnniversary; the new Board of Directors
https://s.apache.org/Board2020 ; launched a new monthly post on ASF
Infrastructure team "Inside Infra: Chris Thistlethwaite"
https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Chris ; issued the Apache Month in Review:
March 2020 https://s.apache.org/Mar2020 ; and published "Success at Apache:
Welcoming Communities Strengthens the Apache Way" https://s.apache.org/tcs0m.
Post-production continues on the ASF documentary, "Trillions and Trillions
Served".

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

26 March - The Apache® Software Foundation Celebrates 21 Years of Open Source
Leadership

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 9 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog.
4 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview were issued, with a total of
304 news summaries published to date. We tweeted 12 items to 56.5K followers
on Twitter, and posted 11 items on LinkedIn that garnered more than 27K
organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are on hold. Projects planning to
graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major
project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?"
highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to six media queries. The ASF received 1,178
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,276. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 1,821 press hits vs. last month's 1,622. ApacheCon received
105 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received no briefing requests during this time,
although we have been following up with an analyst regarding an Apache project
featured in an upcoming Webinar. Apache was mentioned in 1 report by Gartner;
3 reports by Forrester; 5 reports by 451 Research; and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. Central Services: the Creative team have updated the apache.org home
page and second tier templates for the ASF's 21st Anniversary. We are also
creating a new templated logo set for the new Apache Local Chapter initiative
that would allow for slight customization by each location. We are exploring
options for editorial production due to limited volunteer availability.

IX. Events liaison: support for events is on hold due to the coronavirus
impact on ASF Conferences; we are standing by to help promote any updates to
Apache Roadshows and ApacheCon. We have also secured a new Targeted Sponsor
who will be helping promote future ASF Conferences as a Media Partner.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: all accounts are auto-renewing to ensure
uninterrupted service. We are working to resolve accounts issues with one of
our vendors.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- Many finance-related items: budget, pause on hiring, bill.com.
- Working on a starter guide for website build and publish.

Finances
========
- The budget has been submitted for FY21.
- We should get back the bulk of our flight expenditures, due to
  government policies for airlines when a flight is canceled. Our
  current exposure is about US$2500, but should reach zero after
  discussion with airlines.
- We have one open headcount, but have decided to put a hold on
  backfilling the position until we get a better sense of the
  pandemic's effect on the world economy and our sponsors' ability to
  continue helping us.
- Working with Treasurer to stand up bill.com. The initial work looks
  very good, and (optimistically) we can start using it for issuing
  some payments. We will continue after the Easter weekend.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Complete the project-specific Jenkins masters standup.
- Fix Docker security/permission support.
- Using the CI/CD statistics, trim failing builds and work with
  projects to improve their utilization.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Move to new payment workflows.
- Portions of our mail system have been moved to 18.04/p6, but the
  rest needs to be migrated.

General Activity
================
- Continue documentation work, specifically around www.a.o/dev/ pages
  which need to migrate to infra.a.o.
- TravisCI was contracted for another year, at the same rate.
- Provided support for vote.a.o for the Annual Meeting.
- Improving Docker support and security on our Jenkins slaves.
- Changes to s.a.o to increase its capacity. The Annual Meeting
  created a large load, due to many links/uses for documentation and
  processes around the meeting.
- Added "stale" ticket insight on our Jira SLA page.

Uptime Statistics
=================
The TLP servers were having stability issues, but some parameter
tuning has stabilized their operation. It does not appear that these
created any impact on our communities or downstream users.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon North America will be held September 28 through October 1st, 2020,
in New Orleans. We are still proceeding as though the event will, in fact,
happen. The CFP has been extended until June 1, since attentions are elsewhere
at this time. We are also planning to extend the earlybird registration
deadlines out a few more weeks.

We continue to seek sponsorship for the event, but have taken the step of
offering sponsors to not pay until we have confirmed, for certain, that the
event will take place.

Meanwhile, we continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation, and watch other
conferences in the same time period as they struggle with the same decisions.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Much of this report is the same as last month, noting tweaks to membership and
mailing list activity

Current Events
==============

No current events

Future Events
=============

TAC has an events Calendar that it shares with other Committees for the
purposes of cross-committee planning and collaboration. Currently filled our
up until October. Due to the cancellation of many events, currently the next
supported event will be ApacheCon New Orleans.

Any ASF Project putting on a Hackathon and/or Meetup should also talk to TAC
about supporting them getting folks there (Committers and Non Committers)

Short Term Priorities
=====================

We are looking into creating a new webapp, one that is independent on the
reliance of one or two volunteers, that can be maintained and serve TACs needs
for the next few years. The webapp would need to be ready and tested before
applications open for the next event.

Long Term Priorities
====================

Be ready for applications open for ApacheCon NA, applications should be open
by early June.

Mailing List Activity
=====================

Discussion has begun on getting a new stable TAC Application Software.

Membership
==========

Inactive folks were removed from the committee, noting that should
circumstances change, they are welcome back at any time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

Continued to attend the Conference committee and assist where
applicable. Assisted in the Board Vote monitoring. Continue to attend
weekly fundraising calls and assist where applicable.

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

Contributors Gris Cuevas

Katia Rojas

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:
None

## Activity:

*** Project:  Survey***

- Preliminary results have been reviewed. 
- Bitergia is preparing a slide presentation with the summary 
of gathered information and insights.
- Bitergia will host a 1h debrief about the survey which will be recorded
and shared in the diversity mailing list.

*** Project: User Experience Research on new contributors ***
- The under represented groups of interest have been identified. 
- These are the groups the interviews will be focused on to expand the research. 
- Bitergia is drafting the invite for volunteers to be
interviewed
- The purpose of these interviews is to deep-dive into topics of
interest identified in the survey. 
- The survey debrief session will also serve as an introduction
to the questions from the interviews

*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***

- Don't forget to read the notes from the weekly working meetings, they are in
the D&I Wiki[1] and shared via the mailing list. 
- The team is following up with the mentor and mentee from the previous round 
to clarify the friction logs,they were also asked if sharing insights publicly was ok. 
- The mentor and mentee would be invited to the interviews derived from the survey 
- The second round of contributions has started, we have had 22 contributions for 3
projects 
- We're expecting to have 5 interns in this new round, a 5x growth from
the previous round 
- The V.P. of D&I will record an interview w/ Katia and Matt,
coordinators of the Outreachy program. This interview will be focused on
what's worked and what can be improved, as well as highlights. 
- The coordinators continue to expand the Outreachy FAQs 
- From Gris: We should discuss how to continue the program after funds run out

*** Operations ***
No updates.

## Health report:

The dev@ and diversity@ mailing lists continue to be slow, not too much
activity outside the work done for each ongoing project. The discussions have
been focused on topics that pertain to the projects we are running.

## Committee members changes:
None.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Dirk-Willem van Gulik]

Apologies for a late report - Corona related things took over.

No substancial process on the organisational side.

Few RQ related things got processed in time, commmunicated timely to
requestor, etc. Currently no tickets open that require action or have
deadlines. One ticket 'dead' where the requestors email ceased to work (and it
may have been a fluff/experimental/vigiliante style request).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

W3C are proposing process changes:

1/ "Recommendations" become "Specifications".

2/ Working groups can choose to have "living documents" with errata and
additions added in-place after publication.

These steps make it a little easier for open source projects to get feedback
recognized in specifications.

Proposed changes in-place https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#major-changes-2019

The Patent Policy is revised in line with these changes, but this should
not affect ASF participation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're up 1 (to 21),
unresolved issues this month.

Henri Yandell (in his VP Jakarta EE Relations capacity) closed the loop with
Eclipse Foundation around relationship between ASF and Eclipse. There are no
further actions required at this time.

We received request for classification of the newly minted "Mulan PSL v2"
license (LEGAL-513). This license originated in China and what makes it
unusual is that the canonical text is in Chinese. It has already been
approved by OSI. So far the consensus is that it is very close to the
original ALv2 license and thus can be added to the Cat A. Our final decision
is expected in a week or so.

We have received an affidavit request for details on how Apache License
applies to the projects we govern and what are the ramifications for the
contributors and downstream consumers. We're working on this request and
expect the work to continue for the next week or so.

Due to recent global events, progress on  various binary distribution
channels that ASF controls is slow, but it is still on my radar.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 12: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

In the stats below "site" refers to things where people report issues
that are not specific to a projects code, for example most of these are
reports of missing DMARC records, or lack of clickjacking protection,
or reports of open directory listings.  Almost none of these are actual
real issues, those that are get escalated to infra.

Stats for Mar 2020:

      29        [license confusion]
      13	[support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 43 (last months: 23, 40, 23, 31)


      13      [site]
      2       [flink], [lucene], [shiro], [skywalking], [tomcat]
      1       [ambari], [atlas], [camel], [couchdb], [cxf], [druid]
              [freemarker], [guacamole], [hadoop], [hc], [heron],
              [ignite], [jena], [kylin], [openmeetings], [syncope],
              [thrift], [velocity], [xerces], [zeppelin]

     In total, as of 1st April 2020, we're tracking 58 (last month:
     52) open issues across 35 projects, median age 61 (last month:
     81) days.  33 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     8 (last month: 6) of these issues, across 6 projects, are older
     than 365 days. None require board escalation.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 13: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations  [Henri Yandell]

Some minor progress to report.

I've reviewed the emails over the last year and received valuable input from
Mark Struberg, David Blevins, and Mark Thomas.

I reached out to Mike Milinkovich and Paul Buck at Eclipse to determine the
current status of things.

My summary:

* There was a 2018-ish agreement on the Jakarta name signed by Mark Thomas.
* There was an invitation from Eclipse for Apache to join the Jakarta EE
  Working Group as a guest, with 2 agreements to sign.
* There was also IP moved from Oracle to Eclipse related to the JCP and a
  desire for Apache to sign something.
* There will be a big javax to jakarta package renaming coming down the
  pipeline.

On these, the invitation is still open (#2) and there is still interest from
Eclipse in completing their diligence (#3).

My current action items are to identify the documents to be signed in #2 and
confirm that these were approved for signing; and to identify the mechanism by
which copyright licensing flowed from the ASF to the JCP so I understand what
copyright's in various JSRs the ASF may be able to license.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Airavata is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to executing and managing computational jobs on distributed computing 
resources including local clusters, supercomputers, national grids, academic 
and commercial clouds.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Airavata was founded 2012-09-18 (8 years ago)
There are currently 41 committers and 25 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Sudhakar Pamidighantam on 2019-12-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Aarushi Bisht on 2019-12-19.

## Project Activity:
Airavata contributions and activity is rejuvenating. Two new major
capabilities are actively being developed. Airavata Custos is spin off
security components from the main repository into its own repository. Airavata
Managed File Transfers is a new activity. We anticipate these refactoring to
stabilize and release them to community soon.

## Community Health:
The community is doing well, there are 4 google summer of code applicants to
projects ideas. There are new contributors active on the mailing lists and
submitting pull requests.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Christian Schneider]

## Description:
Apache Aries software is a set of pluggable Java components enabling an 
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Aries was founded 2010-12-15 (9 years ago)
There are currently 58 committers and 41 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carlos Sierra Andrés on 2018-07-03.
- Romain Manni-Bucau was added as committer on 2020-01-29

## Project Activity:
We mainly worked on Aries CDI and Aries JAX-RS-Whiteboard.

## Community Health:
Only a few of the many sub projects of Aries are active at the moment.
Activity on user list grew a bit but is still very low.
The biggest problem I see at the moment is that our website is very
outdated. While we have some very interesting projects that are widely
used in the OSGi community we are not announcing them well.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

The mission of Apache Arrow is the creation and maintenance of software related
to columnar in-memory processing and data interchange. The project has some
level of support for 11 different programming languages.

## Issues:

- We are continuing to work with INFRA on issues related to self-hosted CI
  machines integrated with our GitHub-based pull request workflows. There are
  two avenues we are exploring (and we may well use both of them), GitHub
  Actions Self-hosted and Buildkite. Per INFRA-19217 Buildkite has just been
  approved for the @apache GitHub organization and we have validated that
  we can successfully use this with the free Arrow organization that Buildkite
  has provided us. CI/CD is likely to require an ongoing significant investment
  of time, and we are doing the best we can try avoid overburdening ASF Infra
  with requests.

## Membership Data:

Apache Arrow was founded 2016-01-19 (4 years ago)
There are currently 50 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Francois Saint-Jacques was added to the PMC on 2020-03-04
- Neal Richardson was added to the PMC on 2020-03-04
- No new committers. Last addition was Joris Van den Bossche on 2019-12-06.

## Project Activity:

- 0.16.0 was released at the end of January. We are close to
  releasing 0.17.0, with a 1.0.0 release hopefully sometime in
  2020.
- Three months ago, Apache Arrow was accepted for continuous fuzzing in the
  OSS-Fuzz infrastructure.  We have now finally stabilized the situation by
  fixing all detected issues in the Arrow C++ IPC implementation, and are
  actively fixing issues in the Arrow C++ Parquet reader.
- We just adopted a "C Data Interface" for the project which will open many new
  opportunities for integrations with third party projects.

## Community Health:

The project and contributor base continues to grow in size and
scope. We now have over 400 unique contributors since the
creation of the project.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Mads Toftum]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Sean Busbey]

## Description:
Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

## Issues:
The project currently has no issues that require board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Avro was founded 2010-04-20 (10 years ago)
There are currently 33 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Nándor Kollár on 2019-08-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Ryan Skraba on 2019-12-12.

## Project Activity:
Apache Avro 1.9.2 was released on 2020-02-12. This release included some new
experimental features that try to improve performance[1].

Work has continued to update both build tools, language versions, third party
dependencies, and ease of integration in preparation for a new major release
currently planned for May 2020, version 1.10.0.

The previously reported need to document and update how the project versions
releases came up for discussion again but no action has been taken yet.

## Numbers
For those who prefer metrics:

Mailing Lists:
 - dev@avro.apache.org had 1034 emails (24% increase)
 - user@avro.apache.org had 91 emails (15% increase)

JIRA:
 - 115 issues opened (42% increase)
 - 76 issues closed (7% increase)

GitHub:
 - 88 PRs open (9% increase)
 - 68 PRs closed (7% decrease)

Code Repository:
 - 122 commits in the past quarter (67% increase)
 - 25 code contributors in the past quarter (39% increase)

## Community Health:
Community health is doing well at drawing in contributions. The PMC still
needs to work to recognize contributors through committership. Current focus
is on working towards releases.

## Membership Data:

Apache Beam was founded 2016-12-20 (3 years ago)
There are currently 70 committers and 21 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:2.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Pablo Estrada on 2019-05-13.
- Alex Van Boxel was added as committer on 2020-02-03
- Chad Dombrova was added as committer on 2020-02-20
- Hannah Jiang was added as committer on 2020-02-03
- Jincheng Sun was added as committer on 2020-02-18

- Katarzyna Kucharczyk was added as committer on 2019-12-19
- Michał Walenia was added as committer on 2020-01-25

## Project Activity:

- Improvements and fixes on several IOs have been done or on the way (updated
  ElasticsearchIO, JmsIO new message types support, …)
- Beam now has an official Beam Improvement Proposal (BIP) process [bip] and a
  first BIP [bip1]. This gives a clear way for people to proposal
  enhancements, followed by an official voting process. We are looking forward
  to evolving the process as we gain experience, in order to be more clear
  about the status of proposals, for the Beam dev community and also broader
  community including users.
- Last report, the community had chosen the firefly as mascot. Now we have
  received some draft artwork from a vendor.
- Lots of activity around Google Summer of Code projects. Beam docker images
  are now transitioned to the apache org (off the apachebeam). [docker]
- A draft communications strategy makes for really interesting reading about
  outreach and awareness. [comms]
- The new twister2 runner is approaching merge. [twister2]
- Website transition to docsy has an update that it is beginning shortly.
   [docsy]
- Starting with Beam 2.21.0 support for Flink 1.7 will be removed. [flink17]
- Starting with Beam 2.21.0 support for Flink 1.10 has been added. [flink110]
- Starting with the approach to the 2.20.0 release, Beam has adopted a
  CHANGES.md file to track and draft release notes. It should also help make
  it easier to have informative board reports.
- We still have not got the isolated Jenkins instance finished, which would
  allow precommits to run on pull requests from untrusted parties.

## Community Health:

Busiest email thread: this thread has been re-used over time for people to
request a committer to trigger testing on the PR

 - dev@beam.apache.org Jenkins jobs not running for my PR 10438(98 emails)

The traffic on builds@ indicates a lot more test failures on master. It does
mean the community needs to communicate and come together around test health.

- builds@beam.apache.org had a 56% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (11442 emails compared to 7317):

Traffic on dev@, issues@, and user@ don't show interesting changes.

JIRA continues to grow faster than it shrinks, in a healthy ratio:

- 514 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-29% decrease)
- 398 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (4% increase)

Could we possibly be catching up on PRs? Let's wait and see. We are down to
118 open at the time of this writing (we were previously on the move from
about 100 open all the time up to 150+ open all the time).

GitHub PR activity:

- 720 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-11% decrease)
- 745 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-6% decrease)

for last month's board meeting as scheduled. There are no issues requiring
board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache BVal was founded 2012-02-14 (8 years ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:7.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Thomas Andraschko on 2019-05-15.
- No new committers. Last addition was Thomas Andraschko on 2019-05-16.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Stamatis Zampetakis]

## Description:
Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Calcite was founded 2015-10-22 (4 years ago) There are currently 46
committers and 22 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Haisheng Yuan on 2019-11-11.
- Feng Zhu was added as committer on 2020-02-29

## Project Activity:
Avatica 1.16.0 was released in the middle of December, including numerous bug
fixes and security improvements while the build system has been migrated from
Maven to gradle.

Calcite 1.22.0 was released at the beginning of March, including more than 250
resolved issues including long-awaited features such as support of SQL hints,
important bug fixes in the core of the query planner, and many changes in
build and test infrastructure. This release was the biggest in the history of
the project and one of the most complicated to pull out due to the big number
of contributions.

Stamatis gave a talk about query planning and Calcite at the university of
Cergy-Pontoise, Paris, France, in March. The audience was not aware of the
existence of the project which shows that we should organize such events more
often, at least in Europe, if we want to expand our community.

Finally, we were informed that the SuperSQL project by Tencent uses Calcite in
order to provide a unified entrance to various data platforms such as RDBMS,
ElasticSearch, Hive, Flink, Spark, Presto, ClickHouse, etc.

## Community Health:

Activity levels on mailing lists (-8%), git (-24%) and JIRA (opened -20%,
closed
-30%) have decreased in the first quarter of 2020. Most of the big changes
 that started during the last quarter of 2019 (and initiated a lot of
 activity) have been finalized and incorporated in the release of Calcite
 1.22.0, making things calmer in the community. The big decrease of closed
 issues in JIRA may be explained by the frequency of releases that have
 slightly dropped. The number of active committers has also decreased the past
 few months, with work and family constraints getting in the middle. To the
 above it is worth adding the period of holidays in December and January that
 in general slows things down.

Following the decreased activity in the lists, git, and JIRA it is normal to
see the activity rates on pull requests drop (-20% opened, -31% closed) more
or less for the same reasons. Although our backlog keeps increasing (~174 open
pull requests), the community is very reactive commenting and reviewing almost
every contribution. On the bright side, we continue to see promising
contributors who are on the right track for committership.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CarbonData Project  [Liang Chen]

## Description:

- The Apache CarbonData is an indexed columnar store solution for fast
  analytics on Big Data platforms (including Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark,
  Apache Flink among others) to help speed up queries an order of magnitude
  faster over petabytes of data, with the aim of using a unified file format
  to satisfy all kinds of data analysis cases.

## Board comment in the last report:
  druggeri: The previous quarter's report indicated that there are
            potential PMC additions in the pipeline. Is anything preventing
            growth there? It's cool to see the Flink integration making it into
            the report!

            Re: Nothing preventing,  just waiting for new PMC candidate end to
            end complete some contributions as per mailing list discussion of
            community. we started VOTE for new candidate after the merit is
            enough.

## Issues:

 - There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Besides integration with Apache spark, now CarbonData can integrate with
   Apache Flink for further extending the ecosystem.
 - In the past 3 months, we are focusing on preparing 2.0 releases, which
   provided many significant features, such as :  Support pre priming cache in
   Index cache server, Carbon Extension for Spark 2.4/3.0 without Carbon
   Session, MV  Time-series support with Rollup support, multiple granularity,
   Supports the spatial index Data-map, Support Secondary Index, Support CDC
   merge functionality, Support Flink streaming write to carbon, Hive leverage
   the index for query performance enhancement, Hive Write support, Support
   for latest stable spark 2.4.5 version, Support prestodb-0.217 and
   prestosql-316, Insert into performance improvement, Optimize Bucket Table,
   pycarbon support for AI cases, Materialized view on all table.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Pepijn Noltes]

## Description:
Dynamic service framework for C and C++

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Celix was founded 2014-07-16 (6 years ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Erjan Altena on 2018-06-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Idzard Hoekstra on 2019-10-01.

## Project Activity:
The last three month the Celix project has seen improvement on:
- Testing, moving from CppUTest to GTest
- PubSub, many improvements for performance, support for interceptors
and bug fixes
- Remote Service, also performance improvements and bug fixes
- Moved most of the CI build environment from travis to GitHub workflows
- Refactoring of the service registry to prevent race conditions

## Community Health:
Commit activity has increased significantly in the last quarter.
This is not only due to commits from the celix committers, but we
are also seeing more small PR created from non celix committers.
It seems that moving the source code management to GitHub really
helped in making donations more easy.
Because of the success of "pull-based development" most of the
discussion have moved to PR conversations.

dev@celix.apache.org had a 551% increase in traffic in the past
quarter (293 emails compared to 45)
132 commits in the past quarter (355% increase)
10 code contributors in the past quarter (42% increase)
35 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (250% increase)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache CXF was founded 2008-04-15 (12 years ago)
There are currently 43 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andy McCright on 2019-02-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexey Markevich on 2017-12-29.

## Project Activity:
The work this quarter was most "patch" related as we concentrated on 
getting bug fixes out to users.   As such, we released:

3.2.13 was released on 2020-03-30.
3.3.6 was released on 2020-03-30.
3.2.12 was released on 2020-01-15.
3.3.5 was released on 2020-01-15.

3.2.12 and 3.3.5 contain fixes for two CVE's:
CVE-2019-17573: Apache CXF Reflected XSS in the services listing page
CVE-2019-12423: Apache CXF OpenId Connect JWK Keys service returns 
   private/secret credentials if configured with a jwk keystore

3.2.13 and 3.3.5 contain a fix for one CVE:
CVE-2020-1954: Apache CXF JMX Integration is vulnerable to a MITM attack 

Mater branch is now targeting 3.4 and does have a few additional
new features.   We have started a migration guide to document the 
changes.   We hope to get 3.4 out this coming period as we work
with Santuario and WebServices to get the releases we need
from them.

## Community Health:
For the most part, the project is making steady, but not stellar, progress.
Many of the protocols and specs that CXF implements are mature specs and don't
really change much (other than the above mentioned package change from
javax->jakarta).   Thus, steady progress and regular releases are a good
thing.   We are responding to bug reports and security issues and getting
patch releases out.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Shawn McKinney]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:

- ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in
  Java, which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides
  LDAP it supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.

- LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
  replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).
  This is a "schema aware” API with some convenient ways to access all types
  of LDAP servers.

- Studio: A complete directory tooling platform intended to be used with any
  LDAP server however it is particularly designed for use with ApacheDS. It is
  an Eclipse RCP application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.

- Fortress: A standards-based authorization platform that provides role-based
  access control, delegated administration and password policy services with
  an LDAP backend.

- Kerby: An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains various tools
  to access and manage kerberos principals and keytabs. It provides a rich,
  intuitive and interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
  facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2) as desired in modern
  environments such as cloud, Hadoop and mobile.

- Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC (Multi Version
  Concurrency Control) support.

- SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Per sub-project:

- ApacheDS: low activity: The project continues to be fairly low activity
  although there’s been an uptick this quarter with a release. The major
  hurdle for this project is utilization of the new backend, mavibot, bringing
  much needed performance improvements and stability to the directory server.

- LDAP API: low activity: Also had a release this quarter.  Downloads over
  maven remain robust, around 1M/month.

- Studio:   low activity: No releases this quarter but still being maintained
  and used.  Also robust download activity.

- Fortress: low activity: This project also had a release recently containing
  enhancements and bug fixes.  The next hurdle for this project is to consume
  the LDAP API 2.x which will bring it in line with current.

- Kerby:    very low activity but also still being maintained with lots of
  downloads per month.

- Mavibot:  no activity

- SCIMple:  low activity:  After several quarters with almost zero activity
  (being called out on previous reports) this project woke up a bit this
   quarter.  Numerous pull requests and coding activities although still not
   much in the way of communication over the mailing list.  We are in contact
   with the project team and will continue to monitor this activity closely.

## Health report:

Another slow quarter for the projects that comprise this TLP.  While this is a
cause for concern, the PMC feels the overall health of the project remains
healthy with a decent core of contributors maintaining, fixing bugs.  Demand
remains for the project's wares, we are continuing to release, albeit at a
lower level than in previous years, as evidenced by overall decreased commits.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 19 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Radovan Semancik on Sat Sep 29 2018

## Committer base changes:

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Druid Project  [Gian Merlino]

## Description

Apache Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database. It is
designed for workflows where low-latency query and ingest are the main
requirements. It implements ingestion, storage, and querying subsystems. Users
interface with Druid through built-in SQL and JSON APIs, as well as
third-party applications.

Druid has an extensive web of connections with other Apache projects: Calcite
for SQL planning, Curator and ZooKeeper for coordination, Kafka and Hadoop as
data sources, Avro, ORC, or Parquet as supported data input formats, and
DataSketches for scalable approximate algorithms. Druid can also be used as a
data source by Superset.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Vishwas Babu A J]

## Description:
Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Fineract was founded 2017-04-18 (~3 years ago) There are currently 36
committers and 18 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No changes

## Project Activity:

The Fineract community maintains two active projects.

Fineract 1.x - Current generation product which is widely used.


Fineract-CN - Next Generation framework which is still under active
development and has not been officially released


- Fineract 1.x

The 1.4 release is still pending as the community is working to find volunteer
release managers and maintainers to help cut the release. The community is
anticipating a number of significant contributions for the 1.5 release so
would like to urgently get the 1.4 release shipped. 

Several intern candidates are being evaluated for projects related to
hardening of the codebase, upgrading of core dependencies. 

PMC members, Awasum Yannick and Michael Vorburger are continuing to do timely
reviews of pull requests being submitted. 


- Fineract-CN

There is growing momentum around Fineract-CN with individuals from several
organizations looking to contribute back features and enhancements for the
deployments and ongoing projects. The current focus and aim of the committers
around Fineract CN is to identify the minimum set of mature and stable
libraries needed to establish a foundational framework, a minimum set of
functionality that can demonstrate an end to end solution on top of the
framework and sufficient DevOps tooling and scripts to more easily deploy the
framework. 

Work is still ongoing to get the public demo server live. GSOC projects
related to live API documentation  as well as additional UIs on top of
Fineract CN are being explored. Work is ongoing to provide an Open Banking API
layer on top of Fineract CN to all third party and trusted first-party apps to
securely connect. 


## Community Health:

Both projects continue to remain healthy with 425 mails sent to our dev
mailing list, which amounts to a minor seasonal (~4%) decrease in traffic
compared to the previous quarter.

Activity rates on Jira also remain stable

- Fineract 1.X
- 50 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (24 in the previous quarter)
- 26 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months (22 in the previous
  quarter)

- Fineract CN
- 29 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (15 in the previous quarter)
- 3 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months (39 in the previous
  quarter)

Community members, Javier Borkenztain and Edward Cable, are working the
ApacheCon committee to plan out a Fineract track for ApacheCon North America.

Fluo added the ability to count running oracles to the Stat command and fixed
a race condition with counting workers and oracles.

Many general Muchos improvements were made including : Systemd support, Map
Reduce Job History support, latest Zookeeper support, multiple standby
namenode support, WIP Logstash support, Azure Log Analytics support, Azure
ephemeral storage support, and Azure terminate and wipe support.

## Community Health:

There was more overall activity this quarter than the last, more commits and
PRs. There were 48 commits from 4 committers and 6 non-committers. Three of
the non-committers were first time contributors.  We are discussing inviting
two contributors to join Fluo.

Fluo has not done a release in a long time and this is not good.  We really
need to do a release and will draft a release plan soon.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for April 2020

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.
This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here:

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/April2020
There are presently 45 podlings incubating. In March, podlings executed 7 
distinct releases. We added one new IPMC member, and there are a couple of 
outstanding requests, no IPMC members retired.

There was one requested IP clearance. There are four new podlings under 
discussion or VOTE; they are AgenisGraph, BlueMarlin, HBlock and Rainbow. 
No projects graduated or retired last month. At least one podling is 
heading towards graduation in the next few months, and ShardingSphere has a 
resolution to graduate. All projected reported this month which is a 
rarity, but one podling Gobblin failed to get sign off from it's mentors
and will be asked to report again next month.

It's nice to see that due to the covid-19 situation world-wide that things
are operating mostly as usual.

Three podlings MXNet, SDAP and Spot still need to sort out their roster and 
private mailing list subscriptions and look lite they need to be reminded 
again to correct this.

One IPMC member removed by the recent board proposal asked to join again 
and was added back to the IPMC roster.

There was a discussion on graduating Apache ShardingSphere to become a Top 
Level Project and the project corrected some minor branding and trademark 
issues.

Regarding ShardingSphere, there was a discussion "Fork me on Github" the
outcome  of which is that wording should not be used, and the link to
GitHub be a no-follow one.

It was discovered that some podling download pages were not following 
policy (in minor ways). Also, there has been a recent change to use 
download.apache.org rather than using apache.org.dist for .sha and .asc 
links. Some podlings have fixed these issues. However, in most cases, 
podlings will fix this when they make a new release.

A number of podlings have also made releases but are missing download pages 
on their web site; this issue is currently unresolved, and the podlings 
need to be contacted.

The (reasonably frequent) topic on distributing binaries came up again, 
once again underlining the need to have a clear policy around this.

## Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and
humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Release initial versions
  2. Add active contributors
  3. Demonstrate good governance through voting on process improvements.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Not at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have had increased mentor activity and increased participation on our
  weekly calls which have both helped improve our momentum.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We walked through the process of cutting a release (0.1.0) and putting 
  that
  release up for a vote. The first vote attempt failed due to a process 
  mistake we
  sent it to `general@` before we passed it to `dev@`. We then attempted a 
  second
  vote which passed at the project level, but failed when sent to the 
  Incubator list. 
  However, we received valuable feedback from Justin Mclean which we are now
  acting upon. We plan to attempt another release and vote early this month.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  made a lot of optimization and improvement , showing the diversity of the
  community ). we also elected first non-initial PPMC member @lilien1010. 
  - We strengthen interaction/cooperation with other Apache project. E.g. 
  Apache skywalking. we also elected @Sheng Wu ( from the PMC of Apache 
  skywalking ) as a member of our PPMC. then he can help us a lot on 
  community building.
  - the official docker image library migrated to Apache.

  1. Community growth (committers and users)
  2. One or more Apache Releases as an Incubator project

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  PPMC need to consider exit approaches (retiring or graduate as Hive 
  subproject).

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  - No enough progress since the last report due to changes in PPMC member 
  job roles.
  - Makoto is not active since he is taking paternity leave.
  - Github watchers/stars are gradually increasing: 252 stars as of April 1 
  (was 243 on Dec 2)

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The development [has been calmed down) since the last Apache 
  release on Dec 2019.

  Created 5 minor tickets and resolved 3 issues.

  Need to set some major target with new major features to activate the 
  development. 
  Also, we need to discuss about exit strategy of the project with PPMCs.

## NuttX

NuttX is a mature, real-time embedded operating system (RTOS).

NuttX has been incubating since 2019-12-09.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Clear any potential infringing use of the NuttX trademark
  2. Determine the form and location of NuttX releases
  3. Make the first release under Apache

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  * We have extended invitations to two new committers.  
  * One of the new invited committers, Yamamoto Takashi, has accepted,  
    filed an ICLA with the ASF, and has been added to the roster  
    successfully.  
  * The other new invited committer has accepted but is still  
    currently undergoing the ICLA and account creation process.  
  * We continue to see new contributors to the project through GitHub.  
  * Most communications have moved from old venues to  
    dev@nuttx.apache.org. Currently this list is the primary home of  
    all development discussions and users questions. Some users  
    continue to post questions to the old Google Group but we let them  
    know about the move, so as to consolidate the project in one  
    place.  
  * GitHub's PRs and Issues also have their own discussions.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Regarding making our first release as Apache NuttX (Incubating),  
    the community has agreed on a branch date (April 6th) and a  
    tentative release date of end of April. Furthermore, we have  
    agreed to reinstate the bimonthly releases that NuttX was making  
    prior to becoming a Podling, subsequent to this first release.  
  * One of our PPMC members, Brennan Ashton, has volunteered to be  
    Release Manager (RM) for this first release, provided that we make  
    progress on licensing. To that end, several community members have  
    invested considerable time with Fossology to qualify license  
    headers of various files. As we have nearly 90,000 files in our  
    repository, we expect this work to continue for quite some time,  
    but the goal is to make additional progress at each release.  
  * The nightly build is up and running: https://s.apache.org/wnv2u    
    Our Continuous Integration (CI) system continues to receive  
    various tweaks and fixes. Currently, our automated nightly tests  
    are showing various failures but this is gradually improving.  
  * The community continues to collaborate on various technical  
    improvements, bug fixes, and new architectures. Contributions are  
    flowing regularly as Pull Requests (PRs) in GitHub and as patches  
    emailed to the dev list.

     simply need communication and engagement to become involved.

## Teaclave

Teaclave is a universal secure computing platform.

Teaclave has been incubating since 2019-08-20.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Improving project structure and documentation
  2. Grow the community (committers, contributors, users)
  3. Publish Apache release

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Since last report, one external contributor has became our regular
    contributor.
  - Compared to the last report, we have seen more pull request from 
    external contributors.
  - We received emails from some companies which are interested in the
    project and willing to make some contributions for the secure computing
    community.
  - Since we are mainly working on GitHub, with the help of the INFRA team,
    we can sync the notifications of GitHub with our mailing list.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Since last report, the whole project has been refactored to be more
    functional, as well as readable and approachable for new contributors.
  - We have rewrote the framework for implementing enclave services. Also, 
    we have redesigned current services into seven core services
    including access control, authentication, execution, frontend, 
management,
    scheduler, and storage service. Communication protocols between services
    are defined in protobuf.
  - RPC between services has been redesigned to supported TLS-based 
    attestation.
  - We have added DCAP attestation algorithm in the platform so that people 
    can deploy the system in environments without Intel's attestation service.
  - Communication between app and enclave has been also redesigned
    with better APIs.
  - All updates is currently in the `develop` branch. We plan to merge
    into `master` when main refactoring is done.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache James Project  [Benoit Tellier]

## Description:

The Apache James Project delivers a rich set of open source modules and
libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which build into an
advanced enterprise mail server.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:

Apache James was founded 2003-01-22 (17 years ago)
There are currently 38 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.

This include working on improving performance and allowing corrective 
tasks for the projections we are relying on.

An effort started to update the JMAP specification to the latest RFC. This
effort will likely span several quaters.

A vote had been started for Apache James release 3.5.0.

## Community Health:

We are happy to observe an increase of activity of our user base:
 - server-user@james.apache.org had a 2% increase in traffic in
the past quarter (86 emails compared to 84)

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud-agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

jclouds continues to squash bugs but little feature work. There are sporadic
issues being reported and fixed, but activity overall is low.

The project remains stable, but there are no plans or requirements to
modernize it and upgrade it to newer Java versions.

== Community ==

There have been small contributions from the community and bugfix reports as
in previous quarters.

As said in previous reports, most of the PMC and committers are now "pure"
volunteers (with $dayjob no longer related to jclouds). There is also a lack
of traction, requests, and general interest from the community itself. This
could be an issue but it simply shows that the project is no longer that
relevant in the space and that the primitives it provides are an "already
fixed problem".

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Be able to keep fixing important issues, and help anyone interested in
contributing to the project be successful at it.

== Releases ==

The last major jclouds release, 2.2.0, took place on 2019-10-21.
The last bugfix release, 2.1.3, took place on 2019-10-21.

This quarter has been busier than last on github, JIRA and mailing lists. JIRA
reports are coming in faster than being addressed but this happens. Some are
showing deep understanding of the codebase.

The project has been receiving more PRs, with an increased in the number of
contributors.

With the help of Roy Lenferink, the production of the Apache Jena website has
moved from using svn and Apache's custom CMS to being stored in git and using
Hugo.

A big clear-out of log4j1 use finally completed.

## Community Health:

Generally more active this quarter though last quarter include Xmas and New
Year.

Splitting out github PR emails to a separate list helped dev@ but that was
still busier than last quarter.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez]

## Description:
The mission of JSPWiki is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Leading open source WikiWiki engine, feature-rich and built around standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache JSPWiki was founded 2013-07-17 (7 years ago)
There are currently 16 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Dave Koelmeyer on 2016-04-06.
- No new committers. Last addition was Dave Koelmeyer on 2016-04-06.

## Project Activity:
This quarter's project activity has revolved mostly around the following items
* The refactor of WikiEngine, one of the core classes of JSPWiki (JSPWIKI-120)
* The development of a public API for JSPWiki's custom extensions
  (JSPWIKI-303)
* Other bugfixes and improvements

Because of two first, we missed our release train stop this quarter, as in 
the moment of releasing the master branch, it wasn't backwards compatible with
current 3rd party extensions. We should be able to release next quarter,
though.

The development of the public API also allowed us to add the possibility of
including custom managers on the Wiki Engine (JSPWIKI-806) and the ability of
swapping core JSPWiki classes (WikiContext, WikiEngine, WikiPage, etc.) with
custom ones through an SPI, bringing up JSPWiki pluggability another step up.

## Community Health:
There is enough oversight, with questions getting answered on MLs. The public
API sparkled a conversation on how / when to break backwards compatibility,
which ended up on specifying /clarifying our versioning proposal [#1].

We received one security report this quarter, but ended up rejecting it.

One pull request merged into master, with 3 people committing into master.

In order to foster / attract contributors, we also had an overhaul of
documentation related to different ways of extending / customizing JSPWiki:
- How to write plugins [#2]
- How to write filters [#3]
- How to write page providers [#4]
- Starting point for developing custom extensions [#5]
- JSPWiki's public API [#6]
- Adding / improving translations [#7], [#8]

## Community Health:
January 15th a lot of public artifact repositories including (Maven) Central
dropped http support and can only be accessed via https. We've had close to
no issues, we discovered that a couple of unittests were actually more like
integration tests and were connecting to Central via http. These were all 
easy to fix.
Also close to no issues from the Java community .

Java 14 has been released, so we've updated JDK versions to test with.
In general this means minimum (Java 7), LTS (Java 8 + 11), latest (Java 14) and 
early access (Java 15-ea). During the switch some usual suspects caused failing 
builds, but these have all been fixed.

Some major changes that are planned for Maven 3.7.0 are close to completion.
There has been a video conference to explain these changes. Robert will make 
separate videos about these features. Most of the people that build up Maven
have left the team or are inactive, so it hard to share knowlegde about 
improvements in the base of Maven.

Reproducible builds have our attention. One of our goals is to have all builds 
reproducible within a couple of months, so with every new release should be 
delivered as a reproducible build.
As of now 97% of our 87 sub projects have reproducible builds (on Git HEAD), 
then every future release of a Maven sub project should be reproducible
- reproducible builds improvement start to be integrated in other projects 
targetting the JVM and publishing on Central Repository [2], some are Apache 
projects, some are outside ASF.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    During this unprecedented crisis, I think pretty much everything is 
    largelyslowed down.In this period of reporting, 2 of tickets has been 
    created and 0 resolved, basically, we are considering to upgrade our 
    project to work with JDK 13 and improve the CI process.

Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - no new PMC member added since Jun. 2018.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 13 committers.
 - No new committer added since Jun. 2018.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
The mission of NiFi is the creation and maintenance of software related to
providing an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
distribute data.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
Java and C++ implementations.

Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
MiNiFi.

Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
NiFi classloader isolation model.

Apache NiFi Flow Design System is a theme-able set of high quality UI
components and utilities for use across the various Apache NiFi web
applications in order to provide a more consistent user experience.
## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache NiFi was founded 2015-07-14 (4 years ago)
There are currently 47 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Peter Wicks on 2019-05-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Peter Turcsanyi on 2019-10-25.

We have strong committer and PMC pipeline to consider so we expect to see
activity here pending discussions by the PMC.

## Project Activity:
Apache NiFi Registry 0.6.0 is currently under Release Candidate vote. It is
mostly stability and security related changes.

Apache NiFi 1.11.0 through 1.11.4 have all been released in January, 
February, and March respectively.  The 1.11 release line brought in some 
awesome features like better integration with Azure, all NiFi repositories
can now be encrypted at an application level, class loader isolation now
works across nars with native libraries, and more.  We've also addressed 
a massive number of bugs, improvements, and security related fixes.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi CPP 0.7.0 was released in January with 145 issues addressed.
It includes a number of new features like SFTP support, running as a windows 
service, tail support for globs/wildcards, windows event log consumption, and
a long list of stability improvements.
## Community Health:
In our previous reporting period we noted a decline of roughly 15% mailing
list activity in dev and users and attributed that to the time of year and the
rise of engagements in slack.  Slack engagement continues to rise but this
period we see an increase of 58% on our dev list and 16% on users and also a
large increase in issues activity of 61%.  The community is very busy
including more than a 100% increase in commits and 17% increase in the number
of contributors of committed code in the quarter.  Anecdotally a significant
increase in new user activity is observed as well.  Many mailing list
questions are starting from very limited knowledge and folks are looking for a
lot of assistance with patterns and getting started in terms of pure usage.

We see also constant activity for Apache NiFi on Twitter, Stackoverflow,
Youtube, etc. These are for tutorials, example use cases, job/ads, questions
and answer created by people active in the community and not.

For the past few quarters we've reported 394, 523, 707, and now 895 persistent
users in our slack channels. While it appeared this might harm or reduce
mailing list activity that doesn't seem to be the case.  We've just opened up
more ways for folks to collaborate in the community.  The slack channels are
extremely busy and the depth of questions range from very superficial
questions easily answered to deeper and more complex situations that lead to
JIRAs and mailing list discussions.  Mostly though it just appears to be a
communication mode some users and developers like far more than the lists.

Our community activity level has certainly increased while at the same time we
have not increased committer or PMC ranks.  This is really a reflection of the
fact that the PMC has been very focused on knocking out releases and engaging
on the various mailing list and slack channels.  We need to remind ourselves
to groom and manage the committer/PMC pipeline and there are least a couple
candidates well positioned for committer and/or PMC status based on past
discussions. Overall the state of the community appears very strong.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Carl B. Marcum]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## SUMMARY

Latest Release was in September 2019. The community activity in general is on
a low level. A major obstacle is the complex code and build system. Therefore
it is not easy for new people to gain a foothold into the code when the first
build is hard to be done. There is recent activity on the mailing list to
update the building guides to make it easier to get builds working.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

No issues

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines:

1) 4.2.0 is the next minor release, planned to be released into a beta phase.
We have missed our goal on going into the beta in 2019. We managed only to
solve the biggest blockers. Currently a new dev test version is discussed to
be rolled to be more widely tested. An alpha and/or beta release is planned
for the next quarter.

For that release we improved the translation process. We are now able to sync
our translation server Pootle with the code. Together with ASF Infra we were
able to set up a new (updated) translate VM.

At this time we support 64 languages in Pootle. We plan to add some new
languages to the 4.2.0 release.

2) We are currently in discussion about a 4.1.8 release. The motivation in
still maintaining the 4.1.x release line is not very high, especially due to
the the 4.1.x codebase being  based around much older OS versions. Therefore
we will shut it down as soon as we have a stable release of 4.2.x. There is no
release date defined although we hope to have at least a beta in the coming
quarter once we resolve some blockers.

## LATEST RELEASE HISTORY

2019-09-21 4.1.7 2018-11-18 4.1.6 2017-12-30 4.1.5

## COMMITTER & PMC DATA

  remains in the PMC and as Release Manager.
- Carl Marcum was nominated and appointed, via resolution at 2020-03-18 board
  meeting.

## COMMUNITY HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT

Community overall health is stable. Our user level support and translation
teams are well working. Documentation team is virtually non existent. We have
issues to bring volunteers on board for development.

Certainly, more people would be helpful and we continue to try to grow the
developer and especially the builder communities. We do have the process and
the people in place to enable us to continue development and, more
importantly, perform releases in a reasonable time-frame. We also struggle
somewhat with our commitment to continue to support, and being a viable
platform, for users who are "stuck" on older machines and OSs, since this
makes development and community builds more difficult. However, it also
appears obvious that that community is being neglected by other FOSS office
platforms, who tend to focus on providing releases for newer platforms.

Community metrics:

- dev@openoffice.apache.org had a 12% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (482 emails compared to 542)

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We have initiated the migration from the old Apache CMS to Pelican CMS. We
face the issue that we have 9 GB of content to move. A plan has been made.

Our build bots are now functional again. Work still needs to be done on
improving upload speed (Linux bots) and the RAT builds.

Apache OpenOffice uses Google Analytics. We are aware this is controversial
topic within the ASF. Current setup is to collect as few data as possible. We
do not use Google Analytics for advertisement. Disclaimers are placed.

The data might be used in optimizing the web content. For example within the
migration of our web content.

## MARKETING

We are  still in the process of printing new flyers. The Flyers need to be
updated again.

### FOSDEM (Brussels, Belgium) [1]

We were co-organizing the Open Document Editors devroom, that brings together
Apache OpenOffice and other similar projects. OpenOffice PMC members gave two
talks. Additionally some PMC members were present at the ASF booth on Sunday
for several hours to represent the project and the Foundation.

The PMC has, using targeted funds, purchased a replacement computer system and
monitor for usage at various conferences and events in which OpenOffice
presents and/or has a table. Unfortunately, due to Corona Virus, the following
events have been canceled [2] or postponed [3].

### Facebook

We have now one Volunteer for Facebook. The Page subscription dropped in the
last Month, but with 74 people currently subscribed to the page it is not a
significant attribute. The People post a lot of Support Question to the page,
which can be mostly answered. The Answers are Difficult to create if the query
can only be understood by translators. Due the support Question the reach of
Apache OpenOffice rises and we receive more Likes. No Money was spend or is
plant to spend on advertisement. Next development step here would be to start
to write small articles that teach the are a outside resource to the outside.
Maybe this articles will be also be published to other channels.

### Twitter

Currently unmaintained. There is no volunteer.

## DEVELOPMENT

### Apple Code Signing

We have done one signed test build. However we need to do another one, since
Apple has changed the standards. This is an open topic. Signing is done
manual.

### Windows Code Signing

We can successfully create Windows installer with digital signature. There is
some discussion to switch from the exe Installer to a clean msi Installer. But
there are technical hurdles to be solved. Windows code signing is currently a
manual process.

### Unmaintained Python 2 code

Python 2 is unmaintained. We have in the development tree the external python3
support. Internal python 3 support is difficult. We are checking alternatives.
Planned for the next major release.

### New ODF Version

Our Main Format, the OpenDocument Format has received a new Standard update.
We plan to support this format.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specifications which are defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0), JSR-346
 (CDI-1.1 and CDI-1.2 MR) and JSR-365 (CDI-2.0).

 The OWB community also maintains  a small server as
 Apache Meecrowave subproject. Meecrowave bundles latest releases of
 the ASF projects Tocmat9 + OpenWebBeans + CXF + Johnzon + log4j2.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 Activity was ok-ish. We did a few performance optimisations and
 shipped new releases. We should ship a new Meecrowave version though.

## Health report:
 The project is still reasonably active and we also will wee some fresh
 demand once (if) JakartaEE picks up speed.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 13 PMC members, 20 committers
 - Last PMC addition was Reinhard Sandtner on 2017-10-09.
 - Last committer addition was John D. Ament on 2017-10-09.

It has been a relatively quiet quarter and the queue of waiting PR's
has built up. We need to spend more time working through the queue
and create some new committers to help.

- dev@orc.apache.org had a 22% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (56 emails compared to 71)

with the ORC code available, it will encourage additional contribution
from LinkedIn.

related to HTTP and associated protocols.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Serf was founded 2015-08-18 (5 years ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.

- No new committers. Last addition was Evgeny Kotkov on 2017-04-13.

## Project Activity:
There was recent discussion on-list about an upstream change in OpenSSL
that broke one of the regression tests in the 1.3.x series.  This caused
the Debian sid builder to flag an error.  A patch was prepared for Serf,
but OpenSSL reverted the change in a subsequent OpenSSL release.  Therefore,
there are no current plans to cut a new 1.3.x release to address the issue.

(The uptake of the broken OpenSSL release is expected to be minimal as
the 1.1.1e release was only out for 14 days followed by the 1.1.1f release
which contained the revert of the behavior which broke the Debian builder.)

Work continues on preparing a 1.4.0 release with no firm ETA at this time.

## Community Health:
The Serf PMC recommends Justin Erenkrantz as Chair.  The PMC would like
to thank Branko for his service as chair.

Dynamic websites using TCL. Apache Tcl is home to the Tcl-Apache integration
efforts. The purpose of our project is to combine the power of the Apache
web server with the capabilities of the mature, robust and flexible Tcl
scripting language. Currently only the Apache Rivet project is actively
maintained.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tcl was founded 2000-07-24 (20 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Brice Hamon De Crevecoer on 2014-11-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Brice B. Hamon on 2014-11-25.

## Project Activity:
In addition to the changes brought by the Tcl 8.7 release, a new branch has
been created, attributing changes needed for Tcl 9.0. Code in this branch
builds correctly with Tcl9.0a1 and it is able to run a basic rivet script,
although several problems remain (like reading some of the typical
management/introspection variables such as tcl_patchlevel tcl_platform or
auto_path). Currently, it remains unusable at the moment for any serious
programming.

## Community Health:
curcuru: Great roll call; in the future, include the results in your report
(i.e. how many people replied they were still active in the project - in this
 case, plenty!)

In the roll call the following PMC members replied: Georgios Petasis, Massimo
Manghi, Brice Hamon, Harald Oehlmann, Damon Courtney and Ronnie Brunner. David
Welton has not participated.

rb: We remain concerned that it's been more than 5 years since you've added
any new committers or PMC members. I know that TcL has long been a
slow-and-steady project, but are there any contributors who might be
considered for committer?

Right now, no, we don't have any candidates as possible new committers. We are
going to discuss this issue, and report on the next period's report.

Attachment BX: Report from the Apache Tez Project  [Jonathan Turner Eagles]

## Description:
Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be 
used to process arbitrarily complex DAGs of data-processing tasks and also a 
re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.

## Issues:
Work from home has limited our productivity as a community over the last
month, but has picked up again the last couple of weeks. 0.9.3 release delayed
due to this. Some assistance for github based PRs may be needed. Yetus
supports this, but there are some gaps in setup knowledge in the community.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tez was founded 2014-07-15 (6 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 35 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Kuhu Shukla on 2018-03-25.
- László Bodor was added as committer on 2020-01-22

## Project Activity:
Continued activity from newest committer László Bodor who has been a very
active member. More compatibility with Hadoop 3.x improvements added.
Downstream project interest from hive LLAP project has picked up recently with
performance related fixes.

0.9.2 was released on 2019-03-29.

## Community Health:
Good discussions on fixes and improvements. Some community user related help
request and bugs. While activity has been down the last month. Overall, there
has been increasing traffic on JIRA and mailing lists.

- No new committers. Last addition was Tilman Hausherr on 2019-10-03.

## Project Activity:
1.24 was released on 2020-03-17. We adding a fuzzing module to identify denial
of service (DoS) vulnerabilities, and we're currently preparing a 1.24.1 release
that fixes several DoS vulnerabilities, primarily in our dependencies. We've
had mixed success in getting some of our (ASF-licensed but non-ASF) dependencies
to fix their code in a timely manner, and we've had to fork some dependencies
and release them separately.  We continue to work with with these projects to
improve security.

## Community Health:
We've seen decreases in email and issue traffic in the past quarter, 
but nothing alarming.

Attachment CA: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop released versions 3.3.10 and 3.4.5. Both were releases containing
important bug fixes and minor improvements. Within a week of those releases
being available, we received a report of a bug on our user mailing list[1]
in 3.4.5. We deemed the bug especially bad that an immediate patch release
was required and quickly turned around 3.4.6. The bug did not affect 3.3.10.

We've not had to release this sort of "hotfix" since 2011 which goes back to
a time prior to TinkerPop being an Apache project (2015) and covers over
forty releases here at a Apache plus many more prior to that. We attribute
this long run to of good releases to both our code review process and to our
test suites and procedures.

Our code review process not only gets additional contributors to provide
their feedback for a particular change, but also allows for a "pause" of up
to seven days before merging to a release branch. This pause often gives the
original contributor time to think through their body of work further and
can lead to additional testing, documentation or other quality enhancements.
The process is generally designed to slow major changes from reaching
release branches, while also leaving flexibility for smaller, lesser risk
modifications to move through that process more quickly.

As for our test suites and procedures, like most projects we have unit and
integration tests, however we also have the added complexity of testing
across five different programming languages with Java, Groovy, C#, Python,
and Javascript. Through various methods we've managed to unify tests of all
of these programming language environments under Maven, so that there is a
single way to execute all tests every time we build. In this way, for
example, we can immediately tell if a change to Java components have somehow
affected the viability of Python components without having to run some
separate test suite in a Python environment. When this approach is combined
with our extensive test infrastructure consisting of over 30,000 unit and
integration tests, we find ourselves having a reasonably high degree of
confidence that a particular change does not introduce regressions.

Of course, as the case of the failed 3.4.5 release demonstrates, no review
process, high test count or testing procedure will be perfect. Here we can
attribute the failed release to an assumption that an obvious feature was
being tested in all reasonably possible ways, but when underlying behavior
for an indirectly related capability shifted for 3.4.5 we failed to realize
the subtle side-effect that increased the testing dimensions. This particular
case shows that there are still obscure gaps in our test suite, but we’ve
addressed this gap and hope for another nine years without requirement of a
similar hotfix.

Aside from the excitement of the hotfix release, there are other points
worth noting. During this reporting period, the community added a Slack
channel to help enable a bit more real-time chatter about graphs, Gremlin
and TinkerPop.

We saw the growth of the wider TinkerPop ecosystem with the following
release announcements:

* jupyter-gremlin-kernel[2] - a Jupyter kernel for Gremlin
* gremlify[3] - a Gremlin workspace for queries and visualization
* gremlint[4] - a Gremlin code formatter
* Gremlin++[5] - a C++ interpreter for the Gremlin language
* BitGraph[6] - a C++ Backend for the Gremlin with GPU Acceleration

All of these are interesting new additions to the ecosystem. The Jupyter
integration is especially useful in that it puts Gremlin into the hands of
Jupyter users, which is a fairly popular ecosystem in and of itself. We
also like the addition of gremlify which will hopefully make learning about
Gremlin easier for folks who want to try it out without having to download
anything to their local system. The gremlint project is an incredibly useful
tool for cleaning and formatting Gremlin. We would hope that in the future
that it might have some more official standing within our Apache project.
Finally, Gremlin++ and the related BitGraph represent the first open source
implementation of Gremlin Virtual Machine outside of our project. While this
project is still under development, it represents an important part of
TinkerPop's vision where graph queries written in Gremlin in any programming
language can then be ubiquitously executed in any graph database/processor
developed in any programming language.

There are typically a number of talks and papers about TinkerPop, Gremlin
and related projects that occur during a reporting period, but it seemed
that there were less that came to light than usual. Perhaps some of this was
due to COVID-19 which cancelled a number of meetings and events. One such
case we are aware of was the cancellation of the DC Apache Roadshow where
our PMC Chair, Stephen Mallette, was scheduled to talk about Gremlin.

Committer, Josh Shinavier, did however speak at Global Graph Summit to give
his "TinkerPop 2020" presentation[7] and while we normally only list the
works of committer and PMC members for purpose of this report, we feel that
the paper of the aforementioned Gremlin++ and BitGraph distinguished itself
to be worthy of report. This paper was titled "Gremlin++ & BitGraph:
Implementing The Gremlin Traversal Language and a GPU-Accelerated Graph
Computing Framework"[8] and was authored by Alexander Barghi.

As an additional note along these lines, the paper mentioned in our last
report "Let’s build Bridges, not Walls – SPARQL Querying of TinkerPop Graph
Databases with sparql-gremlin"[9], primarily authored by committer, Harsh
Thakkar, received the Best Paper Award at ICSC 2020 the 14th IEEE
International Conference.

There are currently 61 committers and 51 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:7.

Community changes, past quarter:
- David Calavera was added to the PMC on 2020-01-13
- Valentin Gutierrez was added as committer on 2020-03-23

## Project Activity:
We are working on our ATS 9.0.0 release, which the release has been pushed to
Q3 of 2020.  Verizon Media has deployed a prereleases version of ATS 9.0.0 in
one colo. We are also continuing to support making bug fixes and updates to
the 8.0.x and 7.1.x release branches.

We made two security releases 8.0.6 and 7.1.9, which closed out 3 CVEs
regarding various smuggle attacks.

## Community Health:
We has an ATS Spring Summit planned for June in London, England.  However, do
to the coronavirus we canceled the summit and will have a 2 day remote summit.
We also are planning on a Hackathon in late April of May for the ATS 9.0.0
release.

Activity on dev and users mailing lists has increased significatly, by 76% and
97% respectively.  I believe this is do to winter vacations in the preceding
quarter.

Attachment CC: Report from the Apache Twill Project  [Terence Yim]

## Description:
The mission of Twill is the creation and maintenance of software related to Use 
Apache Hadoop YARN's distributed capabilities with a programming model that is 
similar to running threads

## Issues:
The board reached out with a question about the community activity of the
project and exploring the possibility of becoming an attic project. Some of
the existing PMCs responded and all of them are not able to contribute any
more. We need guidance from the board on how to proceed forward.

## Membership Data:
Apache Twill was founded 2016-06-14 (4 years ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 6 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andreas Neumann on 2016-06-14.
- No new committers. Last addition was Yuliya Feldman on 2018-03-06.

## Project Activity:
- Version 0.14.0 was released on 2020-01-29
- We are still exploring on expanding beyond Hadoop YARN, by adding the
  support for Kubernetes

## Community Health:
- There were increase of activities in JIRA, mailing list, and GitHub in
  January 2020. Most of them are due to bug fixes and improvements made for
  the new 0.14.0 release.

Attachment CD: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Web Services was founded 2003-01-22 (17 years ago)
There are currently 224 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2016-05-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2014-09-14.

## Project Activity:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required. However, user
questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed, and there are at
least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project can continue to
produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer
considered state of the art, we don't expect a major uptick in new development
efforts, new committers, etc...

The only development efforts this quarter were on WSS4J.  We fixed a few
issues that were reported by users and did a 2.2.5 release.  On master 
(targeting 2.3), work is underway to support JDK14 as well as some 
changes that will be needed to use an upcoming release of Santuario.

The only release done recently was an WSS4J 2.2.5 patch release to fix a
few minor issues.

Past Releases:
WSS4J-2.2.5: 2020-03.
XmlSchema-2.2.5: 2020-01.
Neethi-3.1.1: 2018-01
Axiom-1.2.21: 2018-11
Woden-1.0M10: 2015-09

## Community Health:
As mentioned, SOAP/WebServices is not considered state-of-the-art anymore and
we are getting very little contribution from anyone other than the 2 or 3
regulars" that are driving features and changes needed for CXF (which is
being driven by their employers).   Thus, we are not seeing any possibilities
for future new committers or PMC members.  However, there are plenty of
people around that can do releases and answer questions and respond to
security issues.  It's a mature project.
