 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Jim]

       Not a lot to report. I've been watching the results of the disbanding
       of the PRC (and the subsequent creation of the separate offices) and
       have been pleased with the progress so far. I am concerned about
       the impacts of the sponsorship transition, but that is just the
       paranoid in me coming out.

       We are due for our "special" ASF members meeting, and have pinged the
       membership regarding the feasibility of it being held in mid/late
       January of 2010.
       
       board@ and members@ have been relatively quiet.

       At the start of the year, I'd like restart discussion regarding an
       EA, a formal audit of our books and a review of our current budgeting
       projections.

    B. President [Justin]

       This month has been relatively quiet for everyone else as most
       people were either recovering from ApacheCon US or settling into
       their new officer roles as Infra and the PRC breakup has created
       a lot of turnover.  

       While most was quiet in the US and Europe, Greg and I recently
       returned from Apache Asia Roadshow 2009 in Beijing and Colombo.
       It was fantastic and we got to meet a number of developers and
       spread the Apache love.  We had about 40 attendees in Beijing and
       over 250 people in Colombo attended our free events.  (Per Great
       Circle Mapper, I flew just under 20,000 miles and Greg flew over
       23,000 miles!  I was very happy to get home.)  Some pictures I
       took on our trip are at:

        http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=42901&id=1069138396&l=ab65d85d55

       These events would not have happened without the terrific local
       support we received.  In Beijing, kudos to Xiao-Feng, Peter, Robert
       and to Intel for providing us with the space.  For Colombo, many
       thanks to so many folks including Chamindra, Kanchana, Karthiga,
       Sagara, Sanjiva, and Suchetha with help from the Lanka Software
       Foundation, Virtusa, and WSO2.  I look forward to trying to
       support more events in Asia in 2010!

       My recent keynote given at SAP in November is now online:

         http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/17151

       I have accepted invitations to speak about the ASF at Jasig Spring
       2010 (San Diego) and OSBC 2010 (San Francisco).  I've submitted
       an Apache talk at SCALE 8x (Los Angeles).  I am hopeful that all of
       these talks will further encourage participation in our existing
       projects or perhaps bring new projects to Apache!

       Organizationally, as the page turns to January soon, I will ask
       all of our committees to start considering their budget proposals
       for FY2010-2011 with submissions due in March.  (Our fiscal year
       begins May 1.)

       Justin requests a Y2D expenditures vs budget. Geir says it
       shouldn't be that hard, other than potential categorization

       Aaron needs to update quickbooks, Jim and Geir will get with
       Aaron offline.
       
       Gavin: Stone Circle still hasn't billed us for the last 3
       ApacheCons? Geir has the checks. Everything is balanced
       against WellsFargo, and Geir doesn't think that anything is
       mis-categorized. Geir and Gavin will resolve offline.


    D. Secretary [Sam]

       Minutes drafted, minutes posted.  Craig is shouldering most of the
       burden of keeping up with the various documents that are coming in, with
       occasional documents filed by me (including the ones that come in via
       the postal system).  Sebb continues to audit.

       As a result of some discussion regarding names containing non-ASCII
       characters, Jim's committers.html page has been converted to utf-8
       (Thanks, Jim!).  Due to differences in how Macs and other operating
       systems handle Unicode characters in file names (svn bug 2464), we are
       restricting file names to ASCII characters at this time.

       See Attachment N

       Board would like to avoid umbrella projects, and Lucene (and
       Hadoop) both appear to be heading down this path. Doug's
       concern is that some of the subprojects may have enough
       (quantity) committers, but may not have enough diversity
       (e.g., all of the committers may be from one company).
       Encouraging either common committers across subprojects or for
       subprojects be spun out would bring issues to the forefront.
       Doug suggests that people with concerns be brought to the PMC.
       
       Jim notes that Lucene is aware of the issue, and encourages
       them to split out subprojects. Meanwhile, the board will
       monitor. Greg will like a special report on the one question:
       what that status of each subprojects with respect to diversity
       and splitting out as a TLP?  Greg to pursue.

       open-source software related to the creation and maintenance of a
       platform for building rich Internet applications in Java, 
       for distribution at no charge to the public.

       Roy (and others) are concerned about the confusion that will
       be created by using a name that others use (e.g., Microsoft
       Pivot will quickly dominate search results), and suggests that
       the project considers changing their name. Given that Pivot
       has been applied for as an MS Trademark (USPTO serial number
       77859890), ASF Legal and Microsoft should be consulted.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Appropriate use of theapacheway.com

    Shane acquired the domain a year and a half ago, and started using
    it 2 months ago. Shane doesn't see this as an issue, but others have
    raised it as such.
    
    Roy: as long as you are using it for Apache stuff, there is no
    conflict at all, furthermore as an officer of the ASF you are
    authorized to publish official positions as you see fit.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

Quiet period again - don't expect much to change until the ORCL/JAVA
merger completes.  Recent news reports contend that the EU 
regulators are "softening" their stance.  I have no idea what this 
really means.

Had the monthly JCP EC conference call.  Nothing of interest to
report.  Will attend the F2F next month in CA.

The ASF voted against a suite of JSRs related to Java EE 6, including
the Java EE 6 JSR as they are led by Sun, in accordance with the 
ASFs policy that EC members that don't comply with the spirit 
and letter of the JSPA should not lead JSRs.  There were two 
press followups, one that was answered in writing with CC to PR, 
and the second a 2 second phone call in which I confirmed the reason.

Other than the usual flow of requests for TCKs and updates, there's
nothing else to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Issues for board attention
==========================
See agenda item 8A. 

Notices to the board
====================
I've formed an Officer's committee to assist in Brand Management, comprised
of Upayavira, Jukka Zitting, Craig L Russell, Grant Ingersoll, Noirin 
Shirley, Jim Jagielski, Lawrence Rosen and Doug Cutting.

Operations And Community
========================
Created trademarks@ as our operational mailing list for managing 
trademarks; this is privately archived, member subscribeable, and used 
to discuss policy and to answer external requests about marks; there 
are currently 21 members subscribed.  We're in the process of moving 
trademark-related discussions to this list instead of prc@.

We plan to use site-dev@ for issues relating to "look and feel" branding, 
in conjunction with VP, Marketing and Publicity.

Discussed a proposal for new Powered By logo guidelines, and hope that 
more projects will adopt official Powered By logos.

Larry drafted a nice "here's a reminder of our policies" default email for 
use as a base to answer trademark use requests, which was used for 
the TomcatExpert request below.

Bertrand wrote a Foundation blog entry educating the public that the ASF 
only publishes official information on the apache.org or apachecon.com 
domains, and that web content on any other domain is not from the ASF 
itself.  This is to address the issue of both potential fundraising 
websites and other community support websites that are run by others. 

External Requests
=================
Answered various non-infringing related questions.

SpringSource notified us of their plan to launch tomcatexpert.com, a 
community support and information site for Apache Tomcat.  After reviewing 
the site and asking for some specific changes, sent SpringSource our
default email, with a reminder to respect our marks.

IBM asked if they could use a modified but obviously Apache Hadoop elephant 
logo in a IBM logo of theirs for an unspecified project.  The request was 
denied, because it would be a clear infringement of the actual Hadoop 
elephant that identifies our software product. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

The past month has largely been coming to realize the areas under
fundraising, figure out who knows what, figure out who is doing what,
and just try to make sure I have all the puzzle pieces on the table
before I start fitting them together.  My sense is that in the next 2-3
months, I will be creating a vision and plan for ASF fundraising.  My
work for fundraising is in an early assessment and planning stage.

The sponsorship program will be transitioned from HALO to myself and
Greg Stein in Q1 2010.  Greg has expressed interest in managing and/or
closing sponsorship relationships.  Greg lives near me, so I'm looking
to meet up to better understand how he sees himself helping.

I want to give is a lot of thought that will go into what it means to be
an ASF sponsor.  Key questions include what levels are there, what we
have to do to service foundation sponsors, and how is it differentiated
with an ApacheCon sponsorship.  I'm reviewing how other groups have
designed sponsorship programs (defining "groups" very broadly to mean
everything from opera companies to industry non-profit groups to schools
to NGOs).

The donation program needs to get in gear to write thank you letters
both to show sincere appreciation and to give people the tax exempt
letter some require.  Phil Steitz has offered to help.  I need to figure
out how to get the list of who gets a letter soon.  Any pointers
appreciated.

fundraising@ is now moderated by me, which has lead to some initial
inquiries that were getting bounced.  I plan to use this as a place for
discussion but have held back until I have some agenda of what to talk
to others about.

I've talked to Sally and need to touch base with Shane about meeting
face-to-face to talk more about our related areas of responsibility.

Please let me know if you have any questions.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

Background and Status:
With the newly-formed Marketing & Publicity group, the primary activity over
the past three weeks has been spent planning, knowledge transfer, and
transitioning tasks. Sally has exchanged emails with Greg Stein as well as
held a call with Serge Knystautas to discuss Sponsor Relations activities.
She also had several email conversations with both Serge and Shane Curcuru
regarding the separation of responsibilities within the Fundraising and
Brand Management groups (a possible face-to-face meeting has also been
discussed). There has been some email activity with the site-dev team
regarding editing apache.org (starting with the home page).

The day-to-day activities within the Marketing & Publicity group have been
relatively quiet, with focus on post- ApacheCon/10th Anniversary follow-up,
discussing announcement tactics with the soon-to-graduate Pivot, and
coordinating media interviews with Software Design magazine of Japan and
developer site Dzone.

Please refer to the timeline following the list below for a detailed agenda.

adjust scheduling, and assign tasks.

Attachment 5: Report from the ASF Rep. for W3C

[Prepared by Sam Ruby]

Starting to organize a set of people interested in participating in W3C
activities on the ASF behalf; at the present time we have Larry Rosen, Glen
Daniels, Rahul Akolkar, and myself expressing interest.  I encourage others
who are interested to join the members-only w3c@apache.org mailing list.

As I am working closely with the W3C staff anyway, I am willing to step
forward and assume the role of VP, W3C for the ASF as well as W3C Advisory
Committee Representative for the ASF.  I don't see this as being a time
concern (activity is low, and this would enable me to work direct vs through
an intermediary).  I would also be quite willing to hand this off at any point
in the future if somebody else has the interest and cycles to pursue it.  A
board resolution has been created on this topic.

Only "real" business this month: forwarded a request for contacts regarding
developer outreach to the PRC list (as I didn't find a separate list for
Marketing and Publicity).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

All activity this month fairly routine: one new JIRA opened, one closed, and
progress on 5 others.  Assisted the new VP, Brand Management; am monitoring
one potential IP Clearance / Pedigree issue in a Incubator podling.  On the
latter, I'm satisfied that the PPMC is taking the appropriate steps.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For November 2009: There continues to be a steady stream of reports
of various kinds arriving at security@apache.org.  These continue to
be dealt with by the security team.

   5       Support question
   2       Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
   1       Vulnerability report of which
   1       [myfaces, via security@apache.org]

Also in November the TLS renegotiation flaw was made public which
requires protocol updates to be corrected.  While the upstream OpenSSL
fix was to disable all renegotiation that can break sites needing to
use client certificates, and so mod_ssl got an alternative mitigation
fix (http://marc.info/?m=125755783724966 ).  This will continue to be
a painful issue for some months as changes to the protocol and OpenSSL
implementation thereof may break some client/server interactions.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

ApacheCon US 2009 (2-6 November)
==============================
This was a great event!

We had approximately 750 attendees overall, including about 250 Meetup
attendees.

The Mayor of Oakland declared November 4th to be Apache Software
Foundation Day, and the Governor of California sent his
congratulations and thanks for our work over the last ten years.

Apache Roadshow Asia 2009 (Nov. 28-29 (Beijing); Dec 4-6 (Colombo))
========================================================
Both events were successful, more details in next month's report

Apache Retreat, Ireland 2010
=======================
Registration and publicity are proceeding at a slow but steady rate.
Noirin has been co-ordinating with local BarCamp folk, and we'll
announce the BarCamp publicly in January. A further registration
push will follow at that time.

Other events
==========
Various people are interested in running local events in 2010:
-Bruno Borges, Ross Gardler and Danese Cooper are interested in
holding an Apache Track at FISL, June 2010 in Brazil
-Noirin Shirley, Emmanuel Lecharny and Bertrand Delacretaz are working
with the Open World Forum organisers to provide Apache-related content
at the OWF in September 2010, Paris. The exact format has yet to be
determined.
-Simon Willnauer and Isabel Drost are interested in holding an Apache
event in Berlin, dates TBD. This may be pushed to 2011, depending on
what other events go on in Europe in 2010.
-Ross Gardler & others are interested in holding an Apache event in
the UK in June/July 2010, to be co-ordinated with OSWatch's annual
conference
-The TrafficServer and httpd projects are planning on doing a
hackathon & meetup on January 26th at the Yahoo Campus. This event is
planned to be entirely developer focused, and no ConCom assistance has
been requested.

Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Sander Striker ordered a disk replacement for nike (mx1.eu) and Bart
van der Schans installed it.

Began testing a searchable interface for private mail archives courtesy
of Chris Rhodes.

Started sending out periodic notifications to users with oversized home
directories, insecure permissions or private keys.

Improved our DNS configuration with input from Surfnet.

Ordered 6 SCSI drives to serve as replacements for various failed drives.

Tony Stevenson specced an HP machine slated to replace the aging minotaur
(people).

Tony Stevenson expanded our LDAP footprint to now be usable for logins
with all subversion repositories.

In contact with Sun to replace a failed controller in helios's array.

Philip Gollucci upgraded loki to FreeBSD 8.0.

Philip Gollucci patched FreeBSD on minotaur(people) to deal with a few
security advisories.

Martin Cooper and Davanum Srinivas dealt with a mass influx of spam
accounts into Confluence.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

ApacheCon US 2009
-----------------

ApacheCon went extremely well for the TAC attendees and those on the 
ground representing TAC. Tony prepared a report and was posted on the 
TAC list for inclusion in the board report, here it is:

"..In the initial stages of this round of applications things went really 
smoothly. We opened the applications on time, and we have a steady stream 
of applications until the closing date.  We selected an agent with whom we 
could book all the airline ticketing. This is the only part of the whole 
process that is still leaves a sour taste.  As we had to utilise a judges 
personal CC to pay for a bulk of the tickets as the agent decided partway
through that she could not actually accept a wire transfer, as had 
been previously discussed. 

On site, the conference went really well. This round of TAC recipients were 
both helpful and willing.  They were involved in setting up the Barcamp 
with Ross, and then they helped with session chairing. They also helped 
with other misc tasks throughout the week.  We trotted them out to 1st 
morning breakfast. This was a good way for us to get to meet many of them, 
and for them to meet other friendly faces. This was a great idea, and should 
remain on the roster.

There are some changes that we have unofficially agreed to be made to the 
application, process, and interaction with other parts of the foundation.
We intend to have a conference call to discuss these.  

Overall I think Oakland was much more of a hit than Amsterdam wrt the TAC 
aspects.."

The handing over of funds from the Treasurer to Nick Burch went ok and we 
thank Geir and Nick for sorting that out.

One last refund of pre-paid funding by a TAC attendee is in process of 
being done as we speak as mentioned in the Treasurers report.

TAC members held a concall meeting on the 26th November for a post 
ApacheCon round up and to talk about what went well and what needs 
changing etc. This discussion is summarized on the TAC list for everyone 
to read through and comment on, make suggestions etc. We expect to start 
acting on some of the points raised soon.

Of particular note is the discussion we had regarding the Apache Retreat 
being held in Ireland next year. We have funds left over that was 
reserved for an ApacheCon Europe. As it 'looks' like such an event will 
not happen during our current budget year then we have funds left over to 
use for other events if we decide to do so. We agreed that the Apache 
Retreat was within our scope of helping folks get to Apache events. 
We will contact the organisers of this event shortly and see what we 
can do. The intention is to open up applications in January.

Since the concall and discussion, TAC folks have been taking a well-earned 
break from activities and so no more news since then.

    * no releases.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

Summary
=======

The Apache Harmony community remains healthy, and has recently released
a new milestone build.  The lack of a JCK continues to be an issue for
Harmony.


Development and Releases
========================

There was no work on the core JVM and JIT code during the reporting
period, but we continue to receive a steady stream of patches to the
Java 5 and Java 6 class library branches.

The Harmony community published Apache Harmony 5.0 Milestone 12 on
December 5th.  This latest milestone build contains a number of bug
fixes and enhancements across numerous modules.  Our previous release
was in August 2009.

We are currently stabilizing the Java 6 stream with a view to making the
first stable release of that stream in the next few days.

Harmony build and test is running smoothly on the Hudson Ubuntu systems,
and we look forward to infra bringing on-line a wider variety of
platforms that can be used in test, including Windows.


Community
=========

The Harmony PMC appointed one new committer during the last reporting
period, and there are now 50 committers of which ~9 were active this
period.  There were no changes to the PMC membership.

Xiao-Feng gave a talk on Apache Harmony at the Apache Roadshow Asia 2009
meeting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache iBATIS Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The Incubator is running smoothly, with nothing requiring the Board's
attention at this time.

There was some discussion regarding publishing of docs to the site, and
whether docs for an intermediate state are or are not to be treated the same
as a code release.  Unclear that it is in any way an Incubator issue, as
opposed to an ASF-wide topic.

There is discussion of an OpenCMIS project, with some people wanting it, and
others concerned about incubating two projects in the same domain at the
same time.  There is also discussion of incubating a JSR-303 Bean Validation
project.

Pivot and OpenWebBeans are set to graduate.  Apache Clerezza is set to start
(q.v., http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ClerezzaProposal).

----

= Aries =

Aries will deliver a set of pluggable Java components enabling an enterprise
OSGi application programming model.

Aries entered incubation on September 22, 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention.

The svn area has been organized with a single trunk for now, though we still
need to settle the discussion about components lifecycle and the svn layout.

The following sub-components are actively being developed:

* Application
* Blueprint
* JMX

There has been a lot of activity on the mailing list this month indicating a
vibrant community is being built.

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve before graduation:

* Build community
* Create a release
* Address project scope concerns raised during acceptance vote


= Bluesky =

BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008. It is an e-learning solution
designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education
between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.

What we've completed in the last month:

   * last round check of first release preparation, e.g., legal issues of
compile scripts;
   * all the scripts and documents are committed, official website was
updated correspondingly;
   * Announced the first round vote of release of RealClass of BlueSky, but
failed due to deficiency of understanding release procedure;

top 2 or 3 to resolve prior to graduation:

   * According to the opinions on RealClass@BlueSky first release which
reverberate from dev-mailing list, we'd improve and start the release vote as
soon as possible;
   * Once the first release is made, we'd move fast to the next version's
transferring on the base of our prototype;
   * Community development is always under concern though it is not
realized because of some complex reasons. However, i'd be sure we could do
better when the development of the next version is on its way;


= Cassandra =

Cassandra is a distributed storage system providing reliability at a massive
scale. Started incubation: 01/2009. Opened to community in 03/2009.

Past action items:

* Get 0.4.0 release out. Done. (And 0.4.1, and 0.4.2)

Other notable activity:

* Cassandra users survey thread including responses from Twitter, Mahalo,
Ooyala, SimpleGeo, and 20+ others:
http://n2.nabble.com/Cassandra-users-survey-td4040068.html#a4040068
* Added Chris Goffinet and Johan Oskarsson as committers

Next steps:

* Get 0.5.0 release out. (Beta1 was released a couple weeks ago; Beta2 is
being voted on now.)
* Graduate


= Clerezza =

Clerezza was accepted in the incubator on November 27th, 2009.

We are setting up the podling, waiting on our mailing lists, there are no
issues requiring board attention at the moment.


= ESME =

Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment (ESME) is a secure and highly
scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that allows people to
discover and meet one another and get controlled access to other sources of
information, all in a business process context.

ESME entered the incubator in 2008-12-02.

The following items have been performed since the last reporting period

* Activity on the mailing list has increased dramatically
* The Apache wiki is full of content and used widely
* We have at least 4 new contributors adding code on a daily (almost)
basis.
* Professional performance tests have been assisting us to find memory
problems
* Use of Apache Hudson for daily builds
* Started defining the Jira items necessary for a first release
* Great deal of media attention - based on Chatter announcement from
SalesForce
* Collaboration with various Apache-external groups (#ubimic, akibot, etc.)
* Collaboration with OFBiz regarding integration of ESME into the
application
* Users from various enterprises are using ESME in test installations

The following items are planned for the next reporting period:

* Work on new UI
* Hopefully, our first release

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve prior to graduation

* Move all collaboration to the esme-dev mailing list
* Increase community involvement in the project
* Multiple Apache releases


= Etch =

Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008. We had our first
birthday!

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a
variety of programming languages.

This last reporting period saw little activity (0 commits, 0 releases).
We're finding it hard to regain our momentum after the dissolution of our
team. James and Scott are using etch in their current projects, and Youngjin
would like to pick up the c-binding. What we lack is the organizational
energy to get things moving.

Release 1.1 is ready but needs some administrative polish before it is
*done*.

Release 1.2 is next in the pipeline.

Our continuous integration build problem will only be solved by one of us
hosting it at our new gigs. James and Scott are looking into this.

Outstanding items:

* More community.. we have been Cisco-centered with just a few nibbles
outside of Cisco. Things are definitely changing with members employed or so
to be employed in different places. Building a stronger community remains
our key task. We wish we knew how.

Signed off by mentor: dashorst

= Hama =
Hama has been incubating since 19 May, 2008. It is a parallel matrix
computational package based on Hadoop Map/Reduce.

Recent developments:

* We implemented BSP(Bulk Synchronous Parallel) library on top of the
Hadoop.
* We were re-architecting the computing engine based on BSP to solve a
problem of performance and locality of sub-blocks in distributed system.

Required before graduation:

* Recently, the community and patch contribution is increasing. However, we
need more committer/reviewers who are capable of proofing algorithm.
* We need more documentation (We are preparing to submit a paper to the
USENIX) and education about linear algebra and graph algorithm.

Signed off by mentor: brett

= HISE =
HISE has entered incubation on November 6, 2009. HISE provides a deployable
component ready to interpret human interactions defined in xml files, as
specified in WS-Human-Task 1.0 Spec. It also exposes a taskOperations Web
Service for tasks management.

HISE is still in the setup phase, although that's almost done. All initial
committers now have an account, the repository and issues manager has been
setup. The only missing piece left are mailing-lasts, for now we're using
ODE's development list when necessary.


= Kato =

Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.

Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation,
and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API

Recent Activity:

* The project is working towards making a milestone 1 release. Currently
working through release candidates using a multi-staged audit process as
suggested by Robert Burrell Donkin.
* The JSR specification document has been accepted as an Early Draft Review
and the review period has passed.
* The Technology Compliance Kit (TCK) has been running against the hprof
and CJVMTI implementations of the API.

The following is planned for next reporting period:

* Our first release of the RI, demos and TCK.
* The 1.0 release of the RI in concert with the Final Draft Review (FDR) of
the JSR.
* Finalization of RI and JSR.

Before this project can be graduated we need to produce a usable
implementation of the API and more useful tools to encourage adoption and
participation of a much needed community.


= Libcloud =

Libcloud is a unified interface into various cloud service providers,
written in python. Libcloud joined the Incubator on November 3rd, 2009. Most
of our activity since joining the incubator has been around migrating our
existing code and community to the ASF.

* All but one developer account has been created.
* All iCLAs from pre-existing contributors have been submitted.
* libcloud git repo has been migrated to ASF SVN.
* libcloud mailing list has been migrated to ASF.
* We are holding a libcloud meetup/dinner in San Francisco on Thursday,
December 10th. See the mailing list if you are interested in joining!

We are actively working on a release, which we hope to happen early 2010.


= Log4php =

Log4PHP is a logging framework similar to Log4J, but in PHP. The project
entered incubation in 2004, retired and restarted again on 2007-07-04. The
project got some community feedback, which is good, but not enough for
graduation.

* Christian Hammers has been elected as new Committer
* The Log4PHP team created 3 release candidates. We are currently voting on
them and will bring the proposed release on the incubator list soon
* Update 13-12-09 - Today Log4PHP made its first release since being in the
Incubator for over 4 years!! A truly great effort to get this far, well done
team!


= OpenWebBeans =

OpenWebBeans is an ASL-licensed implementation of the JSR-299: Contexts and
Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform which is defined as JSR-299.

OpenWebBeans entered the incubator in October 26, 2008. The following items
have been made after the last report

* We have passed JSR-330 TCK
* We have increased our community
* We have voted for graduation
* We have been updating our code base using final specification
* We begin to work on JSR-299 TCK
* We have created a documentation project using docbook

Below are the next steps;

* We will try to graduate as TLP
* We will release the M4 version.
* We will integrate with the Apache Geronimo
* We will fully implement specification
* We will work on JSR-299 TCK


= RAT =

A number of patches have been (belatedly) applied and elections of some
contributors new to RAT but well known to the ASF are in progress.

The issue of final destination would probably be best solved by the creation
of a new TLP with a charter slightly wider than just RAT to allow the
development of other similar auditing tools useful to the Apache
infrastructure.


= River =

River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology
core infrastructure. Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that
defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology
to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive
to change. River has been incubating since December 2006.

Work on the test suite and other parts of River has continued and there is
continued talk about doing the AR2 release. The active development community
is still rather small.

Next steps before graduation (no changes since last report):

* AR2 Release
* Change com.sun.jini.* namespace to org.apache.river.*
* Reduce barriers to entry for new developers.
* Increased committer participation.


= Shindig =

Apache Shindig is an OpenSocial container and helps you to start
hosting OpenSocial apps quickly by providing the code to render
gadgets, proxy requests, and handle REST and RPC requests. Apache
Shindig entered the incubator 2007-12-03.

The following tasks have been completed since the last reporting period.

   * Multiple licensing issues have been cleaned up and we have
successful RAT tests in place.
   * Successful release of shindig 1.1-BETA5 on 11/24/2009, we now
have multiple committers that can cut releases.
   * Approval of two new committers.
   * Created distribution area with KEYS and our 1.0.0 and 1.1-BETA5 releases.
   * Updated Website

The following items are planned for the next reporting period:

   * Start graduation process.
   * Official 1.1 release.


= Stonehenge =

Stonehenge has been incubating since December 2008. Stonehenge a set of
example applications for Service Oriented Architecture that spans languages
and platforms and demonstrates best practices and interoperability by using
currently defined W3C OASIS standard protocols.

Since the last report in August, the Stonehenge project has been making
progress towards, and clarifying the scope of an M2 release with
improvements to the first sample application centered on both a unified
configuration system, and a claims-based security model. As part of the
efforts towards an M2 release, a Sun Metro based implementation of the
StockTrader sample was added to the trunk.

Community

Since the last report, about 2 new developers have joined and actively
contributed code in the form bug fixes and new functionality, as well as
documentation. Apache Stonehenge was demonstrated at
http://www.nycdotnetdev.com/EventDetail.aspx?f=list&event=7/16/2009, the NYC
Connected Systems User Group, ApacheCon, and
http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/jccim/Apache-Stonehenge-demoed-at-PDC09/.

M2

Progress has been steady towards an M2 release. There is on-going work on a
claims-based security system that adds a passive and active STS in select
implementations of the StockTrader sample application. Interoperability
testing is currently underway on this new functionality. As documentation is
a key part to this project we've completely revamped out
http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/STONEHENGE/Index to accommodate
future samples. Currently there are 19 open JIRA issues marked as M2.

M3

As mentioned in the August 2009 Report M3 would consist of either adding
more interoperability features to StockTrader or implementing new sample
applications. The latter is currently the focus, and the community is
focusing on creating "micro samples" for many common WS-* scenarios, with
the goal being around creating implementations with low barriers to entry.
Discussions are in progress about testing frameworks and scenarios of
interest.

Graduation Map

* Grow community around new claims based stocktrader implementations just
added
* More thorough documentation that empowers developers to replicate
interoperability scenarios demonstrated
* Demonstrate full interoperability between existing components, and
release


= Subversion =

Subversion entered the Incubator on November 7, 2009.  Subversion is a
version control system.

Mailing lists have been migrated to ASF infrastructure.  As of Dec. 10th,
the development mailing list has fully migrated over with the old tigris.org
dev@ list being shut down.  A users@ list has been created on ASF
infrastructure and is being used, but there are a number of published
references to the old tigris.org users@ address, so we are still discussing
that transition - that should be complete within the next month.  No
progress has been made to backfill archives, though some discussion has
occurred.  (Backfilling of archives is not required for graduation.)

The Subversion project has merged its source code history into the One True
Repo at svn.apache.org.  The old repository on svn.collab.net has been put
in read-only mode, and all new development is happening on svn.apache.org.
Most, if not all, active Subversion contributors have filed their ICLAs, and
are continuing development on the new infrastructure.

The most recent http://ci.apache.org/projects/subversion/rat-output.txt for
Subversion shows only 70 unknown licensed files, down from more than 200 a
couple of weeks ago.  Work continues on either removing inappropriately
licensed files from the distribution tarballs or adding licenses to files
found deficient.

The community plans to create a new patch release, Subversion 1.6.7, before
the end of the year.  Although this release will be made under the old
license (to avoid having to relicense mountains of code on the release
branch), the release process will be observed and monitored by the Incubator
PMC as part of the podling's progress toward graduation.

The podling remains optimistic that a rapid progression to graduation is
possible in the next month or two.

Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  Jackrabbit 2.0 reached beta status with the following releases:

    * Apache Jackrabbit 2.0 alpha11 on September 23rd
    * Apache Jackrabbit 2.0 beta1 on October 30th
    * Apache Jackrabbit 2.0 beta3 on November 25th
    * Apache Jackrabbit 2.0 beta4 on December 12th

  We also made two releases from the old 1.4 maintenance branch:

    * jackrabbit-core 1.4.10 on September 15th
    * jackrabbit-core 1.4.11 on September 23rd

  We made two releases of the Jackrabbit parent POM:

    * org.apache.jackrabbit:jackrabbit:4 on September 14th
    * org.apache.jackrabbit:jackrabbit:5 on October 4th

o Legal

  We're tracking the LEGAL-50 and LEGAL-62 issues for further comments,
  but currently we have no open legal action items.

  We are interested in figuring out how the new trademark policy affects
  our logo, website and releases, and what steps we need to take to meet
  the policy.

o Community / Development

  Jackrabbit participated in the Content Technology track and the NoSQL
  meetup at ApacheCon US 2009.

  The development branch related to database connection pooling has been
  merged back to Jackrabbit trunk and the results are included in the
  Jackrabbit 2.0 beta4 release.

  We've discussed with Apache Sling about taking over some OSGi bundling
  code they've written for Jackrabbit. On the other hand there is some
  code in Jackrabbit that's only being used by Sling and that might end up
  being adopted by them. We're considering making parts of our svn tree
  writable by members of both projects to simplify such cooperation.

o Infrastructure

  We received some spam through Nabble on our dev@ list, and have asked
  Nabble to disable posts through the web interface.

  We reconfigured the Jackrabbit entry on Ohloh to get code statistics
  from the Git mirror at git.apache.org since the svn history seen by Ohloh
  didn't include the time when Jackrabbit was still incubating.

LUCENE JAVA

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit.  Development has been
active and we released both 2.9 and 3.0 this quarter

SOLR

Solr is a full text search server using Lucene Java.
Development and the community is active.  Solr released
version 1.4 this quarter.


NUTCH

Nutch is a web-search engine: crawler, indexer and search runtime. There has
been a recent flurry of work on discussing Nutch's future post ApacheCon,
spearheaded by Andrzej Bialecki and others. In addition, there is ongoing
work on reducing code duplication (tighter integration of the Tika parsing
framework and mime type detection, better Solr integration) and using a
more flexible storage system (e.g. HBase). Many issues are being fixed in
preparation for a 1.1 release early next quarter.


LUCY

Lucy is a loose C port of Lucene targeted at dynamic language bindings.
Development this quarter has focused on abstraction of the IO subsystem and
portability to various compiler platforms.



LUCENE.NET

Lucene.NET is a .NET based port of Lucene Java.  Development and the
community are active.  Lucene.NET graduated from the incubator and is
now a full-fledged Lucene sub-project.


Mahout

Apache Mahout is working towards
building a suite of scalable machine learning libraries for text and
data mining.  Development is active and version 0.2 was released this
quarter.

Open Relevance Project

The Open Relevance Project is a new project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The project added Robert Muir as a committer
this quarter and development is getting under way. Recent work
has added support for Indonesian "Tempo" and Persian
"Hamshahri" collection to execute relevance judgements with
lucene-benchmark.

PyLucene

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java. Development is
active. Closely tracking the Lucene Java releases, we released PyLucene
2.9.0, PyLucene 2.9.1 and PyLucene 3.0.0 this quarter. A major addition was
made to JCC, the code generator making PyLucene possible: the support
for Java generics now in use by Lucene Java 3.0.

TIKA

Apache Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and
structured text content from various documents using existing parser
libraries.  Tika released version 0.5 this quarter. There have been
recent development efforts to speed up Tika's mime detector, as well as
efforts to provide a self-contained OGSI-based Tika bundle. There is a
strong desire to release these post 0.5 improvements, so we are planning
to release Tika 0.6 in the next few weeks.

Attachment V: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

- We're well on our way to a major release, 3.3.0.  Beta1 was recently
  cut nearly two weeks ago, no major issues so far.

- We had an issue with a users@sa list member harassing/attacking a
  representative of Return-Path and sending abusive emails to PMC members.
  We've revoked posting privs from the user and made it clear on the users
  list that such behaviour will not be tolerated in our community.  board@
  was copied in my email titled "Note from SA PMC: Removal of an abusive
  list member", sent at Tue, 08 Dec 2009 23:01:59 -0500.  Other than that,
  the mailing lists are active and healthy.

- We added two new committers since the last report: Warren Togami Jr.
  (wtogami) and Adam Katz (khopesh).  That brings our active committer
  count to approximately 13.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Synapse Project

Community

The Synapse community keeps going well. Mailing list traffic is solid
and continuous, with new users on a regular basis. We voted in a new committer:
Supun Kamburugamuwa

Releases
The 1.3 release is taking longer than expected due to dependencies on
other projects. However, the WS-Commons Transports release is
imminent.

ApacheCon
We had a number of presentations at ApacheCon.

Board issues
None identified.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

This quarter Apache Tiles has released new versions of both the 2.1 and 2.2 
series. Here is a synopsis of the releases:

 * 2.2.1 Beta - The 2.2 series includes a cleaner API and some new features
   and is dependent on modern versions of the JDK and servlet specifications. 

 * 2.1.4 GA - The older 2.1 series is being maintained for users who require 
   older JDK and servlet versions, but there are no plans to backport the
   newer features to this branch.

 * The release roadmap is on the Tiles wiki here: 
   http://cwiki.apache.org/TILES/post-21x-release-plan.html

There have been no changes to the PMC or committers group this quarter. User 
list traffic is steady and non-committers seem to be stepping up a bit more to 
answer questions. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

Summary
--------------
The project continues to be active on a number of fronts.
There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Releases
-------------
We have released Tomcat Native 1.1.18.

Security
------------
We've been working closely with security issue reports and the Apache
Security committee on quickly replying to issues, resolving them, and
coordinating public disclosures.

CVE-2009-3548 - Insecure default password
  The Windows installer defaults to a blank password for the
  administrative user. If this is not changed during the install
  process, then by default a user is created with the name admin,
  roles admin and manager and a blank password.

Development
-------------------
Development was concentrated mainly on fixing bugs for the current
releases and on finalizing the Tomcat 7. The new Tomcat Lite was moved
from the sandbox to the modules directory.
We have requested the Solaris Zone for Tomcat PMC which we would
like to use for creating daily and release builds.
