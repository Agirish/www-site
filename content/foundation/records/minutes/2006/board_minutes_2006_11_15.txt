       Approval of the minutes were tabled for the next meeting.

 4. Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Greg]

       Nothing to report for the short time since our last meeting.

    B. President [Sander]

       Infrastructure is back to business 'as usual'.  Services
       were restored.  Final accounting was done on the colo move.
       Justin has the expenses incurred.

    C. Treasurer [Justin]

       The SoC payment Jim received last month has now been received in
       our account and is reflected below.

       Per the email sent earlier this week, the cost of the co-lo move
       from UL to OSL is currently $3,188.70.  We have discontinued
       payments to UL.  Due to some mixups with the vendors, my personal
       credit card was charged for some of these items ($714.11 in
       total).  Given Jim and Sander's recent approval via email, I will
       be reimbursed for those charges.

       In the last few weeks, we've had a number of 'chargeback'
       incidents with PayPal.  These seem to be cases where credit card
       fraud may have been used and the scammers donated money to us. 
       The fact that there's been so many in the last few weeks is sort
       of disturbing.  We should keep an eye on this, but there's not
       much that we can do here.

       We have not yet received the Google payment for the sponsorship
       program, but should receive it in the next month.  We're also
       still awaiting a firm committment from Covalent as to what level
       they will donate at.  A few other companies have expressed
       interest in the program, but we have not yet received any other
       payments.

       I would also like to upgrade us to QuickBooks 2007.  We're
       currently using QB 2005.  Due to some upcoming personal changes,
       I need to migrate my main QB setup to another computer.  So, I'd
       like to take this opportunity to upgrade QB as well.  The new
       "non-profit" version claims to better support 990 forms.  If
       true, that's really nice and would be a huge time saver.  It's
       $399.95 online (downloadable from Intuit).

       Current balances (as of 11/14/2006):

        Paypal             $    563.73 (-$    348.82)
        Checking           $ 17,048.99 (+$ 15,720.45)
        Savings            $190,972.12 (-$  9,507.91)
        Total              $208,584.84 (+$  5,863.72)

       Jim volunteered to contact Covalent regarding their
       Sponsorship level.

    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]

       Working in continuing on scanning all of our documents. All
       incoming iCLAs, CCLAs and grants get immediately recorded and
       scanned, with previously recorded documents getting scanned
       in a priority order. At present, all ASF membership applications
       have been scanned and are ready to be committed. I have
       created an Infra request to create a new 'documents' directory
       under the private repo, which will be used to locate all scanned
       documents.
       
       The secretarial assistant reported entering and scanning thirty-three
       new ICLAs, three CCLAs, one consultant services agreement, and four
       license agreements. The remainder of the membership application
       were completed in October, and several previously entered license
       grants were scanned. The ASF incorporation documents are also
       in process. The October Board Minutes were written based on
       our conversation and my notes.
       
       All approved minutes have been moved to the records section
       of the site repository.
       
       A proposal to hold an irc-based members meeting was floated
       to the membership. Out of a membership base of ~200 people,
       there was very little feedback. Because of what appears
       to be a lack of desire or need to have one, plus the
       proximity to the holiday season as well as work schedules,
       we will postpone the meeting and see if the start of 2007
       looks any better.
       
       We have recieved no correspondence requiring board attention.

    E. VP of Legal Affairs [Cliff]

       Cliff reported that work is continuing on the "crypto export"
       clarifications for use within the ASF. Also being worked on
       is the standards licensing. Cliff noted that SenderID is
       covered under the Open Specification promise, and therefore
       removes any restrictions on use.
       
    F. VP of JCP [Geir]

       Geir reported that there were no issues within the JCP
       requiring board attention at this time.

 5. Committee Reports

    A. Apache Ant Project [Conor MacNeill / Justin]

       See Attachment A

       Greg asked why Gump was not viable regarding the nightly
       builds. Greg was to follow up on this issue.

       Approved by General Consent.

    B. Apache Cocoon Project [Reinhard Poetz / Henri]

       See Attachment B

       Justin expressed his hope that the use of the term "Flashy" in
       the report did not imply Macromedia Flash.  His concern was
       that accessibility should be a priority for all of our sites.
       
       Justin also noted that regarding Daisy, there has been some
       conversations between infra@ and Cocoon about the wisdom of running
       production services in the zone.  Also, Spring is under the ALv2, so
       no license worries there.

       Henri noted  that Rhino just relicensed under a joint MPL/GPL style,
       which is great news for a lot of projects at the ASF. Greg agreed
       but reminded everyone that no ASF projects can depend on GPL
       libraries.

       Approved by General Consent.

    C. Apache Forrest Project [David Crossley / Dirk]

       See Attachment C

       Approved by General Consent.

    D. Apache HiveMind Project [James Carman / Sam]

       See Attachment D

       Henri suggested that Sam chat with James about release management, 
       just to make sure they and Tapestry are looking good. Sam
       agreed to take that action item

       Approved by General Consent.

    E. Apache HTTP Server Project [Roy T. Fielding / Greg]

       See Attachment E

       Approved by General Consent.

    F. Apache Java Community Process Project [Geir Magnusson Jr. / Sander]

       See Attachment F

       Report given during 'VP of JCP' Officer's report, above.

    G. Apache Lenya Project [Gregor J. Rothfuss / Cliff]

       See Attachment G

       Approved by General Consent.

    H. Apache Logging Project [Curt Arnold / Jim]

       See Attachment H

       Henri asked whether the Logging PMC was correct in avoiding to
       look at LOGBack, to avoid "contamination" of codebase IP. Cliff
       will follow up with them about this; this might be overly sensitive.
       Greg suggested that they simply  should just ask permission from Ceki
       if he considers their review of LOGBack a possible contamination.
       
       Cliff also noted that the terms "very quiet mailing list" and "ending
       incubation" seem to imply "closing down" the project (some sort
       of hibernation).
       
       Greg noted that Incubator projects should almost never have separate
       user/dev mailing lists, unless they're mature code bases arriving with
       a large community.
       
       Approved by General Consent.

    I. Apache Perl Project [Geoffrey Young / Greg]

       See Attachment I

       Justin asked if Fred was added to the PMC or just granted commit.
       He will follow up.

       Approved by General Consent.

    J. Public Relations Committee [Jim Jagielski]

       See Attachment J

       Approved by General Consent.

    K. Apache Santuario Project [Berin Lautenbach / Sam]

       See Attachment K

       Jim noted, regarding JuiCE project and others, that they
       refer to some sort of "hibernation" option for podlings even
       though we have no such thing. Justin noted that basically
       hibernation is the same as retiring, or, at least, should
       be. Henri repeated the board's position that several
       podlings appear to be "hibernating" already, by being
       very dormant. Sam will talk to Berin and suggest he go
       to general@incubator to discuss the next phase for the podling.

       Approved by General Consent.

    L. Apache Velocity Project [Henning Schmiedehausen / Cliff]

       See Attachment L

       Approved by General Consent.

    M. Apache Xalan Project [Brian Minchau / Dirk]

       See Attachment M

       Approved by General Consent.

    N. Apache Xerces Project [Gareth Reakes / Sander]

       See Attachment N

       Justin asked if there was a license or s/w grant on file from
       Lucian Holland. Jim noted that we have an iCLA on file for
       him, but not a grant or CCLA.

       Approved by General Consent.

    O. Apache XML Project [Gianugo Rabellino / Justin]

       See Attachment O

       Approved by General Consent.

    P. Apache XML Graphics Project [Jeremias Maerki / Henri]

       See Attachment P

       Approved by General Consent.

    Q. Apache Incubator Project [Noel Bergman / Justin]

       See Attachment Q

       Jim wondered if we had any problems regarding Wicket and
       the lack of iCLA's from some developer who did not move
       over with the codebase.
       
       Henri asked if stdcxx be a worry. His concerns are that it's
       been 18 months in the incubator and that 5 of its committers have
       never been active. He also wondered what was meant by the
       phrase that Synapse has a 'diversity factor 3'.

       Approved by General Consent.

    R. Apache Maven Project [Jason van Zyl / Ken]

       See Attachment R

       Justin noted that we don't have any resolutions yet on the
       2 issues the Maven PMC wishes to bring to board attention.
       It was noted that regarding the trademark issue, the PMC
       should contact the PRC directly. Jim took the action item
       to facilitate that.

       Approved by General Consent.

    S. Conferences Committee [Ken Coar]

       No reported submitted in time for review.

    T. Apache Geronimo Project [Ken Coar]

       See Attachment T

       Jim was curious on how "old" the report really was, and
       whether it included any Late Oct./Early Nov. news. Ken
       reported that it, in fact, did.

       Approved by General Consent.

    U. Apache Shale Project [Craig McClanahan]

       See Attachment U

       Approved by General Consent.

    V. Apache Harmony Project [Geir Magnusson Jr.]

       See Attachment V

       Approved by General Consent.

ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Ant Project

o Current Release

  The current release remains Ant 1.6.5 which was released on June 2,
  2005. There have been no releases finalized since the previous board
  report.

o Ant 1.7

  Ant 1.7 has been through a number of beta releases. A release
  candidate for the final 1.7 release is now available (13-Nov-2006).

o Antlibs

  The Ant project has released version 1.0 of a .NET Antlib which
  supports .NET related development activities and tools. It works
  with both Microsoft's and the mono project's tools.

  A beta of the AntUnit 1.0 antlib has been released. This antlib
  contains tasks for testing Ant tasks without needing to use JUnit
  directly.

o Development Activities

  The Ant project is currently considering issues which have arisen
  from the Ant 1.7 release preparations including:

  - procedures for management and validation of releases
  - how to handle tasks which support commercial tools and require the
    tool's libraries to be present for the task to be built.  Examples
    include the Weblogic and Starteam tasks. Overall Ant will be
    moving to isolating such dependencies in Antlibs.
  - Resuming Ant nightly builds. In the past Ant nightlies were
    produced by the Gump project but this is not considered viable any
    more.

  There has been a lot of work on outstanding bugs as part of the
  release cycle which is good to see.

o Ivy Project

  The Ant PMC has sponsored the Ivy project in the ASF incubator. The
  Ant Project is happy to manage Ivy once it has been through
  incubation but also recognizes that the board and/or Ivy may deem it
  more appropriate to have Ivy as a TLP once incubation is complete.

  A number of Ant PMC members are acting as mentors.

o Legal Issues

  I noted the appearance of the Gosling project which makes use of
  some Ant source code but which does not include a NOTICE file at
  this time.  We have not yet contacted the Gosling project about
  this, but we do not expect there to be an issue.

o Community

  I think everyone is happy to see an Ant 1.7 release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

RELEASES / ONGOING WORK
- There were no releases, neither from the 2.1.x branch nor from trunk.
- We plan to release a second milestone release of Cocoon core 2.2 and of
  some blocks in November. Additionally we aim to release Cocoon 2.1.10 by
  the end of the year.
- Finally we have a working version of Cocoon blocks in trunk. After that we
  consider Cocoon core in trunk being feature complete.
- The work on using OSGi as fundament (aka Cocoon 3.0) is "on hold" for now.
  The reason is that the Spring community is working on an OSGi/Spring
  integration layer which will save us a lot of work
  (www.springframework.org/osgi).
- As soon as 2.2 is released, we will only apply bug fixes and minor
  enhancements to the 2.1.x branch. This means that there will be no hard
  rule to keep it in sync with trunk anymore.
- There is a new documentation system in place. It is based around the Daisy
  CMS, a Maven 2 plugin that pulls out the content and SVN. Although we use
  the CMS, we will still add our generated docs to SVN before we publish
  them. (see http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/daisy/cdocs/1201.html)
- There are plans to come up with a new, flashy design for cocoon.apache.org.

COMMUNITY
- From October, 2nd to October, 4th the 5th annual Cocoon GetTogether took
  place, this year in  Amsterdam. Thanks to Arje Cahn and his team at Hippo,
  it was a success again. There were 91 attendees from 13 different countries
  (http://www.cocoongt.org/chairs-big.png) and 13 interesting talks
  (http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/GT2006Notes).
- new committers: Lars Trieloff
- new PMC members: Andreas Hochsteger, Ard Schrijvers, Helma van der Linden,
  Lars Trieloff

LEGAL
- We use the new license headers throughout our codebase.
- Cameron McCormack (Batik) asked the Rhino team about
  relicensing Rhino under the MPL:

- Joe Schaefer made us aware that the IP Agreement at the Daisy registration
  (Daisy is our CMS) doesn't follow the Apache Community Contribution Agreement
  (http://www.apache.org/licenses/proposed/community.txt) which hasn't been
  adopted by the board though, but would definitly be an improvement compared
  to the current text.

Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Issues needing board attention
------------------------------
None.

Changes in the PMC membership
-----------------------------
New committer/PMC member Sjur Moshagen (sjur).

General status
--------------
Progress has been slower this quarter. Most devs seem busy with other
stuff.

Some new developers are participating on the mailing lists.

Seems to be a bit more activity on the user list. Committers and other
developers are assisting there.

Issues still to be dealt with by the Forrest PMC
------------------------------------------------
Continue our project guidelines document. Been making links to various
dev email discussions about how to deal with new development and when
to branch.  Need to get that into words. No progress since last
report.

Continue the discussion about our use of IRC (monthly sessions been on
hold).

Progress of the project
-----------------------
Discussed the architecture of the framework, especially in relation to
how we use Cocoon. Needs more exploration.

No release date has yet been set for 0.8 but we are continuing the
phase of trimming the list of scheduled issues, so the release is
likely to be soon.  That is what we said in the last three board
reports, but yes we are making some progress.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache HiveMind Project

The HiveMind team is working on the architecture for HiveMind 2.0.

The HiveMind TLP move is finally finished.  Thanks to all who helped
us (actually me; I'm still learning) in the process.

We are also in the process of cutting a 1.1.2 release.  I believe we
are going to switch to a new release strategy, much like what Tapestry
is doing.  Basically, we cut a release, but don't declare it
"official" until we have a vote on it.  That's my understanding at
least.  Does this go along with what the rest of Apache does?


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

The Apache HTTP server project has had a relatively quiet quarter,
with more time spent on ApacheCon and infrastructure moves than
on the source code.  We have no board-level issues at this time.

In the last three months, we have added Graham Dumpleton to the
PMC and Ian Holsman has resigned to focus on other things.

We started a wiki at <http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/> for documentation
and it seems to have attracted interest in the area of documenting
configuration related instructions for integrating third-party
products with Apache httpd.  We should be encouraging packagers
to use that space as well.

The HTTP server project is currently responsible for

There have been no releases of any of our products since August,
though builds of httpd 2.2.x, mod_python 3.3, and libapreq seem
to be in progress this week.

There are a few things we need to do fairly soon.  First, we need
to clean up the above mess -- there should be a distinction between
release-ready products and various experiments, and mod_python could
survive as its own TLP.  Second, we need to find a way to lower the
commit barrier for experiments and decide where to park the dormant
ones.  Finally, we need to open the doors to rethinking the entire
server framework for httpd 3.0, with the potential for multiple
competing alternatives and a serious bake-off.

Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Java Community Process Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Lenya Project

The Lenya project added two new committers in the last period, Joern
Nettingsmeier and Renaud Richardet.

There were no new releases in the period. A maintenance release 1.2.5
has been proposed though for the next week.

The codebase saw some nice enhancements in the period:

* unified resource handling
* flowscript integration simplified
* continued switching to UUID for content

No legal issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Logging Project

Overall
----------

* No activity.  Changes to project bylaws to reorganize as a
  single project with multiple products should be considered in next 
  quarter.  Curt Arnold (PMC Chair) and Ron Grabowski (log4net committer) 
  attended ApacheCON US.

log4cxx Report
--------------

* log4cxx status is essentially unchanged since last report.
  An initial ASF release of log4cxx is long overdue.  There only some 
  minor bug fixes this quarter and there still needs to be a coordinated 
  sprint to address the few remaining issues that have been blocking a 
  release.  The user community remains healthy, but development has been 
  resource starved.

log4j Report
------------

* log4j 1.2.14 was released on 18 September 2006.  This release added 
  concurrency issues and addressed many minor bugs that had built up 
  since development had shifted to log4j 1.3 branch several years ago.

* A log4j 1.3 alpha was expected in this period, but no release 
  candidate was produced.

* Community discussion around a new appender that would address use cases 
  such as distinct log files per thread.  A sandbox effort was started 
  for potential inclusion in log4j, but has not progressed to a usuable 
  state.

* There is an unclear migration path from log4j 1.2.  log4j 1.2 is widely 
  deployed more users are encountering concurrency issues and limitations 
  which have been in the code for a long time, some of which can not be 
  resolved without breaking compatibility.  The log4j 1.3 development 
  effort did not address these issues but broke compatibility in other 
  areas in a manner inconsistent with a minor release designation.  
  Most development effort in the last 18 months have been to eliminate 
  unnecessary compatibility breakages in log4j 1.3.  There has been 
  discussion, but little more, about starting a log4j 2.0 development 
  effort to target the concurrency defects and target current JDK's.  
  In addition, Ceki Gulcu has been promoting migration to LOGBack 
  (http://logback.qos.ch/index.html), a LGPL licensed logging framework.  
  However given the terms of the LGPL license, it is risky for log4j 
  developers to review the LOGBack code due to possibly contaminating 
  log4j which makes it difficult to respond to LOGBack advocacy on the 
  mailing lists.

log4net Report
--------------

* The log4net project is still in incubation, but likely time to make an 
  exit which will hopefully be accomplished by the next report.

* No scheduled work apart from bug fixing and evaluating contributed patches
  at the moment.

* We have an open ended discussion on the use and storage of strong name
  assembly signing keys. This may need further discussion at wider level,
  and probably requires some sort of consensus amongst all the 
  .NET projects.

log4php Report
--------------

* No report available from log4php committers in time for this report.  
  The mailing list have been very quiet with only 4 messages on the 
  user list and no messages on the development list.  Likely time to 
  consider ending incubation and finding a permanent resting place.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Perl Project

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

Nothing much happening on that track.  No new mod_perl 1.x releases
since the last report.

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

no new mod_perl 2.x releases since the last report

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP and
Parrot.

no new Apache-Test releases since the last report

--- Apache-SizeLimt --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.

no new Apache-SizeLimit releases since the last report

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be an active and healthy development community -
bugs are found, bugs are fixed, development moves forward as usual.

as of this report, we are in the middle of a release cycle, so all
subprojects should have new releases by the next report.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is, as always, thriving.  nothing noteworthy
has happened since the last report.

-- PMC --

Fred Moyer joined the ranks as full committer to all the mod_perl
source repositories.  as always, it's nice to grow our community with
good, talented people.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Public Relations Committee

Status report for the Public Relations Committee

The PRC is making the transition to the new chair, which
was approved by the board last month. There has been
discussion on the PRC list regarding ways and methods
of better tracking PRC open issues. Potential
methods include:

   JIRA:
     The issue is that there are some non-ASF
     members who have admin view privs on JIRA;
     it is generally accepted that the PRC deals
     with sensitive issues and at the very most,
     ONLY ASF members should have view access.
     Whether this can be worked around is being
     investigated.

   Wiki:
     Investigation into ACL viewing capability is
     also being done, for similar reasons as
     detailed in the JIRA section.

   SVN:
     A PRC area under the private foundation repo
     is likely the leading candidate. All ASF members
     will have view access, and whether write access
     should be limited to PRC members is being discussed

   Mailing List:
     Jim proposed separating the singular prc@ list
     into 2: one which would deal with "policy"
     discussions, etc and the other that would
     have traffic focused on open issues and day-to-
     day operations. The reason, according to Jim,
     was to allow a better avenue for the PRC to
     track and follow action items via a list with
     a better signal/noise ratio. Heated debate about
     this; some people did not like the idea at all,
     others were confused about the idea (due to
     misleading names for the lists) and others
     had no problem with it (as long as they were
     open to all ASF members).

Working is progressing on adding the Sponsorship
program to the ASF website, most likely as its own
page and line-item (on the main site). PRC and board
members are relaying to the PRC contact information for
potential sponsors.

New members are expected to be voted in at this months
board meeting; additionally, non-active members are
expected to be removed, but with the gratitude of
the PRC.

IBM had a potential PR for the UIMA podling. After ensuring
that the PR would not be released until the podling had
reached the stage that allowed branding, feedback
was sent to IBM. IBM has postponed the PR.

Ted Leung working with Michael Goulde, of Forrester
Research, on Michael's Open Source report on the ASF
with a specific focus on SOA projects and podlings.

Ongoing Items:
- Logo Policy Guide (Susie)
    Susie has a initial draft, which is looking great. This should
    help us with a lot of the mundane stuff that PRC handles, waiting for
    feedback from people before it progresses

- PRC Toolkit proposal from David Reid. (for handling press releases and
  things like that)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

Work for the past quarter has been concentrated on the two libraries
rather than any infrastructure level stuff.  The C++ library had a 1.3
release and is now looking to release 1.3.1 with an updated build
system and some minor bug fixes.

The Java library is very close to a 1.4 release, having cut a set of
release candidates.  Some last minute API compatibility issues have
held up the release, but it is now expected in the next week or so.

On the JuiCE project (within the Incubator), nobody has had any time
to focus on it, so we are considering "hibernating" it until such time
as somebody has the required bandwidth.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project

Velocity Top Level move
-----------------------

The Velocity project is excited about its move out from the Jakarta
umbrella and onto top-level status.

The board decided to establish the Apache Velocity project on Oct 25th
and appointed Henning Schmiedehausen (henning@apache.org) as Vice
President, Velocity and chair of the Velocity PMC.

Ever since then, we have started to migrate our web site, mailing
lists and repositories out of the Jakarta umbrella. With help from the
infrastructure team, we currently have moved all mailing lists onto
velocity.apache.org, created the private@ and general@ lists and
started migrating the web site (we already have velocity.apache.org
but it is currently redirecting to the jakarta site). We hope to
finish the migration until the end of November.


General information
-------------------

Some talk with the Click project (click.sf.net), which is a framework
centered around Velocity, has taken place to bring Click through the
incubator into the Velocity project. There has been enthusiasm on the
Click side and from us, but we have not taken any steps yet, because
we wanted to let the dust from the top level move settle first.


Velocity Engine project
-----------------------

The 'velocity' project has been renamed the 'Velocity Engine project'
a while ago. What is commonly known as "Velocity" is actually the
templating engine.

The Velocity Engine team is pushing heavily towards the 1.5
release. We have released one beta and will be releasing our second
(and hopefully last) beta this week (we already voted on it). We
expect an RC until the end of November and plan for a final release
very early Q1 2007 (both Will and Henning attended Sally's PR talk @
ApacheCon US and we tried to understand the value of good release
timing). We also plan sort of a "mini PR campaign" similar to the
press releases issued at AC US. We will get in contact with the PRC
once the RC is out.

The code base itself has seen a steady progression; we were able to
triage and sort all of the issue reports in JIRA and prioritize them
nicely. The number of open issues is steadily going down so we expect
the 1.5 release to be the best Velocity release ever.

There has been work on a docbook based Documentation (User Guide,
Developers Guide), which in turn has spawned a docbook framework which
might usable outside Velocity as a general purpose documentation
framework.


Velocity Tools project
----------------------

Velocity Tools is working through a short backlog of patch
contributions and bugs hoping to get a 1.3 version released before
Velocity Engine 1.5 goes final.  It's also the plan to test
VelocityStruts 1.3 against Struts 1.3 for compatibility.  Velocity
Tools 1.3 is likely to be the last major release in the 1.x line, as
the development team already started planning for version 2.


Velocity DVSL
-------------

There were no changes on the DVSL code base in the last few
months. DVSL currently has no active developers, but we do apply the
odd patch. All issue reports against DVSL were triaged and checked but
there are no immediate plans to do a DVSL release unless one of the
contributors steps up or strong desire for a release is shown on the
user list.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

 Xalan-C
 =======
 Nothing to report. Just bug fixes.

 Xalan-J
 =======

 The Xalan PMC has passed three motions in the last quarter:

 1. Have a new point release, Xalan-J 2.7.1 (the previous
   2.7.0 release was in August 2005)
 2. Drop support for running on JRE 1.1.x (no tears there)
   in 2.7.1 and beyond
 3. Accept a code contribution from Xerces through Neil
   Delima a Xerces committer (THANKS NEIL!) to support
   serialization with DOM Level 3 APIs in 2.7.1


 Xalan-J developers agreed on a date for the 2.7.1 release,
 and we are aiming for November 27, 2006.

 Dropping support for JRE 1.1.x means that Xalan can now
 use newer JRE library classes and apply a number of suggested
 patches.

 Xerces has noticed that Xalan's Java based serializer
 has been generally faster and of better quality than
 Xerces' serializer although Xalan's serializer was
 originally based on Xerces' serializer.

 Xerces is in the XML parsing business, not the XML producing
 business, so it makes sense to have a common serializer,
 and lack of support for DOM Level 3 APIs was the final thing
 that was holding Xerces back from using Xalan's serializer.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J
========

In September we released Xerces-J 2.8.1 to roll up all of the bug fixes
and minor improvements since the previous release. Work on the StAX
implementation continues. In October we received a generous contribution
from Lucian Holland containing an initial implementation of the StAX
Event API along with several test cases. Since 2.8.1 we've also been
working on the Xalan based DOM Level 3 serializer. This was just recently
completed and contributed to Xalan-J. We've already migrated to it in
SVN which clears the way for deprecating Xerces' native serializer in
Xerces 2.9.0. There's been some discussion with the Xalan community about
coordinating this release with the upcoming Xalan 2.7.1. If this were to
happen it would probably occur later this month, shortly before the Xalan
release.

XML Commons
===========

The Xerces PMC and committers recently voted to accept the transfer of XML
Commons from the XML project to Xerces. In September the community agreed
on a plan to have three releases of the XML Commons components:

    xml-commons-external-1.2.06 (JAXP 1.2)
    xml-commons-external-1.3.04 (JAXP 1.3)
    xml-commons-resolver-1_2 (XML Catalogs v1.1).

It's been far too long since XML Commons had a release of these components.
There are still a few odds and ends left but they are almost ready to go.


Xerces-C / P
===========

Xerces-P is now within Xerces-C. This means it is kept up to date as code
changes and we have a very useful testing tool. Perl tests have now been
written that cover the majority of the API. The new build system still
needs testing on more platforms before the next release. We have had a code
submission for XInclude but it still needs some work and we need to make a
decision on whether to postpone this release or leave it until next.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache XML Project

General business:
==============
As usual, things are quiet in the XML project. Generally speaking,
it's worth noting that the process of moving XML projects to different
PMC has started, with the recent vote that moved XML Commons under the
Xerces umbrella. During the next quarter we expect to move Xindice to
DB and Axkit to Perl. Other than that, no news to report.

Xindice:
=======
Xindice user's list is quiet, as usual, but there is some BugZilla and
SVN activity on the developer's list. As bug list shrinks, possibility
for the next release increases.

AxKit:
=====
AxKit2 development is going well, but has stalled while the developers
concentrate on "real life" for a bit. People are developing apps for
it and using it. We intend to do one more release of AxKit1 to fix a
few niggling bugs.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

Not much going on on the project level.

XML Graphics Commons

A version 1.1 is soon to be released in preparation of the next FOP
release.

Batik

Most work was on bugfixing. Planning for a new release has started.

The Rhino project has been asked to relicense under the MPL 1.1 which
should solve the problem with the license policy. They said, they'll
look into it (Nov 3).

FOP

There were improvements in the font area, for page-number-citation and
the bitmap renderers. It was also encouraging to receive patches from
new contributors, including a patch for CMYK support. One new
committer: Vincent Hennebert (he was one of the GSoC students)

The 0.93 release is still to be done.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The Incubator continues to be very active.

The recent graduation of Harmony has led to a healthy discussion of
what types of votes should be held on which mailing lists.  Ken Coar
also conducted a general review of the STATUS files for current
Incubator projects, which has led to a number of those files being
updated, and a general awareness that there had been some laxity in
maintaining them.

Robert Burrell Donkin continues to yeoman work helping to review the
IP status for our projects.  His RAT tool can help to automate some of
the preliminaries, and perhaps we should look at encouraging its use
ASF-wide.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


November Reports

=== Abdera ===

Abdera is an implementation of the Atom Publishing Protocol and Atom
Syndication Format.

Items to complete before graduation:

 * Continue to expand the community
 * Handle any legal issues related to crypto code

Community:

 * Added Ugo Cei as a committer/PPMC member
 * Decided to work towards a new release Real Soon Now (tm)

Code:

 * Added new code that implements IRI support
 * Tweaked extension API to improve code reuse across parser
   implementations
 * Implemented more unit tests
 * Added more extensions
 * Added experimental bidirectional character support

=== IVY ===

Ivy is a new incubator podling.

Functionally, Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking,
resolving and reporting) project dependencies.  It is characterized by
the following:

  1. flexibility and configurability

  2. tight integration with Apache Ant

Xavier Hanin, the main author of Ivy, sent the proposal to join the
incubator on October 23d 2006.

The proposal is sponsored by the Ant PMC which voted to sponsor the
entry of Ivy at the Apache Incubator.

Since the proposal, the main actions which have been achieved have
been:

 * creation of the web page http://incubator.apache.org/projects/ivy.html
 * creation of ivy specific mailing lists
 * the CLA of Xavier Hanin has been received by the ASF
 * the CLA of Maarten Coene and the License Grant have not been received
   or processed yet.

The receipt and processing of the License Grant is now the limiting
factor for the next steps, which are the import of the codebase in
Subversion and the import of the bug reports in JIRA.

The people involved with Ivy at present are :

===== Mentors =====

 * Antoine Levy-Lambert
 * Stephane Bailliez
 * Steve Loughran
 * Stefan Bodewig

===== Committers =====

 * Xavier Hanin
 * Maarten Coene


=== Lokahi ===
Lokahi is a management console for Apache httpd and Apache Tomcat.
Lokahi entered incubation in January 2006.

Top items to resolve before graduation:
 * Grow the community.  It's currently diverse, but fairly small.
 * Go through the release process at least once, issuing Apache-approved
   release and making sure all requirements, e.g. LICENSE and NOTICE
   files, are met.

The Lokahi project has kept on chugging along, incorporating numerous
contributed patches and focusing on code quality, improved MySQL
support, and and enhanced support for late version Tomcat 5.5
containers.


=== Roller ===

Roller 3.0 work complete - We reported on the new featues of Roller
3.0 in the last status report. Roller 3.0 is now in production at
several sites and is ready for release. We are currently testing RC4
and hoping to release shortly.

Roller 3.1 nearing completion, RC1 sometime in the next week -
features include:

- Full support for tagging weblog entries, displaying a tag cloud,
  viewing blog pages by tag and providing dynamic RSS/Atom feeds based
  on tags.
- Theme encapsulation: when you customize a theme the resources are
  now copied into your file upload area - making custom themes
  independent so they won't break when new versions of themes are
  deployed.
- Replaced RTE editor with more sophisticated Xinha WYSIWYG editor

Ready for graduation? - our licensing issues are behind us. We no
longer ship any LGPL components and three separate effort exist to
replace our Hibernate dependency with a non LGPL solution (using JDO,
JPA and iBatis). Apparently, all we need to do to graduate is to build
up our web presence within the incubator and migrate our bug database.

Community building efforts - Earlier efforts are bearing fruit: IBM Is
now contributing regularly to development via committer Elias Torres,
who implemented weblog entry tagging support in Roller 3.1. Dave
Johnson presented is Roller "primer for new users and contributors"
talk at ApacheCon US 2006 in Austin, TX.


=== Solr ===
Solr is a Lucene based search server supporting XML/HTTP APIs, faceted
search, highlighting, caching and replication.  Solr entered
incubation in January 2006.

Top items to resolve before graduation:
 * Go through the process of making a release
 * Continue building a diverse community

Community
 * Solr continues to see increased adoption and very positive feedback
   and contributions from a growing community: 195 solr-user
   subscribers and 95 solr-dev.
 * Patches from 10 different non-CNET contributors have been committed.
 * ApacheCon US 2006: "Faceted Searching with Apache Solr" session,
   Solr incubator talk, Lucene BOF
 * Other Presentations like "Subversion and Solr - Your Next Content
   Repository?" and "Solr and Faceted Search"
 * Integration packages (such as acts_as_solr maintained by others at
   rubyforge)

Code
 * New built-in simple faceted search capabilities without the need
   for custom code.
 * Output XML via XSL transformer, compressed fields, improved
   parameter handling, more querying options and performance optimizations.

=== stdcxx ===

Code

The most recent release of stdcxx, version 4.1.3, was published in
January 2006. The next release, tentatively numbered 4.2, is expected
to be published in the March 2007 timeframe. All code is licensed
under the Apache license version 2.

=== Synapse ===

Accepted into the Incubator August 2005.

Synapse is a robust, lightweight implementation of a highly scalable
and distributed service mediation framework based on Web services
specifications

We are making good progress on these three issues:

  1. Increase mailing list discussions - mailing list discussions up
     significantly
  2. Growth of community - getting some good input from users. There
     was a good session at ApacheCon, and also 3 sessions on Synapse
     at the Colorado Software Summit with good attendance and feedback
     at all three.
  3. Diversity of committers - we have diversity factor 3 currently and
     patches/contributions from at least two others

Synapse development continues apace, have agreed a release plan for a
0.90 release and are working to get that out in the near future.
There has been some discussion with the Jakarta HttpComponents people
to use their upcoming NIO and async http code within Synapse (post the
0.90 release).  In October a new committer, Ruwan Linton, was voted
in. A Synapse blog has been started and there have been presentations
at Apachecon US and at the Colorado Software Summit.

=== Tuscany ===

Tuscany provides infrastructure for developing service-oriented
applications.

Tuscany is still focusing on community building. We added four new
committers, Venkat Krishnan, Luciano Resende, Ignacio Silva-Lepe and
Rajith Attapattu. We also have others actively contributing,
particularly in the areas of Declarative DAS, BPEL, JMS, SCA Policy
and OSGi integration.

In addition, we have had a lot of development activity:

 * C++ M2 was released
 * DAS M2 release candidate was submitted to the IPMC for vote and is
   currently underway
 * A SDO M2 release candidate was submitted to the IMPMC for vote and
   is currently underway
 * A Java M2 release candidate is currently being worked on and
   will hopefully be submitted soon to the IPMC for vote

Our top two issues to resolve are:

 1. Increasing community diversity. A significant number of
    committers work for one vendor. We are making efforts to attract
    individual contributors in addition to normal avenues (helping on
    lists with questions, etc.)  including presenting at conferences
    (ApacheCon) and webinars.

 2. Preparation for graduation needs to start including a discussion
    of what timeframe is appropriate

=== UIMA ===

Accepted into the Incubator 10/06.

UIMA is a component framework for the analysis of unstructured content
such as text, audio and video.

There was some discussion on incubator-general about changing the name
of the project to something that's not an acronym and does not have a
history outside of Apache.  The final consensus though was that the
arguments for keeping the name outweighed the ones for changing, so
we're sticking with it.

After the naming discussion was settled, we started getting the
infrastructure set up:

 * Mailing lists set up
 * SVN repository created
 * Apache, SVN, Jira accounts for committers (mostly done)
 * Initial code drop checked in after receipt of software grant,
   Apache license headers inserted
 * Initial version of website created

Our priorities for the next few weeks:

 * Finish infrastructure set up, get settled in with Apache
 * Work on our (maven2) build
 * Work on our website, document our build etc.
 * Start directing our existing user base to Apache to attract some
   early adopters
 * Discuss ways to attract new committers

=== Wicket ===

Web development framework focusing on pure OO coding, making the
creation of new components very easy. Wicket entered the incubator in
October 2006.

==== October report ====

Top three items to resolve -

 * Remove a LGPL date picker component from Wicket-extensions
 * Work out how community is going to manage releases (e.g should we
   release current maintenance branches at SourceForge? 1.2.3->SF,
   1.3->ASF, 2.0->ASF)
 * Settle into ASF context more

Community aspects:
 * All bar one of Wicket's SourceForge committers have come over to
   Apache
 * About to vote in our first new committer since starting incubation
 * PPMC is starting to explore setting up project guidelines, for
   example should committer votes be done in private/public; should all
   committers be on PPMC or not)

Code aspects:
 * Working on completing 1.2.3 release - last release to be done at
   SourceForge - before 1.3 development starts. 1.3 likely an ASF
   release
 * Work continues steadily on 2.0, also expected to be an ASF release

Licensing:
 * Need to remove/resolve a LGPL dependency in Wicket-extensions on
   a date picker component

Infrastructure:
 * All ICLAs are signed, all accounts created, and all karma granted
   (still need to get ICLA from one chap who didn't come to ASF, and
   for other contributors that may need one)
 * Subversion repository successfully imported into ASF repo by Garrett
   Rooney (many thanks). All development work is now taking place in
   ASF repo.
 * dev, private and commits email lists moved to incubator. All
   development work is happening on these lists
 * user list remains on SourceForge for the time being (while
   development settles in. May move over to ASF once we've done a real
   ASF release).
 * Wicket Wiki ( http://www.wicket-wiki.org.uk/wiki/index.php) has
   been ported across to Confluence ( http://cwiki.apache.org/WICKET/)
 * JIRA has been set up and bugtracking is now happening there. A
   SourceForge->JIRA importer has been written, but not yet executed
   on Wicket issues.

==== November report ====

Top three items to resolve

 * Remove a LGPL date picker component from Wicket-extensions
 * Make the code base license policy compliant
 * Settle into ASF context more

Community aspects:
 * Voted in our first new committer since starting incubation:
   Alistair Maw
 * Development list gets more activity

Code aspects:
 * Performed Wicket 1.2.3 release at sourceforge.net
 * Work on 1.3 has started
 * Work continues steadily on 2.0
 * 1.3 and 2.0 are marked Apache releases

Licensing:
 * Started work on removing/replacing LGPL date picker component
   from extensions
 * Started to replace License headers in source files
 * Discussion on css/javascript/html file license headers. Wicket
   contains and distributes many (small) css, javascript and html
   files that are also downloaded to the browser. Point of dispute is
   the fact that the license is larger than several of the files, and
   that it increases the download sizes of resources for all users of
   Wicket applications.

Infrastructure:
 * Work has started to generate the website using confluence

=== XAP ===
XAP is a declarative framework for building, deploying and maintaining
Ajax-based rich internet applications with the goal of dramatically
simplifying Ajax application development. XAP entered incubation in
May 2006.

Top three items to resolve before graduation:

  * Bring the codebase to a level that contributors can make
    contributions without significant pain;
  * Create a XAP incubating release with proper packaging and quality
  * Engage a higher level of community activity and contribution

Community
  * Various discussions on the XAP dev list on technical issues such
    as application initialization and DOM model;
  * Attended ApacheCon and gave a lightening talk on XAP
  * A session called "Introduction to XAP" was presented at AjaxWorld
    Conference and Ajax Experience conference at Boston
  * Various third party expressed interest in learning more about XAP,
    but complained that not easy to get infomation and not easy to
    figure out what XAP code does.

Code
 * Achieved milestone 3: added more widgets and streamlined
   initialization
 * Various bug submission and JS unit tests submitted by Trevor Oldak
 * Update demo applications with improved performance
 * Working towards the next milestone: more widgets and some appealing
   demos to attract more developers

Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Maven Project

Things are going well with the Maven project, but we have noticed that
we are have noticed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to
absorb user submitted patches. As a result we have opened up a part of
the Maven SVN for all Apache committers where they can contribute in a
more effective way. Managing patches has become overwhelming so we are
encouraging people to work in the Maven sandbox where it is easier for
us to integrate contributor works.

Over the last quarter we have moved Maven's central repository from
Ibibilio to a machine hosted by Contegix. As part of this move two
proposals are outstanding for the board and I hope to get to them
before the end of the month so that they can be voted on during the
next board meeting. They are:

- A proposal is still pending for the board on the use of the Maven
  trademark at maven.org
- A proposal is still pending for the inclusion of Contegix as part
  of the official Apache infrastructure

We are currently voting for a logo for the Archiva subproject, which
is of a similar style to the existing logos.

New Projects
----------------------

No new projects have been started or imported, but we have recently
started a discussion about bringing the NMaven project from
SourceForge over to the Maven project. NMaven deals with the specifics
of Maven and .NET.

New PMC Member
----------------------

We have added Jesse McConnell and Joakim Erdfelt to the Maven PMC.

New Committers
----------------------

We have add Dan Fabulich as a committer on Maven and the Maven
plugins.

We have created a special group for documentation/site committers.
Wendy Smoak has been added as a site committer.

Henri Yandell has been added as an Archiva committer.

Releases
----------------------

We have had numerous releases of plugins, but no major releases of
Maven itself. Maven 2.0.5 will come out shortly, Maven 2.1 is in the
works for early January, a beta of Archiva and Continuum 1.1 will also
be out shortly.

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Shale Project

Overview
-------------

The Apache Shale TLP was created in June 2006 to further the development 
of the Shale Framework, a web application framework built on top of
JavaServer Faces.  This is our latest quarterly report.

PMC and Committer Changes
-------------------------------------------- 

We have added two new committers this quarter:

* David Geary, who has worked on Shale code when it was part of the 
  Struts project

* Rahul Alkolkar, who has made substantial contributions (particularly in 
  the Dialog Manager area, where one implementation is based on his work 
  in the Commons SCXML project)

Current Development Activities
--------------------------------------------

This quarter, we have focused on several major areas of work, in 
preparation for what is hoped to be a release that can be voted GA quality:

* Per many requests from the user community, split the
  functionality supported by Shale into finer grained individual
  modules, so users can pick and choose which combinations 
  of functionality they prefer.

* Improve the quality and organization of the web site documentation
  and user guide information, including migrating it to the corresponding
  submodules (we use Maven2's website generation technology). 

* Replace the original dialog manager implementation with a two tier
  API that addresses the major functional limitations of the original
  design (such as only supporting a single window or frame), plus
  added pluggable back end support for the state manager engine.
  Two implementations are provided by default -- a "basic" one that
  is functionally compatible with the previous support, and an
  advanced one that uses Commons SCXML to manage execution. 

* The inevitable bugfix and minor enhancements endeavors.

Because it is likely that some of the Shale dependencies (such as
Standalone Tiles from Struts) will not be completed yet -- they are
gonig through a major refactoring cycle at the moment -- we are 
considering posting an upcoming release where different modules
might have different quality grades, so that the parts of Shale that
are GA quality can stop suffering from users waiting for a "final"
release before they get started in earnest.

Community
-----------------

At ApacheCon US, we announced the winner of a logo contest, to have
a nice website logo (and a "powered by" image) that would be made 
available for use by developers using Shale.  The winning artist has
attempted to submit his ICLA via fax, but it has not yet been recorded
(he's in Egypt, which might be part of the issue there).

The Shale developer community continues to operate harmoniously, 
both within the project and with other projects (such as Struts and
MyFaces) where there is substantial overlap in committer base, and
many of the committers are active on multiple projects simultaneously.
There are no community issues to raise to the Board's attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Harmony project

Currently, we have no issues requiring board attention.

We are ready to switch our infrastructure to that of
a TLP - website URL is ready, group created, and we
expect to bring that live this week.

Of interest was Sun's recent announcement of their
implementation of Java SE licensed under GPLv2.  As
advocates of open source Java SE, we think this is a
positive thing and validate our work for the last 18
months - more open source Java is great.  While their
choice of license precludes immediate collaboration
between the projects, we've already floated one idea
of how we can work together - asking Sun to relicense
the javac compiler under CDDL so Harmony can
redistribute - and we will keep exploring other ideas.

We have added one new committer, Nadya Morozova, who has
been doing lots of good work in the area of our
documentation and website.  Currently this hasn't been
announced on the dev list as we're waiting for ICLA.

We continue to make progress - we have achieved 95%
completeness on the class library for Java SE 5 and
the DRLVM continues to improve in performance,
stability and completeness.

Attachment W: Apache Labs Proposed Bylaws

                  Apache Labs Bylaws
                  ------------------

 Executive Summary
 -----------------

The Apache Software Foundation is well known for its motto
"community is more important than code" and has designed
its incubation facilities accordingly.

While healthy and diverse open development communities
provide a very efficient solution for self-sustaining,
long-lasting and well-adapting software development
practices, the creation and bootstrap of such community
is normally a long and emotionally expensive process.

Moreover, in order to provide a seed to grow and ground
discussions on technical levels, the ASF incubation rules
require the "podlings" to join the incubation process with
an established and working codebase.

While this is a tremendous benefit for the incubator (because
setting the bar high avoids it to have to do the filtering and
dissipating the negative energy that would develop in such a
process), it also implies that the ability for the ASF to
"innovate" is left at the top level projects that graduated
out of incubation.

Several of these projects provide places for their committers to
work on innovative ideas (these are normally called "sandboxes"
or "whiteboards"). Unfortunately, such efforts are constrained by
the project bylaws, which can limit the degree of innovation
that such efforts can exhibit.

Apache Labs are the place where ASF committers can work on
innovative, blue-sky and off-the-wall ideas, without having to
worry about fitting in an existing project bylaw or building a 
community around it, but unlike other external venues that 
can offer similar hosting services, as a place where fellow 
committers can offer suggestions and help.



 Guidelines
 ----------

 - The Apache Labs project infrastructure is composed of the 
   following parts:

    o) a zone
    o) a virtual host (http://labs.apache.org/)
    o) a SVN repository (http://svn.apache.org/asf/repos/labs/)
    o) three mailing lists
         - labs@labs.apache.org
         - commits@labs.apache.org (this receives the svn commits diffs)
         - private@labs.apache.org
    o) a lab registry (a collection of machine-readable descriptors)

 - Every ASF committer has both read and write access to the entire 
   Labs SVN repository.
   
 - Everybody can subscribe and post messages to "labs@labs.apache.org".
   Posters are suggested to use '[labname]' prefix in their 
   email subjects to give proper context to the email threads.

 - Everybody can subscribe to "commits@labs.apache.org", but only 
   automated agents can post to it (svn commit diffs, cron jobs, etc..).

 - The Labs PMC members (and all ASF members) 
   can subscribe and post to private@labs.apache.org,
   everybody else can post but their messages will be moderated.

 - Every ASF committer can ask for one or more labs. The creation of
   the lab requires a PMC lazy consensus vote
   (at least three +1 and no -1, 72 hours).

 - If approved, the ASF committer will create the lab on his/her own
   and register the lab's descriptor in the lab registry. The
   committer that asks for the lab becomes known as that lab's PI
   (principal investigator). The PI is the sole responsible
   for keeping their lab descriptor up-to-date. Failure to do so
   can result in lab completion.

 - Labs are prohibited from making releases.

 - The Labs PMC will not ask for commit access for people that 
   are not already ASF committers.

 - The Labs PMC will not ask for lab-specific mail lists.

 - Each Labs PMC member can resign at any time. The PMC can elect
   another ASF committer as Labs PMC member at any time. Only ASF
   committers can become members of the Labs PMC. The elected ASF
   committer reserves the right to reject the nomination without
   justification.

 - A Lab PI can resign and select another committer as PI just by
   communicating so to the PMC. It becomes effective if the new PI
   accepts.

 - The Apache Labs will welcome existing lab-like efforts (sandboxes,
   whiteboards) from existing ASF TLPs to become labs.

 - Changes to the Apache Labs bylaws require a 2/3 vote from the PMC
   members.



 Lab Lifecycle
 -------------
 
 - A lab can have four states:

     o  Active
         [activity is happening]

     o  Idle
         [activity is paused but
          it will be resumed in the future]

     o Promoted
         [lab started incubation]

     o Completed
         [activity has been completed and
          unlikely to resume in the future]         

 - The lab PI can change the state of the lab from 'active' to 'idle' 
   and back at any time, just by updating the descriptor.
   
 - The Labs PMC can change the state of a lab with a majority vote.

 - In any vote when a lab state is changed, and in such votes only,
   the lab's PI's vote will be counted along with the PMC members' 
   to form majority.

 - When a lab is "idled", the descriptor is changed accordingly and a
   boilerplate disclaimer is placed in the README file.

 - When a lab is re-"activated", the descriptor is changed accordingly 
   and a the boilerplate disclaimer is removed from the README file.
   
 - When a lab is "promoted", the files are moved over to the 
   incubation area.
   
 - When a lab is "completed", the lab is archived and removed from SVN.

     

 Guidelines Rationale
 --------------------
 
The voting guidelines are not established to induce rigid process, 
but rather to avoid that a single negative vote can act as a veto. We 
expect that most votes will resolve themselves with lazy consensus 
(three +1 and no -1). In case a -1 appears, it is good practice to 
try to reach a compromise that results in the removal of such -1. In 
case such a  compromise cannot be reached, the majority vote takes 
place. Established social practices throughout the foundation suggest 
that such cases are very rare.

The reason why the lab PI is included in the 'state change' vote is to 
act as arbiter in case the PMC is undecided. It also gives the feeling 
of participating in the decision-making process.

The reason why the Labs PMC has the power to vote a 'state change' even 
if the lab PI is in disagreement is to allow the PMC to promote those 
labs that become too active even if the labs PI and participants would 
rather stay in the labs.

The reason why the Labs PMC has to perform a lazy vote on the 
establishment of a lab is to provide oversight with a minimal overhead. 
Such oversight is meant to avoid the abuse of labs as 'personal backups'
or 'dumping grounds', which would be off-topic in the Labs' mission, 
or use labs as a way to 'fork' existing efforts and route around
incubation practices. It also allows the PMC to allow labs only if 
they have a functional machine-readable descriptor, which allows the 
automation of the information gathering about the labs.

The reason why the Labs PMC cannot create new mailing lists or institute
new committers is to avoid labs to become a way for people to 'route 
around' the incubator (and also to avoid add more work to 
'infrastructure')

The reason why Labs are prohibited from making releases is to simplify
operation and avoid the legal oversight associated with the release 
process and to avoid labs from becoming ways to 'route around' the 
incubator.

The reason why Labs have a fixed number of mailing list is to force 
people to watch over other's people's shoulders, to avoid mail-list 
creation load on infrastructure and to provide a comfort threshold that 
successful labs can easily trigger as an indicator that they might be 
ready for promotion into the incubator.

The reason why all committers have write-access to all labs is to avoid
adding infrastructure costs and to simplify collaboration. The use of 
version control, the selected nature of committership and the existence 
of a single communication channel guarantee minimal risks and collision 
costs in doing so.

The reason why labs must have a machine-readable descriptor is to allow
automation of lab metadata gathering and web site publishing in order to
scale to hundreds of labs and provide more effective oversight.
