 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       I have been travelling for the past month and have not been
       involved with much Apache business.

    B. President [Jim]

       The big news the last month has been the OpenOffice.org code and
       trademark donation from Oracle in anticipation of the OpenOffice.org
       podling. This created quite a bit of discussion and debate, both
       within and without the foundation, with quite a bit of FUD being
       slung externally.

       I keynoted at the Open Repositories 2011 conference in Austin, TX.
       The topic was "Open Source: It's not just for IT anymore" and the
       focus was regarding the "Apache Way" and how we build communities.

       Doug announced the ASF member's meeting for 12 July, 2010, at
       17:00 UTC (http://s.apache.org/KUR). I will be helping Doug setup
       and coordinate the meeting. Doug has already sent out the Call For
       Nominations for both new members as well as the board.

       There are no issues from a foundation perspective.

    Resolution 7E was approved unanimously by roll call vote.

 8. Discussion Items
 
    A. PMC Brand requirements followup and tracking.

      There was a general discussion about reporting requirements of projects
      with regard to branding. Board members need to review all project reports 
      and it's a burden to review multiple paragraphs on each project. There
      must be a better way for Shane to track progress without burdening every
      board member.

      AI Shane: work on a proposal to track status

    B. Git @Apache: good progress has been made but should we make
       a decision about making it a first-class citizen? Might need budget
       for manpower and/or equipment. 

      AI Jim: follow up with infra on git status

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    * Sam: find out what's going on with Bluesky
              Status: Completed. Bluesky is not moving in the right direction.

    * Greg: discuss release policy with Lab folks
              Status: Not started.

    * Greg: follow up with Synapse re no releases since 2008
              Status: Not started.

    * Greg: follow up with HBase to clarify the "developer release" term.

    * Doug: Suggest to Noel that JSPWiki needs a nudge.
              Status: Not started.

    * Greg: Find out whether Shindig can use internal Hudson.

    * Jim: work with EA on a calendar (e.g. due dates for external reports)
           Status: In progress

    * Jim: arrange for a public announcement of new members
           Status: Done.

    * Greg: follow up with Roller PMC chair to improve report

    * Jim: move xml project to attic
           Status: Not done

    * Philip: follow up on /dist with Perl PMC
              Status: NEW

    * Greg: find out the status of the Continuum security release.

    * Bertrand: follow up to move Xalan to the Attic.
           Status: In progress

    * Doug: set up next members' meeting.
              Status: Done.

10. Unfinished Business

11. New Business

    Google has asked for some information on the Oracle lawsuit, without
    going through the exercise of serving Apache with a subpoena.
    Board consensus is that we should give Google whatever we have already
    given Oracle. No need for formal process.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

Nothing to concern the board at this time.  

There has been steady usage activity of currently-licensed TCKs.  ASF
community is self-supporting on maintenance of our TCK repo.  There has
been some discussion between MyFaces and Oracle re self-certification and
the MyFaces PMC is handling it.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================

The Domain Name Branding Policy passed the [VOTE] and is final; the Tomcat PMC 
has already used this to work with the tomcatexpert.com domain holders to 
ensure their branding gives proper credit to our communities. 

Emailed pmcs@ reminding them to follow up and report on their branding progress, 
including linking to the newly published PMC Branding Responsibilities [1] 
and Apache Trademark Reporting Guidelines [2].  Several PMCs are also now using 
our sample contact letter for third parties using our marks [3].

A member erroneously forwarded a trademarks@ message to their employer, 
reportedly not realizing the list is privately archived.   Sent a 
"trademarks@ private list etiquette" email to remind subscribers.

Awaiting feedback on legal-internal@ of the status of (re-)starting trademark 
registrations for Apache and Hadoop.  Note the registration for Apache was 
temporarily withdrawn while counsel work with a third party on a consent 
agreement for longstanding previous (non-infringing) uses.

Thanks to Jukka for starting work on a feather with TM.

External Requests
=================

The Maven PMC continues to work productively with Sonatype on an MOU for 
the maven.org domain name and its use.

The Tomcat PMC is doing a great job of policing their brand, and serves as 
an example of best practices.  Note that they have an outstanding request to 
legal-internal@ needing assistance in contacting the unreachable developers 
of an iPhone app.

Working with the Hadoop PMC on a number of third parties using our Hadoop 
mark in a wide variety of new ways.

Yahoo! reports that they have completed updating all websites with the old 
"Yahoo! Distribution of Hadoop" naming which was requested earlier.

Received information on some existing OpenOffice.org (a podling starting in 
the incubator) and Open Office (an unrelated product) trademarks, which 
trademarks@ will work with legal-internal@ to track when the podling is created.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

SPONSORSHIP
My time was very limited this month, so not too much new.  I processed 
paperwork for Yahoo and Talend's payments.  Also communicating with Google 
to sort out the paperwork for their renewal;  I expect we'll be getting 
payment for that renewal this month.  I'm still trying to figure out why a
wire transfer from PSW bounced.  I started reaching out to AMD and Intuit 
about renewals.

DONATIONS
A question on the list came up about donating to a specific project, and
someone stepped in answered that donations are general. (Thanks!)

MISC
I had follow-up emails from someone looking to build relationships with
OfBiz and directed them to that project's mailing lists.

And I discussed possible get together with Sally and Shane at either OSCON
or sometime in Maryland or Boston.  I plan to get to OSCON this summer and 
meet up with sponsors when possible.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

N. Team: ASF executive assistant Melissa Warnkin is working with Sally Khudairi
on pulling together some of the items needed for the ASF Annual Report, and
will be onsite to help man the ASF booth at OSCON in July.


I. Budget: with the new Fiscal Year budget approved, several expenditures will
be charged against the M&P budget this month, including HALO contract kickoff
retainer, as well as OSCON-related expenses, and clipping fees (trying to set
up a subscription to align with the ASF fiscal year).


II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally has been in communications
with Shane and Serge regarding a possible face-to-face meeting over the
summer. She has also been in regular contact with several sponsors regarding
their organizing/sponsoring/hosting Apache-focused events (conferences and
developer/community outreach). Sally has also been working with Greg Stein to
connect with a sponsor regarding publicity at the platinum sponsorship level,
and will be forwarding new contacts for a sponsor for renewal this Fall. 


III. Press Releases: we issued the following announcement over the PR NewsWire
service:

- May 25: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache Libcloud as a
  Top-Level Project

information.


V. Media Relations: Sally spent a tremendous amount of time working with
members of Oracle and IBM's technical and PR teams in advance of the
OpenOffice.org submission to the Apache Incubator, and continues to counsel
relevant parties during the incubation voting period. Both the Apache Libcloud
announcement and Incubator blog post garnered great press interest and media
coverage (70 articles alone for the OpenOffice.org Incubator submission). We
received nearly 600 Twitter mentions, and continue to field press queries on
these and related topics such as JCP. We haven't issued any statements to the
press under embargo over the past reporting period, but intend to resume doing
so when possible.


VI. Analyst Relations: we received a request from RedMonk for a regular
briefing schedule, considering the number of activities at the Foundation.
Sally is also considering holding a "Project Publicity /Analyst Briefing
Workshop" in lieu of formal Media Training at the Hackathon (both days) during
ApacheCon this November. There is also a chance of litmus-testing this program
at OSCON in July.


VII. ApacheCon liaison: with the conference program close to being sorted,
Sally will be working on conference marketing and publicity tactics;
early-bird registration will be closing mid-summer. Sally also worked with
Cloudera, ConCom, and ApacheCon teams regarding a scheduling conflict with
Hadoop World, which is taking place the same week as ApacheCon.


VIII. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally is organizing the
ASF booth at OSCON's "dot-org pavilion"; there is a chance that we will be
located in the "OSCON Java" section. Details forthcoming once confirmed.

- 25-29 July: OSCON (+ OSCON Data/OSCON Java), Portland, Oregon


IX. PR Newswire account: we have 10 pre-paid press releases with PRNewswire
through 3 March 2012.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

Last call for HTML5 is proceeding, and the results of the Advisory Council
license survey have not been published.  Nothing major to report on any of the
other ASF activities at the W3C.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Busy month; major items include responding to the Oracle subpoena and
receiving a software grant from Oracle for OpenOffice.org.  Larry is leading
discussions concerning transferring the associated trademarks.

Aaron is leading the response to the subpoena.  He has produced an initial set
of documents and is still evaluating more, including from board-private.  Whom
we choose to disclose this information to beyond what we are legally required
to do is up to us, and the subject of a sometimes heated debate.

There are clear signs of animosity between some of the participants on legal
internal, and that is inhibiting the use of the mailing list for discussions.
I am taking steps to correct this.

Additionally, we have gotten a similar request for information from Google.
Instead of pursuing a subpoena they have simply made a request.  As we were
not the ones that required Oracle to issue a subpoena, we can simply provide
the requested information or require Google to provide a subpoena.  My
recommendation is that we simply provide the information.

Sadly, Larry has reported that i4i prevailed over Microsoft and the standard
of "clear and convincing" evidence remains the standard of proof required to
invalidate a patent.

Other discussions include Travel/Medical insurance for conference attendees
and how PMCs are to deal with patent claims.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For May 2011: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

1      Support question
2      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
1      Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
2      Vulnerability reports
       1      [continuum, via security@apache.org]
       1      [camel, via security@apache.org]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

General
-------
There has been lots of discussions this month about the Third Party Event
Branding policy. We now have a published events calendar, a section in the
policy about date clashes, a section on how to apply, and committee guidance +
example emails for implementing it.

One event has been approved under the policy, and we're expecting applications
from two more shortly.

A discussion is also on-going about what lists we should have, and how much we
can push to public lists. Once this has completed, we'll better document what
should go where, and then do a push to get more people involved through
subscribing to lists of interest to them.

ApacheCon NA11
--------------
All selected speakers have now been notified, and most have accepted.  Backup
speakers should be being contacted shortly where needed. Some announcements
have gone out from/about accepted talks. The provisional schedule should be
posted shortly.

The speaker selection/notification/acceptance/declining process hasn't been as
smooth as hoped, partly because not all the required management features were
delivered from crowdvine in time. Shared Google Docs has come to the rescue
here, and the planners have done some great work making sure not too many balls
were dropped... Going from a selected list of talks to accepted speakers has
taken more volunteer energy than hoped though, which is something to be aware
of for the future.

Otherwise we seem to be currently slight ahead of where we've been in past
years.

BarCamps
--------
BarCampApacheSpain has been approved for Seville for Saturday 8th October, and
announcements should go out soon (when the organisers are ready)

BarCampApacheOxford is aiming to officially open signups this Wednesday (the
event is in September). Several potential future BarCamp organisers have joined
the organisers list to help and learn.

Discussions are on-going about potentially funding future BarCampApache
organisers to attend Oxford to learn from the process. Sally has kindly agreed
to fund one of the three applicants, and it's expected that the decision on
concom funding for the other two will happen shortly.

No other BarCamps are currently on the horizon.

Future ApacheCons
-----------------
No progress has been made on deciding what we might want from a producer for a
potential NA12 commercial event, and it's unlikely we'll do anything until the
lists are all sorted.

We're waiting to hear back from a potential European venue about a possible
community (non-commercial) conference. Once we hear about that, we can either
start discussing how it'd work, or where we might host such an event instead.
Private discussions with committers at Berlin Buzzwords shows there's strong
volunteer energy in running such an event in Europe though, which is positive.

Committee
---------
A vote on the new VP was held, and the only candidate (Nick Burch) was
approved. 

Once we sort out what lists we'll be running, and announce them, we'll
hopefully get quite a few more committers involved. At that point we may
well propose some new people for committee membership.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Upgraded MoinMoin wiki to 1.8.8.

Mark Thomas Upgraded Jira to 4.3.4.

Niklas Upgraded Jenkins to 1.413 and moved it to a more stable URL
(removing hudson from the URL).

Took another whack at cleaning up /dist dirs.  Current status is appended
to the end of the report.

VP visited OSUOSL to survey the racks.

Looking to purchase additional RAM for sigyn (which keeps panicing
because of lack of RAM).

More XSS vulns reported against modules.apache.org, which we don't
physically host.

Ran into a snag while placing the order for the replacement backup
system.  At this point we need the treasurer's sign-off on a Bank &
Trades agreement with Intervision who will subsequently provide us
with Net-30 terms for the order.

OSUOSL has notified us they are running low on cooling capacity, which
may affect our ability to host new machines at their datacenter.

OSUOSL wants us to purchase a switch to rationalize their cabling
system for our 3rd rack.  We plan to accommodate them once the backup
system has been purchased.

We are purchasing a warranty extension contract from Dell for selene
and phoebe, our Geronimo TCK build hosts in Traci.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General:
--------

No changes to the Committee.

The mailing list has started to perk up now that the run up to ApacheCon
has started.

A brief discussion has started as to whether or not 'already accepted
speakers' (by planners/concom) should have any kind of extra 'bonus'
points or any other favoritism when it comes to them applying for 
travel assistance. (Sometimes we do not know in advance if they are
speakers or not). Consensus is that our procedures do not need to 
change and no extra attention to speakers applications (known or not)
will occur. Being a speaker and all that it entails should ensure
the sufficient points in the normal application process.

Thanks to the EA for resolving our created Jira issues regarding the
gathering of financial information of past events.
A new issue has been opened for the EA regarding the subject of 
travel/medical insurance that has come up before - we just need to know
the best way to do things regarding waivers etc. 

Ok, we've had an official reply now and it looks like we do not need 
any waiver in place for travel/medical insurance and we can consider
that if we do provide travel insurance, it will be purely on a needs
basis like the rest of the travel/accommodation/entrance and will be
assessed accordingly. The question will be asked if they want help with
travel insurance. We will recommend but not require insurance to be 
in place.

ApacheCon NA 7th-11th November 2011 Vancouver BC:
-------------------------------------------------

Applications opened on the 6th of this month and run through to the
applications closed date of July 8th 2011. We have allowed for a
late and short opening/closing period around end of september for any
late deciders.

Our 3 judges are Gavin, Nick and Matt - all of whom will be sharing the
rest of the duties for the event - liaising, advertising, booking, 
shepherding etc etc.

We have received our pricing from the producers.

Apache Retreat Ireland 13th-16th May 2011 Knockree:
----------------------------------------------------

Knockree was an overall success says our man on the ground Nick, and
was impressed with our two TAC attendees. Our two TAC attendees cost
$1,971.00 for travel, with lodgings and food paid for by themselves. 
No other TAC costs were involved.

Other Events:
-------------

No news about any other events happening at this time.


Budget 2010/2011:
-----------------

Our Budget and what we spent for the last year is held in the private repo.

The budget is complete but still open for any adjustments.


Budget 2011/2012:
-----------------

Our budget for this coming year is now open and the file is at.

The FY has just begun so nothing much to see so far, but keep an eye on
it if you wish to track our expenditure throughout the coming year.
Additions to the ApacheCon NA section for instance will be added as known.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache APR Project

Releases
--------

After just over a year with no releases in the current stable APR series,
1.4.4 and 1.4.5 were released in quick succession, first to resolve a
vulnerability affecting some APR applications, then to resolve regressions
in 1.4.4.

The current stable APR-Util series also had two releases in quick
succession -- 1.3.11 and 1.3.12.

Community
---------

New PMC members or committers: none

As of June 10, sixteen bugs and enhancements have been opened during
the current quarter, but the total number of outstanding bugs and 
enhancements, 126, is almost exactly the same as last quarter,
indicating that at least a moderate amount of attention is being paid
to these reports.

Mailing list activity has grown significantly since last quarter, 
due mostly to a small set of topics which generated a lot of discussion.

Development
-----------

Efforts in support of APR-Util 1.next and APR 2.0 have been revived
in recent weeks.  APR and APR-Util have been largely in maintenance
mode for several years, but there are some new features, as well as
a major packaging change, awaiting release for some time.

Issues
------

There are no board-level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Archiva Project

Releases
--------

* Archiva 1.3.5 was released on May 17, 2011 as mitigation to the multiple
CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery) and XSS (Cross-site Scripting) security
vulnerabilities reported by Riyaz Ahemed Walikar of Microland Ltd., India. 
The CVE IDs for these security issues are CVE-2011-1026 and CVE-2011-1077, 
respectively.

* For the CSRF fix in the 1.3.5 release, Struts' token tag was used and 
was added in the affected forms and actions. If the token included in the 
request does not match the one in the server, the request is rejected. 

* For the XSS fix in the 1.3.5 release, the form validation across all the
pages in the Archiva webapp was tightened so that possible XSS scripts are
caught immediately.

Community
---------

* Olivier Lamy was added as a committer in May.

* Community activity has picked up with repeated interest from people 
involved in Apache ACE. However, overall, activity remains low and the 
number of active committers is low.

Development
-----------

* There have been discussions in the dev list about the possibility of
enhancing Archiva to act as an OSGi Bundle Repository. In the discussion, it
was suggested by Jean-Baptiste Onofre (a developer from Apache Karaf and
Apache ACE) that Archiva could provide a RESTful interface to upload bundles
and artifacts as well as a P2P extension interface to download/upload
artifacts. It could also manage the lifecycle of bundles and artifacts such
as staging, promoting, and dropping features.

* There was also a discussion (initiated by Olivier Lamy) regarding
refactoring Archiva trunk. The planned refactorings are: moving the UI to
another framework, removal of all plexus components, and replace or overhaul
the security system used (which is Redback). Removal of the plexus 
components is already on-going in trunk.

Issues
------

No board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------

  (OK, other than 'tm' symbols)
* Further work on the website styling on hold pending our evaluation of Apache CMS 
  as a replacement for Confluence.

Community

* Mailing list activity is normal.
* Christian Grobmeier announced on the developer mailing list he has agreed to writing 
  two technical articles on Cayenne for JavaMagazine which should be published this fall.
  We will continue helping Christian by answering questions he has on Cayenne.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

General
=======
 Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
 responsiveness on both dev and user lists.  New activity on some
 previously dormant components (graph, digester, validator, discovery)
 and work on major new new directions in active components (net, math,
 dbcp, pool, lang) has made this an active quarter in Commons.

 Work to bring Commons web pages into compliance with ASF branding
 guidelines continues, as we complete the release of Commons Skin, the
 Maven site resources shared by all Commons components.

 We also need to finalize our approach to Commons-specific trademarks
 and logos.  We seem to have come to consensus that adding TMs  to the
 text-only "logos" that we use on component web pages is acceptable.
 Work to modify the logos has begun.

 Incubation of OGNL has begun and the incubating community is using the 
 Commons  mailing lists.
 
 A proposal to extend "dormant" status to include Commons proper components
 is being discussed and refined.  Currently, we classify sandbox components
 as "dormant" when they are no longer active and the proposal is to extend
 this designation to include Commons proper components.  It is not meant
 or allowed to be a replacement for the Attic.

 The dormant sandbox "graph" component has been revived.  Anyone interested
 in hacking on a Java implementation of the graph ADT and associated
 algorithms is encouraged to join the fun.

 The PMC voted to accept a software grant of code developed by Simone
 Tripodi outside the ASF as the basis for a new sandbox component
 related to classpath scanning.  This component may eventually be
 merged into [lang] or it may graduate from the sandbox as a new
 Commons proper component.

 We also agreed to replace the trunk of Commons digester with the
 "digester3" sandbox component.

 The Chair has announced his intention to step down. The PMC are mostly
 trying to dodge the bullet, but at least one brave soul has volunteered,
 so I am sure that when the music stops in the next couple of weeks we will
 have a great new chair identified.  We will aim to draft a resolution to
 rotate the chair for the next board meeting.

 There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  It is
different from "usual" CI servers in that it expects the individual
project builds to succeed; its purpose is to check the integration of
a project with the latest code rather than a fixed version of the
project's dependencies.  If you want a more traditional nightly build
server, Gump is not for you.  Use Gump if you want to know when a
change in your dependencies breaks your project or when your changes
break other projects.

Gump's intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle
that makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

No development activity at all, no issues.

== Issues ==

There are no Board level issues.

== Community ==

The Gump project really consists of two parts, the code base for the
project and the ASF installations[1] running this code base to build
many ASF projects as well as some related projects.

The code base mostly does what its current users need so there isn't
much development going on at all.  No new committers have been added.

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.  There are a few people contributing across all
projects and a few additional people maintaining the metadata of the
projects they are interested in the most.

No changes to the PMC.

All in all the community is pretty small by now and it has been a long
time since a new project has been added to the Gump runs because the
project had asked for it - when we've added new projects over the past
two years the driver has been the Gump community.  It looks as if most
projects are content with the existing vanilla CI options.

== Development ==

None.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Infrastructure ==

The infra team has provided us with a VM to run Gump on top of Apache
Harmony but it is currently not used, we'll hand it back to infra so
it doesn't waste resources.

At one point in time a Gump run on the FreeBSD jail created many core
dumps that filled up the disk space shared by all jails.  Gump is now
set up to not allow core dumps since nobody would want to look at them
anyway.

== Project Branding Requirements ==

We've updated the first sentence of the description to match the
revised requirement.  

Thanks to David Crossley the main site logo now contains a TM and we
are confident we will manage to add a TM to the logo Gump uses in its
reports soon as well.  We believe to meet all other requirements.

== Statistics ==

As of Fri, 10 Jun 2011 the ASF installations check out a bit less than
180 source trees (115 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
less than 800 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes about seven and a
half hours on vmgump or the FreeBSD jail about six and a half hours on
the MacOS X server where more projects fail to build and thus less
time is spent building dependent projects.

Some builds have been removed since the projects moved to the Attic
(regexp, for example) or were unmaintained and always failed to build
anyway.

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ , a
FreeBSD jail at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/public/ and a Mac OS
X Server at http://adam.apache.org/gump/


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

Apache Harmony developers' list remains very quiet at the moment with
only a limited amount of discussion on new directions for the project,
a few specific technical questions, and some day to day housekeeping.

While there was a brief exploration of creating a specialized VM for
Groovy, at this point there is no evidence that the community will rally
around a new goal in absence of a JCK license for Java SE.

Discussions that included the Board and Incubator PMC were held to
decide whether Apache Harmony should move back to the Incubator to help
define a new objective.  The rationale being any new goal should be to
the standard expected of an incubator proposal, including diversity and
mentoring, and that it be done with the oversight of the IPMC.  The
general opinion was that the Harmony PMC could handle such a task just
as well.  If no viable proposals are forthcoming after giving people
plenty of time to consider such, the PMC will propose moving the
project to the Attic.

The PMC have been proactive to the requests for documentation in regards
to the Oracle vs. Google subpoena.  Communications on this subject have
been through the V.P. Legal Affairs.

One security incident was reported to the Apache Harmony private list
regarding a virus scanner warning on one of the project's distributed
binary files. The report was promptly addressed, and concluded to be a
false alarm.

There were no changes to PMC or committer membership during this
reporting period.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Hive Project

Apache Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Apache Hadoop.  It
provides SQL to query and manage data (in the form of tables and
partitions stored in HDFS or external systems) and provides a
metastore containing metadata information about the stored data.

Releases:

No new releases this quarter (0.7.1 is close to release).
0.7.0 released on March 29, 2011.

Community:
* Siying Dong was added as a committer.
* Existing committer Carl Steinbach was added as a PMC member.
* 316 contributors (commented, filed bugs or contributed to
Hive). This was 286 at the last report time (March 2011)

Branding Checklist:

We've only started looking into this since we saw the mail from Shane
Curcuru on May 31.  The Hive PMC will expedite resolution of the
non-conformances below.

* Project Website Basics:  homepage is hive.apache.org [DONE]

* Project Naming And Descriptions: the text in the Hive homepage and
  wiki need to be brought into conformance with the guidelines.
  [NOT STARTED]

* Website Navigation Links: we are missing links for License,
  Sponsorship, and Security.  The "Thanks" link is currently misnamed
  as "Sponsors".  There is a link back to www.apache.org in the
  navbar, but not in the main text.  The navbar contains a Hadoop link
  (along with the Hadoop logo); these are leftovers from when Hive was
  a Hadoop subproject. [NOT STARTED]

* Trademark Attributions:  these need to be added to the homepage.
  [NOT STARTED]

* Logos and Graphics:  the Hive logo (which does not use the Apache
  feather) lacks a TM.  [NOT STARTED]

* Project Metadata:  Hive does not have a DOAP file.  [NOT STARTED]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The Incubator PMC now totals 143 members, with some additional requests
(joining and a resignation) pending.  Recent changes include Peter Royal and
Phil Steitz (pending) dropping off; and Shane Curcuru, Srinath Perera,
Nicolas Lalevee, Marvin Humphrey, Michael McCandless, Nigel Daley, Tommaso
Teofili, Yegor Kozlov, Leif Hedstrom and Steve Loughran joining the PMC.

Certainly the biggest thing in the Incubator this month is the arrival of
OpenOffice.org for Incubation.  OpenOffice.org is going to need significant
help and guidance, with an emphasis on liasoning with other, external,
projects such as LibreOffice.  There is very significant concern regarding
how this project will relate to the rest of the Openoffice.org ecosystem,
and those will need to be carefully addressed.  One of the first challenges
for the project will be deciding its scope.  If it is going to try to be the
old OpenOffice.org, essentially an Apache Licensed "coopetitor" to the
downstream forks; or if it is going to focus on common technologies, release
vanilla binaries for key platforms, and let the downstreams take the primary
role in delivering end-user binaries.  Other issues with respect to
OpenOffice.org may challenge our infrastructure.  There may also be IP
(patent and trademark) issues to address.  But the lengthy and diverse list
of Mentors should be aware of and preparing to address all of the issues.

Despite OpenOffice.org's arrival, and its well than 1000 messages swamping
the mailing list, there was more activity than just that one topic.

BigTop, a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Hadoop
ecosystem, is proposed for Incubation.

Flume -- a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently
collecting,
aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data to scalable data storage
systems such as Apache Hadoop's HDFS -- was voted to enter Incubation.

Sqoop -- a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data between
Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases -- was
voted to enter Incubation.

There is nascent discussion regarding moving Alois and BlueSky to dormant
status.

Airavata

Airavata is a software toolkit currently used to build science gateways but
that has a much wider potential use. It provides features to compose,
manage, execute, and monitor large scale applications and workflows on
computational resources ranging from local clusters to national grids and
computing clouds.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Finish the security paper work needed to import donated code with
cryptographic dependencies.
  2. Engage the community by document existing design, drafting detailed
JIRA tasks defining smaller goals.
  3. Remove incompatible license dependencies and implement over ALV2
compatible libraries.
  4. Simplify the build process and provide simple to use cases.
  5. At least one Apache Incubator release.
  6. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well
aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here:
http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

The interactions to date have been focused on development, and getting the
project started.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Airavata was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on May 7, 2011.

Suresh Marru is pushing forward on the Airavata website. There is also work
going on related to this to define a new Apache Airavata logo. In addition,
Suresh led a development roadmap discussion.

====

ALOIS

The ALOIS project team wrote an private e-mail to its mentors shortly after
the last report. They have told us that due to personal reasons they cannot
keep this project alive and there will be no project activity in near
future. We have agreed to wait until the June 2011 comes up. So far there is
no change in project activity or interest, no e-mails and even no more
private messages. After this report the Incubator-PMC needs to discuss about
retiring this podling. (Christian Grobmeier)

In addition to Christian's report, I'd like to mention that we didn't find
any interest in the project outside of our small group, although we did
quite a lot requests off list. If there would be someone to take over the
project, we would be happy to give a helping hand at the start. (Urs Lerch)

====

BeanValidation

Apache Bean Validation will deliver an implementation of the JSR303 Bean
Validation 1.0 specification. BVAL entered incubation on March 1, 2010.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation.
* Perform successful Releases - Done
* Grow the community and committer base - stale at a medium level
* Decide on graduation target of TLP or subproject - TBD

The BVAL community is still discussing about the 3 possible graduation
scenarios:
* Graduate as TLP
* Graduate as part of Apache Commons
* Graduate under the Geronimo TLP

The codebase is mature and stable, thus there is not much development effort
going on atm. Otoh this means that there are not many developers working
actively on BVAL.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of?
. None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?
. No new committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?
. 0.3-incubating was released on 2011-02-04.

====

Bluesky

This project did not report.  The Incubator PMC will begin discussion to
move the project to dormant status.

====

Etch

Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a
variety of programming languages.

- we got a larger contribution of a UDP Binding from BMW Research / Itestra
via Jira. It enables Signals (~ Publish/Subscribe for Properties) and UDP
Broad- and Multicasting of Etch messages, as well as a proposal for a
mechanism of handling multiple etch client connections on the server via one
stack ("single session"). review is in progress.
- Michael and Holger joined the Apache Retreat in Knockree, Ireland and got
to know other Apache people.
- C++ Binding is currently in development (nothing to publish yet, but it
will come), and a new developer (Martin Veith) will join the Etch team at
BMW Car IT and will contribute code to the project
- fixed some smaller bugs in the C, Java and C# bindings
- transition to new CMS system is on its way, some more copying of existing
text/documentation has to be done
- we are looking forward to more contributions from BMW Research / Itestra
regarding Service Management in the future

future tasks:
- integrate contributed third-party code
- make CMS switch
- C++ binding

====

Gora

Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache
Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Port Gora code and license headers into ASF license headers.
  2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with
infection into existing ASF projects like Nutch and Hadoop.
  3. At least one Gora incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Ever since the 0.1-incubating release, it's been kind of quiet. We did have
a couple users (Yves Langisch, Joseph Vychtrle, Ioannis Canellos, and
Marshall Pierce) pop on, report some issues, and help out.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.

The 0.1-incubating release is out. We're currently working on a
0.1.1-incubating patch that includes an update to Gora-Hbase that will allow
us to upgrade our existing jars on Maven Central. Once we roll 0.1.1 (Chris
Mattmann will RM it), Nutch 2.0-trunk will upgrade to the Gora release
shortly thereafter.

====

Hama

Hama was accepted into Incubator on 20 May 2008. Hama is a distributed
computing framework based on BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing
techniques for massive scientific computations.

== Top 2 or 3 things to resolve prior to graduation ==

* Invite new active committers

== Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board ==

None.

== Community development ==

* Mailing list shows increased usage from previous report.
* 'Chiahung lin' is actively involves in our community and research area of
hama fault-tolerant design.
* 'Miklos Erdelyi' has contributed some performance improvements.
* One of GSoC students, 'Thomas Jungblut' has excellently finished
implementing his GSoC project, and also has started to contribute major
parts in our project.
* Steve Loughran has became a mentor

== Project development ==

* We've made our first release under the Apache Incubator.
* Switched from Ant to Maven.
* Some new features are added e.g., web UI for job monitoring, examples,
messages bundle.
* Some bug and performance issues are fixed.

====

HCatalog

HCatalog is a table and storage management service for data created using
Apache Hadoop.

The most important issues in moving the project to graduation are expanding
the community of developers and producing a release of the software.

Since the last report we have:
* Written install docs for the 0.1 release
* Fixed bugs we found that are blocking the 0.1 release
* continued development on new features for 0.2
* been accepted to present a talk on HCatalog at the upcoming Hadoop Summit

Currently there are 32 subscribers to the user list and 30 on the dev list.
There were 29 and 27 respectively last month.

====

Isis

Isis is an ALv2 licensed implementation of the Naked Objects pattern. It is
based on contributions of the original Naked Objects Framework along with a
number of sister projects that were developed for the book "Domain Driven
Design using Naked Objects " (pragprog 2009).

Isis was accepted into the Incubator in 2010, September 7th.

Project Development

* Good documentation site is online now.
* Working on an Isis incubator release
* Currently voting on isis-0.1.2-RC4-incubating

Community Development

* Active mailing list.
* Frequent commits

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

* Getting first release out to demonstrate credibility.
* Ensuring existing committers all happy with transition to Apache.
* support people who like to move from NO to ISIS

None of these issues requires Board attention.

New Releases

* We are currently in the progress of voting on our first release.

====

Kato

Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.

Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation,
and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.

Recent Activity:

* There had been some discussion with Oracle regarding the future of JSR-326
in May this year, a definitive statement is expected from them in July.
* The question has been raised as to the future of JSR-326 and the Apache
Kato podling, the options being to keep both or continue only with one of
them.

The following is planned for next reporting period:

* Decide in what form the podling should continue, if at all.

Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in
the project and grow the community.

Sadly Kato seems still to be set on a holding pattern

====

ManifoldCF

--Description--

ManifoldCF is an incremental crawler framework and set of connectors
designed to pull documents from various kinds of repositories into search
engine indexes or other targets. The current bevy of connectors includes
Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink (OpenText), Meridio (Autonomy),
SharePoint (Microsoft), RSS feeds, and web content. ManifoldCF also provides
components for individual document security within a target search engine,
so that repository security access conventions can be enforced in the search
results.

ManifoldCF has been in incubation since January, 2010. It was originally a
planned subproject of Lucene but is now a likely top-level project.

--A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation--

1. We need at least one additional active committer, as well as additional
users and repeat contributors
2. We may want another release before graduating
3. We'd like to see long-term contributions for project testing, especially
infrastructure access

--Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?--

All issues have been addressed to our satisfaction at this time.

--How has the community developed since the last report?--

A book has being completed, and is becoming available in early-release form,
available from Manning Publishing.  We have signed up two new committers and
one new mentor.  We continue to have user community interest.  We've had a
number of extremely helpful bug reports and contributions from the field.

--How has the project developed since the last report?--

An 0.1 release was made on January 31, 2011, and a 0.2 release occurred on
May 17, 2011.  Another release is being considered.

====

MRUnit - a library to support unit testing of Hadoop MapReduce jobs.

MRUnit entered incubation on March 8th, 2011.

Community
* MRUnit has started receiving contributions from users (2 significant
contributions thus far).
* Still looking to develop a broader community.
* Release and contribution docs under development.
* Eric Sammer doing a great job pushing development forward.
* Discussions about producing first MRUNIT release candidate.

Issues before graduation
* Create the MRUnit web site
* Make an incubating release
* Grow the community size and diversity

Licensing and other issues
* none - MRUnit was originally a subproject of Hadoop

====

OGNL

Apache OGNL is a Java development framework for Object-Graph
Navigation Language, plus other extras such as list projection and
selection and lambda expressions.

The project just joined the Incubator on April 26, 2011.

* A list of the three most important issues to address in the move
towards graduation.

- make at least a big release that shows to Commons PMC the
compliancy level of OGNL to Commons policies;
- attract more users, at the moment only Apache Struts people are
interested because they heavily use OGNL;
- attract more new committers, the only external contribution we got
was about the new OGNL logo.

* Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be
aware of

- no news about Marc Andrew Davidson's even if was requested twice;
- not every PPMC member joined the private ML yet;
- due to OpenSymphony dismissing, we need importing old issues to ASF jira.
We've been trying to contact someone from OpenSymphony to obtain an OGNL
Issue dump/XML backup

* How has the community developed since the last report

Community is healthy and people participate to discussions, getting a
lot of suggestions from Commons PMCs, few members are very active, no
new committers yet

* How has the project developed since the last report.

Codebase has been imported and committers started updating it
according to Apache Commons policies. Site is online and we got a new
logo.

We also have Jenkins and Sonar jobs.

====

OpenNLP

OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural
language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization,
sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction,
chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually
required to build more advanced text processing services.

OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.

We started to integrate a couple of new features and will soon start testing
for our second release at Apache.
To solve our training data problem we created a proposal for an annotation
project which suggest to label
AL 2.0 licensable text documents with semantic annotations.

There is still good traffic on both the user and dev mailing list.

A list of the the most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:
* Resolve potential IP issues around releasing training models
* Establish open regression tests for the parser and coreference component
* Identify and encourage new contributors on the path to committership

====

RAT

Rat is (still) a small and mature code base without a clear home at Apache
to aim for.

Unlike the last two quarters there has been some development activity with
commits by four different committers.  Some JIRA issues have been opened and
not all of them have been addressed by now.

====

Rave

Apache Rave is a new web and social mashup engine. It will provide an
out-of-the-box as well as an extendible lightweight Java platform to host,
serve and aggregate (Open)Social Gadgets and services through a highly
customizable and Web 2.0 friendly front-end.

Rave entered incubation on 2011-03-01.

Current Status:
 * The community has identified and completed the features for a 0.1
incubation release
 * Members of the community have reached out to Wookie do discuss alignment
 * Members of the community have reached out to Shindig to offer assistance
toward producing a Shindig beta release required for incubation release
 * The community is developing release guidelines and posting them to the
site
 * The community expects to propose a release vote for 0.1 incubation
release to the IPMC within the month
 * There were over 50 commits and 1 patch submission from the committers
and the community as a whole
 * Mailing list activity remains high

Next steps:
 * Continue to build up awareness of Rave and grow the community
 * Release 0.1
 * Identify issues for a 0.2 incubation release

Issues before graduation:
 * Complete 1.0 release
 * Expand the community/user base

====

Wave

Description: Wave is a real-time communication and collaboration tool. Wave
in a Box
(WIAB) is a server that hosts and federates waves, supports extensive
APIs, and provides a rich web client. This project also includes an
implementation of the Wave Federation protocol, to enable federated
collaboration systems (such as multiple interoperable Wave In a Box
instances).

Incubating since: Dec-2010

Most important issues are:
* Migrate source code from code.google.com to SVN.
* Bug fixes and scaling/enhancing stability in preparations toward 1.0
version.
* Implement WIAB functionality to import waves (deltas) from Google Wave

Community:
The Wave in a Box community exhibits a stable even if slow growth. The mail
list stays very active, new contributors emerge every month, WIAB demo
servers show constant growth both in active users and topics discussed.

Project development:
 - Issues migrated to the ASF Jira
 - Introduction of "shared per domain waves"
 - Improvement of search functionality performance.
 - Using Guice for servlet injection - which should facilitate using WIAB
   modules for 3-rd party developers.
 - User and admin password robot agents.
 - Remote logging of client errors.
 - Numerous important enhancements to the client side architecture.
 - about 40 more changes and bug fixes.

Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Labs Project

Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF committers.

[STATUS]

Labs is in a kind of identity crisis, it seems. Activity around current
and new labs is low.

However, there might be hope. We recently had a very active public
discussion on labs@labs.apache.org about the project's future, where a
few constitutional cornerstones of Labs where put into question. That
said, not all is lost. My personal feeling is that we just need to
spread the word a little more to attract new lablings.

It's the PMC's task for the next quarter to work out what could be
changed and improved. There is also the perspective to go to the Attic
if no improvements can been achieved in the middle- to long-term
perspective.

Additionally, we are in the process of voting in a new PMC member.

[DETAILS]

== Labs Statistics ==

Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Libcloud Project

Libcloud is a Python library that abstracts away the differences among
multiple cloud provider APIs.

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

General

Libcloud graduated from the Incubator in May which means we have spent a better
part of May migrating to the new Top Level Project layout and infrastructure.
As of a few weeks ago, all the mailing lists, website, CMS and SVN repositories
have been migrated.

Development

* We have started development on Libcloud 0.6.0 which will among other things
include support for DNS as a Service support
* We have also fixed some minor bugs in 0.5.0 and we expect to release 0.5.1
soon

Releases

Libcloud 0.5.0 has been released on May 25, 2011.

Community

* The development and user lists continue to stay active
* Libcloud will held a development sprint at EuroPython in Italy this month
* Libcloud developers Tomaz and Paul will also talk about Libcloud on FLOSS
weekly (podcast about free and open-source software) in September

Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

=== Lucene Status Report: June 2011 ===

TLP

We have submitted a resolution to change the chair from Grant Ingersoll
to Simon Willnauer.

Trademarks:
We have not made progress on trademarks since the last board report, but
do intend to finish the necessary pieces.

    * Project Naming And Descriptions : 
      We believe this is complete, but are still reviewing.
    * Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to www.apache.org 
      included
      Likely complete, but under review.
    * Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in 
      footers, etc.
      The main TLP site is converted, subproject sites have not.  
    * Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your site
      In progress.  Some have been converted to have TM, some not.  We don't 
      seem to have ready volunteers on the graphical front, so it is slower
      than we'd like
    * Project Metadata : DOAP file checkedin and up to date
      Done


LUCENE JAVA/Solr

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community is very active.
The community just released 3.2.0.

Martijn van Groningen, Chris Male, Andi Vajda and Erick Erickson
were added as committers.


Open Relevance Project

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either as it is a niche
area.  

PyLucene

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
almost entirely an automated port, so this project will never
require a lot of developers.  The user community is active.
A vote for release candidate 1 for version 3.2.0, based on Lucene Java's
recent 3.2.0 release, is currently open.

Attachment R: Status report for the Apache OFBiz Project

Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

*Project Branding Checklist*
Project Website Basics: complete
Project Naming And Descriptions: complete
Website Navigation Links: complete
Trademark Attributions: complete
Logos and Graphics: in progress - we have a logo with a small feather
   (different from the Apache feather) and without TM
Project Metadata: complete

The main pages (index, download) should be now compliant with the project
branding guidelines; however there are several Confluence based pages
(linked from the home page) that still need to be reviewed.

*Releases*
- no new release but the new branch for the feature freeze for the next OFBiz 11.04
  release family has been created

*Community and Project*

- Community interaction remains strong, user and dev mailing lists traffic
  is high
- Significant new development continues, for highlights see:
  http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBIZ/Main+New+Features

*Infrastructure/Legal*
- no issues

Attachment S: Status report for the Apache OODT Project

Releases/Development:

Work progresses towards the 0.3 release. Andrew Hart will hopefully
have the 0.3 RC within the next week or so [1]. Chris Mattmann
upgraded the OODT file manager browser [2] and workflow monitor [3]
webapps to be based on the Apache Wicket framework. Chris is also
working on updating the PCS Operator Interface to be based on Wicket
[4]. Brian Foster is modularizing the Push Pull Framework [5] and
adding more significant unit testing coverage. Thomas Bennett has
added some great documentation on the wiki regarding ingestion and the
crawler [6]. Paul Ramirez and Cameron Goodale are working hard on
developing "RADIX" [7], an easy installer framework for OODT. Andrew
Hart contributed a PHP-based web framework for OODT called "Balance" [8].

Community: 

Thomas Bennett was added to the OODT PMC and as a OODT committer.

Several OODT-focused talks were accepted for ApacheCon. There will be an OODT 
track at ApacheCon this year (Apache in Space! (OODT) [9]) and the community 
is planning on attending in full force.

Branding: 

We feel our website and branding status is up-to-date. During Incubation, Sean 
Kelly worked very hard to bring our new Apache OODT website up-to-date with the 
branding guidelines from Shane. We welcome further input or suggested updates.

Press: 

We've been coordinating with Sally on the Meaningful Use of Complex Medical 
Data (MUCMD) symposium [10] that we are putting on in collaboration with NASA, 
the National Library of Medicine and Apache. The symposium will cover various 
technologies and approaches to understanding medical data (health care records, 
instrument monitors, patient notes, etc.) Apache OODT is a big part of this.

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Pig Project

Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level
language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure
for evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that
their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns
enables them to handle very large data sets.
 
Pig held its 5th Contributor Workshop. We discussed issue related to the
release process as well as how to improve our testing infrastructure.
 
Three Google Summer of code projects have been approved for Pig:
* Nested foreach statement (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1631)
* Nested cross statement (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1916)
* Syntax sugar (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1904,
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1387,
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1926)
 
Releases:
* Pig 0.8.1 released on 4/24/11.
 
Committers:
Aniket Mokashi became Pig committer
Xuefu Zhang became Pig committer
 
Community:
* 231 subscribers to dev mailing list (211 in the last report)

Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs) in Java.

Commits by Greg Brown (the perennial committer) dropped significantly
in the last quarter due to conflicting commitments, but the slack was
somewhat picked up by Sandro Martini and Noel Grandin.  Greg also has
remained very active on the mailing lists, answering questions of both
users and developers.  We also saw increased contributions from Roger
Whitcomb and voted him in as a new committer on May 20.  Though the
list traffic is healthy, in general we're in a time of transition away
from heavy reliance on the commits of one person (Greg).

Pivot is currently finalizing the few remaining JIRA issues in preparation
for the 2.0.1 release.

Releases:
* No releases this quarter (aiming for late June release of 2.0.1)
* Most recent release is 2.0 (January 10, 2011)

Committers:
* New committer (Roger Whitcomb) voted in on May 20

Community:
* User list traffic volume steady at about 2 threads per day
* 176 subscribers to the user mailing list
* 63 subscribers to the dev mailing list

Status of branding checklist:

This wasn't on our radar until we saw the mail from Shane Curcuru
on May 31.  As such, all items are NOT STARTED but being tracked
in PIVOT-750.

Project Naming and Description: NOT STARTED
Website Navigation Links: NOT STARTED

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache ServiceMix Project

Status report for the Apache ServiceMix project - June 2011

Project Status
--------------
We continue to have an active community with high levels of participation
from users on mailing lists, IRC, and issue reporting in Jira.

No issues for the board to consider.

Community
---------
No new committers or PMC members this quarter.

Community Objectives
--------------------
Roadmap - The maintenance release of ServiceMix 3.4 is nearly ready
pending some upstream dependency releases. Discussions on ServiceMix 4.4
and 5.0 releases have stabilized a feature roadmap and some work toward
these releases is already underway.

Web Site and Documentation - Work is underway to move the web site content
from the Confluence export plugin to being static generated content with
some community managed content remaining as wiki pages in Confluence.  As
part of this effort we are updating our logo, branding and web site
content to reflect the "Apache Project Branding Requirements".  The
community is also creating new documentation that will be maintained with
each release so that we can provide release specific docs that are self
contained. A preview of the new documentation has been made available
here: http://servicemix.apache.org/docs/4.3.0-SNAPSHOT/

Branding Status

Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Shiro Project

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:
- No releases since our first 1 Nov 2010 1.1.0 release

Community & Project:

This last quarter has been focused more on community building than
coding, with great success.  The Shiro average website visitor traffic
has increased more than half (59%) in only 3 months!  We continue to
grow and help the JVM security community.  Following are
the most important points from the last quarter.

- The Apache Shiro team is excited to report that we have added
 Brian Demers as our first new committer after becoming a TLP.  We're
 excited that our community continues to grow with quality folks like
 Brian.

- There has been minor discussion of creating a 1.2 release soon.  A
 few minor issues need to be resolved, and hopefully this will be done
 before our next board report.

- While Shiro doesn't receive many complaints, the most frequent one has
 been that non-JavaDoc documentation has been lacking.  Significant work
 has gone into improving Shiro's documentation over the last month, and
 we believe this will serve the community much better.

- To improve project publicity, Les Hazlewood wrote an intro article on
 Apache Shiro published on InfoQ: http://www.infoq.com/articles/apache-shiro
 This has contributed to site traffic and community adoption significantly.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

- release of version 3.3.2 is imminent!  our first code release in 15 months
 as focus has been on rule development and sa-update update releases.

- we continue to recruit contributors of mass-check results for use in
 scoring rules; we've signed up some more; we could use some more.

- we've added more safeguards to the sa-update update generation process to
 ensure quality updates; primarily we've made sure that test rules don't
 slip out in published updates.  committers have also been reminded that
 they need to be careful in identifying rules that should not be published.

- we've removed two releases from dist/ to save the mirrors a couple of MB.

- users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

- dev list has been active with both committers and community members
 contributing; we're keeping an eye out for new potential committers.

== Branding ==

June 2011: The chair will open bugs in the project's bug tracker for each of
the required branding action items so that branding things start to happen.

** No change since last report. **

While we've been careful to ensure "proper" branding of Apache SpamAssassin
since joining the ASF nearly a decade ago, we have not started on meeting
the specific requirements of the current branding requirements.  You'd be
hard pressed not to know we were "Apache SpamAssassin" when visiting our
non-wiki web pages.  Some areas of our wiki need updating to reflect the
Apache brand.

The following is a cursory review of our current branding:

Project Website Basics: mostly compliant

 All but sa-update mirrors are hosted on ASF infrastructure under the
 apache.org domain.

 Currently no link to www.apache.org on the project home page.

Project Naming And Descriptions: somewhat compliant

 The project home page uses "Apache SpamAssassin" prominently.  The download
 page isn't as good at using "Apache" in front of "SpamAssassin, but I think
 it'd be pretty difficult to miss the big bold "The Apache SpamAssassin
 Project" at the top of every page on our website (excluding the wiki).

 We do not have a one sentence project description on our home and
 download pages, although I note that the example provided at
 http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#naming is actually three
 sentences in length, so I don't feel to bad about our 5 feature bullet
 points describing the project on our home page.

Website Navigation Links: not compliant

 We fail on all points.

Trademark Attributions: not compliant

 While we're generally good about using the term "Apache SpamAssassin" we're
 short on "TM"s.

Logos and Graphics: half way there

 We're consistent with logo use but lacking the "TM"s.

Project Metadata: in progress

 A DOAP file exists.  It's accurate, except for an incorrect link to our bug
 tracker.

Other Trademark Guidelines:

 spamassassin.org has been assigned to and managed by the ASF for the better
 part of a decade.

Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

In January I reported that the Tiles community has been inactive long
enough that it may be time to make a change. In discussions on the
dev@ list some committers indicated that they had plans to do some
revolutionary work that would be starting in the next few months. We
agreed to give the project another six months before addressing the
issue again. Those six months have passed and no significant change
has taken place. My feeling is that it is time for some kind of
change. I had intended to start a discussion about that early this
month, but the last three months have proven difficult for me to do
much of anything due to workload at my day job. So, unfortunately, the
Tiles community is finding out this information at the same time the
board is. At a minimum it is probably time to change the project
chair. It may be time to consider options such as the attic. It is my
intention to start a discussion on the dev@ list this week about the
future of Tiles and see what direction the community desires. If
desired, I'd be happy to send a special report next month or a
resolution for change if something concrete comes up.

There is still one step left in the process to complete our branding
requirements. That step is to check the status of the project DOAP
file. As noted above, my time availability has been near zero, so I
still have not completed this task.

Other than that, there has been little activity in the Tiles project
this quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

General:
 Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
 responsiveness on both dev and user lists.

 There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Releases:
 * Apache Tomcat 7.0.12
 * Apache Tomcat 7.0.14

Community:
 There were no community membership changes since the
 last board report.
 Couple of developers were present at the Apache Retreat in
 Knockree working on various issues and code, namely AJP
 NIO connector.

Security:
 * CVE-2011-1183
   A regression in the fix for CVE-2011-1088
   meant that security constraints were ignored when no login
   configuration was present in the web.xml and the web
   application was marked as meta-data complete.
 * CVE-2011-1475
   Changes introduced to the HTTP BIO connector to support
   Servlet 3.0 asynchronous requests did not fully account
   for HTTP pipelining.
 * CVE-2011-1582
   An error in the fixes for CVE-2011-1088/CVE-2011-1183 meant
   that security constraints configured via annotations were
   ignored on the first request to a Servlet. Subsequent requests
   were secured correctly.

Trademark:
  Reviewed private@tomcat.a.o for all trademark issues and created
  status file in svn for tracking.

  Current status:
  * Resolved
      7 products, 2 web sites, 1 advert. 10 total
  * In progress
      3 products promised to rename
      1 product with legal-internal
      1 product in process of renaming (just domain name left)
      1 product considering entering incubation
      1 website promised to make updates

Issues:
  We are still waiting for EL 2.2 TCK. 18 months and counting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases:
Since last report, UIMA-AS Released
(http://uima.apache.org/news.html#22 March 2011).

Development:
UIMA CAS Editor is being improved and extended with inputs from several
active users. A new Eclipse plugin was done that supports easy launching
of UIMA Analysis Engines from within Eclipse.

The set of add-ons is being released soon (on 2nd release candidate as of now).

A user has set up a French language portal to all things UIMA, and
contributed a French language models for the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
Tagger annotator, and generally improved that annotator.
 
Another user contributed fixes to URL usage.

Community:
Two users have been busy submitting patches, some of which haven't been
acted upon yet (we have a backlog).  One new user who has expressed an
interest in helping out, has also started contributing patches.
 
Issues: No Board level issues at this time

Trademarks/Branding: all of our web pages have the right footers. 
We changed the first occurrence of the use of trademark at the
beginning to be a modifier of a generic class noun, per recent guidance.

 Branding checklist:
  Project Website Basics - done
  Website Navigation Links - done
  Trademark Attributions - done
  Logos and Graphics - not done
  Project Metadata - done
  Read PMC Branding Responsibilities - partially done.  Need to get confirmation
    that all PMC members have read this.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Released Apache Wicket 1.4.16, 1.4.17, and 1.5-rc3 and 1.5-rc4.2
- Apache Wicket Cookbook published (written by Igor Vaynberg)
- Wicket 1.5 is under way to get a final release soon

Release 1.5 is nearing completion: release candidates are pushed out at a semi
regular interval (about one every 3 weeks).

We are contemplating moving our build towards gradle instead of Maven, while
still publishing our artifacts to the central repository. No decision has been
made yet. For publishing our source release we are contemplating to move to
svnpubsub, obviating the need to upload to p.a.o and using accounts for that.

No new committers were added in this period. We recently added 3 new team
members and are still assimilating them into our collective. They have joined
the top committers since they've been elected. We are still on the lookout for
new committer blood to assimilate.

Compliance with branding/trademark guidelines

Only our logo on the webpage does not comply in missing a TM. We're still
working on a new web design and will incorporate the TM in that design. All
other items on the checklist are fulfilled.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

No report from PMC chair (and not much to report anyway), here's a report by 
Bertrand on my findings since last board meeting:

I wrote a last call to the Xalan dev list ( http://s.apache.org/Bug )
to which David Bertoni, current PMC chair, replies that he's
probably the only active Xalan-J committer and PMC member left,
and doesn't have much time to dedicate to that.

Steve Hathaway, Xalan-C community member, indicates in that thread that 
he's working on Xalan-C++ V 1.11 and shooting for a September release. 
He's not currently a committer. David's willing to review and commit
his patches.

Michael Glavassevich notes ( http://s.apache.org/0H ) that there's a GSoC
project about Xalan this year ( http://s.apache.org/LI3 ) which is not being
discussed on the Xalan-dev list. I have contacted the mentor with CC to 
the Xalan dev list to find out more. UPDATE: see http://s.apache.org/KJe
for replies by mentor and student, there's definitely a Xalan-related
GSoC project happening.

In summary: there's a few people still involved, might be just enough to
keep the project going. I suggest postponing the Attic move one more month.

Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache Subversion Project

No Board-level issues at this time. This is a supplemental report,
outside of our regular reporting timeframe.

I'm happy to report that Apache Subversion is now releasing alphas
under the Apache banner. The project has enjoyed a much-too-long grace
period on making releases under the standard Apache banner and
licensing regime. The community did not envision or desire it taking
this long to produce a 1.7 release, but... well, it did take a while.

On June 10, we released the first "alpha" of the 1.7 series. Beyond
the proper Apache licensing and copyright, this is also the first
release to go into the standard Apache distribution and mirror
system. The 1.6 (and 1.5) releases that the community has produced
while at the Foundation have resided at the old tigris.org
distribution point since they were not true Foundation releases.
They also are also mirrored on archive.apache.org.

And yes, this is a self-congratulatory pat on the back to the
community for finally reaching this point :-)

Attachment AK: Special status report for the Apache Maven Project

As anticipated, the board's action of removing Sonatype employees from the
Maven PMC, and assigning myself as Chair, resulted in quite a bit of
discussion, debate, concern and (quite frankly) FUD within the PMC. Email
posts from various board members were very influential in clarifying the
concerns and the rationale. After the hub-bub about the action, the PMC
is recovering nicely and returning to a more functional status-quo.

I met with Wayne Jackson, CEO of Sonatype for lunch, and we discussed
the trademark situation. Sonatype's main concern is regarding the usage
of the maven.org domain. The PMC, especially John Casey, are working to
define what usages of maven.org would be allowed and what timetable
for transition would be invisioned. I plan to, this week, contact Wayne,
and determine the status of the attribution on their end.
