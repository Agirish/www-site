 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       We conducted our annual members meeting last week, electing a
       new board and 21 new members.  The omnibus resolution easily
       passed, approving the board's actions over the past year.

       For the record, here is my annual report to the members:

         The ASF is the leading community-based software foundation.  We
         provide legal, social and technical structure to nearly a hundred
         project communities.  Our unifying theme is not any particular kind
         of software, but rather our way of collaborating.

         The past year has had its landmark events: in September we counted
         our millionth commit; in December we left the JCP; in February our
         software helped play Jeopardy; and in June we accepted
         OpenOffice.org into the incubator.

         We've taken positive steps in clarifying the Apache way.
         Thanks to Shane and others, our trademark policy is now better
         documented, understood and practiced.  This has not been
         uncontroversial or painless, but as our projects become
         sucessful we must defend their identity.

         But let's not permit these highlights to blind us to our
         substantial everyday accomplishments: the myriad bugs fixed,
         features developed, releases cut, and committers added.  Today
         we have ten more top-level projects and 21 more incubating than
         we did a year ago.  We are a well-functioning foundation: we
         nurture communities that create great software.

       I'd like to welcome Larry and Brett to the board and thank
       Noirin and Geir for their service last year.

    B. President [Jim]

       Less than a week ago we finished our annual ASF members meeting. The
       meeting ran well, but this was the 1st year in which I was honestly
       worried that we may not hit quorum. We did manage to hit it, with
       about 20-30 or so members to spare, but I wonder if it's time to
       once again ping the "inactive" members and ask if they wish to
       go emeritus.

       On behalf of the foundation, welcome to the new board! In particular,
       welcome back to Brett, after a brief (but I'm sure refreshing) hiatus,
       and to Larry, our noob. And a vote of thanks and gratitude goes out
       to Geir and Noirin as outgoing directors (but still active exec.
       officers).

       I received a few more invitations for later on this year to speak
       regarding the ASF; I am checking my schedule for availability. I did
       accept the offer to speak at the Transfer Summit, in GB.

       For the record, I am adding in my report from the members meeting:

       The foundation is running smoothly but has seen quite a bit of
       activity, both internally and well as externally related. Externally,
       the item most of note is likely the donation of the OpenOffice.org
       code and trademark from Oracle to us, and the subsequent creation of
       the Apache OpenOffice Incubator podling. Admittedly, not all of the
       "press" related to this was positive, with some people and reporters
       even going so far as to imply that the ASF was in kahoots with Oracle
       and IBM to "destroy" LibreOffice (which of course, is FUD of the nth
       degree).

       Another semi-major issue that occurred over the last 6 months has
       been that Oracle subpoenaed us regarding information related to
       Harmony, its licensing and attempts to get a TCK, in support of
       Oracle's suit against Google. Kudos to all involved for helping out
       with this, but special attention to Sam for leading the effort.

       Internally, I would say that the efforts regarding our trademarks and
       the *protection* of our trademarks, and the discussion that arose on
       the members@ and incubator@ lists regarding OOo have been 2 of the
       most substantial ones.

       Speaking of the Incubator, as the below stats show, there are quite a
       number of Incubator podlings in existence, and a non-insignificant
       number of those have been in the Incubator for a number of years.
       Something for the new board and the Incubator to consider is actively
       prodding these podlings to either graduation or retire.

       Our Executive Assistant has been extremely helpful in a number of
       areas, especially with Concom and TAC. I expect to renew her contract
       this month.

       Our infrastructure team continues to actively and pro-actively keep
       on top of our resources and services; in particular, we just hired a
       part-time sys-admin (pctony) and servers are being replaced *before*
       they die.

       Finally, as before, if your PMC desires specific computing resources
       (ie build farm, test machines, etc.), please get in touch with the
       infrastructure group.  Well-reasoned and detailed proposals are
       always welcomed.  However, we are often limited by human resources,
       so volunteers to help execute these plans are strongly encouraged.

       The board approved our FY2011-2012 budget, and, although admittedly
       early in our fiscal year, we are operating on projections.

       Finally, I am happy to report that the ASF continues to be an
       extremely noteworthy and respected entity in the FOSS space, and I
       (and others) are frequently asked to speak at conferences,
       user-groups, etc regarding the foundation, the so-called "Apache Way"
       and Open Source in general.

       General agreement on reviewing/pinging inactive membership for
       status and moving to emeritus.
       
       Greg suggests that we also should stress proxies.
       
       Larry asks if we could change our quorum requirements; Greg
       indicates that this would require a change to bylaws (Section
       3.9), and should be something that is done as a last resort
       (and probably only after we fail hold a members meeting due to
       quorum requirements).
       
       Jim notes that the quorum requirements is required to start
       the meeting, votes afterwards are counted as attending but too
       late to be helpful; again we need to stress proxies.


    C. Treasurer [Geir]

       Larry: do we have too much money? The IRS is not a problem. We
       should think about what we should do with the money as it
       might discourage contributions.
       
       Sam: has it discouraged contributions? Greg: it hasn't been an
       issue with our big platnimum sponsors... at most it might
       affect paypal contributions.
       
       Doug: please discuss it on the list, and possibly bring it
       back as a discussion item next month.
       
       Larry: What does "receivables" mean? Serge: those are (likely)
       sponsorship invoices that have been sent but have not yet been
       paid.


    D. Secretary [Craig]

       June was a record busy month in secretary-land due to the
       admission of OOo into the incubator. 112 ICLAs, 3 CCLAs and one
       grant were recorded.

       We occasionally receive a few documents that are incomplete,
       unsigned, or that use the wrong form, but nothing of concern.

       A discussion regarding privacy and duplication is leading to a
       privacy policy for members' personal information.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

       Verbal report: nothing to report.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       In my role, I backstopped a request for our Chairman to speak
       at LinuxConf Brazil this November. I also did a press interview
       for a Git/Subversion story; it is unclear whether I'll be
       credited in my Vice Chairman role, or as VP, Apache Subversion.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Do we require a nofollow attribute on links to external websites
       on our project's sites? We have a recommendation from Jim as PRC chair
       here: http://s.apache.org/prc_nofollow but no policy AFAIK.

       Shane and Serge are working on a proposal:
       http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/linking.html

       Discussion will continue on the trademark mailing list.

    B. Should the Board hold a face-to-face meeting prior to
       ApacheCon?  If so, when and where?

       Agreement to "pencil in" the week of September 28th in the LA area.
       Brett and Bertrand (as the Directors with the farthest to travel) to
       verify over the course of the next week that these dates are workable.

    C. Is it time to reassign credit cards?

       General consensus is that it is.

       AI: Sam to work with Wells Fargo to do all of the necessary
       deactivations, reactivations, reassignments, and requests for cards.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

Nothing of interest this month.  TCK support for projects is going
well, with all traffic on jcp-open@.  There are no issues that I'm
aware of at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================

A number of PMCs are now using the Apache Trademark Reporting Guidelines
to make first contact and work on branding issues with third parties using
their respective marks.

Working with fundraising@ on [PROPOSAL] of Apache Corporate Recognition
Branding Policy [1] to address per-project Thanks! pages and other kinds
of outbound links to commercial third parties.  Much of this falls between
fundraising@ and management of Sponsorship programs, and Branding in terms
of how to document for projects website best practices.

Worked with Concom on several third party event sites and approvals.

External Requests
=================

Still waiting on the Maven PMC completing it's work on maven.org domain name
MOU and confirming it with Sonatype.

The Hadoop PMC had a number of great discussions on what it means for a
third party product to "include" or be "compatible" with Hadoop.  This kind
of discussion continues to cry out for a more detailed policy and a new
options to the "Powered By" phrasing that we suggest third parties use for
their products that include Apache products.  Volunteers needed!

Jim denied an independent developer's question as to using the name "Apache"
in their webserver product.  Imitation as a form of flattery?

Trademark Registrations
=======================

Trademarks@ is working with legal-internal@ on a number of registrations or
transfers. In the future, we will need notably expanded EA and counsel
assistance on managing registrations.

SFLC reports that the "Apache" registration should be re-submitted shortly.
Unfortunately no specific agreement has yet been reached with the third party
currently using the name with respect to hardware.

Larry has volunteered to submit the "Hadoop" registration; trademarks@ will
coordinate with the Hadoop PMC.

Oracle has volunteered to transfer a large number of OpenOffice.org related
marks from around the world to the ASF.  Trademarks@ is reviewing the specific
transfer agreement to ensure it covers our concerns and expects to sign
this shortly.

Yahoo! is in the process of donating their Oozie mark to the ASF for
the newly hatched Oozie podling, related to Hadoop; we merely await
the signed paperwork.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

SPONSORSHIP
Added Liip as a new bronze sponsor!

Processed half-year payment for Microsoft's platinum sponsorship.

Processed Google sponsorship payment.

MISC
Commented on the draft by Shane of corporate recognition branding policy
and will be following up to discuss this.

Still trying to find time to fly out next week, but hope to be at OSCON to
staff the booth.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

ASF MARKETING & PUBLICITY STATUS: JULY 2011

I. Budget: several expenses have been charged over the past few weeks,
including HALO monthly fees, promotional items for OSCON (and other events),
as well as our clipping service (reports forwarded daily to the press@ list).

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: no meetings or coordination this
month, however, Sally Khudairi will be available to support Serge Knystautas
and other ASF Board Members with any Sponsor-related activities next week
during OSCON.

IIa. Annual Report: Sally is in the editing stage and is running 3 weeks
behind schedule. The current document length is 265 pages (1/3 of the summary
of last year's core activities already complete); the goal of producing a
final report less than 20 pages in length seems ominous, but is within reach.
We’re anticipating to forward draft for review before the end of the month.
ASF Executive Assistant Melissa Warnkin helped pull together the raw data for
the Incubator and supporting administrative activities (such as TAC) during
FY 2010-2011 -- this part alone was 50+ pages in its unedited form.
Next year’s report will be a much easier process.

III. Press Releases: we issued the following announcements over the PR
NewsWire service:

- 28 June: ApacheCon 2011 Announces "Open Source Enterprise Solutions,
  Cloud Computing, and Community Leadership"

- 14 June: The Apache Software Foundation Announces
  Apache Traffic Server v3.0.0

Upcoming announcements planned for distribution include Apache Tika v1.0 and a
media alert regarding the ASF’s presence at OSCON.

IV. Informal Announcements: the following announcements were distributed to
our dedicated press/analyst list (only; not PR Newswire), as well as posted on
the ASF blog and Twitter feed:

- 14 July: The July @Netcraft Survey is in: the #Apache HTTP Web Server
  remains the leading Web server, powering more than 235 Million sites
  worldwide!

- 2 July: Applications for Travel Assistance to ApacheCon close this Friday 8
  July! s.apache.org/kyX #Apache #OpenSource #Conference #Vancouver

- 30 June: Did you know that Yahoo! uses #Apache #Hadoop to process 5 billion
  jobs a month? apache.org #OpenSource #Cloud

- 28 June: ApacheCon program, speakers confirmed: #OpenSource Enterprise
  Solutions, #Cloud Computing & Community Leadership apachecon.com #Apache

- 14 June: Apache Traffic Server v3.0.0 Features-at-a-Glance

NOTE TO ALL PMCs! We're Seeking Success Stories! Do consider forwarding
innovative/newsworthy metrics/users/datapoints of Apache products for the "Did
You Know?" Twitter campaign. Please contact Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org
for more information.

V. Media Relations: we received great media interest and press coverage on our
Traffic Server announcement, and continue to field general press queries on
topics such as OpenOffice, JCP/Harmony and the Oracle subpoena, and
Subversion. We resumed issuing select announcements/statements to the press
under embargo, but not for every occasion.

VI. Analyst Relations: Summertime is usually quieter with us in terms of
analyst activity; we were mentioned in a report by the 451 on
corporate/individual/community diversity at the Eclipse Foundation ("It would
be fascinating to get similar data for other open source foundations – the
Apache Software Foundation projects, for example"). Sally is planning to meet
some analysts at OSCON, and will be coordinating possible briefings with ASF
"executives" and Members as well.

VII. ApacheCon liaison: the general conference program is very nearly complete
(trainings are not yet in place), and Sally has been spending a considerable
amount of cycles on conference promotion (such as writing the above-mentioned
press release, media pitch letters, and related supporting materials due to
myriad drawbacks by contracted PR firm; other areas, such as securing media
partnerships are running smoothly, and interviews for session/track promotion
are being coordinated). Sally continues to shoulder a significant amount of
responsibility, including creating a top-level master tasklist (comprising
detailed tasks for the planners, producer, program chairs, track chairs, and
marketing/publicity teams). Unfortunately, there are issues with folks
pitching in. All 10 of the 10 items on the active to-do list for the planning
team are incomplete, for example, and it’s unclear whether any of them have
been started or who is taking the lead. The only thing semi-completed to date
is that 6 of 12 Track Chairs have been assigned – i.e., half our tracks have
no-one to oversee/coordinate (e.g., following through on any changes,
assigning backup sessions, ensuring speakers have signed up, etc.). Whilst
happy to assist, Sally is frustrated, exhibiting symptoms of volunteer
fatigue, and is likely unable to continue at this pace.

VIII. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally will be manning
the ASF Booth (#725) at OSCON with support from Melissa and a member of the
HALO community team. The Expo is open the evening of 26 July and all day 27-28
July.

- 25-29 July: OSCON (+ OSCON Data/OSCON Java), Portland, Oregon

IX. PR Newswire account: we have 8 pre-paid press releases with PRNewswire
through 3 March 2012.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

The ASF has joined the WebApps WG in order to enable Larry Rosen to
participate in the Widgets Patent Advisory Group.  See the Legal Affairs
status report for more background.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Production of documents for the Oracle subpoena is proceeding.

Similar status exists for Google's informal request on the same case.  As
discussed, we are proceeding without requiring a formal subpoena.  At the
present time, Aaron is waiting on some some input from Geir.

We have had one violation of confidentiality where an attorney's email was
forwarded to legal-internal without prior permission.  I've taken steps to
ensure that this does not reoccur.

How to deal with confidentiality is a common theme these days.  Larry Rosen
met privately via teleconfererence to discuss in non-specific terms how to
deal with code that remediates patent infringement concerns.  Larry is also
investigating the current status of the W3C Patent Advisory Group policy.

We have had a request from the defendants in a TQP Development LLC vs Capital
Group Companies complaint.  Larry Rosen and Mark Thomas are following up.
Until we have a published policy on confidentiality that handles these kinds
of discussions, these discussions are generally happening off-list.

Larry continues to work the OpenOffice.org trademark assignment from Oracle,
with input from others.

Karen Sandler has left the SFLC. Aaron Williamson and Justin Colannino will
continue to support the ASF.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For Jun 2011: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

3      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
1      Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
6      Vulnerability reports
       1      [infrastructure, via security@apache.org]
       1      [multiple projects, via security@apache.org]
       3      [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org]
       1      [httpd, via security@apache.org]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

General
-------
We approved one external event under the third party branding policy, and
clarified that another didn't need it.

We were approached about an event in Beijing in early October, but the close
proximity to the planned roadshow event in Shanghai meant we declined. The
roadshow isn't confirmed yet, but Justin's mentoring them and we hope
they'll be ready to get the final ok and announce soon.

We are planning to put on a single day Apache track at GotoCon in Amsterdam
in October, and hopefully host a BarCamp or Hackathon the day after. We'll
announce this plus the CFP for this shortly, once it's confirmed what space
and volunteers we have for the Saturday part.

Work continues on the old ApacheCon sites archive. We're almost there...

There were discussions on funding ASF presenters at third party events,
which concluded that this wasn't ConCom's role. Organisers, however, were
considered our role (see BarCamps)

ApacheCon NA 11
---------------
Things are progressing, though more items on the ASF task spreadsheet are
red (overdue) than one would ideally like...

The schedule is up, all speakers notified, all unsuccessful submitters
have been given the bad news, but not all track backup speakers have yet
been identified and told (some have). We're likely to reach out to some
likely suspects to fill the roster of track chairs shortly. The next big
thing then is PR related, helping speakers and track chairs get the word
out. (Sally has kicked this off for a few of the tracks already)

All speakers who asked for help with travel costs are being covered by the
producer. TAC is aware of this.

Registration numbers are I'm told doing ok compared to other years.

BarCamps
--------
Nick and Ross have been speaking with a potential local organiser of a
BarCampApache on the Saturday after ApacheCon in Vancouver. The idea is to
run an internal facing BarCamp on the Tuesday, and an external facing one
off-site on the Saturday. Zak is trying to round up enough local organisers
for this (we have mentors and funding, just boots on the ground we're
waiting on!)

We may have a BarCampApache in Amsterdam on the 15th of October, after
GotoCon, Arje is talking to other committers in the area to see if we have
enough volunteers to let this happen. If not, we'll just do a hackathon or
similar.

Organising continues for BarCampApacheOxford in September. Our trainee
organisers are helping out a lot, especially on putting together
documentation. After a vote, one organiser was approved to have their travel
cost to attend covered, and one was previously covered by external
sponsorship. Otherwise organising is on track.

We expect to hear more about the provisionally approved BarCampApache's in
Pune, Nuevo Hambourgo and Cairo after Oxford.

Future ApacheCons
-----------------
The current ApacheCon has taken more volunteer effort this month than
planned for, so things haven't proceeded as much as hoped.

Discussions on what public lists we should have, and what should be
discussed where are nearly complete. Once that's complete, we'll be emailing
committers@ to let them know what lists exist, and inviting them to join
those that interest them. We'll then kick off discussions on what we would
need from a commercial producer if we were to do another commercially
produced conference.

We're still waiting on a potential host of a low cost, community run style
ApacheCon. Discussions and investigations are happening there. Once we hear
about that one way or another, we can either start discussing how it'd work,
or where we might host such a beast instead.

Committee
---------
No changes at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

LDAP + TLS + LPK work is underway.

Justin Erenkrantz stepped down from root@.

Arranged for travel from VA to FLL for Philip to help out with the racking
and safe deposit box for the backup system.

Work on upgrading id.apache.org to handle acct creation is progressing.

Uli Stark specced a replacement host for aurora (eu websites).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
=======

No changes to the Committee.

ApacheCon NA 2011 Vancouver
===========================

Work is under way for getting people to AC NA 2011 at Vancouver. The judges
completed scoring of 22 applications and 18 of those were approved. A 3
day objection notice was posted to TAC and Concom-private lists with no
objections raised to those names in that time. All 18 therefore will get
notified this week of their successful applications. A wire request has been
asked for for the initial Travel Agent down payment for flights. Our EA
has been given a timeline of events and should start liasing with our
approved Travel Agent this coming week. The cost is expected to be higher
than budgeted for this one event, but we do not expect to exceed our yearly
budget taking into account the lower cost and participation in budgeted
smaller events so far.

With no other volunteers available this time around, Myself, Nick and Matt as
well as being judges are also fulfilling all other remaining roles for the
event. Our thanks therfore to having an EA to help us out. It is intended to
send a note out to members list soon to see if anyone wants to join us to
help with future events.

Other Events:
-------------

No news about any other events happening at this time.

Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Aries Project

Apache Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

=== Development ===
Users have asked for a release of the Aries JPA bundles and hence the
snapshot bundles it depends on (Aries Util) - in particular due to:

* the new 'runtime enhancer' that will mean entities can be enhanced as
  they are used in the runtime, rather than at development time.
* the support for EclipseLink (in addition to Apache OpenJPA) as a JPA
  provider

The release process has just started. This will exercise our per bundle
release process adhering to the OSGi Alliance Semantic Versioning
recommendations.

There have also been enhancements to the Aries JMX (whiteboard pattern)
and Aries Subsystem (to use OSGi Core 4.3).

Apache Geronimo, which consumes Apache Aries to implement its enterprise
OSGi application programming model, has been readying a release. The
performance enhancements in the Aries Proxy module which now makes use
of the new Weaving Hooks OSGi specification, has had a few teething
problems for Geronimo. All known problems are now resolved.

=== Project Branding Board Report Checklist ===

We've been reminded of this work and are reporting this checklist for
the first time. We appreciate we're a bit behind the curve here, and
are doing our best to catch up.

* Project Website Basics : homepage is aries.apache.org (done)
* Project Naming And Descriptions : use proper Apache forms, describe
  product, etc. (pending)
* Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
  www.apache.org included (pending - feather link done)
* Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
  footers, etc. (pending)
* Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your
  site (pending)
* Project Metadata : DOAP file checkedin and up to date (pending - some
  minor updates needed)

=== Community update ===

Roughly same number of dev@ subscribers at 119, user@ 148 subscribers up
14 since last report. John Ross was voted in as a committer after his
significant work to the 'subsystem' module.

There are no board level issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Attic Project

We completed the move of OJB to the Attic and Regexp is nearly there
as well. No other projects in the pipeline at this time and no issues
requiring board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Avro Project

Apache Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

== Issues ==

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

== Community ==

Progress has been steady.  C, C++ and Java have had the most new features
and improvements.  C#, Python, and PHP have had some activity.
No new contributors were added.  Bruce Mitchener was voted into the Avro
PMC.


== Releases ==

Avro 1.5.1 was released on May 6th, 2011.
Avro 1.5.2 is a release candidate as of this writing.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports
such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.


Releases:
2.3.5 released
2.4.1 released


PMC changes:
Colm O hEigeartaigh added to CXF PMC


Community update:
As the Summer season has started, things have quieted down quite a bit.
However, user and dev list traffic remains pretty steady and generally
questions and issues are answered promptly.  Work on trunk is proceeding
to add some new features such as WS-RM 1.1 support, enhanced security
for JAX-RS, etc... Lots of cools stuff being worked on. However, fixes
are being merged back to 2.4.x with plans to release 2.4.2 relatively
soon.

Some big patches were submitted for DOSGi to update it to CXF 2.4.1.
We'll likely try to get a DOSGi release out soon as well.

All items on the "Project Branding Board Report Checklist" have been done
except for the "tm" added to the logo as CXF doesn't have a logo. :-)

I (dkulp) sent out a couple of unofficial "please check your CXF and
Apache trademark usage" emails to a couple companies and I'm happy to
say they all have improved their pages without needing to resort to
official channels.  There still are changes required for some sites, but
things are heading in the right direction.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache DB Project

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o DdlUtils : a small, easy-to-use component for working with Database
              Definition (DDL) files.

Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Directory Project

The Apache Directory Project provides directory solutions entirely written in
Java. These include a directory server, which has been certified as LDAP v3
compliant by the Open Group (ApacheDS), Eclipse-based directory tools (Apache
Directory Studio) and a client API that can be used to communicate with any
directory server (Apache LDAP API).

-- Community --
* No new committers or PMC members.
* A user expressed his willing of contributing some documentation.

-- Development --
* Apache LDAP API:
 * A major refactoring took place to remove the embedded Apache Felix OSGI
   container based on feedback from some users who had difficulties with it.
   We're still looking for the best solution which pleases both our OSGI and
   non-OSGI users, still allowing a good modularity and extensibility.
 * Two new milestones versions have been released (see below).

* ApacheDS 2.0:
 * After almost a year of development and major refactorings in key parts of
   the server, a first milestone version has been released (see below).
 * This should allow our users to take a look at the state of ApacheDS 2.0
   after a long period without any releases.
 * Other incremental milestones should follow in the next months.

* Apache Directory Studio:
 * Lower activity on Studio since the last report. Mainly small bug fixes and
   minor code cleaning.

* Overall:
 * There's currently a discussion about removing support for Java 5 in the
   next releases (at least for ApacheDS and Apache Directory Studio).

-- Releases --

Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Hadoop Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache HBase Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

This past month the Incubator PMC voted to terminate a project.  Bluesky has
been terminated, although its participants asked for one additional month to
clean up their self-admittedly poor performance.  It was the judgment of the
PMC that they had been given many chances, and just did not get the fact
that the community issues were the crucial ones, not the code.

Alois, Impirius, Stonehenge, were also retired.

At the same time, several new projects have begun Incubation:

 * Bigtop, with the goal of building a community around the packaging and
interoperability testing of Hadoop-related projects.

 * Deft, a non-blocking, asynchronous, event driven high performance web
framework running on the JVM.

 * Oozie, a server-based workflow scheduling and coordination system to
manage data processing jobs for Apache Hadoop.

 * Kafka, a distributed, high throughput, publish-subscribe system for
processing large amounts of streaming data for Hadoop.

Another Hadoop related project, is currently being proposed: Giraph, a
large-scale graph processing infrastructure (inspired by Pregel) that runs
entirely on Hadoop.

OGNL and Olio failed to file reports.  OGNL has not had a commit in 5 weeks,
and is sharing mailing list space with Apache Commons.  Olio has not had a
commit in two months.  That commit was the April Board report.  In terms of
development, it appears stagnant and dead.  Perhaps it should be retired.

Update: The Olio report is late. There needs to be a discussion of the
future of the project. It is a useful project but is not making progress
in terms of a viable community. [clr]

Henri Yandell also initiated a discussion on making sure that the
IP/copyright sign-off checklist item has been correctly processed by the
projects.

-----------------------------------------------

Ace

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to centrally
manage and distribute software components, configuration data and other
artifacts to target systems. ACE started incubation on April 24th 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring board or Incubator PMC attention.

Community:

* Jean-Baptiste, Bram and Marcel got accepted at ApacheCon NA 2011.
* Started discussions about a possible donation of ACE IDE to the project
(see https://www.assembla.com/spaces/eclipse-ace/wiki)

Software:

* Wrapped up the Maven integration, readied the codebase for doing releases.
* We did our first release: 0.8.0-incubator!
* Bugfixes after initial feedback on the release.

Licensing and other issues:

* None at the moment.

Things to resolve prior to graduation:

* Not sure, we grew the community, did a release, so this might actually be
a good time to start discussing graduation.

Airavata

Airavata is a software toolkit which provides features to compose, manage,
execute, and monitor large scale applications and workflows on computational
resources ranging from local clusters to national grids and computing
clouds.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Remove incompatible license dependencies and implement over ALV2
compatible libraries.
  2. Simplify the build process and provide simple to use cases.
  3. At least one Apache Incubator release.
  4. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well
aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here:
http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

A web designer Barbara Hallock has contributed, Airavata Logo, web site
banner and CSS. Patanachai Tangchaisin enquired in the mailing list about
contributing to the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

* Followed all the instructions on the Crypto registration, sent BIS notice
and updated the Exports page with cryptographic dependencies.
* Airavata website is designed and developed in the staging area is now made
live.
* Brainstorming on alternatives for incompatible license dependencies
* Started development of the various components, importing, cleaning up the
donate code by adding ASV2 license headers, changed package names and
applying code style templates and formatting.

(Nota Bene: This project was retired by the Incubator PMC this month)

BlueSky has been incubating since 01-12-2008. It is an e-learning solution
designed to help solve the disparity in availability of qualified education
between well-developed cities and poorer regions of China.

The following items have been performed since the last reporting period:
1.solve the problem of the bad effection of recording vedio.
2.integrate with IPTV function.

The following items are planned for the next reporting period:
1.test the system in Linux environment.

----

Celix

Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.

Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.

Over the past few months work has been done on integration and usage of the
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) in Celix.
The work has mostly focusses on stability and robustness of the codebase,
but some new features were added:

   Log Service and Writer: for logging and reading the log
   Service Factories: needed for the log service

Also, in March, a talk was given to the OSGi User Group France. There is a
lot interest in the project, but people seem to be waiting for a more stable
version.
For community building it might be interesting to work towards a release
later this year to make it easier to download and use Celix.
A talk on Celix has also been accepted for the ApacheCon in November, which
is a good opportunity to show Celix to the world.
Also parts of Celix have been ported to Windows. Mostly the utils used by
the framework, and not yet the framework itself. This is a lengthy job
because Celix is using C99, and Windows (Visual Studio) only support
C89/C90.

Most important issues are:

   Improve robustness (APR, error handling etc)
   Generate awareness and grow a community!


----

  3. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well
aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here:
http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ChukwaProposal#Alignment

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

There are some activity on the user mailing list, and some new users
participated in adopting Chukwa for processing and visualizing big data
analytics.

How has the project developed since the last report?

we expect to have a plan and report on it in August.


----

Empire-db

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development
than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient
database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety and
DBMS independence. Empire-db has entered Incubation in August 2008.

After having published our 2.1.0 release in April, things went a bit slower
during the last quarter. Recently our committers have fixed smaller issues
and we have made the Empire-db code base available on git.

We regularly receive user requests on our user list asking for help and or
improvements. Some users submitted small patches through Jira.
For the next term we have planned to start a major API improvement which
might help making Empire-db attractive for even more users.

In order to graduate we still need to increase awareness of the project
through various channels in order to grow our community. This means
participating in blogs and write our own articles. We will set up a
discussion on how exactly our communication can be improved.

Tashi

2011-July Tashi Incubator Status Report

Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.

The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud
computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data). The
idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that
are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated,
and computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.

Tashi has previously encompassed just the tools to manage virtual
machines using Xen and KVM, but is gaining the facility to hand out
physical machines as well.

Development activities have included:-
       * Refactor primitive scheduler to be less convoluted
       * Ensure that an old CM handle expires to not talk to a dead CM
       * Use virtio networking by default for performance
       * Enable config option for Miha Stopar's auto host registration
       * Clean unused and untested modules from stable branch
       * Reduce VM startup time when using scratch (old sparse files)
       * Conversion of sparse file scratch space to Linux LVM2
       * Work on migrating VMs between hosts
       * Resource usage messages sent to clustermanager for accounting

The project is still working toward building a larger user and development
community. User groups have been identified in Ireland, Slovenia and Korea,
as well as at Georgia Tech. CMU usage is growing as other groups hear about
the availability of the resource. Intel has restructured its research
division and folded some operations into adjoining academic sites.

Items to be resolved before graduation:
       * A stable branch exists which could be a release candidate, but
         the codebase is large and test hardware is currently in
         short supply. We are confident that the code in the stablefix
         branch will work if running QEMU emulation, Pickle or sqlite
         data storage, primitive scheduler. Xen, other data stores and
         schedulers have not been tested recently.
       * Should have example accounting code
       * Develop community diversity (Committers currently at Telefonica,
         Google and CMU)


----

VXQuery

The VXQuery Project implements a standard compliant XML Query processor. It
has been in incubation since 2009-07-06.

Recent activities:

   * no progress due to external commitments of the current developers and
minimal community size
   * considering future of the project

Top issues before graduation:

   * Revive project
   * Create a release
   * Build community (developer and users)

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Apache Mahout 0.5 was released on May 27 2011. It resolved 137
issues:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true
  &jqlQuery=project+%3D+MAHOUT+AND+fixVersion+%3D+%220.5%22

The PMC plans an 0.6 release at the end of the year. The focus
continues to be on polish and refinement in advance of a 1.0 release;
A 1.0 release may come in mid 2012 but is not yet being planned.

The community continues to grow steadily. The user and dev lists
contained 793 and 470 subscribers, respectively, in January 2011.
They now contain 983 and 557 respectively. We've seen healthy
community activity around the world, including new talks at events
from Berlin, Seoul, London and Chicago.

The project has one area of significant new activity: graph mining
and graph-related algorithms. For example, Mahout has a
PageRank-like implementation now.

MAHOUT PMC

Releases
--------

* MINA 2.0.3 and 2.0.4, bug fix releases, was published.
* The FtpServer subproject released 1.0.6.

Community
---------

* No committer or PMC changes.

Development
-----------

* A significant increase in activity around the 3.0 branch of MINA was
seen in this quarter. Lots of discussions and code, mostly on how to
further simplify the API.
* The SSHD, FtpServer and Vysper subprojects has all seen some, but
not a lot, of activity.
* A fair amount of questions being asked on the user lists, almost all
of which get fast replies.
* We've noticed the Deft podling which is of interest due to its
similarities with both MINA and the Asyncweb subproject. Some of the
MINA committers has gotten involved in the podling and we're hoping to
see further cooperation in the future.

Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Nutch Project

Andrzej Bialecki does not have as much time anymore
in his role as VP of the Nutch project and he has started a
thread on stepping down and electing a new chair.

It's probably not in time for this month's board meeting,
but we'll have a resolution ready for next month.

Releases:

We're still working on the 2.0 Nutch branch. Nutch 2.0
integrates Gora to provide backend independence, allowing
Nutch to store its content in HBase, MySQL, HSQL and
Cassandra. We are currently focusing on the testing phase,
and trying to benchmark 2.0 compared to the 1.x series.

We rolled a 1.3 release, the most stable release of Nutch
to date. We also created a 1.4 branch and are actively working
on developing it. Chris Mattmann volunteered to do a 1.4 release
when the time comes.

Community:

Lewis John McGibbney was elected as a Nutch PMC member and
committer.

Mailing list activity is steady, alternating between folks
using Nutch 1.x, and those bleeding-edgers who are using the
2.0 trunk.

Students in Chris Mattmann's CSCI 572 Search Engines and
Information Retrieval course at USC are actively looking at
final projects involving Nutch.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache ODE Project

== Status ==
The development speed of ODE has decreased over the last reporting
periods but we have always seen some indicators that that will change
for the next reporting period as we could vote in new committers, had at
least one release per year etc. Since it did not get better, we think
this is the right time to bring this concern to board's attention. ODE
is still a mature and powerful BPEL engine, I'd say it is widely
deployed and the best available OSS BPEL solution. It has been adopted
by several companies, and my impression is that most development efforts
currently go into the maintenance of their ODE forks. We started a
discussion on private@ode.a.o to figure out how we can revive ODE and
how we can lower the bar to get more contributions back.

== Release ==
No release to report in this quarter.

== Development ==
No significant progress to report. A refactoring to make ODE's OModel
more dynamic and thus it can deal better with backward compatibility
issues has been started in a non-public local branch.

== Community ==
Milinda Pathirage has been voted into ODE's PMC

== Project Branding Board Report Checklist ==
 * Project Website Basics : homepage is project.apache.org (ok)

Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

In May, the Struts team released Struts 2.2.3 as GA, which includes both
new features, bug fixes and enhancements as well as an important
security bug fix for an XSS vulnerability.

The said security issue was unfortunately reported via JIRA rather than
our security mailing list. The sub-optimal time to fix for this already
disclosed issue lead the PMC to a discussion on how to improve our
process for dealing with security reports. We are making progress with
this discussion, but it is not finished yet.

The security team was contacted by Helen Atkins of Veracode to review a
static security scan report on Struts 2 before disclosure, created on
behalf of an unnamed Veracode client. A few PMC members were provided
with accounts to the Veracode platform. The review did not reveal any
markable issues so far.

The development community has been quite active to prepare the next
major release of Struts 2, which is intended to remove deprecated APIs
and plugins and to add new functionality such as Portlet 2.0 (JSR 286)
support, which has been voted on to be moved out of the sandbox and to
be included in the project trunk.

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.

Trademarks and Project Banding (ongoing)

Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

Tapestry is a Java language, component-based, web framework.

This was a busy quarter for Tapestry; we've completed a switch from
Maven to Gradle as the project's build tool.

On the community side, we've elected three new committers: Francois
Facon, Bob Harner, and Massimo Lusetti.

The plastic bytecode library, developed by Howard Lewis Ship on
GitHub, was imported as a new Tapestry module, and
enhanced. Ultimately, this will break the current Tapestry dependency
on JBoss Javassist.

We've released a bug fix for Tapestry 5.2: version 5.2.6 addresses
some critical Internet Explorer 9 incompatibilities.

We've also voted to update (and document) our version naming system
and release process. We now make previews available more frequently.

Bob Harner and others have continued to improve the web site,
including changes to older documentation that improved search results
for new documentation.

Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache Tika Project

Releases
=========================
Progress towards the 1.0 release
continues and we hope to roll a 1.0 in the Q3 timeframe.

Development activity is progressing, and there are a number of
issues being worked on the user and dev lists. Notably, the Tika
command line interface now outputs JSON [1], new document formats
are being worked and/or improved: ole2 and ooxml [2], the pcap
format [3], the CHM format [4], the PRT format [5] and some new
Font parsers [6].

Based on dev discussion, Tika's MIME identifier is becoming more
prominently used in the Aperture project [7].

There was also some discussion regarding Tika's relationship with
Apache OOo [8].

Community
=========================
No new committers or PMC members elected in this quarter.

Mailing list activity on dev@ remains steady (near the ~150 message
range), while user@ is coming in at around ~50 or so messages per
month.

Chris Mattmann will give a talk at ApacheCon NA 2011 on "Apache
Tika: One Point Oh!" commemorating the upcoming 1.0 Tika release.

Chris Mattmann's CS572 Search Engines class students at USC are
doing final projects related to Search technologies, and one of
them is from Fernando Arreola [6] who is contributing new font
parsers as mentioned above.

Press
=========================
Chris and Jukka and Sally are coordinating with Priscilla Vega from JPL to
make a press release about Tika's use at NASA, as well as its use at Day
Software and other companies. The goal is to have this coincide with the
1.0 release and OSCON.

Tika In Action
==========================
Chris Mattmann and Jukka Zitting are writing a Manning book called "Tika
in Action", and it is now complete and handed off to production. All
Chapters of the book and the appendices are now available on the MEAP page
[9]. The book is set to be published in the Q2/Q3 timeframe of 2011.

Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Traffic Server Project

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features.


Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the boards attention.


Community
=========

The Apache Traffic Server community is very happy to announce the addition
of Zhao Yongming as a committer. Zhao is a hero on mailing lists, bugs,
patches and all other community activities.

Activity on mailing lists and Jira tickets continue to increase. Our
mailing lists are now reaching well over 100 users and contributors each:

    users@  - 186 subscribers
    dev@    - 142 subscribers


Three Traffic Server presentations are scheduled so far for 2011. Two for
ApacheCon 2011, and one for OSCON 2011. We're looking forward to meet and
talk about our projects and software.


Releases
========

The community is incredibly excited to announce our first stable release
in over a year: Apache Traffic Server v3.0.0 was released June 14 2011. We
would also like to thank the PR group for coordinating a press release for
this occasion. We got some significant media attention for our 3.0.0
release.

The old 2.0.x branch is being phased out, and instead we will focus our
efforts on the 3.0.x stable branch, as well as the bleeding edge
trunk. Igor Galic is the release manager for the 3.0.x branch. Going
forward, the community is planning on at least two stable major releases
per year (6 months schedule) as well as patch releases on the stable
branch.

Buildbots are setup for all major platforms, and now also includes builds
for the 3.0.x release branch. Many thanks to the infra-ops team for
supporting our CI infrastructure, it's truly invaluable.


Branding
========

We believe the project has completed all the Branding requirements.

Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

There have been no releases this quarter for Xalan-C or Xalan-J.

The new Xalan PMC is slowly gearing up and getting organized. Some things we
are working on:

1. Separate out the Java and C++ projects.

2. Get a read on the state of the project so we can come up with a
reasonable summary of the current state and where to go.

3. There was an incident with the Google Summer of Code which played out on
the Xalan-developer and Xalan-J user lists. We are trying to understand what
happened and what do to about it, if anything.

There has been a small uptick in activity on the Xalan-C mailing list. A
recent participant has been working on resurrecting the documentation
building process to prepare for a new release. The committee is hoping to
nominate this person as a committer in the near future.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

XMLBeans Board Report - July 2011

About XMLBeans:
XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a
Java friendly way. The idea is that you can take advantage of the
richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features
mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and
typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces
and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance
data.


XMLBeans missed the submission to last board meeting so this combines
information for the last month and the previous quarter.

This was a regular quarter for XMLBeans project, there were no release,
no new committers or changes in PMC.
Email traffic on mailing lists was lower than previous quarters, but for
last month the number got closer to older rate, there are still new
users with new usage questions that are answered promptly.

XMLBeans PMC responded to boards request to remove the old releases from
Apache dist.
