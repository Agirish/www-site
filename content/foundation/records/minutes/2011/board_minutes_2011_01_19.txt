 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       A special members meeting to elect new members is currently in
       recess.  We had no trouble reaching quorum and have a good
       number of nominees, so I expect this to be a fruitful meeting.

       Beyond that, little of note has happened since the last board meeting.

       Question: should minutes of members's meetings be publicly published?
       AI Craig: publish minutes for the January 2011 meeting.
       Up for grabs: publish minutes for previous meetings.

    B. President [Jim]

       For general information, please see the President's Report for the
       Member's Meeting. Supplmental info as follows:

       Melissa Warnkin is fully on-board as our EA. She has all required
       accounts, access to JIRA and subversion, an EA-specific JIRA task
       list and an archived Email alias. Next step will be in coordinating
       tasks with the various PMCs and VPs. Formal announcement to them will
       be made this week.

       Other than that, a slow month, business-wise but there was some
       spirited discussion on members@ regarding membership and trademark
       issues.

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

Nothing to report other than PMO is closing down our JCP membership, and current EC 
members representing the JCP are working out what they have to do w/in their PMCs and
ECs


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

One board-level issue: Discussion item 8.A: trademark policy ownership.

Operations And Community
========================

Projects continue to report status on implementing Branding Requirements; we 
are making good progress so far although there is still a lot of work to 
complete.

Updated the draft Third Party Event Branding Policy and sought consensus 
on promoting to final.  Working with trademarks@ and legal-discuss@ on 
expanding the Event branding policy concepts to cover domain names and 
services.  The primary mission of Apache is the distribution of software 
products for the public good; we need to clarify what our brand and marks 
policies are for other items, like services, that Apache and it's projects 
may not offer directly.

Trademarks@ continues to discuss our "licensing" policy for recognizing 
third party uses of our marks that we approve of.  This will be an ongoing 
issue for the year, both to define our branding policy, as well as to define 
any potential legal agreements we choose to make.

Continuing work on private@ on followup issues related to Sonatype's 
use of our Maven mark and with the PMC to understand their expectations for 
our management of the Maven brand.  Note that the Maven PMC's drafting of 
their own trademark guidelines is one of the reasons for discussion item 
8.A above.

External Requests
=================

Contacted a number of third parties about uses of Apache marks; all are either 
cc:'d or bcc:'d to relevant PMC private@ lists.

Greg is working with Legal Affairs to work on the appropriate action to take 
towards WANdisco's various mis-uses of our Subversion registered mark.  Given 
Subversion's past corporate history, Greg is taking this on as VP, Subversion, 
although in the future we need to clearly document whether a PMC's VP or 
VP, Brand should be driving any legal-related actions around brand.

Working with VP, Concom to finalise Event policies and issue appropriate 
approvals for upcoming third party events.

External Meetings
=================

Had a call with Cloudera's CEO to discuss their use of our Hadoop mark; call 
report sent to trademarks@ and private@p.  They plan to comply with 
our requests for renaming their CDH product, although the rebranding work 
will take some time on their website.  


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

I realize this is tardy, but wanted to still send in a note.

SPONSORSHIP
We set up new vendor registration info with Microsoft and got the first half
of the sponsorship payment.  Due to touch base with them this month to talk
more about how to work together.

We setup ACH with Google and received the extra $75k before the year's end. 
Seems like we're in good shape there.

Greg had good face-to-face talks with sponsors in a trip to San Francisco.

Cloudera needed a W-9 sent along which was done.

I got yelled at by IBM corporate because of they don't want us using their
logo unless we want to spend months working out a logo-use contract with
their corporate counsel.  Their official "blue lines" logo is now off the
thanks page.

HP is sending infra@ two servers at OSU.  The budget is approved and my
understanding is that the hardware is currently being built, but I haven't
received the shipping tracking codes yet.

Lucid's sponsorship check arrived.

VMWare's virtualization licenses have arrived.

Facebook's gold sponsorship and most all of the bronze sponsorships are due
to be renewed and are in various states of being approached.  Hope to renew
or remove from the sponsors list by next month.

DONATIONS
59 thank you letters were sent out tonight.  There was a 60th donation, but
I couldn't get Firefox to Excel to Word to Acrobat to handle the Chinese
characters. :(

Again, sorry for the late notice.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

ASF MARKETING & PUBLICITY STATUS: JANUARY 2011

I. Budget: No new expenditures have been charged against the M&P budget
since November. Sally has been traveling for most of the past month and was
unable to connect with Jim to discuss the mid-year budget, but will be doing
so before the end of January.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally has been acting as
advocate to ConCom on behalf of a Sponsor seeking to organize a conference
based on an Apache project, and has been communicating with the Branding
team regarding continued use of an unofficial/alternate ASF logo in various
news outlets.

III. Press Releases: we issued the following press release over the PR
NewsWire service:

- 11 January The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache Cassandra 0.7
- 5 January The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache OODT as a
  Top-Level Project
- 14 December The Apache Software Foundation Launches 'Apache Extras' to
  Accelerate Innovation

We are finalizing the announcement for Apache Pivot v2.0, which will likely
be disseminated the week of 17 January.

IV. Informal Announcements: the following announcements were distributed to
our dedicated press/analyst list (only; not PR Newswire), as well as posted
on the ASF blog and Twitter feed:

- 3 January Apache Subversion to WANdisco: +1 on the code contributions,
              -1 on the attitude.


We are continuing to highlight innovative uses of Apache products in the
"Did You Know?" Twitter campaign. Please forward any success stories to
Sally at press@.

V. Media Relations: we've been busy keeping up with reporter/staffing
transitions over the past few weeks, and have reached out to dozens of
outlets as part of our end-of-year communications. We are also establishing
the new schedule for the "Apache Asserts" blog on ComputerWorld UK as well,
with Isabel Drost coming on board as a new member of the blogging team.

VI. Analyst Relations: we litmus-tested the ASF's new themes for 2011 with
James, Cote, and Stephen of RedMonk, who enthusiastically supported our
direction. RedMonk also acted as analyst spokesperson for a press feature on
Apache OODT.

VII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally met with Charel Morris 13-16 December to
develop a strategic plan for marketing the 2011/Vancouver conference,
creating a master calendar and tactical punch-list, creating the Website
framework and copydeck, as well as developing the CFP and copy using the
ASF's themes for 2011 as the conference theme. Sally also kick-started the
planning process with the overall Planners team early January.

VIII. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison:

- 23-24 March: Jim will be speaking at POSSCON in Columbia,
               South Carolina.
- 25-29 July: there's a chance we'll have a presence at OSCON again;
              details are being explored.

IX. PR Newswire account: we have 4 remaining pre-paid, flat-rate press
releases available through 30 April 2011. We will be purchasing an
additional pre-paid set of 10 at a deeply-discounted, non-profit rate to
allow future announcements without interruption.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

The ASF has joined as an Initiating member the WebID Incubator.  Henry Story
is representing the ASF, and has been named as (one of) the initial chair(s).

http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/charter

Apache Incubator Clerezza is an implementation of WebID.

The PSIG continues to deliberate privately on the topic of the HTML5 spec
license.  Saturday is the deadline for escalating bugs for Last Call
consideration, with the plan being to get HTML5 to Last Call in May.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Discussions even quieter than last month, mostly in support of Trademark
discussions.  Nothing requiring board attention.

A minor revision of the Amicus Brief in support of Microsoft v. i4i re:
burden of proof in invaliding trademarks is in process.  Larry Rosen
continues to lead this effort.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For December 2010: There continues to be a steady stream of reports
of various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to
be dealt with by the security team.

7      Support question
1      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
3      Vulnerability reports of which:
       1      Vulnerability report [infrastructure, via security@]
       1      Vulnerability report [roller, via security@]
       1      Vulnerability report [httpd, via security@]

Additionally, the Tomcat and HTTPD security pages were updated to expose
the date each issue was reported to the ASF and the date each issue
was public in addition to the date the issue was fixed.  Vulnerability 
databases and researchers find this information useful.  Examples:
http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html
http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html

for details.

Confluence upgraded to the latest 3.x version, courtesy of Gavin McDonald.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
-------

TAC is going through a change, there are differing opinions within the 
committee on how to sponsor events in the future. In the past this was 
easy, we concentrated on the main ApacheCon events of the year and that 
was it.
Now TAC needs to get to know about, choose and deal with many much smaller 
events. How all this happens is not decided yet though much (sometimes 
heated) debates have started things along. The proven TAC rules regarding 
who/how/when we provide assistance, the application process and contained 
questions etc, are all in need of adapting to the smaller and varied events, 
one size fits all approach may not work for the future. I suggest we go 
back to basics, take things one new event at a time and carve out a new 
approach.

Membership Changes
------------------

Tony, Ross and Bill have all stepped down as TAC Committee Members.
Notifications were given to the board and a resolution provided.
We wish them all the best for the future and great thanks for their hard 
work over the past 2+ years.

Budget
------

Actual Budget figures related to TAC for 2009/2010 have come through and 
we are in the process of comparing those against our expected figures.
We'll contact Treasurer and EA shortly for help in this area.

We have also been tasked with coming up with a budget for the next financial 
year, this will be ready shortly also.

ApacheCon NA 2010
-----------------

Well and truly over and previous reports have provided information, just 
noting that we should start sending our feedback questionaires to all 
attendees shortly.

Upcoming Events
---------------

As of this time, no events have been announced to TAC list so currently 
nothing to prepare for.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache ActiveMQ Project

Community:
 * The development and user lists continue to stay active.
 * No new committers or PMC members added.

Development:

Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Aries Project

Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an enterprise
OSGi application programming model.

Aries graduated from the Incubator on 15th December 2010. The majority
of the items on the Incubator transfer to TLP list have been completed
but not all.

We are preparing our 0.3 release and are at the stage of removing
snapshot dependencies by working with the projects Aries depends on to
cut releases themselves. This is making good progress.

The Aries web site has now moved from Confluence to CMS. The speed to
put a page into production is much improved and very welcome.

Community update: dev@ 118 subscribers, user@ 127 subscribers. The dev@
list continues to be active with less traffic on the user@ list. No new
committers or PMC members since the December report.

There are no board level issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Attic Project

Since the last board report, ORO, ECS and Slide are now retired.
Excalibur is in the works. No changes to the PMC. No issues requiring
board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Avro Project

== Avro Board Report ==

Apache Avro tm is a data serialization and RPC system.

== Releases ==

The Avro team released version 1.4.1 on October 13th, 2010.  This release
included contributions from seven unique authors.  It included new features
such as SASL security for socket-based RPC and support for reading Hadoop
sequence files as Avro data to MapReduce API.  There were also a handful
of improvements and bug fixes across all Avro implementation languages.

== Overall Activity ==

Mailing list traffic on the developer list has averaged about 5 messages/day
since our last board report.  Much of the traffic on the developer mailing list 
is Jira-generated messages.  Since October, there have been 60 new Jiras
opened and 35 Jiras resolved that were created by 14 unique reporters.

Mailing list traffic on the user mailing list remains
around 1-2 messages a day.  Most questions on this list
pertain to Avro best practices, questions around building
a schema, etc.

== Committers and PMC members ==

There have been no changes to the Avro PMC or committers since the last
board report in October 2010.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Releases:
   2.2.12 was released
   2.3.1 was released
   2.3.2 is in final preparations (may be in voting by the time this report is 
submitted)

New committers:
   Colm O hEigeartaigh was added as a committer
   Lukasz Moren was added as a committer (GSoC Success!)
  Tomasz Opanovicz was added as a committer (GSoC Success!)
   7 PMC members that haven't been heard from in over 2 years were marked 
emeritus. 

Community update:

User and dev list traffic remains pretty steady and generally questions and
issues are answered promptly.

From an "outside the Apache Community" perspective,  3 different companies 
added information (to make a total of 4) about commercial support, training, 
and product options to the section of the CXF support page: 
http://cxf.apache.org/support.html .  Not sure if that reflects possitively or 
negatively.    :-)

No board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache DB Project

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
o DdlUtils - a small, easy-to-use component for working with Database
  Definition (DDL) files.
o Derby - an open source relational database implemented entirely in Java
o JDO - focused on building the JDO API and the TCK for compatibility
  testing of JDO implementations.
o ObJectRelationalBridge (OJB) - an Object/Relational mapping tool that
  allows transparent persistence for Java Objects against relational
  databases.
o Torque - an object-relational mapper for java.

Activities over the last quarter:
1) Asked trademarks@ for clarification on how to use a trademark
   (adjective vs noun/verb). Feedback received, work on implementing the
   guidelines not started.
2) The PMC voted to retire the OJB subproject and move it to the Attic.
   Process in progress.
3) Project name reservations on apache-extras.org .

Community
==========
Lily Wei and Greg Monroe were added to the PMC.
No new committers since August 2010.

Traffic on the lists for Derby and JDO is steady, both have most activity
on the dev lists.
Torque has some traffic, whereas DdlUtils has very little (the PMC
discussed this issue earlier and still considers the project to be
useful).
OJB will be retired.

Releases
=======
DdlUtils: no new releases (1.0, June 2007)
Derby: feature release 10.7.1.1, December 14 2010
JDO: no new releases (3.0, April 2010)
Torque: no new releases (3.3, February 2008)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Directory Project

Community
---------------

No new PMC members. One new committer (already Apache Member), Antoine
Levy Lambert, who added the delegated authentication feature.

List Subscribers:

API : 34
DEV : 173 (was 170 one year ago, 185 2 years ago)
USERS : 219 (was 189 one year ago, 145 2 years ago)


Releases
------------

None but the community is not idle preparing milestones for major
version releases.

The community has voted to change the versioning scheme we've used in
the past which was slowing us down. We've started using the Eclipse
Milestone scheme and have started work on 2.0.0-M1.

We're working on a shared-1.0.0-M1, which will include the LDAP API.
Studio 2.0.0-M1 will also be released shortly there after.

Slowdowns resulted due to the need for a full Kerberos Codec rewrite
by Emmanuel Lecharny and Kiran Ayyagari.

Various optimizations and fixes are also being done on the LDAP side
by Emmanuel.

A new ApacheDS Configuration plugin has been created by Pierre to
compliment the 2.0 ApacheDS M1 release which includes a new
configuration subsystem inside the LDAP DIT.


Miscellaneous
-------------------

There's been a great deal of refactoring and feature addition to get a
more stable ApacheDS 2.0 ready. The new release versioning scheme will
give us more flexibility over our older scheme.

Apache Project Branding requirements for all ASF marks have been
fulfilled by Stefan Seelman.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache ESME Project

Apache ESME's mission: Enterprise Social Messaging Environment (ESME) is a
secure and highly scalable microsharing and micromessaging platform that
allows people to discover and meet one another and get controlled access
to other sources of information, all in a business process context.

Moving to TLP:
Apache ESME graduated from the incubator last month. This is its first
report to the Board.  The top level project infrastructure was set up on
December 21th, and SVN was moved on December 23.  Our web-site has been
moved to the TLP position.  Our website is currently Confluence-based.
We are working with INFRA to migrate to Apache CMS. We also have a
non-Apache blog [1] that we are no longer using in order to focus on our
new Apache blog [2].

We have more work to do to complete the move to a TLP, including
removing the incubation notices and making a first release as a TLP.

Releases:
none yet (as a TLP)

2010-10-09 1.1 (Incubator - last release)

Development:
It was relatively quiet during the first part of the month, as we were
awaiting our move from the incubator to become a TLP.  Subsequently,
there has been lots of activity to complete TLP migration. We are currently
working on our 1.2 release.

A significant number of issues remain in Jira, postponed from the
last release.  There has been some progress on these, and
a few new ones have been raised.

Community:
No changes

Issues:
No Board level issues at this time

Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Hadoop Project


 Hadoop status report for January 2011

     Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and
     managing distributed applications running on clusters of commodity
     computers.

     Nigel has volunteered to RM the 0.22, and it is making progress, the previous
     RM stepped down due to not having enough time since the 6685 patch was not
     going to make this release. Progress on 6685 has not really progressed.

     Owen has volunteered to RM the 0.20.3 release, and there is discussions 
     about integrating the 'security' patch-set that Yahoo! is developing, that
     Arun has volunteered to RM. Both of these are separate branches.

     We have invited 11 new committers into the project this month, all have
     accepted, are in the process of getting their accounts setup. We also had
     2-3 people who the PMC felt were not ready for committership yet. There is
     still a lot of discussion about what the criteria of what makes a committer,
     but I think we are in a better place than before.

     We are working with the brand management team about Yahoo!'s and 
     Cloudera's use of Hadoop's name. Both of these are showing good progress
     thanks to the brand management teams hard work.

     We are still having lots of discussions about future work on the 0.20 branch
     this includes the security patch-set, adding append, and the 0.20.3 release
     The security patch-set has it's own issues, due to it requiring some work
     if it will be contributed as separate patches, and also how it the work will
     be applied to the upcoming 0.22 release. (see http://s.apache.org/NfJ & 
     http://s.apache.org/uf  for the discussions around the append branch & security 
     branches) there have been a couple of misunderstandings around the security 
     releases.

     We have also started discussions about why we have so many mailing lists, 
     what they are used for, and the possibility of combining some of them (and
     2 code bases). We have updated the website to provide better documentation.
     The codebase discussion is more about moving directories around, rather than
     combining them into a single one.

 COMMON

     Common is the shared libraries for HDFS and MapReduce.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache HBase Project

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of Hadoop
Common and Hadoop HDFS

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD's ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

We have made four release candidates for 0.90.0 since our last report
where HBase 0.90.0 is the next major HBase release to follow 0.20.0
(For more on the odd looking HBase versioning, see [1] below).

COMMITTERS

We added two new committers during this period.  Gary Helmling has
been a long-time contributor and works for Trend Micro.  Nicolas
Spiegelberg is at Facebook and has made many and substantial
contributions to both HBase and HDFS over the last year or so.

Our PMC voted to make committers == PMC members.  All committers that
were not yet PMC members were promoted.

COMMUNITY

Big news this period was the announcement by Facebook that their
Messaging will be built on top of HBase (For example, [2]).  Facebook
have been making many substantial contributions to HBase over the last
year or so.

Mailing list traffic in user is about constant with this period last
year -- ~500 mesages per month -- with spikes in September and
December where our traffic doubled over last years numbers (Its
hard to compare dev mailing list since it used conflate issues and
dev traffic since fixed).

We had a successful open hackathon at Facebook on December 13th, 2010
attended by about 30 or so folks.

A fairly quiet month for the Incubator as a whole (individual projects have
been busy).

The Apache River project (nee' Sun JINI) has been voted to have completed
Incubation, and to seek TLP status.

Mesos, a system for sharing resources (advanced resource scheduling) between
cluster applications such as Hadoop MapReduce, HBase, MPI, and web
applications, was voted to start Incubation.

Lucene.NET is returning from Lucene to the Incubator, prepatory to seeking
TLP status.

With Joe Schaefer's help, the Incubator is starting the process of migrating
to the CMS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ace

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to centrally
manage and distribute software components, configuration data and other
artifacts to target systems. ACE started incubation on April 24th 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring board or Incubator PMC attention.

Community

 * Angelo will do a talk about massive device deployment and Karl and Marcel
will be doing a tutorial about ACE in the Cloud at the upcoming EclipseCon /
OSGi DevCon.
 * Some of the feedback and follow up discussions after ApacheCon have been
discussed further on the mailing list.

Software

 * Quite a lot of work has gone into the new Vaadin based Web UI.
 * A new, simpler launcher is being worked on by Angelo.

Licensing and other issues

 * None at the moment.

Things to resolve prior to graduation

 * Make sure all our dependencies are based on released artifacts.
 * Make a release.
 * Grow the community some more.

BlueSky did not report.  There is considerble discussion on the -dev list.
Not much in the way of commits, but it does appear from the -dev list
chatter that they are starting to grow the community a bit.  The growth of
on-list discussion may be a good sign.


====

Bean Validation

The community missed their December quarterly report. So, are submitting
this report in January.

Summary

The community has been active with discussions on the dev list and code
updates. A new 0.3 release has been discussed, but is not yet underway.

Community
 * No new committers...
 * No new PMC members...

Development
 * No new releases, but a 0.3 release has been discussed.
 * Work on annotations for commons-lang 3
 * Many bug fixes

Project Branding

 * Not started yet.


====

Celix

Celix is an implementation of the OSGi Specification in C.

Celix entered incubation on November 2, 2010.

Currently the source tree is being cleaned and correct header information is
being added. We are also looking at the project structure and how it can be
changed to get a better/simpler overview. Most important aspect is
separating the actual framework from the additional bundles.
Additionally, last December a proposal for a Celix talk was sent to, and
accepted by the EclipseCon/OSGi DevCon. This provides a great opportunity to
increase awareness and build a community.

Most important issues are:

   * Add more information to the wiki (ongoing process)
   * Cleanup project, rearrange structure
   * Generate awareness and grow a community!


====

Chemistry

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in Java,
Python, PHP, JavaScript (and possibly other languages). Chemistry entered
incubation on April 30th, 2009.

Issues to address in the move towards graduation:
   * First non-Java release (PHP, Python).

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:
   * None.

Community development since the last report:
   * We have 8 active committers working on three sub projects. No new
committer has been added last quarter. There are a few regular contributors
of bug reports, suggestions and patches.
   * Traffic on the dev list is steady.

Project development since the last report:
   * A second release of the Java subproject (OpenCMIS 0.2) is under way. A
release candidate is available.
   * The Java APIs have been refined and should now be stable.
   * Continued work on the draft browser binding (JSON protocol) in the
sandbox.
   * The Python subproject (cmislib) is preparing for its first release
since joining the project.
   * The PHP subproject (phpclient) increased coverage of the spec, refined
some of the existing functionality and updated documentation. Next steps are
to begin preparations for the first release.

Chukwa

Chukwa is a distributed log collection and processing system built on top of
Hadoop. Chukwa has migrated from relational database to Apache HBase 0.20.6
for data storage.  New aggregation script has been built using Apache Pig
0.8 and Apache HBase 0.20.6 combination.  Next steps are to begin
preparations for Chukwa 0.5 release.


====

Empire-db

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development
than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient
database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety and
DBMS independence.

Project development since the last report

Last December we have finished and published release 2.0.7 that features
some minor improvements and bug fixes. Currently we are working on release
2.1.0 with more significant improvements.

Issues to address in the move towards graduation and community development

After now being 2 and a half years in the incubator we have managed to
successfully implement and establish the Apache development and release
cycle, we have published several releases and we have received good feedback
from users who are subscribed to the dev and user lists.

However during all this time, we have still not managed to get ourselves
known to a wider audience and to get a significant amount of public
attention, most certainly due to the fact that have not managed to work on
publicity as much as on code. Also our community currently consists of only
3 active committers that are regularly contributing to the project.

For this reason questions about the future of the project and whether we
will ever be able to graduate have been raised. While the remaining active
committers are determined to continue their project commitment and to work
towards graduation it is still unclear by which measures new committers can
be won to join the project.

Hence, for the coming months answering this question and establishing the
corresponding measures should be our focus. One way of answering this
question could be to move this discussion to the dev list in order to find
out how our subscribers feel about the status of the project. Also it might
make sense to combine the user and dev lists in order to prevent subscribers
from missing information and getting them more involved in the project.


====

Imperius has been incubating since November 2007.

Imperius is a rule-based policy evaluation engine based on the CIM-SPL
language from
Distributed Management Task Force (dtmf.org).

Communication continues to be intermittent, there was some interest in the
CIM binding.
The community is not requesting new features and the project is being used
in at least a handful of projects
across both academic and commercial teams.

Things to resolve prior to graduation:
* Grow the community
* Next steps and future of Imperius at Apache.
* There has been some discussions about the possibility of not successfully
graduating from the Incubator. Hopefully, this can be resolved, soon.


====

Jena

Jena was accepted into the Apache Incubator November 2010. It is an existing
project migrating to ASF. It has a large codebase that provides a semantic
web framework in Java that implements the key W3C recommendations for the
core semantic web technologies of RDF and SPARQL.

Three most important issues to address for graduation:

* Create a code base in Apache with legal clearance.
* Migrate the existing community of developers, contributors and users to
the Apache infrastructure
* Create and communicate open project processes aligned to Apache

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board to address

Community development:

We have started to advertise the existence of Apache-hosted mailing lists
and the last non-Apache release included references to these lists. Traffic
on these lists has started to grow.

We are now using JIRA alongside our old issue tracker while we migrate
across.

Project development:

Project infrastructure is now set up and tested.

The last planned, non-Apache release, was done for Jena and all the related
sub-projects.  This will minimise disturbance to users during code
migration.

Code migration to Apache SVN will begin when a software grant for the
majority of the codebase is received (from HP).  We understand that HP is
actively working on this.


====

JSPWiki

2011 January JSPWiki Incubator status report

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

A few minor bugs were fixed.

No progress in the incubation process. The project still needs to make an
official Apache release.

There have been discussions about the future of JSPWiki, considering the
long "periods of silence" and the lack of progress in the incubation
process..

Different opinions were ventilated, both positive and less positive ones
with no clear outcome.

The developer list currently has 90 subscribers; and the user
list has 190 subscribers.


====

Kitty

Kitty is a command-line based JMX administration and automation utility.

This month was primarily engaged in discussion about the roadmap of the
project.

After presenting the project to the Los Angeles Java Users Group, the
community here expressed that the utility should not only focus on Tomcat,
but should have a plugin architecture where application-specific JMX
attributes are made available by dropping in plugins in to the application.

Kitty currently doesn't have such a capability, and the kitty-dev list
agrees that Kitty should head in this direction. A document will be produced
discussing how to best achieve the modular architecture, and begin working
on adding these capabilities, beginning with Tomcat 6 and Tomcat 7 plugins.

Some small code cleanup was done, and documentation will be produce on how
to get started in developing for Kitty to promote further community
adoption.


====

Lucy

Lucy is a loose port of the Apache Lucene search engine library, written in
C and targeted at dynamic language users.

Lucy was voted into the Incubator on July 22, 2010.

Progress since the last report:

 * Software grant completed.
 * Assimilation of KinoSearch codebase completed (import, IP audit,
  relicensing, namespace migration).
 * Some dependencies with problematic licenses have been eliminated
  (others remain).
 * Release guide draft completed.
 * ASF branding requirements mostly addressed.
 * Website transition to new Apache CMS underway.
 * Continuous minor developments (e.g. versioning scheme hashed out,
tutorial
  refactored, miscellaneous bugfixes and improvements).

Top priorities prior to graduation:

 * Disperse knowledge of codebase among developers.
 * Make a release.

Issues for Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

 * None at this time.


====

Mesos

Mesos is a cluster manager that provides resource sharing and isolation
across cluster applications.

Mesos entered incubation on December 23rd, 2010

This is our first report. Since entering incubation, we've done the
following:
 - Filed CLAs for initial committers
 - Requested user accounts for initial committers
 - Got JIRA, mailing lists and SVN repository set up

Most important issues to address towards graduation:
 - IP clearance
 - Migrate code from GitHub to Apache SVN
 - Setting up a project website with help and documentation
 - Grow the user and developer community


====

Olio

Olio has been incubating since September 2008.

Olio is a web 2.0 toolkit to help developers evaluate the suitability,
functionality and performance of various web technologies by implementing a
reasonably complex application in several different technologies.

Things have been fairly quiet on both the user and developer list this
quarter.

Graduation From Incubation:

The user base is not showing growth. Since this is a test
application/workload, it is being used as such for short-term projects.


====

OpenNLP

OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural
language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization,
sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction,
chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually
required to build more advanced text processing services.

OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.

Since we last reported in December, we have completed the code import.
There has been a lot of activity on the dev list, and we're filling up Jira
with issues to resolve before we can release.  Our users also seem to have
found the way from sourceforge to Apache, as there is also activity on the
user list.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:

 * Resolve potential IP issues
 * Do a release
 * Establish open regression tests


====

Stanbol

Stanbol is a modular software stack and reusable set of components for
semantic content management.  Stanbol just entered incubation, on
2010-11-15.

Community development:
 - a group of five individuals were identified who had made substantial
contributions to Stanbol, yet were omitted from the original proposal. The
PPMC decided that, given that they intended to continue contributing, they
would vote them in as committers.

Main activities:
 - imported code cleaning
 - OpenCalais FISE engine added

Next steps:
 - Refactor package naming
 - Check build issues
 - Make a first release
 - Make the community grow


====

Tashi

Tashi has been incubating since September 2008.

The Tashi project aims to build a software infrastructure for cloud
computing on massive internet-scale datasets (what we call Big Data). The
idea is to build a cluster management system that enables the Big Data that
are stored in a cluster/data center to be accessed, shared, manipulated, and
computed on by remote users in a convenient, efficient, and safe manner.

Tashi has previously encompassed just the tools to manage virtual machines
using Xen and KVM, but is gaining the facility to hand out physical machines
as well.

Development activities have included:-
       * fix for xen root declaration (necessary if using external kernel)
       * parameterize xen root disk declaration
       * implement Miha Stopar's fix to improve handoff during migration
       * implement Miha Stopar and Andrew Edmond's patch to register and
         unregister hosts, and improve locking of resources
       * allow use of virtio disks under qemu

Richard Gass has created a branch to work on the physical machine
reservation
component (zoni-dev):-
       * allow physical machine registration
       * add integration with Apache web server for control
       * add facilities for DNS/DHCP registration of physical resources
       * make changes to Zoni DB layout (convert some tables to InnoDB)
       * add initial infrastructure hardware (switch and PDU)
       * demonstrate initial VM usage reports (shame-tashi)
       * add logging to infrastructure hardware controllers
       * add abstraction layer for hardware controllers
       * add debug console to zoni
       * add DNS/DHCP key creation functions
       * add physical to virtual cluster manager service
       * add primitive agent to keep minimal amount of machines powered
         on and scale up from there
       * allow zoni-cli to talk to hardware directly

The project is still working toward building a larger user and development
community. User groups have been identified in Ireland, Slovenia and Korea,
as well as at Georgia Tech. Several suggestions provided by users at those
sites have been implemented in the head.

Items to be resolved before graduation:
       * Prepare and review a release candidate
       * Develop community diversity (currently Intel and CMU committers)


--------------------

VXQuery

The VXQuery Project implements a standard compliant XML Query processor. It
has been in incubation since 2009-07-06.

Recent activities:

   * progress is still slow due to the small team/community size and
external commitments of the current developers

Top issues before graduation:

   * Build community (developer and users)
   * Increase development speed
   * Create a release


====

Wave

Wave a real-time communication and collaboration tool

Wave entered incubation on December 12, 2010.

We're currently in the process of moving to Apache infrastructure. Mailing
lists and continuous build have moved, source, issues and documentation has
not. On the technical side, the Wave in a Box system needs completed
persistence and search/indexing implementations, import from Google Wave,
and improvements to protocols and documentation thereof.

Most important issues are:

 * Build website and wiki on apache.org
 * Move source and issue tracking to apache.org
 * Finish implementation of major outstanding items: persistence,
search/indexing, protocols

-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Jakarta Project

Jakarta status report, January 2011. There are no issues requiring board
attention at this time.

* General

We completed the moves of two subprojects to the Apache Attic: Jakarta ECS
and Jakarta ORO.

Few improvements were made to the website, including the Jakarta news feed,
by sebb.

We added one new PMC member, Milamber. Martin Cooper withdrew from the PMC.

* Releases
  - None

* Subproject news

* BCEL
One new issue reported, no other activity.

Sizeable number of new issues opened in the tracker (25+), including a few
with patches from users.

* Regexp
No notable activity this quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache JAMES Project

=== JAMES Status Report: Jan 2011 ===

The Apache JAMES Project delivers a rich set of open source modules
and libraries, written in Java, related to internet mail  which build
into an advanced enterprise mail server.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

We are currently in the cycles to prepare stuff for the next
milestones for Apache James Server (3.0-M3), Apache James Mailbox
(0.2-M2), Apache James Imap (0.2-M2). Beside this Oleg started to
cleanup stuff for the next major release of Apache James Mime4J (0.7)
and Stefano started a discussion about what to change for the next
version of the mailet-api.


COMMUNITY

There are no new Committers or PMC Members. Anyway we received some
patches from contributers which were applied.
We will keep an eye on this to see if someone is ready for
committership during the next period.

The mailinglist got some more traffic again, we hope to see futher
increasing activity in the future.


RELEASES

We did the following releases during this period:

* Apache James Server 3.0-M1
* Apache James Server 3.0-M2
* Apache James Mime4J 0.6.1
* Apache James Protocols 1.2
* Apache James Protocols 1.3


TRADEMARKS / BRANDING

We did not tackle this yet. Anyway Manuel volunteered to make it
happen in the next quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Mahout Project

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Apache Mahout released version 0.4 on October 31, 2010. 0.4 included changes
related to 153 issues, summarized here:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAHOUT/fixforversion/12314396

It continues to change significantly and across the board, though a certain
consistent scope and identity is confirming itself at this stage. It is
a Java-based scalable data mining library that currently has much of its
implementation based on Apache Hadoop 0.20.x. It currently covers, primarily,
collaborative filtering, clustering, classification, frequent itemset mining,
and some related and supporting algorithms.

The project expects to continue with an 0.5 release around May 2011.
The 57 issues to date that are resolved or are being worked on for 0.5 are:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?pid=12310751
  &fixfor=12315255

After that, we believe, will be a 1.0 release. From 0.5, the focus will
change to making the code base stable and 1.0-ready.

MAHOUT IN ACTION

The book "Mahout in Action", published by Manning, has been completed and
will be published in February 2011.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Maven Project

* General Information
  Work continues both on Maven 3.x and various plugins and shared
  components as seen in the list below. Maven 3.x is continuing to
  follow a fairly regular 6 week release cycle. 
  
  Last month, the board asked the PMC several questions:
  1) is the "Maven" name for the project important to the PMC (as a
  whole), or not?
  2) we need the PMC to take point on addressing third party uses of
  the Maven mark
  3) Maven Central needs clarification: what the heck is it, who
  technically runs it and how it fits into the Maven community's
  ecosystem.
  
  The answer to #1 is yes.
  
  In response to #2, The PMC has recently been discussing a trademark
  policy to cover the use of Maven and MVN in products and services
  related to our project and community. This work is still ongoing,
  but the intent is to finalize and publish the initial version of
  our policy soon.
  
  In response to #3, Maven Central is a repository of Open Source
  artifacts stored in the Maven 2 layout. This is the default
  repository used by Maven to retrieve dependencies at build
  time. Think of it along the same lines of an RPM repository for
  Linux.
  
  We have been discussing ownership and management of Maven Central.
  I had done some digging and reviewing of the project charter and
  initial discussions around the time of the Maven project creation.
  I came to the conclusion that the repository was never specifically
  in the scope of the PMC, although historically members of the PMC
  were managing it. There is some disagreement with my position at
  this time and we will continue to work through it.

  We also had various discussions about dependencies and their
  projects moving from Codehaus to Sonatype and/or Eclipse.
  Specifically the projects of concern are Modello, Plexus and 
  Aether. The first two have historically been developed primarily by
  Maven Developers and consumed by Maven.

  What happens inside external projects is not within the scope of
  this PMC, although it is appropriate for us to monitor key
  dependencies in case they are no longer appropriate for us to use
  or otherwise become unavailable to us. No specific action has been
  undertaken by the PMC for any of these projects at this time.

Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Nutch Project

Report for the Apache Nutch project: January 2011

There are no board level issues at this point in time.

Releases:

Work progresses on the 2.0 Nutch branch which integrates Gora to provide
backend independence, allowing Nutch to store its content in HBase, MySQL, 
HSQL and Cassandra. We are currently focusing on the testing phase, and 
trying to benchmark 2.0 compared to the 1.x series.

There has been some desire for patches and updates to the 1.x and we are 
considering rolling a 1.3 release. If this comes to pass, Chris Mattmann has 
volunteered to RM the release.

Community:

No new PMC members or committers were elected in this quarter. Otis
Gospodnetic decided to go Emeritus from the PMC, and the board has
ACK-ed.

Mailing list activity is steady, alternating between folks using Nutch 1.x, 
and those bleeding-edgers who are using the 2.0 trunk.

Chris Mattmann gave a talk at ApacheCon NA on Nutch titled 
"Lessons Learned in the Development of a Web-scale Search Engine: 
Nutch2 and beyond".

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache ODE Project

== Status ==
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

== Release ==
Together with the community we identified a couple of performance
issues. We are in progress of releasing ODE 1.3.5 as a maintenance
release that improves the performance of ODE's XPath processing in some
scenarios by factor 10. Also around 30 bugs have been fixed and we were
working with the ServiceMix community to align ODE 1.3.5 with SMX 4.3.
The RC is currently being tested and we are looking forward to start the
release vote next week.

== Development ==
Most development efforts have been put into the analyzing and optimizing
performance issues, compatibility with ServiceMix, bug fixing and build
process tweaks. We are planning to continue with our refactoring roadmap
in the next quarter: Finalizing the JPA refactoring, solving backward
compatibility issues (i.e. supporting evolution of OModels and runtime
states) and backporting features (extension activities, process context)
from our experimental branch.

== Community ==
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. The last
reporting period was rather quiet. Nevertheless we got excellent
feedback, bug reports and patches from the community.

== Project Branding Board Report Checklist ==

    * Project Website Basics : homepage is project.apache.org ✔
    * Project Naming And Descriptions : use proper Apache forms,
describe product, etc. ✔
    * Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
www.apache.org included ✘
    * Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
footers, etc. ✘
    * Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on
your site ✘
    * Project Metadata : DOAP file checkedin and up to date ✔

Attachment V: Status report for the Apache OODT Project

Apache OODT was made a TLP at the November 17, 2010 board 
meeting. This is the second of three initial monthly reports 
before moving to Quarterly in March 2011.

Releases
-------------

Work continues towards the 0.2 release. Paul Ramirez 
volunteered [1] to RM this release. Currently we have about 44 
resolved issues [2]. We expect to put out the 0.2 release likely 
in the next month. One of the big things in this release will 
hopefully be the ability to push out to the Python Package Index 
(PyPI) [3], and also we are looking at how to deal with getting the 
OODT jars out to Maven Central as well.

Press
---------

Chris Mattmann and Dan Crichton and Sally Khudairi and Brian Knosp 
put out 2 OODT TLP press releases, one at the ASF [4] and one at the 
JPL science and technology website [5], which was picked up by the 
NASA.gov main technology website [6] and a number of other outlets. For 
instance, InformationWeek [7] ran a story, as did the sdtimes [8] and (w00t!), 
Slashdot [9]! We've received tons of feedback and interest in the project 
since the releases went out. Thanks everyone!


Community
----------------

We haven't elected any new committers or PMC members in this month since 
the last report.

We've had some new lurkers on the dev@ and user@ mailing lists, especially 
since the press release, and there are still steady contributions heading 
in including a test report and bug fix from a new user picking up the 
software for the first time [10]. We've also had some discussion and momentum 
on generating some training videos that we can post up on our site [11].

Attachment W: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

OpenEJB 3.1.3 was released in late October and contained a decent amount of
improvements and new features.  Perhaps too much.  This was largely due to the
gap between the previous release and overall the project decided more
diligence in releasing more often was a priority.  OpenEJB 3.1.4 was released
in late November.  Discussions on a 3.1.5 have started.  Things look much
improved in release frequency for 3.1.x.

The 3.2.x codebase has yet to be released in any form.  There is still some
active and unstable development on that branch with regards to Tomcat 7
support and OpenWebBeans integration, both required for Web Profile
certification.  Good progress has been made in those two areas particularly in
the last month.  Hopefully release work will start over the next quarter.
There are many anxious users.

Community remains active.  Many of the committers added last quarter still
actively participate which is good as sometimes people become demotivated once
they cross that "finish line".  We've been lucky enough to have two different
people file CLAs for access to contribute to the docs.  Both random users with
no prior interest shown in contribution.  No docs have been produced yet, but
we read the interest as a good sign.  A sign we need more docs, but that
there's too much value for users to switch to another solution and the project
is perceived as open enough that contribution is possible.

The Nabble issues reported last quarter have been largely resolved.  What was
previously an OpenEJB "category" that held two forums, dev and user, was
automatically converted on one of their many internal upgrades to a full forum
that simply didn't point anywhere so posted questions stayed on Nabble and
were perceived as ignored.  We responded to all posts that were in this forum
explaining the issue and were able to switch the forum back to a category.
Other projects who are setup in Nabble, either by themselves or by Nabble,
should review their setup as this likely happened across the board.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

There are no items requiring board attention at this time.

Highlights

The OpenJPA web presence was evaluated with regard to the trademark
and branding requirements. Most of the requirements are already met,
with the exception of direct "sponsor", "thanks", and "security" links.
There are links to the Apache sponsor, thanks, and security pages but
these are linked by the OpenJPA sponsor, thanks, and security pages.

The trickiest issue is that OpenJPA is introduced as "a Java persistence
project" which is a noun, not an adjective. This will need to be changed to
"The Apache OpenJPA project is a Java persistence project".

We have identified a volunteer to migrate the existing Confluence-based
web tool to the Apache CMS, and the changes with regard to trademark and
branding will be done concurrent with the migration.

Community

A new JSR for JPA was just posted to the JCP web site.
http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338
The terms of the sample TCK appear to be similar to the previous versions
which are acceptable for use by Apache projects.

New committers were voted into the project: Jody Grassel and Heath Thomann.

Mailing lists continue to be very active, with close to 230 messages 
per month on the dev alias and approximately 110 messages per
month on the users alias.

OpenJPA email subscriptions are stable at approximately 150 subscribers to dev
and 240 to users.

Governance

We continue to monitor contributors for possible committers and committers
for PMC members.

Releases

A branch 2.1.x has been created in preparation for a maintenance release
2.1 early in 2011.

Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

In December, the Struts team released Struts 2.2.1.1 as GA, primarily
to address a reported XSRF issue. We also released Struts Master 8, a
Maven POM update, to pick up changes from the ASF master POM.

As part of the Apache Extras initiative, the Struts team has
registered several names, viz Struts, Struts 1, Struts 2, S2, WebWork,
and XWork.

There have been a couple of questions around the contribution of web
site translations from the community. We are unaware of any ASF policy
around this, and have been addressing the enquiries on a case by case
basis.

Two new committers joined the team this quarter, namely Maurizio
Cucchiara (mcucchiara) and John Lindal (account creation pending).
There were no changes to the PMC.

Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

Tapestry is a component-oriented web framework for Java.

Branding requirements implementation progress:

- Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org [OK]
- Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe 
  product, etc. [OK]
- Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org 
  included, License and Security links are missing [PARTIAL]
- Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in 
  footers, etc.  [OK]
- Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site:
  TM missing [PARTIAL]
- Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date  It's still
  referencing Tapestry 4, need to update that. [PARTIAL]

We've had a series of beta releases for Tapestry: 5.2.2, 5.2.3 (which was 
voted down due to a problem), and 5.2.4. 5.2.4 was voted up as a GA release
on December 16th; the first GA release is almost 18 months.

A live demo of Tapestry is now available at 
http://tapestry.zones.apache.org:8180/tapestry5-hotel-booking/signin

We have deployed the new and improved web site, which is authored in 
Confluence and exported as a static web site. This includes a brand new and 
improved logo. In addition, we've had much community work 
(by non-committers, but with CLAs, and therefore access to Confluence) 
organizing and rewriting the documentation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Tcl Project

Not a great deal new to report.  Some various bits and pieces were
contributed to Rivet, such as some RPM's, and Massimo is planning a
new version of Rivet.

Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Thrift Project

Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

Community
We have not added any new committers this month.

Releases
We are currently iterating on a second release candidate of Thrift 0.6. Some
contentious backwards compatibility issues in the Java library arose at the
last second.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache Tika Project

Releases
=========================
We've made our 0.8 release [1] in November 2010. It's been 
a long time coming, and there were over 98 JIRA issues [2] 
addressed in the release. Work progresses towards a patch 
release (either 0.8.1 or 0.9) and Chris Mattmann plans to RM 
it and roll a release candidate hopefully in the next month. 
This release should fix a number of smaller issues found after 
folks have upgraded to 0.8.


Community
=========================

We added Maxim Valyanskiy to Tika PMC in November 2010 [3].

Chris Mattmann gave a talk on Tika titled Scientific Data 
Curation and Processing with Apache Tika [4] at ApacheCon NA 
in November 2010 during the Lucene and friends session. The 
morning talk was well attended and it was great to finally meet 
everyone in person!


Tika In Action
==========================
Chris Mattmann and Jukka Zitting are writing a Manning book 
called "Tika in Action", and it is progressing steadily. We 
completed our 2/3 book review and Chapters 1-8 of the book are 
now available [5] through Manning's Early Access Program or MEAP.

Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Traffic Server Project

Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
in functionality and features.

Issues
======

There are no issues that needs the boards attention.


Community
=========

Igor Galic has joined the Traffic Server PMC. Activity on mailing lists
is very good, and the community is still seeing a slow, but healthy,
growth. Several community members are actively working towards including
Apache Traffic Server in various Linux distributions.


Releases
========

The community has produced two releases since our last report:

    v2.1.4 - Primarily a large bug fix release
    v2.1.5 - Many Bug fixes and several new features (see below)


Version 2.1.5 adds several new interesting features, including

    - WCCP v2 (experimental)
    - Per transaction overridable configurations
    - IPv6 has finally landed (for client connections)
    - Much better (consistent) 64-bit support, particularly in the plugin
      SDK APIs.

Some of the changes made in the v2.1.5 (and upcoming v2.1.6) release makes
it incompatible with earlier releases. Therefore, the community has
decided that the next major, stable release will be v3.0. The expectation
is that we'll do at least one more developer release (v2.1.6) before v3.0.
