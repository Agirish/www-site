 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

     I travelled to Japan to speak at IDG's "Next Generation Data
     Center" conference.  While there I gave five interviews to
     journalists.  The primary topic of interest was Apache's Hadoop
     ecosystem, but I also tried to promote the ASF more generally
     whenever reasonable.

     Other than that, a quiet month.

    B. President [Jim]

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

    D. Secretary [Craig]

    The recording of documents received by secretary@ continues to be
    timely and smooth, with two eyes on the incoming mail basket. 
    In August, 51 ICLAs, two CCLAs, nine grants, and one membership
    application were received and filed.

    The new ICLA form and process for requesting accounts are working well.
    At times only a few minutes elapse between receipt of an ICLA and the
    creation of an account for a new committer.

 8. Discussion Items

        Should we use part of the Vancouver board meeting to reflect on 
        our goals and strategies for foundation-level activities 
        (public relations, trademarks management, outreach, finances etc.)?

        Should we plan for a face-to-face meeting within a short time
        after each annual board election? Perhaps use OSCON as a venue.

        We should start planning the board face-to-face in Vancouver.
        AI Doug: prepare the draft agenda.

ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

Continues to be quiet with nothing requiring board attention.

Community continues to actively use TCKs for those that we have 
licensed, and updates to SVN repo of TCKs happened  (thanks Mark!).

Have reached out to Oracle again about getting new and updated TCKs - 
there was a 'freeze' by Oracle legal a while ago and we may 
be able to restart the process.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================

Tomcat and trademarks@ have been working with a number of third parties to 
correct potential infringements or grant simple permissions.

The Apache Flume podling has requested an evaluation of their project name 
vis-a-vis another registered mark; more feedback from people experienced with 
our trademark policy is needed to ensure we can provide projects with 
timely advice on naming issues. 

External Requests
=================

Still waiting on the Maven PMC completing its work on maven.org domain name
MOU and confirming it with Sonatype.  (repeat from last month)

Trademark Registrations
=======================

Larry forwarded correspondence from Oracle dealing with past details of 
some OpenOffice.org trademark registrations.  This will require coordination 
between trademarks@, legal-internal@, and ooo-private@ going forward, and 
speaks to the very large scope of the OpenOffice.org donation to the ASF, 
and to our future plans for ensuring we have the capacity to manage 
the many brands our projects now use. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

SPONSORSHIP
Added Hortonworks as a gold sponsor.

Worked with PSW to process an invoice payment now that the international
wire transfer issues were solved by Geir/Sam.

Same with Liip as their payment had the same issues.

Spoke with HP about how their server donation had gone.

Working with Yahoo on invoice payment for sponsorship.

Discussed other ways Cloudera could help the ASF, steering away from more
hardware donations.

Met new points of contacts for sponsorship at Intuit and VMWare.

MISC
Declined an advertising program with AfterDownload.

My work life is starting to slow down, so starting to get back to my
sponsorship duties. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

I. Budget: we've issued two press releases on a wire service separate from
PRNewswire which requires us to pay-as-we-go; thanks to Jim Jagielski and Geir
Magnusson, Jr., we are on target with getting invoices paid on time. Melissa
Warnkin and Sally Khudairi's airfare for ApacheCon has recently been purchased
using Sam's ASF credit card.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally is working with Hortonworks
regarding a press release announcing their new sponsorship. She's also been in
discussions with a Gold-level sponsor regarding publicity on a project they're
preparing to submit to the Apache Incubator.

III. Press Releases: we issued the following announcements over the NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire service (please see Section IX for further details):

- 13 September: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache Whirr as a
  Top-Level Project

- 30 August: The Apache Software Foundation Announces 10th Anniversary of Apache
  POI


Upcoming announcements planned for distribution include the 10th anniversary of
Apache Lucene. The Apache Tika v1.0 announcement will now take place the week of
ApacheCon. There's a chance for a blog entry on the v1.7 release of Apache
Subversion; the announcement was pre-empted in two vendor product press releases
last week, which nullifies the efficacy of an ASF-issued press release on the
wire.

IV. Informal Announcements: in addition to the above two press releases being
posted on the ASF blog, we also published a blog entry titled, "Belated
congratulations to the Apache Turbine team on a decade at the ASF and the
milestone release of Turbine-4.0-M1!"

In addition, the following items were announced on @TheASF Twitter feed:

NOTE TO ALL PMCs! We're Seeking Success Stories! Do consider forwarding
innovative/newsworthy metrics/users/datapoints of Apache products for the "Did
You Know?" Twitter campaign. Please contact Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org for
more information.

V. Media Relations: a very quiet month reactively, however, there's been quite a
bit of press coverage on an NSA submission to the Incubator, as well as the
above-mentioned Subversion pre-announcements. We still need more Board-level
spokespeople!

VI. Analyst Relations: Sally met with RedMonk co-founder James Governor two
weeks ago, and will be meeting with co-founder Stephen O'Grady this week. A
reminder for anyone wishing to participate in their Monktober developer forum
http://monktoberfest.com/ to go ahead and sign up. Select complimentary passes
may also be available. Please contact Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org for more
information.

VII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally met with Nick Burch at length to discuss the work
needed to get the event back on track, and held an in-person work session with
conference producer Charel Morris last week. Much of the work has been
completed, but we're still not fully caught up. Melissa's assistance will still
be needed to ensure we're on schedule.

VIII. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: a very quiet month; no
active action items need attention at this time.

IX. PR Newswire account: we have 7 pre-paid press releases with PRNewswire
through 3 March 2012. Sally has established an account with NASDAQ for press
release distribution through their GlobeNewswire service at a lower flat-rate
than PRNewswire. This will be used as our distribution channel for
project-related announcements and other Foundation-level news.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

Henry Story joined the Read Write Web and Web Crypto API Community Groups.

Andy Seaborne rejoined the SPARQL-WG as the WG was rechartered.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Back to being a more quiet month.  Longest public threads deal with the ooo
podling exploring under what conditions an ICLA is necessary, and I see no
issues coming out of that thread.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For August 2011: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.  August saw the HTTPD team spend a lot of effort
on CVE-2011-3192 (byterange remote DoS, apache-killer.pl).

2     Support question
2     Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
2     Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
6     Vulnerability reports, of which:
      1     Vulnerability report [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org] [CLOSED]
      1     Vulnerability report [struts, via security@struts.apache.org]
      4     Vulnerability report [httpd, via security@apache.org]

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

General
-------
An anti harassment policy for concom organised events was approved and
published. The producers approved a proposed policy for ApacheCon (which was
similar but not the same), and this has now been published. Progress on the
2nd version of the policy to cover additional forms of harassment (the
policy concentrates most on the problems we know we have had, but not all
kinds) has stalled. A champion to drive this is probably needed.

A one day Apache track (with 5 Apache selected and related talks) will take
place at GotoCon in Amsterdam in about a month. We'll review how well Apache
organised tracks, aiming more at users, co-located with external events
work after this. We also have a 1 day hackathon afterwards, signup so far
has been a little disappointing, so this will likely be a small event
(though fun for those there!)

We expect to approve the final proposal for the "Apache Asia Roadshow" in
Shanghai in October soon (currently pending an updated submission based on
feedback from the committee). Several experienced members are kindly
mentoring and helping the local Chinese committers with this, and the Subversion
PMC is looking to co-locate something with this.

More work has been done on the archive apachecon site, and some talk slides
have been added. We hope to add more soon too. We are waiting on infra for a
few bits relating to this site though (INFRA-3931)

BarCamps
--------
BarCampApacheOxford was 1.5 weeks ago, and went well. Around 60 people
attended, and lots of excellent sessions were held. Local sponsorship ended
up covering all of the costs. Two committers who are hoping to run local
barcamps took part in the organising and attended, and we hope to hear more
about their own events soon.

BarCampApacheSpain in Serville (Sevilla) is about a month away, and
progressing nicely.

Things progress with a planned BarCampApache on the Saturday after
ApacheCon. The local organisers have met several times, and we're just
waiting on a confirmed venue before announcing signup. The ApacheCon
planners have discussed rooms for the hackathon and Tuesday in-conference
BarCamp, which is now largely sorted.

Ari continues to look for possible venues for a 2nd BarCampApacheSydney (the
lovely spot used last year isn't alas an option)

No other BarCamps are currently planned. Robert is looking into a possible
Bradford one for next year though.

ApacheCon NA 11
---------------
Registration stood at just under 300 at the last report from the producer
(including committers and speakers), which apparently compares fine to past
years.

The rooms for meetup spaces have been largely confirmed, and we hope to
announce meetup signups to PMCs soon. Submissions for the Fast Feather Track
are still being sought, and we may be able to add additional spots for this
if we get enough good proposals.

Nick and Sally have had several discussions (including one in person) to
discuss ApacheCon, and met with the producer for two hours to discuss
progress and problems. Once we get meetup signups announced, and a talk for
the current single gap confirmed, we look good for the ASF task list. The
list of producer tasks needed was confirmed. Some have now been done, others
are expected soon, and Sally is driving the process of ensuring they get
done. Lots of positive things came from the meeting too.

Future ApacheCons
-----------------

Discussions have begun on the apachecon-discuss list about two possible
future ApacheCons with very different formats. One would be a producer
driven event in a typical conference hotel, much like past ones, and the key
questions here revolve around what the producer would do/not do, and what
we'd do. The other would be a more community style event, in a SAP
conference venue with the venue costs covered by SAP sponsorship.

We don't expect to have anything ready for approval for several months,
especially on the former. We would encourage any board members with
experience and/or interest to join in the discussions.

Committee
---------
No changes this month. An email was sent to members@ about a number of
foundation committees (including ConCom) about a month ago, but no new
volunteers stepped forward. We may look at encouraging some of the likely
possible new people over beers in Vancouver!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

New Karma:
==========

Finances:
==========

Payments to staff were about 1 week late this month.

Board Action Items:
===================
Intervision LOC needs to be signed,filled out,and sent

approved/dell-2011-05.pdf needs to be moved to paid by treasurer@

General Activity:
=================
Response time on new account requests remains under
2-3 days.

The harmonia (svn.eu) bad disk situation remains unresolved
at this time.

Ordered a replacement host for aurora (www.eu) from a Dell
reseller in Germany. Cost = 5259.80 EU.  It is to be shipped
to Hippo for eventual installation by Bart van der Schans.

Daniel Shahaf improved our automated banning of abusive IP
addresses with respect to svn traffic.

Failed to successfully incorporate Terry Ellison of the
openoffice.org (ooo) project into the infrastructure community.
Terry was working on migrating the existing wiki and forum
services for that project to ASF gear, but gave up after
being frustrated with his interactions with the ooo community
at the ASF and the infrastructure team in particular.  His
volunteer efforts will be missed.

Mark Thomas successfully migrated the ooo bugzilla instance
to ASF gear.

Mark Thomas also improved our svn traffic banning schemes.

Upgraded our relative state of paranoia following breakins to
kernel.org and linux.com.

Lost a disk in hermes' (mail) zfs array which was subsequently
replaced with an existing spare in the rack.  We need to look into
purchasing another spare of the same specifications for future
disk failures, as there are none left for us to use in the rack.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee



-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Abdera Project

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera continues to be fairly quiet. There have been no releases for 7
months and no committer or PMC changes for a year. There have been
about 30 commits this year from three different committers, some as
recently as July. There are emails on the user list that mostly get
answered and occasionally patches get submitted and applied or bugs
get fixed, and so far whenever a new release has been asked for it has
been done.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache APR Project

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.

Releases
--------

Version 0.9.20 of the legacy APR 0.9 series was released September
16, 2011 to deliver a security fix which was already available in
the current series.

(The active branches had releases in May of this year.)

Community
---------
New PMC members or committers: none

The number of open bugs and enhancement requests has grown slightly
to 133 during the current reporting period, with little developer
activity focused on them, such that the newly opened bugs are mostly
unaddressed.

Mailing list activity is relatively low at present.

Development
-----------
Activity has been minimal.

Issues
------
There are no board-level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Archiva Project

Apache Archiva is an extensible repository management software that helps
taking care of your own personal or enterprise-wide build artifact 
repository. It is the perfect companion for build tools such as Maven, 
Continuum, and ANT.

Releases
--------

* No releases for this quarter

Community
---------

* The sandbox was opened to all Apache committers, after committers on other
  projects expressed interest in getting involved with some proof-of-concept
  work.

* Olivier Lamy was added to the Archiva PMC.

* Wendy Smoak resigned from the Archiva PMC.

Development
-----------

* As reported in the last board report, there were a number of planned 
  refactorings of Archiva trunk: moving the UI to another framework, removal
  of all plexus components, and replace or overhaul the security system 
  used. The removal of all plexus components has been completed. 
  Implementation of REST services in preparation for the UI improvements and
  for possible use of Archiva as an OSGi Bundle Repository, is currently 
  on-going.

Planned releases for next quarter: Sandesha2/Java 1.6.1, Rampart/Java
1.5.2 and 1.6.1, Axis2/C 1.7.0

Branding checklist for subprojects with releases in the last two
quarters (Axis2/Java, Rampart/Java, Sandesha2/Java):

* Project Naming And Descriptions: OK
* Website Navigation Links: OK
* Trademark Attributions: OK
* Logos and Graphics: TM not yet included in product logos
* Project Metadata: OK

Not yet compliant:

* Axis2/Java Transports
* C/C++ subprojects
* Project homepage (needs review anyway)

Community:

* No new committers/PMC members.
* No issues requiring board attention.
* We worked closely with the Geronimo folks to produce an Axis2 release
  with several fixes required for Geronimo 3.0.
* Sagara Gunathunga started an initiative to make it easier for new
  people to start contributing to the Axis2/Java project.
* The Axis PMC was incorrectly mentioned in the last infra report as
  having ignored requests to clean up the /dist area. We were able to
  settle the issue with the infra team. We keep two versions of (only)
  the following subprojects in the /dist area: Axis2/Java (1.5.x and
  1.6.x), Rampart/Java (1.5.x and 1.6.x) and Sandesha2/Java (1.4.x and
  1.6.x).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Camel Project

Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration framework
based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns.

Community:
* There are a few issues that require the board intervention.
* The project is healthy and continues to grow
* Three PMC members moved to emeritus status: djencks,
 bsnyder and romkal

Development:
* Development continues with new features and fixes on trunk
  and the camel-2.7.x and 2.8.x maintenance branches
* Brian Fox reported LGPL dependencies shipped with exactly
  2 camel components (camel-web and camel-web-standalone)
  in version 2.4.0 released more than a year ago on 
  06/12/2010. I can confirm his findings, not sure what the
  right solution is though, will discuss this in the PMC.

Releases:
* 2.8.1

-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Cayenne Project


Apache Cayenne is an open source persistence framework providing 
object-relational mapping (ORM) and remoting services.

Development

Work on 3.0.3 (STABLE) and 3.1 (ALPHA) releases continue.
Artifacts for 3.1 Milestone 3 prepared and awaiting vote for release. 
This release was delayed by changing the build/release procedures to 
be more Maven-centric.

Google Summer of Code: Ksenia Khailenko was mentoring Eshan Sudharaka on 
adding Cayenne Modeler support into Eclipse. The project was completed 
successfully and will now be evolving further within the project.
DocBook migration of the project documentation (currently in Confluence) 
is beginning. We are happy with the toolset so far. Output to html and 
pdf already working, which is an improvement on Confluence.

Web site

Unfinished items from Branding Requirements:

Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, 
link to www.apache.org included -> Needs work. Consider how to rearrange 
navigation to avoid confusion between links which leave the Cayenne site 
and those which don't.
Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site -> OK, 
other than 'tm' symbols
Further work on the website styling on hold pending our evaluation of Apache 
CMS  as a replacement for Confluence (for the pages which aren't product 
documentation).

Community

Dzmitry Kazimirchyk added as a committer.

Mailing list activity is above average on developer and user lists. The user
list has seen a spike of questions from newcomers to Cayenne and several of 
the questions led to wide-ranging discussions. Many users are also starting 
to use the 3.1 milestone and asking questions about configuration which 
aren't well documented yet.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Chemistry Project

== Status report for Apache Chemistry ==

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in
Java, Python, PHP, and .NET (and possibly other languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.


== Project status ==

OpenCMIS makes steady progress. Beside bug fixes and a few smaller new
features, interoperability has been improved, OSGi support has been
added and the TCK has been enhanced.

There is little activity around the other sub-projects.


== Community ==

Tim Raff joined the PMC. Tim provided the OpenCMIS Client API
Developer's Guide.

In general, we are seeing more users helping other users on the 
mailing list.


== Releases ==

OpenCMIS 0.4.0 has been released in July.
OpenCMIS 0.5.0 will be released soon.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

Nothing to concern the board at this time.

The Commons is an Apache project focused on all aspects of reusable Java
components.

Several new components are now handled under the umbrella of Commons.
Some have been transferred from Jakarta (BCEL, BCF, JCS), and one has
graduated from Incubator (OGNL).  New sandbox components have also been
created (classscan, graph, meiyo).

These new components have increased the size of the Commons community,
and existing components still attract new blood.  There are lots of
discussion on the developers list and slightly less on the users list.
Henri Yandell conducted of a review of our activities and showed it was
very high.  All this shows the community is healthy.

We are happy to have new commons sandbox committers:
   - Mark Struberg (struberg)
   - David Blevins (dblevins)
   - Gerhard Petracek (gpetracek)

Some new committers were elected in commons proper:
   - Greg Sterijevski (gregs)
   - SÃ©bastien Brisard (celestin)

As part of the transfer of BSF from Jakarta to Commons the following
committers were added:
   - Rony Flatscher (rony)
   - Ant Elder (antelder)

As part of the transfer of BCEL from Jakarta to Commons the following
committers were added:
   - Dave Brosius (dbrosius)

As part of the transfer of JCS from Jakarta to Commons the following
committers were added:
   - Aaron Smuts (asmuts)
   - Thomas Vandahl (tv)
   - Scott Eade (seade)

As part of the graduation of OGNL to Commons the following committers
were added:
   - Marc Davidson (javadrewd)
   - Jesse Kuhnert (jkuhnert)
   - Luke Blanshard (leadpipe)
   - Lukasz Lenart (lukaszlenart)
   - Maurizio Cucchiara (mcucchiara)
   - Upayavira (upayavira)
   - Olivier Lamy (olamy)

A new PMC member has joined us:
  Gilles Sadowski

After years of great work, Phil Steitz decided to step down as PMC
chair and was replaced by Luc Maisonobe.  Thanks for all the work
Phil!

Numerous releases have occurred this summer for various components:

 Apache Commons Net            3.0.1  (June      6th)
 Apache Commons Digester       3.0    (July      6th)
 Apache Commons Daemon         1.0.6  (July      8th)
 Apache Commons Lang           3.0    (July     19th)
 Apache Commons Compress       1.2    (July     31st)
 Apache Commons Lang           3.0.1  (August   10th)
 Apache Commons Daemon         1.0.7  (August   12th)
 Apache Commons VFS            2.0    (August   24th)
 Apache Commons Configuration  1.7    (September 8th)

There was one security fix for Commons Daemon (CVE-2011-2729) which was
promptly fixed and released with Apache Commons Daemon 1.0.7.

Phil Steitz will give a talk about a Commons component (Nabla) at
ApacheCon in November.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  It is
different from "usual" CI servers in that it expects the individual
project builds to succeed; its purpose is to check the integration of
a project with the latest code rather than a fixed version of the
project's dependencies.  If you want a more traditional nightly build
server, Gump is not for you.  Use Gump if you want to know when a
change in your dependencies breaks your project or when your changes
break other projects.

Gump's intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle
that makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

No development activity at all, no issues.

== Issues ==

There are no Board level issues.

== Community ==

The Gump project really consists of two parts, the code base for the
project and the ASF installations[1] running this code base to build
many ASF projects as well as some related projects.

The code base mostly does what its current users need so there isn't
much development going on at all.  No new committers have been added.

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.  There are a few people contributing across all
projects and a few additional people maintaining the metadata of the
projects they are interested in the most.

No changes to the PMC.

The past quarter several projects built by Gump have been moved to the
Attic and now are no longer built by Gump, the only notable addition
is the Tomcat 7 branch.

== Development ==

None.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Infrastructure ==

No new is good news.

== Project Branding Requirements ==

We believe to meet all requirements by now.

== Statistics ==

As of Sat, 17 Sep 2011 the ASF installations check out a bit more than
170 source trees (114 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
less than 800 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes about eight hours
on vmgump.  Timings for the FreeBSD jail and the MacOS X server are
currently not available as either build is having issues.

Some builds have been removed since the projects moved to the Attic
(Cactus, for example).

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ , a
FreeBSD jail at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/public/ and a Mac OS
X Server at http://adam.apache.org/gump/


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

At the time of the last report, the Apache Harmony community were
undertaking discussions to identify a new goal for the project.  Those
discussions have failed to establish an alternative effort, and without
any active development underway it now seems time to propose moving
Apache Harmony to the Attic.

There have only been very minor code changes and mailing list traffic
for several weeks, and all the requests for further information relevant
to the Oracle vs. Google subpoena seem to have been satisfied.  Winding
up the project and PMC should, therefore, not be a problem for the needs
of the Foundation.

The Board should expect to see a resolution at the next meeting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Hive Project

Apache Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Apache Hadoop.  It
provides SQL to query and manage data (in the form of tables and
partitions stored in HDFS or external systems) and provides a
metastore containing metadata information about the stored data.

Releases:

0.7.1 released on June 21, 2011.

The 0.8.0 release is expected within a few weeks.

Community:

* No new committers or PMC members.

* 373 contributors (commented, filed bugs or contributed to
Hive). This was 316 at the last report time (June 2011)

* As part of Hadoop Summit, we held a Hive Contributor Day at the end
of June, where we discussed contributor best practices, use cases,
roadmaps, and plans for growing the set of available UDF's.

Branding Checklist:

We've created HIVE-2432 to track this, with sub-tasks corresponding to
each item.

* Project Website Basics:  [DONE]
* Project Naming And Descriptions: [IN PROGRESS]
* Website Navigation Links: [NOT STARTED]
* Trademark Attributions: [NOT STARTED]
* Logos and Graphics: [NOT STARTED]
* Project Metadata:  [NOT STARTED]

-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The flood of Hadoop related projects continues with new Incubator projects:

* HMS (now Ambari), a monitoring, administration and lifecycle management
project for Apache Hadoop clusters
* Accumulo, a sorted, distributed key/value store based on Google's
BigTable design, and built on top of Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift

were voted to start Incubation, along with:

* Kalumet, a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Other projects under discussion:

* S4 (Simple Scalable Streaming System), a general-purpose, distributed,
scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows
programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous,
unbounded streams of data.

OGNL should be moving to Apache Commons.

---------------------------------------------------

Ambari (was HMS)

Ambari is monitoring, administration and lifecycle management project for
Apache Hadoop clusters.

* Incubating since 30 August 2011.
* Changed name to Ambari over trademark concerns.
* In process of moving onto Apache infrastructure:
  * Jira and subversion created.
  * Mailing lists requested (6 Sep), but not created.
  * Confluence requested (6 Sep), but not created
  * Committer accounts created.
  * Working on initial code import and code grant.


----

BeanValidation

Bean Validation was accepted into Incubator on 1 March 2010.

The Bean Validation project is an implementation of the Java EE Bean
Validation JSR303 specification.

There are no other important issues open before a possible graduation.
Actually the project is discussing its graduation as TLP or into
Apache Commons, as natural successor of Commons Validator.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of

* none

How has the community developed since the last report

* Users community activity is stable, users slightly decreased the
activity of filling issues on JIRA and asking questions, we suppose
codebase/provided documentation start being mature enough to satisfy
users needs.

How has the project developed since the last report.

* Started a 'extras' module development where putting validators
not included in the JSR303 spec.
* planning the development for implementing next JSR330 spec version.

Bigtop

Bigtop is a project for the development of native packaging and stack tests
of the Hadoop ecosystem.

Bigtop entered incubation on June 20, 2011.

Primary issues blocking graduation:
* Need for increased diversity and additional committers.
* Incubating release including testing framework.
* Incorporation of functional stack testing.

Issues which Incubator PMC and/or ASF Board might need/wish to be aware of:
* Due to limitations in available platforms on Apache Jenkins infrastructure
and need for VM spin-up/spin-down for tests, we are working directly with
OSUOSL on build/test setup.

Community development since last report:
* Community meetup held August 18th, with mentors and committers alike.

Project development since last report:
* 0.1.0-incubating released.
* Website created.
* Additional component project (Mahout) added.
* Supported platforms voted on.
* Initial implementation of package validation tests implemented and live.


----

Deft

Deft is a non-blocking, asynchronous, event driven high performance web
framework running on the JVM.

Issues before graduation
* Project rename (Deft seems to be trademarked)
* Put together a first incubation release
* Find new committers

The PPMC has discussed that we probably need to rename Deft. The reason for
this is to avoid future complication because of trademarks associated with
Deft.

No significant change has been noticed regarding the Apache Deft community.

The Apache Deft web page is up and running (still a lot of documentation to
be done).


----

Etch

Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a
variety of programming languages.

- Etch binding-cpp is currently in development and some parts of the basic
framework (OS abstraction layer, collection types, basic Etch components)
are already implemented and available in the trunk
- A new developer Martin Veith from the BMW Car IT provided a lot of patches
and some documentation stuff
- Fixed some smaller bugs in the C, Java and C# bindings
- The new Apache Etch website is nearly complete
http://etch.staging.apache.org/etch/ and will be migrated to the public area
while the next weeks. A detailed Etch documentation will be converted
afterwards (Docbook PDF and HTML)
- Community ramp up a little bit and we hope to get a better grounding

future tasks:
- Prepare next release and publish it
- Migrate to new Apache Etch CMS
- Further development of the binding-cpp
- Community development

need him to move forward or remove him.


----

Gora

Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache
Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Port Gora code and license headers into ASF license headers.
  2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with
infection into existing ASF projects like Nutch and Hadoop.
  3. At least one Gora incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

In July 2011, we elected Ioannis Cannelos to the Gora PPMC and as a Gora
Committer. We've also had a lot of interest from the Nutch community lately
(specifically Lewis John McGibbney) as they are trying to help us get a
stable version of Gora 0.2 trunk out the door and working with Maven Central
so that Nutch as a downstream consumer can leverage Gora in it's 2.0 trunk
version.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.

We are on RC #4 for Gora 0.1.1-incubating, a small patch to 0.1-incubating
to get Maven dependencies working and a process in place. There has been
some recent dev activity in trunk by Alexis Detreglode to get a new
Cassandra back-end store in place, and improve upon the existing one. There
are also efforts underway by Henry Saputra to get a CI build on Jenkins
going for Gora.


----

Hama

Hama was accepted into Incubator on 20 May 2008. Hama is a distributed
computing framework based on BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing
techniques for massive scientific computations.

* Invite new active committers

== Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board ==

None.

== Community development ==

* Now we have 3 people ready to become committers (ChiaHung Lin, Thomas
Jungblut, Miklos Erdelyi).
* 'Miklos Erdelyi' has contributed graph computing framework on top of BSP.

== Project development ==

* Now we support multi-task.
* Migrated from Forrest to Maven site.
* Some bug and performance issues are fixed.
* Plan to integrate with Hadoop nextGen.


----

HCatalog

HCatalog is a table and storage management service for data created using
Apache Hadoop.

The most important issues in moving the project to graduation are expanding
the community of developers and producing a release of the software.

Since the last report we have:
* Made several attempts at an initial release, each of which have had issues
with NOTICE or DISCLAIMER files.  We are preparing for another release
candidate.
* Continued feature development, adding two major new features (ability to
write multiple partitions at once and a notification interface for data
consumers).
* Added significant testing

Currently there are 60 subscribers to the user list and 59 on the dev list.
There were 32 and 30 respectively last report (June 2011).


----

Isis

Isis is an ALv2 licensed implementation of the Naked Objects pattern. It is
based on contributions of the original Naked Objects Framework along with a
number of sister projects that were developed for the book "Domain Driven

* Frequent commits
* Isis members attended BarCamp Oxford in Sept, presented on Isis

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

* More blogging/publicity from existing community...
* More users of the framework...
* More committers to the framework

None of these issues requires Board attention.

New Releases

* Next release expected in Nov 2011


----

Kafka

Introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011

Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe
messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence
of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the
message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading
data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.

A list of the most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Successful podling release.
  2. Invite diverse new active committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

Not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Mailing list traffic for July-August-September[12th] (user: 40, 65, 19; dev:
116, 371, 63) both show healthy growth trends.  Qualitatively the -dev
discussion has trended away from topics like "how should we configure Jira?"
to "What's the best way to deal with multiple language bindings?".  Several
patches were submitted by first time contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

The general theme over the past month has been polish: fixing bugs, better
unit tests, getting log levels right, build system cleanup etc.


----

Kato

Kato was accepted into the Incubator on 6 November 2008.

Kato is a project to develop the Specification, Reference Implementation,
and TCK for JSR 326: the JVM Post-mortem Diagnostics API.

Recent Activity:

* Some JIRA items have been raised regarding the commandline tomcat
commands.
* Discussions with Oracle have been continuing. An individual from Oracle
has been identified, but no discussions have come from this yet.

The following is planned for next reporting period:

* Decide in what form the podling should continue, if at all.

Before this project can graduate we need to encourage more participation in
the project and grow the community.

ManifoldCF

--Description--

ManifoldCF is an incremental crawler framework and set of connectors
designed to pull documents from various kinds of repositories into search
engine indexes or other targets. The current bevy of repository connectors
includes Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink (OpenText), Meridio
(Autonomy), SharePoint (Microsoft), JDBC, CIFS file systems, CMIS
repositories, RSS feeds, and web content. Output support includes Solr,
MetaCarta GTS, and OpenSearchServer.  ManifoldCF also provides components
for individual document security within a target search engine, so that
repository security access conventions can be enforced in the search
results.

ManifoldCF has been in incubation since January, 2010. It was originally a
planned subproject of Lucene but is now a likely top-level project.

--A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation--

1. We need at least one additional active committer, as well as additional
users and repeat contributors
2. We want to finish the current release before graduating
3. We'd like to see long-term contributions for project testing, especially
infrastructure access

--Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?--

All issues have been addressed to our satisfaction at this time.

--How has the community developed since the last report?--

A book has been completed, and is now available in early-release form,
available from Manning Publishing, at http://www.manning.com/wright.  We
have signed up a new committer in this quarter and are discussing a second.
One of our mentors (Grant Ingersoll) resigned.

We continue to have user community interest.  We are participating this year
in both Apache Eurocon and Apache North America.  We've had a number of
extremely helpful contributions from the field, including the CMIS connector
and the OpenSearchServer output connector.  We have started to discuss
graduation from the incubator, which may come to pass by the end of the
year.

--How has the project developed since the last report?--

An 0.1 release was made on January 31, 2011, and a 0.2 release occurred on
May 17, 2011.  Another release is scheduled for September 15, 2011, and will
contain significant new features, including two new connectors and a client
scripting language.


----

MRUnit - a library to support unit testing of Hadoop MapReduce jobs.

* Eric Sammer doing a great job pushing development forward.
* Discussions about producing first MRUNIT release candidate.

Issues before graduation
* Make an incubating release
* Grow the community size and diversity

Licensing and other issues
* none - MRUnit was originally a subproject of Hadoop


----

ODFToolkit

The ODF Toolkit is a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation,
scanning and manipulation of OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF)
documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation of
heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit is
lightweight and ideal for server use.

* ODF Toolkit entered incubation on Aug 1st, 2011.

* Most important issues to address.
 1) Growing the community, increasing diversity of committers
 2) Technical migration from the ODF Toolkit Union to Apache
infrastructure, including code repository, website, bugzilla and wiki.
 5) Successful podling release.

* Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of
 None at this time.

* How has the community developed since the last report
 The mailing lists are ready now for 23 days.  We have 37 subscribers. We
invited the existing users to this new community and are trying to attract
more new people join us.  This should be easier once we have code in the
repository.

* How has the project developed since the last report.

Requests are in queue with Apache Infra for loading the code repostiory and
the issue tracker.   70% website and wiki migration work has been done.


----

Oozie

Oozie is a workflow management and scheduler primarily for Hadoop based
jobs.

Oozie entered the incubation on July 11, 2011.

* A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:
  * Make the first Oozie release from Apache incubation.
  * Improve the documentations: user, development for quicker adoption
  * Establish the formal contribution process (such as CTR vs RTC)

* Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of:
  * No issues.

* How has the community developed since the last report:
  * Oozie users from github started moving to Apache Incubator.
  * Using new Apache Oozie JIRA for issue tracking.
  * Using oozie-users and oozie-dev mailing list provided by Apache instead
of the same from yahoo group.

* How has the project developed since the last report.
  * Oozie source code is migrated to Apache SVN.
  * Oozie code originally had Yahoo License. Replace those text by Apache
License.
  * Oozie product web page is created.  Further improvement is ongoing on.
  * Old github Issues and JIRA have been migrated to Apache Oozie JIRA.


----

OpenOffice.org

* OpenOffice.org entered incubation 2011-06-13.

OpenOffice.org is an open-source, office-document productivity suite
providing six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format
(ODF).  OpenOffice.org is released on multiple platforms.  Its localizations
support 110 languages worldwide.

* Most Important To Address

1) Migration of the legacy OpenOffice.org website's content and services to
Apache infrastructure, including defect tracking, wiki, forums, mailing
lists, and cross-service registration using customized software not already
supported by Apache projects and infrastructure.  Successful negotiation of
governance migration of user-supported services brought under incubation.
Resolution of copyright, license and notice for content migrated from
legacy OpenOffice.org website.

2) Completion of the IP-review portions of the incubation checklist, which
will require getting an amended SGA from Oracle to cover additional source
files; scrubbing of incompatible notices from SGA-licensed code and
resolving provenance of other existing materials being migrated.

3) A Successful Podling Release

* Issues for IPMC or ASF Board Awareness

Notices concerning encryption methods employed in code now in the podling
SVN have not been produced; legal-discuss is being consulted in regard to
product class for OpenOffice.org.

* Community Development Progress

As of 2011-09-12 there are 72 committers, with 55 on the PPMC, up from 71
and 52 at last report.  Eleven initial committers have failed to submit
iCLAs and are out of communication.

Discussion is underway with the operators of the existing OpenOffice.org
user-support forums for migration of the forums into the project, with
adjustment of governance to provide appropriate PPMC oversight.

We have created a ooo-users.i.a.o mailing list.  A Japanese-language
ooo-general-ja.i.a.o is also starting.

We have reviewed a request for permission to use the OpenOffice.org
trademark by a German book publisher, and sent our approval recommendation
to Apache Branding.

A "Building OpenOffice.org for Linux" buildfest was announced on the project
blog and carried out over the Internet in the first full week of September.


* Project Development Progress

The OpenOffice.org trademarks have been transferred to Apache.  The
OpenOffice.org domain-name registrations are being transferred to Apache.

The legacy OpenOffice.org Issue Tracking Bugzilla has been moth-balled as
read-only and an Apache Bugzilla established for continuation of Issue
Tracking under the podling.

The main source code base has been transferred to Apache SVN and is being
actively tested and modified.  Merging of additional work spaces from
OpenOffice.org, and preservation of versioning history is being pursued.
The current effort is focused on successful build of a counterpart of the
last complete build at OpenOffice.org.

Test configurations of the OpenOffice.org forum system and the
OpenOffice.org Wiki have been brought up on Apache infrastructure fixtures.
Cutover of the forum system is anticipated as part of the OpenOffice.org
migration.

Detailed planning continues on public wiki:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OOOUSERS/


----

RAT

Rat audits releases.

A renewed push started to find a final status for Rat. A consensus emerged
that the best destination for Rat would be a top level project, even if the
scope is broad enough to allow a suite of related products to be developed
by the community. Hopefully, Rat will be in a position to graduate soon.

Work has started on new code complementing the classic plugins:

* Apache Rat Eye assists bulk reviews (coded in Python)
* Apache Rat Whisker automates the verification and generation of legal
documents (LICENSE, NOTICE, etc) for application composed from many
components (coded in Java)

The 0.8 release of the classic plugin is expected soon.

Trademark, branding and marketing issues remain unresolved. The Incubator
guides no longer accord well with developments in ASF policy in this area.
It seems appropriate that before graduation these issues should be sorted
out, though this may require work to develop incubator policy, which may
potentially delay graduation.


----

Rave

Apache Rave is a new web and social mashup engine. It will provide an
out-of-the-box as well as an extendible lightweight Java platform to host,
serve and aggregate (Open)Social Gadgets and services through a highly
customizable and Web 2.0 friendly front-end.

Rave entered incubation on 2011-03-01.

Current Status:
 * The project has adopted a monthly release cycle:
   - a first time 0.1-incubating release candidate was accepted by the IPMC
on July 8
   - a 0.2-incubating release candidate was canceled by the PPMC in August
because the required Incubating DISCLAIMER file was missing in some artifacts
   - a 0.3-incubating release candidate was accepted by the IPMC on
September 16
 * Reach out to and further cooperation and coordination with Shindig is
growing
 * An integration of Wookie (Incubating) is targeted on short notice (this
or next release cycle)
 * Preliminary steps are made showing how to extend and customize Rave for
end users/developers
 * Jasha Joachimsthal has been elected as new committer in June
 * The commit rate has been steadily growing (more than doubled since the
last report)
 * Mailing list activity remains high
 * Rave has been added to ReviewBoard (reviews.apache.org) to provide
better support for community contributions and patches
 * Website documentation is steadily improved and extended
 * A presentation about Rave, focusing on Apache, community and
collaboration, was given by Matt Franklin and Ate Douma at TransferSummit
2011/UK (Oxford) September 8th

Next steps:
 * Continue to build up awareness of Rave and grow the community
 * Further collaboration and coordination with Shindig and Wookie
 * Further modularize Rave to support extending and customizing for end
users/developers
 * Keep up the pace for the monthly release schedule, working towards a
0.4-incubating release by end September 2011

Issues before graduation:
 * Complete 1.0 release
 * Expand the community/user base


----

Sqoop

A tool for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and
structured datastores such as relational databases.

Sqoop was accepted into Apache Incubator on June 11, 2011. Status
information is available at http://incubator.apache.org/projects/sqoop.html.

Progress since last report:
* Development activity became stronger over the last month with twelve
issues resolved and nine new issues created in this period.
* Sqoop PPMC voted in a new committer on the project - Bilung Lee.
* Sqoop is seeing healthy input from the community with respect to filing
JIRA issues and providing patches.

Issues before graduation
* Create Sqoop web site.
* Make an incubating release.
* Grow the community size and diversity.
* Review all license headers (all contains Cloudera).
* Change java package from com.cloudera.sqoop to org.apache.sqoop.


----

Wave

Incubating since: Dec-2010

Description: Wave is a real-time communication and collaboration tool. Wave
in a Box (WIAB) is a server that hosts and federates waves, supports
extensive APIs, and provides a rich web client. This project also includes
an implementation of the Wave Federation protocol, to enable federated
collaboration systems (such as multiple interoperable Wave In a Box
instances).

Most important issues are:
* Migrate source code from code.google.com to SVN.
* Building up community.

Community:
The community shows stable levels of activity.

Project development:
- The migration of the source code was delayed due to technical issues of
migrating Mercurial repository from Google Code to Apache SVN without
loosing history. After some discussion we decided to move the code to Apache
infra by 28th September 2011 even if that would require a clean check in
without history.
- About 26 commits with improvements and bug fixes.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

The Apache Jackrabbit content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  We made one Jackrabbit 2.2.x patch release in this quarter:

  * Apache Jackrabbit 2.2.8 on August 23rd

o Legal / Branding

  No open issues.

o Community / Development

  No new committers or PMC members were added since our last report.

  Apache Jackrabbit was nominated for the 2011 Swiss Open Source Award
  in the community category. We attended the award ceremony on Tuesday,
  Sep 13th, and gave a short presentation about Jackrabbit, but the
  award went to another project.

  We are planning to cut the Jackrabbit 2.3.0 release from trunk in near
  future. To increase the rate at which latest work in the trunk gets
  released (it is already nine months since Jackrabbit 2.2), we are
  considering an odd/even versioning strategy where all odd releases 
  like 2.3.x are cut directly from trunk, and even-numbered stable
  maintenance branches like 2.4 get created every now and then for
  production-ready releases.

  Meanwhile we will be cutting new patch releases from earlier maintenance
  branches, including the old 1.6 branch whose end of life status will be
  announced along with the last patch release. Also, active work on the
  new microkernel prototype targeting Jackrabbit 3.0 continues.

o Infrastructure

  The planned migration from Confluence to the new CMS soon is still
  pending for action on our part.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache jUDDI Project

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the Universal
Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification for (Web)
Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an implementation of the
JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR).

- We added a great deal of functionality to the juddi-client in the 3.1.0
  release. We are currently working on documenting the new features after which
  will send out a detailed announcement of this release.
- Scout also released a maintenance release: 1.2.3.

Things are moving along nicely.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Karaf Project

Apache Karaf provides higher level features and services 
specifically designed for creating OSGi-based servers.

Community
 The community has changed a bit:
   * Christian Schneider has been voted in as a committer

 We can note an increase of projects powered by Karaf.
 Apache ServiceMix and Apache Geronimo already use Karaf.
 We're discussing with Apache Directory about the usage of Karaf.

Development
 Four releases have been voted:
 * Apache Karaf 2.1.6
 * Apache Karaf 2.2.1
 * Apache Karaf 2.2.2
 * Apache Karaf 2.2.3

 NB: we turned Apache Karaf 2.1.x branch in End Of Life mode. Apache Karaf 
 2.1.6 is the latest version on this branch.

 We created the first Apache Karaf sub-project: Apache Karaf Cellar.
 Apache Karaf Cellar is a cluster and cloud solution for Apache Karaf, 
 powered by Hazelcast and jclouds.
 We already released:
  * Apache Karaf Cellar 2.2.1
  * Apache Karaf Cellar 2.2.2
 We started OBR broadcast and DOSGi implementation. It should be included 
 in Apache Karaf Cellar 2.2.3.

 We can note that two Karaf sub-projects have been started in sandbox 
 and promoted as Karaf sub-projects:
 * Karaf WebConsole based on Pax-Wicket. This new console is very 
 extend-able and highly pluggable. The purpose is to provide a complete 
 enterprise administration and monitoring console, including a new look'n 
 feel, and give a way for others projects (like ServiceMix, CXF or Camel 
 for instance), to provide their own branding and modules.
   http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/webconsole/
 * Karaf Cave is an OBR server implementation, including storage, OBR 
 metadata generation, Maven proxy support, REST API, etc. It will also 
 aim to be a KFR (Karaf Feature Repository) and KAR (KAR Repository).
   http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/cave/

 We are also discussing with the author of EIK (Eclipse Integration for 
 Karaf) to become a new Karaf sub-project 
 (http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/eik/).

Web Site
 Web site has been updated to provide visibility to sub-projects such 
 as Apache Karaf Cellar.
 We also gave more visibility to the documentation, allowing to download 
 the PDF format of our guides.

Branding
 * project website basics: ok
 * website nav links: ok
 * trademarks: ok
 * logo: we added the TM mention on the logo, and provide new "powered by 
 Karaf" logo
 * metadata: ok

Issues for board consideration
 None so far.

Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

Trademarks:
We have not made progress on trademarks since the last board report, but
do intend to finish the necessary pieces.

   * Project Naming And Descriptions :
     We believe this is complete, but are still reviewing.
   * Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
     www.apache.org included.
     Likely complete, but under review.
   * Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
     footers, etc.
     The main TLP site is converted, subproject sites have not.
   * Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your
     site In progress.  Some have been converted to have TM, some not.
     We don't seem to have ready volunteers on the graphical front,
     so it is slower than we'd like
   * Project Metadata : DOAP file checked in and up to date
     Done



LUCENE JAVA/Solr

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community is very active. The community
has made significant progress on cutting over to the Apache CMS.
The community has recently released Lucene & Solr 3.3. The community
is actively working on releasing Lucene & Solr 3.4.

Open Relevance Project

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either as it is a niche
area.

PyLucene

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
almost entirely an automated port, so this project will never
require a lot of developers.  The user community is active.

PyLucene 3.3-3 was released on July 23rd.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache OFBiz Project

Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Attachment V: Status report for the Apache OODT Project

Releases/Development:

We pushed out the 0.3 release at the end of June 2011 [1]. 

Work continues towards the 0.4 release. Chris Mattmann 
volunteered to RM it since he is working on a number of 
updates to the OODT workflow manager described further 
in OODT-215 [2].

Cameron Goodale contributed some updates to the OODT 
file manager tools and documentation in OODT-306 [3] and 
in OODT-52 [4]. Andrew Hart has been working on improving 
the OODT balance webapp framework (e.g., see OODT-297 [5]). 
Gabe Resneck is working on improving the OODT resource 
management component, as described in [6], [7] and [8].

Community: 

Gabriel Resneck and Paul Vee were added to the OODT PMC 
and as OODT committers.

Several OODT-focused talks were accepted for ApacheCon.
There will be an OODT track at ApacheCon this year (Apache 
in Space! (OODT) [9]) and the community is planning on 
attending in full force. Chris has been asked to chair the 
track and has accepted.

Branding: 

We feel our website and branding status is up-to-date. 
During Incubation, Sean Kelly worked very hard to bring 
our new Apache OODT website up-to-date with the branding 
guidelines from Shane. We welcome further input or 
suggested updates.

Press: 

InformationWeek mentioned Apache OODT in an article on 
NASA's Open Source and the Open Gov initiative [10].

We've been coordinating with Sally on the Meaningful 
Use of Complex Medical Data (MUCMD) symposium [11] that 
was held in collaboration with NASA, the National 
Library of Medicine and Apache on August 26, 27th. The 
symposium covered various technologies and approaches to 
understanding medical data (health care records, instrument 
monitors, patient notes, etc.) Apache OODT was a big part of 
this. There were also several talks during the meeting on 
Apache Hadoop, including a presentation by Jeff Hammerbacher.

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Pig Project

Pig status report for September 2011.

Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level
language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for
evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their
structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them
to handle very large data sets.

As part of Hadoop Summit we conducted user meetup that covered topics including
interactive discussions on embedding Pig in Python, Elephant Bird, Pig and
Cassandra, and cube operations in Pig. The meeting was attended by 20+ users and
developers.

We have successfully completed three Google Summer of code projects:
* Nested foreach statement (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1631)
* Nested cross statement (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1916)
* Syntax sugar (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1904,
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-1387, and

Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs) in Java.

Although Pivot's dev and user list traffic, as well as its commits, were
healthy in the last quarter, the project suffered a lull in terms of
releases and branding checklist items.  This was primarily driven by
Todd Volkert (PMC chair) being a new father and not having the time to
drive those items.  Hopefully it will turn a corner in the coming
quarter, as the 2.0.1 release has been tagged for some time and ready to
package for a vote.  On the positive side, we seem to have weathered the
drop in commits from Greg Brown, as commits traffic was fairly good this
quarter despite having only 1 commit from Greg.

Releases:
* No releases this quarter
* Most recent release is 2.0 (January 10, 2011)

Committers:
* 111 commits since last board report
* New committer (Edvin Syse) voted in on June 23

Community:
* User list traffic showed a slight decline but still healthy at about
  1.2 threads per day
* Dev traffic healthy at ~1.6 threads per day
* 164 subscribers to the user mailing list
* 64 subscribers to the dev mailing list

Status of branding checklist:

Unfortunately, no work was done on this.  We'll seek to remedy that in
the next quarter.

Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

- Apache SpamAssassin 3.3.2 was released on June 16, 2011.  It was our
  first code release in 15 months as focus has been on rule development
  and sa-update update releases.

- A new release is in the works.  It will probably be version 3.4.0.
  Release date will be sometime this fall.

- Release targets/goals are now published on our website.

- Some users are asking for access to our ASF infrastructure via IPv6
  for use by some IPv6-only hosts.  I think we'll see more of these
  requests as I think mail servers are early candidates for conversion
  to IPv6 (specifically one or more of a domain's MXes).

- We continue to recruit contributors of mass-check results for use in
  scoring rules; we've signed up some more; we could use some more.

- Users' list is active; questions get asked and answered.

- Dev list has been active with both committers and community members
  contributing; we're keeping an eye out for new potential committers.

== Branding ==

** No change since last report. **

While we've been careful to ensure "proper" branding of Apache SpamAssassin
since joining the ASF nearly a decade ago, we have not started on meeting
the specific requirements of the current branding requirements.  You'd be
hard pressed not to know we were "Apache SpamAssassin" when visiting our
non-wiki web pages.  Some areas of our wiki need updating to reflect the
Apache brand.

The following is a cursory review of our current branding:

Project Website Basics: mostly compliant

  All but sa-update mirrors are hosted on ASF infrastructure under the
  apache.org domain.

  Currently no link to www.apache.org on the project home page.

Project Naming And Descriptions: somewhat compliant

  The project home page uses "Apache SpamAssassin" prominently.  The download
  page isn't as good at using "Apache" in front of "SpamAssassin, but I think
  it'd be pretty difficult to miss the big bold "The Apache SpamAssassin
  Project" at the top of every page on our website (excluding the wiki).

  We do not have a one sentence project description on our home and
  download pages, although I note that the example provided at
  http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs#naming is actually three
  sentences in length, so I don't feel to bad about our 5 feature bullet
  points describing the project on our home page.

Website Navigation Links: not compliant

  We fail on all points.

Trademark Attributions: not compliant

  While we're generally good about using the term "Apache SpamAssassin" we're
  short on "TM"s.

Logos and Graphics: half way there

  We're consistent with logo use but lacking the "TM"s.

Project Metadata: in progress

  A DOAP file exists.  It's accurate, except for an incorrect link to our bug
  tracker.

Other Trademark Guidelines:

  spamassassin.org has been assigned to and managed by the ASF for the better
  part of a decade.

Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

Apache Tiles is a Java EE templating framework built to simplify the development 
of web application user interfaces.

Community:
It's been an interesting quarter for the Tiles project. I fully expected to come
to this report with a resolution to move Tiles to the attic, but it seems we're
not quite ready for that yet. Instead we added Mick Semb Wever to the PMC as he
is wanting to push toward a Tiles 3 release. Steady progress has been made
toward that goal.

I do believe it would be good to change the project chair soon. We discussed that
and no interested candidate emerged. So I've agreed to continue in this role for
the time being. Depending on how things play out over the next few months we'll 
see if the PMC changes or if anyone else on the PMC has a change of heart.

The last week or so has seen a real flurry of activity on the users list. Some 
of that has been one poster who is being a little overzealous with new threads.
But some of it does seem to indicate genuine new interest. There have been a few
names I've not noticed before. This is interesting since there was not a single
response on the users list when we posted that we were considering moving the 
project to the Attic. If there is still interest in the project we need to figure
out how to convert some of these users to committers. Otherwise I do think the
Attic will be in our near future.

Trademarks:
As far as I know we are now in full compliance with the Foundation trademark
guidelines. The only outstanding item I am aware of was to get our Project
Metadata up to date. We got that done a couple of weeks ago.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

General:
 Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
 responsiveness on both dev and user lists.
 We have announced on mailing lists that support for
 Apache Tomcat 5.5.x will end on 30 September 2012. Updating
 official web site will follow.

 There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.


Releases:
 * Apache Tomcat 7.0.16
 * Apache Tomcat 7.0.19
 * Apache Tomcat 7.0.20
 * Apache Tomcat 7.0.21
 * Apache Tomcat 6.0.33
 * Apache Tomcat Native 1.1.22
 * Apache Tomcat Native 1.1.22
 * Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.32


Community:
  Two new committers (Eiji Takahashi and Olivier Lamy) joined
  the Apache Tomcat team.


Security:
 * CVE-2011-3190
   The AJP protocol is designed so that when a request includes
   a request body, an unsolicited AJP message is sent to Tomcat
   that includes the first part (or possibly all) of the
   request body. In certain circumstances, Tomcat did not
   process this message as a request body but as a new request.
 * CVE-2011-2729
   Due to a bug in the capabilities code, jsvc
   (the service wrapper for Linux that is part of the
    Commons Daemon project) does not drop capabilities allowing
   the application to access files and directories owned
   by superuser.
 * CVE-2011-2526
   Tomcat provides support for sendfile with the HTTP NIO and
   HTTP APR connectors. sendfile is used automatically for
   content served via the DefaultServlet and deployed web
   applications may use it directly via setting request attributes.
   These request attributes were not validated. When running
   under a security manager, this lack of validation allowed
   a malicious web application to do one or more of the following
   that would normally be prevented by a security manager:
   - return files to users that the security manager should
     make inaccessible
   - terminate (via a crash) the JVM
 * CVE-2011-2204
   When using the MemoryUserDatabase (based on tomcat-users.xml)
   and creating users via JMX, an exception during the user
   creation process may trigger an error message in the JMX
   client that includes the user's password. This error message
   is also written to the Tomcat logs. User passwords are visible
   to administrators with JMX access and/or administrators with
   read access to the tomcat-users.xml file. Users that do not
   have these permissions but are able to read log files may be
   able to discover a user's password.
 * CVE-2011-2481
   The re-factoring of XML validation for Tomcat 7.0.x re-introduced
   the vulnerability previously reported as CVE-2009-0783.
   This was initially reported as a memory leak. If a web
   application is the first web application loaded, this bugs
   allows that web application to potentially view and/or alter the
   web.xml, context.xml and tld files of other web applications
   deployed on the Tomcat instance.

Trademark:
  Detailed status is in the private tomcat repository.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache Tuscany Project

Apache Tuscany is an SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA.

This quarter there has been one new PMC member, and while there was a
vote to make a contributor a committer they declined the invitation,
no reason was given, and they continue to provide patches.

There have been a couple of Maven plugin releases and a 2.0-Beta3
release of the main trunk code.

Tuscany had five GSoC students this year who have now finished with
some successful projects, one of which has now been included in the
main trunk code.

Tuscany is being used as one of the reference implementations for the
OASIS SCA specifications and there has been submissions to OASIS of
evidence of Tuscany passing several of the compliance test suites.

Some activity stats for the quarter:
Avg dev list mails 292/month compared to 304/month for the same period last year
The user list averaged 39 emails/month compared to 70/month last year
There are currently 358 subscribers to the user list and 265
subscribers to the dev list.

There are no board level issues at this time.

Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache UIMA Project

Board report for Apache UIMA, for September 2011.

Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source
software related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the
UIMA Oasis Standard.

Releases:
Since last report, the Addons package for UIMA was released
(http://uima.apache.org/news.html#29 August 2011).  The addons package 
contains 2 new annotators: 
  Solrcas (for storing CAS objects into an Apache Solr instance), and 
  AlchemyAPIAnnotator (wraps alchemyapi.com services).

Development:
A new contributor, Peter KlÃ¼gl contributed a UIMA tool to the sandbox,
called TextMarker. 

Nicolas Hernandez has set up a French language portal to all things UIMA, and
contributed a French language models for the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
Tagger annotator, and generally improved that annotator.
The French language models are awaiting getting some additional permissions 
before they are put into SVN. 

Some attempts to package UIMA Annotators as OSGi bundles led to renewed
investigations toward this, and some progress was made in identifying
approaches and tools, including Maven integration / support.

There continue to be lots of incremental Cas Editor fixes, mostly driven
by user feedback and the development of a new Cas Editor based plugins
at the Apache Incubator OpenNLP project.

UIMA-AS had a few bug fixes, and some new features, including exposing
per-component statistics (for tuning) from UIMA aggregates for each CAS.

Community:
No changes.
 
Issues: No Board level issues at this time

Trademarks/Branding: 
  Previous work to add TM started (at some point in time) to fail to display.
  With infra's help, traced this to the fact that Apache Web sites
  are now being forced to display using UTF-8.  We adjusted our build to 
  accommodate this change.

 Branding checklist:
   no change from previous report:
  Project Website Basics - done
  Website Navigation Links - done
  Trademark Attributions - done
  Logos and Graphics - not done
  Project Metadata - done
  Read PMC Branding Responsibilities - partially done.  Need to get confirmation

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project

The Web Services project serves to collect several components, all of
which relate to XML/SOAP Web Services, and most of which are
implemented in Java.  We manage a WS-Security implementation (WSS4J),
an XML object model (Axiom), a WS-Policy model (Neethi), an XML Schema
library (XmlSchema), a WSDL 2 library (Woden), and a few other small
pieces.

Last month the board asked the WS project to do a special report this
month on our community status [ note to Sam - you were supposed to
poke us about this?  I never got a ping, although I did get Marvin's
reminders, which, my bad, I thought were a fluke until Sunday ].  The
worry seems to be coming from a couple of places - 1) lack of forward
progress in some of our subprojects, and 2) concern that our community
isn't being effective.

I think the real issue here is "is the community healthy", especially
considering the large number of folks we have on the PMC even after
two rounds of "emeritizing".  I do agree with the comments last month
that we could be doing better.  We're not getting much new blood (with
some notable exceptions) lately, and I think a lot of us have simply
been unable to prioritize WS work when it comes up.  I certainly fall
into that category, and I know others do as well.

On the other hand, I don't think that the voting issue Dan refers to
(see last month's agenda) is anything really new - we've had troubles
pulling votes together in the past too, and while that's perhaps made
us less efficient that we could be, it hasn't made the project
irrelevant or brought us to a standstill.  Our mail traffic is pretty
steady (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/ws-dev/) and as Dan
notes, things are getting dealt with, releases published and questions
answered - we're just a little less snappy than we might be.

We recently voted to accept a grant of a large contribution to use a
base of a 2.0 version of WSS4J.  In that process, we also voted in
Marc Giger as a committer to continue working on that codebase.  This
new contribution has sparked some new discussions and ideas around
WSS4J and may provide some additional collaboration points between the
Axis2/Rampart and CXF security people.

One small thing that might help is to stop forwarding the old list
names to dev@ws, but instead hook them up to an autoresponder that
says "please stop using this address and mail dev@ instead".  I
recently noticed that I hadn't been seeing some of the dev@ mail
because it's also being cc'ed to the old list addresses and I still
had filters to drop those mails into folders I no longer use.  Others
might be in a similar situation.  There is also still some
logistics/cleanup work we need to finish - website maintenance, etc. -
that might help to make things feel a bit more solid too.  Aside from
that, doing some more pruning of the PMC roster (I still think there
are at least 10 people who didn't respond to our last round) and
simply having this conversation might well help to re-engage a few
people.

In general, I think the project is doing ok but we need to keep
plugging away at streamlining and ensuring that there is sufficient
attention from the active PMC members.

I'll plan to attend the board meeting Wednesday to field any questions
or discussion.

--Glen Daniels on behalf of the WS PMC

Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Status report for the Apache Wicket Project September 2011

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications.

Things worthy of note:

- Released Wicket 1.4.18 to fix a XSS attack vector
- Released Wicket 1.5.0 after 2 years of development
- Added Sven Meier as a committer and PMC member
- Discussions on the next Wicket release have started

XSS issue

We received a report of a XSS vulnerability in Wicket when using multi-tab
support. This issue was discovered by Sven Krewitt of TÃV Rheinland i-sec
GmbH. The issue has been resolved in Wicket 1.4.18 (other versions of Wicket
are unaffected by this vulnerability) and we worked with the security@ team on
how to handle this situation. More information can be found here:
http://s.apache.org/cve-2011-2712

Apache Wicket 1.5.0 has been released!

One of the biggest events in the last year or two is the release of Wicket
1.5. It has been in development for about 2 years and features rewritten
internals, HTML5 support and a inter-component event system. The full release
notes can be found here: http://s.apache.org/wicket-1.5.

The release took 2 years because of shifting priorities for several core team
members that previously took on a lot of work for Wicket, including the
rewrite of the internals. With our recent additions of the last year we have
found new, very active blood and are confident that the next release will not
take that long.

There was some turmoil on our dev list during the last couple of release
candidates relating to supporting OSGi fully and with ease (we have
conflicting package names in multiple jars, making it difficult for OSGi to
import and export classes from these jars). Another point of contention was
the addition of CDI support to Wicket. After some discussion and reflection on
how we do releases and versioning it was decided to postpone the OSGi and CDI
inclusion to the next release and purely focussing on finalizing 1.5. All
parties were satisfied with this approach.

New team member

Just after our last board report we elected Sven Meier to become a team
member. As always we are on the lookout for active, smart and willing
candidates to strengthen our team.

Next Wicket release

We have been discussing the way we are going to version our releases going
forward. Historically we have been breaking API in 1.x releases and adding new
features as long they didn't break 1.x.y releases. This has worked quite well,
but does make some folks resisting to use Wicket. As a result we propose to
start using semantic versioning as discussed at http://semver.org, and babtize
our next release Wicket 6 (version 2 has already been used in a failed
experimental branch).

Other proposals include moving to Java 6, Servlet 3, full OSGi support, CDI
support and lessening the requirement to have a matching markup and component
hierarchies. We are also going to look to releasing earlier and more often.

Compliance with branding/trademark guidelines

Only our logo on the webpage does not comply in missing a TM. We're still
working on a new web design and will incorporate the TM in that design. All
other items on the checklist are fulfilled.

Attachment AL: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

About XMLBeans:
XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a
Java friendly way. The idea is that you can take advantage of the
richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features
mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and
typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces
and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance
data.


Not much code development happening since the last report but there was
a flurry of emails on the mailing list and also wiki updates.

There was no new releases but there is talk about a new release, if the
current committers find the time to work on it. We need to bring new
people to the project.

There were no new committers or PMC changes for this period and now
other issues requiring board's attention.

Attachment AM: Status report for the Apache ZooKeeper Project

ZooKeeper status report for September 2011.

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed
applications.

No new releases during the last quarter. A 3.4.0 release is planned
and has a release manager assigned. A 3.4 branch has been cut and
final blocker issues are being resolved, see: http://s.apache.org/Z5x

A 3.3.4 release has been proposed and will likely be cut during the
next quarter, see: http://s.apache.org/Cug

No changes to Committer/PMC membership.

Community:

Recently a number of new Incubator projects have been accepted which
are using ZooKeeper; Flume, Kafka, Accumulo, Giraph

Mailing list activity continues to be high and we are seeing more
contributor activity than we've seen in past quarters.

A public meetup was held subsequent to the recent Hadoop summit,
meeting notes can be found here: http://s.apache.org/TDR and

Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper and Bookkeeper.

The website, jira, and mailing lists are all setup and functional.

We have some dependencies on the next release of ZooKeeper 3.4.0. Once
that release goes out, we will make our first release as a subproject
of ZooKeeper.

Current work is mostly focused on code stabilization, scaling the
number of topics supported to millions, and JMS bindings.
