       Minutes were approved by general consent.

 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       In the past month I've done some ASF outreach.  I gave a talk
       at Visa about open source and the ASF.  I also met with folks
       from Huawei to answer their questions about how they might get
       more involved in ASF projects.

       I have scheduled a face-to-face board meeting for 7 November in
       Vancouver, BC.

    B. President [Jim]

       Actually quite a busy month since the last board meeting.

       First of all, there was some concern regarding the speed and
       "failover" of some infra tasks (mostly related to account creation).
       Thanks goes to Sam, Craig and infra for the effort around the account
       creation tool, which has substantially improved the situation. I
       don't think that this alleviates all the concerns, but this will give
       us some "breathing room" until the planned infra meeting during the
       Surge conference in Baltimore.

       2 renewals were done since the last meeting: we renewed our D&O
       Insurance and I renewed our subcontract with our EA. Our EA continues
       to be a valuable resource for those who use her; I again encourage
       officers and directors to leverage her availability; TAC and Concom
       have, most notably, been advantageous users, as have myself. We
       should be receiving the invoice for the D&O Insurance renewal within
       a week or so.

       We now have a UPS account in conjuction with our FedEx account. Thx
       again to our EA for handling that.

       I am on task to send to Sam 2 copies of acceptable ID in order to
       get my Wells Fargo credit card. I did receive my WF RSA keyfob to
       access to the web portal.

       I will be speaking at the Transfer Summit 2011 in Oxford next month.

    C. Treasurer [Geir]

     Am away with family on vacation.  Things are smooth, and there is nothing
     that needs the attention of the board at this time. Will file standard
     report next week when I get back.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

      The process of filing documentation is running smoothly. In July,
      34 ICLAs, two grants, 11 CCLAs, two NDAs, and 20 membership applications
      were received and processed.

      In August several changes were made to the process in order to expedite
      the creation of new committer accounts. The ICLA forms were updated to
      include preferred Apache id and requesting PMC. A new tool was put into
      service that allows the secretary to request root to create new accounts.
      Finally, more root members of infra were encouraged to create accounts.

      Results of these changes are already visible. A new record for account
      creation was set: just over 9 hours elapsed between receipt of an ICLA
      and the creation of the account for the new committer.

    E. Executive Vice President [Noirin]

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       In my role as Vice Chairman, I spoke with the Financial Times (DE)
       and with the Economic Times (India), and performed a video
       interview in support of the Foundation.

 5. Additional Officer Reports

    A. VP of JCP [Geir Magnusson Jr]

       See Attachment 1

       Jim: Is this office still needed, since not much happens now that
       Apache is no longer a member?

    B. VP of Brand Management [Shane Curcuru]

       See Attachment 2

       It was noted that the nofollow links policy is not yet finalized.

    C. VP of Fundraising [Serge Knystautas / Greg]

       No report was submitted for this month; requested for next month.

    D. VP of Marketing and Publicity [Sally Khudairi / Doug]

       See Attachment 4

    E. VP of W3C Relations [Sam Ruby]

       See Attachment 5

       Larry will attend the face-to-face at TPAC in Santa Clara
       if ASF pays the registration fees. Sam noted that this is
       not "traditionally" done since "traditionally" this implies a
       "pay to play" which Apache is fundamentally opposed to.
       In this case, it's $50 to cover lunch and a conference room,
       and Sam will authorize payment as a Legal Affairs expense.

    F. Apache Legal Affairs Committee [Sam Ruby]

       See Attachment 6

    G. Apache Security Team Project [Mark Cox / Sam]

       See Attachment 7

    H. Apache Conference Planning Project [Nick Burch / Roy]

       See Attachment 8

       Larry asked what the future holds for ApacheCon or other conference 
       events. The consensus currently is for the conference committee to
       hold more, smaller events than ApacheCon.

    I. Apache Infrastructure Team [Philip Gollucci / Jim]

       See Attachment 9

    J. Apache Travel Assistance Committee [Gavin McDonald / Larry]

       See Attachment 10

    Officer reports were approved by general consent.

       No report was submitted and will be requested for next month.

       See Attachment C

    D. Apache C++ Standard Library Project [Martin Sebor / Jim]

       See Attachment D

       It appears that this project is dormant and should move to the attic.

       AI Jim: assist the project in the transition.

    E. Apache Cassandra Project [Jonathan Ellis / Shane]

       See Attachment E

    F. Apache Click Project [Malcolm Edgar / Doug]

    J. Apache CouchDB Project [Jan Lehnardt / Brett]

       See Attachment J

       Sam notes that there is a discussion on moving the repository from
       svn to git, yet no one from infra is involved.

       AI Brett: try to get infra involved in the discussion.

    K. Apache Forrest Project [David Crossley / Bertrand]

       See Attachment K

    L. Apache Hadoop Project [Ian Holsman / Greg]

       See Attachment L

       Larry asked and Owen answered what the "Hadoop naming debate" is.
       It is a reference to whether to accept 
       http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Defining%20Hadoop which seeks to limit 
       the name "Hadoop" to mean releases from Apache and pushing all other 
       derived products to be "powered by Hadoop." There was generally support
       except from the companies that use the Hadoop name for derivative
       products. There was a request to suspend the vote for more discussion,
       but once the vote stopped the discussion stopped.

    M. Apache HBase Project [Michael Stack / Roy]

       See Attachment M

    N. Apache HTTP Server Project [William A. Rowe Jr. / Doug]

       See Attachment U

    V. Apache Perl Project [Philippe M. Chiasson / Greg]

       See Attachment V

       The exception to the approved voting process doesn't appear to be
       needed. A single vote covering the release of multiple related perl
       modules should suffice. If there are any questions, please discuss on
       board@.

       AI Greg: follow up with the Perl PMC.

    W. Apache POI Project [Yegor Kozlov / Roy]

       See Attachment W

Nothing to report :) Community use of TCK materials and maintenance
going smoothly


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================

The Apache OOo podling has had a wide variety of discussions about the future
of OpenOffice.org, both its code, its brand, and its domain(s).  The
question of the kinds of uses we will allow for the OpenOffice.org brand and
domain name will be a key issue to resolve both for the Apache OOo podling as
well as the large existing community of users.

External Requests
=================

Still waiting on the Maven PMC completing its work on maven.org domain name
MOU and confirming it with Sonatype.  (repeat from last month)

Several parties have already contacted us requesting permissions for either
new or continued uses of our new OpenOffice.org marks.

Permission request from planetcassandra.org, a Cassandra blog aggregator run
by a third party; expect to grant permission since they've done a great job
branding it fairly.


Trademark Registrations
=======================

Larry has submitted the registration for the "Hadoop" mark; no status updates
are expected for a number of months (the USPTO process is lengthy).

I have signed trademark grant forms from Yahoo! for the Oozie mark and logo,
and from Oracle for a wide variety of OpenOffice.org marks and logos.  Much
work will be in the years ahead tracking registration renewals, including
minor budget request increases, and most importantly pro bono counsel time.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity

ASF MARKETING & PUBLICITY STATUS: AUGUST 2011

I. Budget: we'd hit a bit of a snag covering OSCON-related expenses
prior to the event that necessitated the use of Geir's personal credit
card. There'd also been a bit of last-minute shuffling prior to the event,
ranging from Melissa's hotel check-in to shipping using the ASF FedEx account.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally Khudairi met with several
sponsors during OSCON. Neither Serge Knystautas nor those ASF Board Members
actively involved in fundraising were in attendance.

IIa. Annual Report: edit is ongoing and was delayed due to scheduling issues;
draft should be ready for review by the end of the week.

III. Press Releases: we issued the following announcements over the PR
NewsWire service:

- 25 July: "Media Alert: Meet Members, Officers, and Committers of The
Apache Software Foundation at OSCON 2011"

Upcoming announcements planned for distribution include Apache Tika v1.0,
Whirr's graduation from the Incubator, and the 10th Anniversary/v.0.1
alpha release of Apache POI.

IV. Informal Announcements: no blog posts were made during this
timeframe, however, the following items were announced on the ASF
Twitter feed:

25 July -- Meet members of the #Apache community this week at #OSCON!
s.apache.org/D84 #OpenSource #conference @TheASF

27 July -- We're at #OSCON Booth 725. Stop by and enter to win free
admission to @ApacheCon (7-11 November/Vancouver). See you there! #Apache

and

Did you know that @eBay uses #Apache #Synapse to process over more
than 1 billion transactions per day? #OpenSource #TheApacheWay

30 July -- Missed us at #OSCON but still want one of our amazing
#Apache caps? There's still @ApacheCon (7-11 November/Vancouver).
See you there!

1 August -- Did you know that Facebook recently completed a
30 petabyte migration using #Apache #Hadoop and #Hive?
crn.com.au/News/265439,fa… #OpenSource

8 August -- Just announced! The Apache Way returns to China.
Join us: #Apache Roadshow Asia -- Shanghai, 23 October.
apacheasiaroadshow.org #OpenSource

and

Did you know that, per the Open Source Census #Apache #Xerces
ranks 4th + is installed on 54% of machines scanned?
osscensus.org/packages-rank-…

and

Our @BarCampApache events are a great way to get involved w/the
#community! Catch us in Oxford, Seville, Amsterdam, ...
wiki.apache.org/apachecon/Fron…


NOTE TO ALL PMCs! We're *Always* Seeking Success Stories!
Do consider forwarding innovative/newsworthy metrics/users/datapoints
of Apache products for the "Did You Know?" Twitter campaign.
Please contact Sally at press-AT-apache-DOT-org for more information.

V. Media Relations: we have had an extraordinarily challenging time trying to
get an interview in place with Financial Times Germany (= more than a month).
This is due to Jim Jagielski being spread way too thin, and simply unable to
take every single interview request that's best executed by ASF "executives".
We had similar issues whilst at OSCON, where two video interviews were handed
over to Justin Erenkrantz and Greg Stein. A few requests emailed to specific
directors also in attendance went unacknowledged, and also another interview
was missed due to timing confusion (since rectified/completed). We've
particularly faced such issues in the past, where a single spokesperson may
not be available (instances of Geir Magnusson traveling and unable to respond
to queries on our relationship with the JCP come to mind), or a journalist is
looking for insight on a high-profile project (e.g. incubating OpenOffice) and
the appropriate contacts aren't around to take the interview.  We need more
spokespeople!

VI. Analyst Relations: the past month has been spent primarily with
the folks at RedMonk. Our primary contact, Cote, has taken on a new
position outside of the analyst space, and so we've been discussing
our options on how to best work together. In addition, we've been
invited to participate in their Monktober developer forum
http://monktoberfest.com/ (anyone interested should just go ahead
and sign up).

VII. ApacheCon liaison: Noirin Plunkett's resignation from the Planners'
Team triggered Sally to agree to become conference chair in light of her
seemingly single-handedly running things already, and has discussed
with Nick Burch the actions needed—both internally as well as with the
producer—to get the event back on track. Melissa Warnkin's assistance
will be needed to ensure we're on schedule.

VIII. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally manned
the ASF Booth at OSCON with support from Melissa and a member of
the HALO community team 26-28 July. Melissa has arranged to ship
and store all the ASF promotional items (banners, signage, flatscreen
monitor, etc.).

We had lots of visitors from the Apache community to the booth,
including several Members such as Craig Russell, Paul Querna,
Hyrum Wright, and Tim Williams, who offered to help answer questions
and offer shift relief. Special "gold star" shoutout and thanks to
Justin Erenkrantz for flying up from Los Angeles expressly to help man
the booth for a day! Sally had 1-on-1 meetings with 63 individuals at
the booth.

Sally met with representatives from Open World Forum, ScaLE, and
LinuxFestNW to discuss possible event partnerships. Those involving
community cross-promotion have been forwarded to Stone Circle Productions
for follow up for ApacheCon. We also ran a promotion for a free conference
registration giveaway to ApacheCon and collected dozens of entries. The
winner will be announced before the end of the month through the ApacheCon
promo channels.

IX. PR Newswire account: we have 7 pre-paid press releases with PRNewswire
through 3 March 2012. Sally is exploring options for press release
distribution through alternate channels at further discounted flat-rates
to augment our primary dissemination channel at PRNewswire.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of W3C Relations

The SPARQL Working Group has rechartered, and I've rejoined the ASF as a
member of the Working Group and reconfirmed Andy Seaborne as our
representative.

TPAC this year is 31 October to 4 November in Santa Clara, and includes a PSIG
face to face on Monday and Tuesday:

http://www.w3.org/2011/11/TPAC/

There is a registration fee of 50 USD per day to defray a portion of the
meeting costs.  Registration will increase to 150 USD per day after 14 October
2011.  The ASF traditionally does not cover such costs.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Largely a quiet month, with most activity related to the recent Open
Office.org donation.  Nothing requiring board action.

Noteworthy discussions:

One concerned the need for IP clearance of code previously developed elsewhere
under an Apache License.  We reminded them of the terms stated in the ICLA and
the traditional Apache position that all contributions are voluntary.  In this
case, the ball is in the Maven PMC's court to determine if they wish to
proceed, and if so, whether they will seek a Software Grant or some sort of
exception.  Thanks go out to Roy for helping in this discussion.

Another concerned the categorization of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
Unported license.  We have yet to find consensus on a categorization.  I asked
for specifics as to the module in question, and have yet to hear back.

Finally, there was a discussion about the confusion between Copyright
assignments as some non-ASF projects require and Copyright Licenses which the
ASF requires.  No action has yet been taken.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For July 2011: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.

1     Support question
3     Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
7     Vulnerability reports of which:
      1     Vulnerability report [couchdb, via security@couchdb.apache.org]
      1     Vulnerability report [openoffice, via security@apache.org]
      2     Vulnerability report [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org]
      2     Vulnerability report [httpd, via security@httpd.apache.org]
      1     Vulnerability report [httpcomponents, via security@apache.org]
            [CLOSED]

Note from last board minute question: not all things listed as
"Vulnerability report" turn out to be real vulnerabilities, and if
they are it's usual for the investigation and final fix to take some
time (especially if a low severity issue), so issues are likely to be
progress over the course of several status reports and not closed in
the same month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

General
-------
We have created a 2nd public list, small-events-discuss@ to complement
apachecon-discuss@, which have been announced and listed on the website. We
hope these will allow us to widen participation in planning and organising
events, drawing in new blood and widening our number of events.

Discussions on our event anti-harassment policy peaked in late July and have
now wound down, so a vote on the draft policy is underway. The ApacheCon
policy is also being reviewed, and we hope to approve and announce both
shortly.

We held a CFP for our one day track at GotoCon in Amsterdam, selected talks
and notified successful+unsuccessful speakers. We are also running a small
community event on the Saturday to which all committers have been invited.
We expect to use the new small events list to help plan this further. So
far, the process of working on a small track at an external event (aiming at
outreach to developers) is going well.

Sally and Justin are working with some of our Chinese based committers for
the Shanghai "Apache Asia Roadshow" in late October, which now has a CFP.

Gav has kindly been helping to tidy up many of our old and un-used lists.

The calendar <http://community.apache.org/calendars/conferences.html>
has been updated with a listing (alongside the existing grid view), and
queries around it clarified.

ApacheCon NA11
--------------
The producer has been busy at another conference for the last fortnight, so
things are a little behind. Sally has a list of things we need from SCP, and
has kindly been driving this forward to ensure it gets done. She also has a
list of the things we need to do (relating to our responsibilities over the
schedule/selection/etc), and will be ensuring we do our part as soon as
things are unblocked!

Sally has been doing great work with sorting out the keynotes, announcing
things as confirmed, and generally keeping things moving PR and non. Several
people have volunteered to help with the organising as Track Chairs, and
they will likely be reaching out to fill backup speaker gaps soon (as
needed).

The signup for Fast Feather Track is open, and committers reminded about the
$300 signup rate deadline.

BarCamps
--------
BarCampApacheOxford is in just under a month, and preparations are going
well. Our trainee organisers continue to both learn and do much of the work,
which is pleasing. Local sponsors have been approached, and discussions
around larger ones has flipped back to concom@. We hope that we'll be able
to get people from the OOo podling along to both learn and share.

BarCampApacheSpain in Serville (Sevilla) is about 2 months away and
progressing nicely. A venue has been secured, publicity is underway and
local sponsors have been engaged. Work continues on the design for the
t-shirt.

Things are looking very hopeful for a BarCampApache in Vancouver the day
after ApacheCon. Nick and Ross are working with the BarCamp community in
Vancouver, and they seem confident we'll be able to announce shortly.

Ari is looking into venues for a possible 2nd BarCampApacheSydney

Future ApacheCons
-----------------
Now we have announced the two new discuss lists, we hope to shortly kick off
discussions soon on the future of ApacheCon. The aim is to seek advice and
input on a possible call for producers, assuming we could produce
requirements that would both satisfy the board and be workable. This process
is expected to take several months, and we would welcome input from the
board on shaping this as the process progresses.

Discussions continue with a potential host of a low cost, community run
style ApacheCon (still). Once we hear about that one way or another, we can
either start discussing how it'd work, or where we might host such a beast
instead.

Committee
---------
No changes this month. An email was sent to members@ about a number of
foundation committees (including ConCom), and we hope with that and the new
public lists we'll be able to draw in new blood


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Setup and racked all the gear for the backup solution at TRACI.
Philip flew down to assist, and we setup a safe deposit box to
store tapes offline.

Harmonia (svn.eu) lost a root disk and reported errors with its zfs array.
The errors were subsequently cleared but we need to look into a
replacement root disk for the one we lost.

After more complaints about delays in the account creation process,
Sam Ruby created a script to automate the input processing for new
requests.  Together with more root people participating in the process,
this has significantly cut response times from several days to just
a few.

Upayavira continues to work on the selfserve infrastructure, which will
someday completely replace the existing account creation procedure.

Uli Stark is finalizing the specs for the EU replacement host for
aurora (www.eu).

Setup for the Openoffice MediaWiki install as well as the Openoffice
forum site has made significant progress.  Terry Ellison has led the
effort for both.

Andrew Bayer approached us with an offer to provide either a cash
donation or hardware donation for additional build slaves.  Serge
explained the situation with targeted donations and our past experiences
with hardware donations at the ASF.

Daniel Shahaf upgraded our svn installation to 1.6.17 on eris, thor,
and harmonia in order to prevent further loss of commit emails.

Cleaned up the root@ alias, adding the President Jim Jagielski to it.

Doubled our available RAM on sigyn (jails) in the hopes of improving
stability of the host.

Bumped the secretary's LDAP karma to a level at least on par with
a PMC Chair.

Niklas Gustavsson was granted infra karma for his work on our Jenkins
build infrastructure.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
=======

No changes to the Committee.

ApacheCon NA 2011 Vancouver
===========================

Work is continuing for getting people to AC NA 2011 at Vancouver. People
are getting passports/VISAs where appropriate and getting info to the
shepherds. There are some jiras open for the EA to work through each applicant
and what they need. The EA is liaising with our usual travel agent to obtain
the best prices possible for our attendees. We thank the treasurer for wiring
the first bulk payment to our travel agent, an initial lot of flights can be
booked as soon as approved by TAC.

There was a bit of a disagreement on a couple of lists stemming from some
confusion as to who pays for what when it comes to speakers. Is it the producers
sole responsibility to provide everything the speaker asks for or are there
causes for TAC to 'top up' a speaker if it is outside the usual remit of the
producer and the speakers agreement. TAC committee is in full agreement of what
we should provide here, once clarification from the producer is obtained and
that the speaker applies for assistance for any extra (accommodation for
instance), as long as the speaker passes our judging criteria in the normal way,
then TAC will provide that extra assistance. The topic eventually faded out, I
believe hopefully to Nick's excellent summary of the whole situation.

Nick sent out a combined concom/TAC note to the members@ list, soliciting
quietly for new blood to come help TAC if they wish.

Things are ticking along ok, timelines being more or less adhered to.

Thanks to all for their continued efforts.


Other Events:
-------------

No news about any other events happening at this time. (At least none that have
approached TAC for possible assistance. It is possible that
some smaller event organisers may feel that TAC is only for the 'bigger' events.
We will speak with concom and see what we can do to provide more
information about TAC and what it will do for smaller events .


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Abdera Project

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Buildr Project

We released Buildr 1.4.6 in June which added support for Scala 2.9.0+ and
included 18 other minor fixes and improvements. I expect we'll release version
1.4.7 in the September/October timeframe.

Thanks to the work of Peter Donald and Antoine Toulme, our continuous
integration tests are back working on Apache's Jenkins infrastructure.

Mailing list has been somewhat active - higher than previously in 2011 but below
2010 averages. We still have a few outstanding contributions sitting in Jira
that need some cleanup and/or committer time to integrate them.

We have no issues that require board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project

Notable changes since previous report (May 2011):

There have been no changes to Apache stdcxx. An interested contributor
seems to have opted to set up a fork of stdcxx at www.spi-inc.org (or
is in the process of doing so).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Cassandra Project

Cassandra is a distributed database combining the best of Google's
Bigtable and Amazon's Dynamo.

--Highlights--

The Cassandra SF 2011 conference was a resounding success.  We reached
the venue's capacity and had to cap attendance at about 450, over twice
last year's attendance.  We were also able to increase from two tracks
of talks, to three.

After 0.7, Cassandra switched to a time-based release process.  0.8.0
was the first release under this system and was our most stable .0
release yet.  We consider the change a success and plan to release
1.0 under a similar plan in October.

--Releases--

0.7.6, 0.7.7, 0.7.8, 0.8.0, 0.8.1, 0.8.2

0.6 has been put out to pasture.  There have been no new bug reports
and we do not anticipate any releases after April's 0.6.13.

--Community--

Added Pavel Yaskevich as committer.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Click Project

Apache Click is an easy-to-use page and component oriented Java web framework.

There are no board level issues at this time.

Infrastructure
-------------------
There are now infrastructure issues at this time.

Development
------------------
There have been no releases during this period.

Community
----------------
There have been no new committer or PMC members added during this period.

Mailing list traffic has been quite low for this period, I suppose
people are on holidays.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

After a slow previous quarter, development of Cocoon 3.0 picked up a bit,
and culminated with release of Apache Cocoon 3.0.0-alpha-3. There has been
no notable changes on older (2.x) branches. Traffic on dev list slightly
picked up due to alpha release and discussions about future of Cocoon.
Traffic on users list was light.

Implementation of the branding guidelines (specifically, changing page
footers, and couple of other minor tweaks) seen no progress, Cocoon's
website CMS has not been restored yet.

I resigned from the position of PMC chair, and Cocoon PMC voted for Simone
to fill this role.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Community Development Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache CouchDB Project

Apache CouchDB is a distributed JSON document database with HTTP API.

New feature release 1.1.0, including

- native SSL support,
- many fixes to edge-cases in replication,
- database for persistent replication setups,
- HTTP range request support,
- new, scalable OS process handling,
- native HTTP proxy support for externals.

Discussions about moving documentation from the wiki to a more structured
documentation system.

Discussion about moving the main CouchDB repository from SVN to git.

Discussions about solving various flaws with the JavaScript test suite by
moving it to a designated runtime that ships with CouchDB instead of
relying on different browsers (thus avoiding the related issues).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2011-01-02

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07

  Development has been quiet for the quarter.
  Four PMC members have been present a little during this quarter.
  Some little activity on dev mail list and issue tracker which was answered
  by more than one developer.

  Some little activity on user mail list was answered by more than one
  developer.

Progress of the project:
  A small amount of continuation on the potential OSGi framework that was
  commenced last quarter.

  A new plugin called "logo" to assist with the case where a project does not
  have the original source for a logo. This uses SVG to apply a trademark to
  an existing PNG to produce a new PNG. Remember that Forrest can also be
  used as a tool (with this and other plugins) to do once-off gathering and
  transformation tasks.

Attend to project branding:
  Since last report our other project logo now has a TM symbol added. Still
  need to apply that to all plugin sites. So that completes the major parts
  of our branding. During next quarter will have another look at the revised
  branding guidelines docs.  Many plugin sites need to be re-deployed. As this
  gradually happens, the changes will be reflected.

Attachment N: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

No major issues requiring the Board's attention.

== Project Status ==
The project continues to make progress towards a GA release of httpd 2.4.0,
releasing two betas (2.3.13, 2.3.14) since our last report in May.

A single release of our 2.2 branch, 2.2.19 was completed just after our last
report primarily to pick up an updated APR for CVE-2011-1928.

The board was engaged on July 7 to help resolve a disagreement over whether
some decisions and interaction between APR and HTTPD projects was being
properly handled, and helping to clarify what constitutes a technical veto.

At the suggestion of Roy, this was brought back to the public development list
where the conclusion was that the veto stood and that the HTTPD change was to
be reverted.

  Message-Id: <E2B2F314-D8A9-4C40-88FE-08C838224143@sharp.fm>
  Message-ID: <4E15E51E.4090700@rowe-clan.net>

The disputed change has since been reverted in httpd trunk.

Traffic on users/development mailing list, and bugzilla, has been steady.  Our
bugzilla backlog remains challenging with 989 open bugs.  288 are enhancements,
and 228 are FixedIntrunk.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Bluesky was retired by vote of the Incubator PMC. The project just never
managed to adjust to the ASF's community-orientation.

Olio likewise seems prime for retirement.

HISE (Human Tasks for WS-BPEL) again failed to report (that was an issue in
February as well). Activity has picked up somewhat being mostly dead, but
the Incubator will inquire into the viability of the project.

Oozie failed to report, but is just getting started. There are no archives
for the -dev list.

ODF Toolkit, a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation,
scanning and manipulation of OpenDocument Format documents, was voted to
begin Incubation, and has filed its first report.

Giraph, a large-scale, fault-tolerant, Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP)-based
graph processing framework that runs on Hadoop, was voted to begin
Incubation.

The Incubator PMC voted to submit Whirr for TLP status to the Board.

Richard Provarp joined the Incubator PMC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Airavata

Airavata is a software toolkit which provides features to compose, manage,
execute, and monitor large scale applications and workflows on computational
resources ranging from local clusters to national grids and computing
clouds. Airavata is incubating since May 2011.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

1. Update web service implementations from XSUL to Axis2. Update security
libraries and simplify the build process and provide sample use cases.
2. Package, document and release at least one Apache Incubator release.
3. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and well
aligned with existing ASF projects as outlined here:
http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/AiravataProposal#Alignment

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Web designer Barbara Hallock was voted in a commiter and PPMC member for her
contributions to the website design, logo and CSS contributions. The website
is now live with her contributions. Lahiru Gunathilake an existing apache
commiter from Axis2 & QPID projects has made significant contributions and
provided 25+ patches to Airavata. He is voted in as a commiter and PPMC
member. A new volunteer Patanachai Tangchaisin has been contributing to the
various components of the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

* Significant progress has been made towards a release. All components are
organized within the svn adding project level and module level maven build
profiles.
* Website is updated with documentation for build and eclipse development
instructions.
* The default database in WS-Messenger and XRegistry is changed from mysql
to Apache Derby. Derby is integrated as an embedded database to build and
deploy as a maven profile. This porting has removed the incompatible license
dependency on mysql-connector jar.
* WS-Messenger module is re-factored, packaged and tested. The messaging
system clients are being worked on, this component needs to integrated with
rest of the modules.
* XBaya module is cleaned up of unused legacy code, improved dependency
management and simple test cases are tested through.


--------------------

Amber

Amber has been incubating since July 2010. Amber is a project to develop a
Java library which provides an API specification for, and an unconditionally
compliant implementation of the OAuth v1.0, v1.0a and v2.0 specifications.
OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to authenticate and authorise access
by another party to resources they control while avoiding the need to share
their username and password credentials.

The most important issues that must be addressed before graduation are:

- Clarify status of code grant
- Attract users and developers
- Generate a release

The Incubator PMC / ASF Board should be aware that:

- Community activity is relatively low

How has the community developed since the last report

- Some users have started asking for help or getting started guides on the
mailing list

How has the project developed since the last report

- Work has begun on updating the OAuth implementation
- Discussion about preparing for an initial release is ongoing


--------------------

Bigtop

Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Hadoop
ecosystem.

Bigtop entered incubation on June 20 2011

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:
* Create Bigtop web site. Item in progress. See ticket BIGTOP-9
* Make an incubating release.
* Grow the community size and diversity.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of:
* No issues

How has the community developed since the last report:
* Discussions have been started about how to organize the development (RTC
vs CTR)

How has the project developed since the last report.
* Discussions have been started about how to organize our first release and
what should it include.

Licensing and other issues
* Work to obtain CCLA from Cloudera including grant for existing Bigtop code
from Cloudera GitHub repository is done.


--------------------

Bluesky

The incubator community voted to retire the Bluesky podling. It will be
closed in near future and reporting will stop with this period.

See here for the vote results:
http://s.apache.org/7oo

Some more context:
http://s.apache.org/4Q2


--------------------

Clerezza

(incubating since November 27th, 2009)

Clerezza is a framework and set of components designed to make it easy to
build application for the semantic and the social web.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation.

1. First release
2. Tutorial on how to build apps with clerezza

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of

- No issue

How has the community developed since the last report

- Intense discussions on the process. When is code acceptable into trunk,
when is it legitimate to veto changes with a -1 and what should the
consequences be. As a consequence to these discussions a "contributing" page
was added to the project site:
http://incubator.apache.org/clerezza/contributing/

- Daniel Spicar accepted as new contributor.
- Registration of Apache Clerezza for an evaluation through OSS Award
(http://www.ossaward.ch/)

How has the project developed since the last report.

- The code has been improved to a stage ready for release. Procedure for
releasing the code base has been initiated. We are now very closed to a
first release, already 3 release candidates have been presented for voting.
Hoping that soon an acceptable one will be proposed.


--------------------

Deft

Deft is a non-blocking, asynchronous, event driven high performance web
framework running on the JVM.

Deft entered incubation on July 8rd, 2011.


Project development

We are still working in the sandbox
(https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/deft/sandbox/). We have signed
and sent the software grant and also received signed ICLA from the external
contributors that submitted patches to Deft before the Apache incubation. A
chairman is currently being voted. All (Github) issues have been migrated to
Apache JIRA. We have already attracted some new contributors.

Most important issues to address
* Finalize the sandbox work (almost done)
* Converge the coding standards discussion (discussed on the dev ML)

Issues before graduation
* Create Deft web site (or migrate deftserver.org)
* Put together a first incubation release
* Find new committers


--------------------

Deltacloud

(Incubating since July 2010)

Deltacloud is a cross cloud abstraction API that allows management of
resources (compute and storage) across different IaaS cloud computing
providers using a single, open API. At present Deltacloud supports
management of Amazon EC2, Rackspace, Gogrid, Rimuhosting, Terremark, RHEV-M,
vSphere, IBM SBC, Eucalyptus, Opennebula compute resources, as well as
Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Eucalyptus and Rackspace Cloudfiles storage
resources.

The last three months have been characterized by ceaseless work towards our
0.4.0 release, which has now been posted as a release candidate.

We also voted three new committers in during that time.

We are in the process of preparing for graduation to a TLP under the Board;
hopefully, a resolution will be posted before the August Board meeting.

Improvements/Fixes/Additions included in upcoming 0.4.0 release (and since
the last report) include:

Server:
* deltacloudd: new option --drivers to list all drivers
* deltacloudd: new options --ssl, --ssl-key and --ssl-cert to
enable HTTPS support
* API entrypoint reports features in JSON
* unify response behavior: any operation returning a 201 Created also
sets the Location header to point to the new resource; ensure the
status for an operation is the same regardless of output format
* Add type to public addresses; type can be one of 'ipv4', 'mac', 'vnc',
and 'hostname'
* Complete overhaul of the HTML UI, now uses jquery-mobile
* Response status for attach/detach storage is now 202 (instead of 302)
* Response status for get/set blob metadata is 204 No Content
* Response status for (un)register with load balancer is 204 No Content
* The user_name feature now reports the permissible length of the name
as the 'max_length' constraint
* Add Date header to responses as per RFC 2616
* New collection 'firewalls' for managing sets of firewalling rules
* split server/config/drivers.yaml into individual files so each driver
can be packaged separately; gives deployers better choice of what
drivers they want enabled
* Numerous bug fixes and improvements to the test suite
* Drivers
+ Condor
- new driver to run a simple cloud based on the Condor grid scheduler
+ EC2
- Fix bug in reboot instance so that the details returned are those
of the stopped instance, not some random instance
- Support getting and updating blob metadata
- support destroying images
- support firewalls (security groups)
- do not support user_name anymore; instance tagging is too fragile
in EC2 to be used reliably for this
- do not support registering an instance with a load balancer upon
creation anymore
- stream blob PUT to backend (requires thin)
- support attaching EBS snapshot to instance upon creation (feature
'attach_snapshot')
- support elastic IP's
+ Eucalyptus
- support firewalls (security groups)
- support elastic IP's
+ Gogrid
- when retrieving single realm, make sure we return the right one
- correctly capture load_balancer params
- report a listener if load_balancer has no instances
+ Mock
- support destroying images
+ Rackspace
- support destroying images
- stream blob PUT to backend (requires thin)
+ RHEV-M
- support creating and destroying images
- report VNC address of instances
- can use Audrey's confserver to fetch IP of an instance
+ vSphere
- turns a VMWare vSphere installation into a cloud
- driver stateless, state is stored in vSphere's data store in
'deltacloud' folder
- images are template VM's
- single HWP, whose max_cpu and max_memory are based on available
cpus and memory across all vSphere hosts
- support data injection via user_data and user_iso (upload entire
ISO image) For both, instance gets virtual CD-ROM with injected
data

Client:
* make authentication info for instances available
* retrieve type and address for public addresses of an instance
* deltacloudc: allow specifying bucket location when creating a bucket

Site:
* Major rewrite of REST API docs, covers the entire API now
* Add libdeltacloud API docs


--------------------

Droids

Droids is an Incubator project arrived from Apache Labs. Droids entered
incubation on October, 2008.

It's an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows one to create and
extend existing web robots.

The last three months have been very productive and focused on our first
official release. However a discussion on the general incubator list raised
concern about the absence of binding votes of IPMC members. This leaded to
abort the first release. In the last member meeting we selected one of our
Droids committer as member and he subscribed now to the incubator PMC to
have a binding vote as well.

Issues before graduation :

* Do a release
* IP clearance


--------------------

EasyAnt

Work has started to clean up the work done by one of the initial committer
of Easyant as he doesn't have provided its ICLA:
- some work has been identified as containing no IP and will be kept.
- some other work will be just removed, as it doesn't impact the
functionality of Easyant
- and some piece seems to have some IP issue and EasyAnt will probably not
work without it. The developers have started a discussion about how to deal
with a such delete, how could it be rewrote for instance.
This work is reviewed by the mentors.

The www.easyant.org site is now redirecting to incubator.apache.org/easyant

The developer community is not super active, but it is there and responsive
to discussion like the management of the continuous integration, discussion
about some design of some plugins, or discussion about debugging tools for
Ant (discussion which has migrated on ant-dev).


--------------------

Flume

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data to
scalable data storage systems such as Apache Hadoop's HDFS.

Flume entered incubation on June 12th, 2011.

Issues before graduation:

* Migrate mailing lists from Cloudera infrastructure to Apache mailing
lists.
* Create Flume web site.
* Make an incubating release.
* Grow the community size and diversity.
* Licensing and trademark issues.

Community:

- flume-user@incubator is now fully active. flume-user@cloudera.org is
read-only
- flume-dev@incubator is nearly fully active, pending code import.
* Added two contributors.
* Discussion and voting about CTR / RTC.

Project developments:

* CCLA from Cloudera regarding license grant for existing Flume code from
Cloudera has been received by ASF.
* Flume project imported to Apache Jira from cloudera.org Flume jira.
(Thanks medthomas, gmcdonald!)
* Initial svn import completed (Thanks joes!)
* Initial inquiry into trademark status.
* Confluence Wiki space is started to get populated with resources and
design information.
* An initial implementation of masterless acknowledgement announced.
* Proposals for next generation master being discussed.
* OpenTSDB connector availability announced.

--------------------

HISE

Failed to report.

--------------------

Jena

Jena is a semantic web framework in Java that implements the key W3C
recommendations for the core semantic web technologies of RDF and SPARQL.
Jena entered incubation in November 2010.


Progress since the last report:

The project uses the Apache-based developer list exclusively and is now
encouraging users to use the Apache-hosted user mailing list by regular
reminder and an automatically added a trailer on all messages on the old
user list.

The Apache-hosted website is "under construction" in staging. The project
selected the Apache CMS and buildbot system. The design and navigation is
done. Next step is to populate the website with the content from the old
sites.

One module, LARQ, is being used to learn about the Apache release process
and the requirements it brings with it.

Important issues to address for graduation:

* Create a code base in Apache with legal clearance.

There are about 10 small contributions (a few line upto a single class file)
across the whole codebase that that need to be resolved. All are currently
covered by BSD licences.

* Do a full release

Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board:

None.

Technical development:

The new transactional native SPARQL storage systems, TxTDB has been
advertised as a prototype snapshot. Some users have offered to help with
testing.

--------------------

Kafka

(introduced to Apache incubator on Jul 4, 2011)

Kafka provides an extremely high throughput distributed publish/subscribe
messaging system. Additionally, it supports relatively long term persistence
of messages to support a wide variety of consumers, partitioning of the
message stream across servers and consumers, and functionality for loading
data into Apache Hadoop for offline, batch processing.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

1. Package, document and release at least one Apache Incubator release.
2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

No, not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Just get started. The mailing list is pretty active, including people other
than the initial committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

* Moved everything (svn, website, mailing list, jira, wiki) in Kafka to
Apache. CCLA from LinkedIn filed with Apache.
* The end-to-end compression feature is almost complete.
* Received various patches from 3 different companies, including dynamic
topic discovering for cross-cluster mirroing, mx4j support, .net client,
etc.


--------------------

Lucene.NET

Lucene.Net was accepted into the Apache Incubator in February 2011.
Originally it was a sub project of the Lucene Project.

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and
targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:
* Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating
and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize
with the Java Lucene release schedule.
* High-performance C# search engine library.
* Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that
end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes
advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.

Recent Activity:

* Lucene.Net 2.9.4 & 2.9.4g are being worked on and tested. The 'g' stands
for generics. The 2.9.4g version now uses .NET 4.0
* Prototyped build scripts with ncover, fxcop, style cop, nunit/mbunit, and
sandcastle have been made.

Current Activities:

* New site design per new Lucene.Net logo. StackOverflow was gracious enough
to put together a logo contest including footing the bill. The incubation
site now shows the logo that was picked from the contest.
http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/
* Working towards getting CI installed.
* The shingle filter was ported
* A simple faceted search contrib project was created.
* Develop a process to automatically (as much as possible) convert the Java
Lucene code to C# (to maintain our line by line port)

Goals for graduation:

* Have a nearly fully automated process to convert Java Lucene to C#.
* Release Lucene.Net 3.0.3 (port of Java Lucene 3.0.3)
* Have a new .NET version of Lucene utilizing .NET constructs and idioms


--------------------

NPanday

NPanday allows projects using the .NET framework to be built with Apache
Maven. NPanday allows .NET projects to be converted into Maven projects thus
allowing them to fully utilize the other technologies driven by Maven.
NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.

We have successfully released NPanday-1.4.0-incubating. Now we are currently
polishing off the NPanday-1.4.1-incubating.

We are also happy to report that our community has gained a lot of new
people in terms of patch contributors and reporters on issues.

The top priorities towards graduation are:

* regular release
* guide regular patch contributors towards becoming committers
* improve engagement of existing committers

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.


--------------------

Nuvem

Apache Nuvem will define an open application programming interface for
common cloud application services, allowing applications to be easily ported
across the most popular cloud platforms.

Nuvem was accepted for Incubation on June, 2010.

* Pasindu Madubashana continue making progress on Data Services project as
part of GSoC 2011
* Community continue small but active, with about 3 to 4 active committers +
the new GSoC student.

Top things to resolve prior to graduation:

* Increase the number of active committers.


--------------------

ODF Toolkit

The ODF Toolkit is a set of Java modules that allow programmatic creation,
scanning and manipulation of OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF)
documents. Unlike other approaches which rely on runtime manipulation of
heavy-weight editors via an automation interface, the ODF Toolkit is
lightweight and ideal for server use.

* ODF Toolkit entered incubation on Aug 1st, 2011.

* Most important issues to address.
1) Moving the community from the ODF Toolkit Union to Apache and learning
the Apache Way
2) Growing the community, increasing diversity of committers
3) Grants for the transfer of existing code, documentation etc to Apache
4) Migration of existing things to Apache infrastructure, including code
repository, website, mailing list, bugzilla and wiki.
5) Successful podling release.

* Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of
None at this time.

* How has the community developed since the last report
Just getting started. After mailing lists are ready (INFRA-3809), we will
start to discuss migration and new release. At the same time, we will invite
the existing users to this new community and try to attract more new people
join us.

* How has the project developed since the last report.
None at this time. Just getting started.


--------------------

OGNL

Apache OGNL is a Java development framework for Object-Graph
Navigation Language, plus other extras such as list projection and
selection and lambda expressions.

The project joined the Incubator on April 26, 2011.

There are no other important issues open before a possible graduation.
Actually the project is discussing its graduation into Apache Commons.

* Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be
aware of

- due to OpenSymphony dismissing, we need importing old issues to ASF
jira. We finally contacted someone from OpenSymphony and obtained the huge
Issue dump/XML backup, there is someone that is working on it, but due to
security policy (the dump contains also users and password hashes), before
importing it, an open-heart surgery is needed.
- The software grant has been received

* How has the community developed since the last report

- Community activity decreased since codebase has been imported and
polished.
- Luc Blanchard has joined the committers lists (one of original authors
of OGNL)

* How has the project developed since the last report.

- Codebase has been imported & polished, we are in the middle of a big
refactoring stripping off generated code by JavaCC that was versioned in the
SCM and modified.


--------------------

Oozie

Just starting. Failed to report.


--------------------

OpenNLP

OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural
language text. It supports the most common NLP tasks, such as tokenization,
sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity extraction,
chunking, parsing, and coreference resolution. These tasks are usually
required to build more advanced text processing services.

OpenNLP entered incubation on 11/23 2010.

We almost finished the development for our next release (1.5.2) and second
release in the Incubator and will start testing it soon.
The development team is still active and most of the changes have been done
by four independent committers.
This week Boris Galitsky proposed on the mailing list to contribute a
component for syntactic generalization which we will hopefully be able to
accept.
Furthermore we started to work on tooling for an annotation project in our
sandbox and hope to be able to attract new contributors through this effort.

A list of the the most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:
* Establish open regression tests for the parser and coreference component
* Identify and encourage new contributors on the path to committership


--------------------

OpenOffice.org

* OpenOffice.org entered incubation 2011-06-13.

OpenOffice.org is an open-source, office-document productivity suite
providing six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format
(ODF). OpenOffice.org is released on multiple platforms. Its localizations
support 110 languages worldwide.

* Issues

Some challenges exist: Under SUN/Oracle, semi-autonomous single focus
"projects" were the basis of structure of OOo, many would like a similar
system to be used under Apache. By contrast a single overarching authority
is proposed with oversight of the entire project by the (P)PMC. Discussions
are ongoing.

Discussions with regard to licensing, especially with regards to
documentation, are continuing.

* Community development progress

As of 2011-08-06, 71 committers, 52 on the PPMC up from 56 and 49 at last
report. Steps are continuing to bring onboard the last of the initial
Committers who have not yet provided an ICLA.

208 people are subscribed to the ooo-dev list. 124 people have posted to
the list of those 59 have more than 10 posts. 9 posters have more than 50
posts each.
User related queries or posts were virtually nil.
The shape and methodology of the Community Outreach is still in discussion.
An OOo blog has been initiated and is getting a high number of hits daily

* Project development progress

The grant from Oracle America, Inc for OpenOffice trademarks, logos, domain
names has been received.

Work with Infra: OOo Mediawiki has been successfully moved onto Apache
infrastructure. Some concerns relating to IP of materials on the wiki are
still in the proces of resolution.

www.openoffice.org is now in an Apache sandbox and work is being done to
recreate it in the Apache CMS


--------------------

PhotArk

Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery application
including a content repository for the images, a display piece, an access
control layer, and upload capabilities.

PhotArk was accepted for Incubation on August 19, 2008.

* Umashanthi Pavalanathan elected as Photark committer
* Subash Chaturanga continue making progress on "Face Recognition" project
as part of GSoC 2011
* Umashanthi Pavalanathan continue making progress on making Photark more
"Social" as part of GSoC 2011

* Issues before graduation :
* PhotArk started as a project with no initial code-base, and we have
grown the community to the minimal independent committer size required for
graduation and have been seeing slow but continuous interest in the project.
The community started discussion graduation and based on mentors feedback we
are going to recruit couple committers before we start the graduation
process.


--------------------

SIS

Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users
can use to build applications containing location context. This project will
look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities,
services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further,
the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level
community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores,
REST-ful interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under
the Apache umbrella.

* Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

Development progress has really slowed, and there isn't much mailing list
activity. Nothing to stop the project for (yet), but something to keep an eye
on.

* Community progress since the last report

Development and mailing list activity have significantly slowed down.
This is a small core set of committers and community though. It would be
great to get some new blood and folks interested in the project.

I still believe that we should try and target a 0.2-incubating release with a
layer service and some basic integration with Apache Tika (a GDAL parser is
being worked on in that community with an eye towards integration into SIS).
Also we are looking at Apache OODT as a mechanism for geospatial storage and
persistence.

The ESRI interest mentioned in the last board report hasn't really gone
anywhere.

* Project progress since last report

SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.

Development progress has been pretty much nil. Chris hopes to start work on
the layer service this quarter, but again, it would be great to have some new
blood here. Folks that are interested in geospatial services, data
presentation, and such would be much welcomed within the project.


--------------------

Sqoop

A tool for efficiently transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and
structured datastores such as relational databases.

Sqoop was accepted into Apache Incubator on June 11, 2011. Status
information is available at http://incubator.apache.org/projects/sqoop.html.

Progress since last report:
* CCLA from Cloudera regarding license grant for existing Sqoop code from
Cloudera has been received by ASF.
* Source code has been migrated to Apache SVN.
* Apache Mailing Lists and JIRA for Sqoop are now in active use. The
Cloudera Mailing Lists and JIRA have begun the process of being phased out.
* Development activities have started with two issues resolved and others
under active development.

Issues before graduation
* Create Sqoop web site.
* Make an incubating release.
* Grow the community size and diversity.
* review all license headers (all contains Cloudera).
* change java package from com.cloudera.sqoop to org.apache.sqoop.


--------------------

Stanbol

Stanbol is a modular software stack and reusable set of components for
semantic content management.
Entered incubation on 2010-11-15.

1. A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation.
- make a first release (depends on a first release of Apache Clerezza to
eliminate SNAPSHOT dependencies)
- create demos showing the power of Stanbol to grow the community
- improve documentation and web site to lower the barrier for new users

2. Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be
aware of
- none

3. How has the community developed since the last report
- Florent Andre was elected as a new committer
- some new users showed up on the mailing list
- Potentially new users from the CMS industry were attracted in a Stanbol
hands-on session during a CMS community workshop organized by the IKS
project in Paris
(http://www.iks-project.eu/news-and-events/events/mycms-and-web-data-iks-com
munity-workshop)

4. How has the project developed since the last report.
- Code preparations for first release (solved incompatible license issues,
license headers, release profile, etc.)
- Added new component "FactStore"
- Integration tests added to EntityHub
- CMIS module added to CMS Adapter


--------------------

VCL

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.

Community Involvement

As stated in the previous report, the Apache VCL community continues to
grow. We're seeing more people start to contribute to our online
documentation and file JIRA issues. We're also starting to see more patches
attached to JIRA issues.

We continue to see growing interest in the VCL project from a variety of
locations.

We are currently working on growing the committers for Apache VCL project.

Releases

The Apache VCL 2.2.1 version was release on April 8th 2011 and addressed
bugfixes and minor improvements.

Our next release Apache VCL 2.3 is on track and we are targeting late fall
timeframe. New features planned include support for the KVM hypervisor which
is to be contributed by the community. In addition to KVM, the committers
will address server loads, and the improvement of cluster reservations.

Top Issues Before Graduation

Continue to increase contributors to establish a more diverse development
community


--------------------

Whirr

Whirr is a library for running services in the cloud.

Whirr was accepted into the incubator on 11 May 2010. Status information is
available at http://incubator.apache.org/projects/whirr.html.

Progress since the last report (May 2011): We have made a fifth incubator
release (0.5.0-incubating). We added three committers to the PPMC. We
continue to get contributions from outside the initial committer base. Whirr
was covered in two presentations at the end of last month at OSCON.

The Whirr PPMC and the Incubator PMC have voted for Whirr to graduate as a
TLP (http://s.apache.org/ZbH, http://s.apache.org/Ebj).

Plans for the next period:
* Perform post-graduation steps.
* Do a sixth release.
* Encourage community growth.


--------------------

Wink

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of REST
style web services. The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311)
standard. The project also introduces a client runtime which can leverage
certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink will deliver
component technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of
environments.

Apache Wink has been incubating since 2009-05-27.

Notable Activity:

* New users are starting to post to the wink-user mailing list.

Planned Activity:

* JAX-RS 2.0 is starting up in the JCP. May attempt to prototype/develop
against the next specification to provide an eventual JAX-RS 2.0 compliant
runtime.
* Work towards graduation.

Top issues before graduation:


--------------------

Wookie

Wookie is a Java server application that allows you to upload and deploy
widgets for your applications. Wookie is based on the W3C Widgets
specification, but widgets can also be included that use extended APIs such
as Google Wave Gadgets and OpenSocial.

Wookie has been incubating since 17th July 2009

Since May 2011:
* Release 0.9 put out for vote
* Published a new CMS website with more documentation
* Explored with Apache Rave(incubating) community and Wookie community
members idea of separate common "widget store" for handling metadata and
discovery of widgets. Rough consensus was to develop separately for now,
identify potential for merging later. Community members associated with two
EU-funded projects (ROLE and ITEC) have been developing Wookie-based widget
stores, and we hope to get their code submissions to kickstart this work.
* Community members exploring Apache Amber (incubating) for oAuth
support within Wookie

Next steps:
* Finish 0.9.0 release and move onto a 0.9.1 release
* Continue to work and liase with other projects
* Create a new "widget store" sub-project, aiming to bring in code
submissions from ROLE and ITEC projects

Issues before graduation:
* complete first release
* build community/expand user base


--------------------

Zeta Components

Apache Zeta Components are a high quality, general purpose library of loosly
coupled components for development of applications based on PHP.

What has been done:

- bug fixes

What is still in progress:

- getting a release
- one critical bug fix is still in review board waiting for
comments/approval, it is necessary for the next release
- minor bugs that should be fixed for the release have almost all been fixed

What needs to be done:

- get reviews and commit the patch in review board
- get a release, really


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache jUDDI Project

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

Releases

Libcloud 0.5.2 has been released on July 4th, 2011.

Community

* The development and user lists continue to stay active
* No new committers
* No new PMC Members
* Multiple patches and contributions from new developers


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Logging Project

- Community

Ivan Habunek was added to the Logging PMC effective July 18th.
Ivan has been an active participant and release manager for log4php.

Stefan Bodewig will be added barring board objection to the Logging PMC
and will assist mentoring new contributors in a log4net release push.

- Project Branding Requirements

  - log4j and log4j-extras conform to the requirements.
  - log4php completed the branding requirements in July (with latest release).
  - log4net should be brought into conformance with
        newly started release push.
  - other log4j companions will be brought into conformance in
        long promised release pushes.
  - log4cxx has had no activity.

  There was some discussion relative to the log4j companions whether
  a release could be done without addressing the branding requirements.
  There does not appear to be an explicit statement that lack of conformance
  to the branding requirements should block a release even if it had
  sufficient votes. At the moment, the question is academic as no
  such release candidate has been prepared.

- Development

log4j 1.2:

No development this period. Release pushes for several log4j companions to
support a Chainsaw release push are long overdue. Christian Grobmeier who
has build log4php releases has expressed willingness to assist in the
release pushs.


log4j 2.0:

Development of Log4j 2.0 has been progressing with a steady stream of commits
from a single developer on a private branch. A few discussions have taken
place on the developer's list and related discussions have taken place on
the Maven and Commons developers list in an effort to raise awareness and
generate involvement. However, as yet no one else has asked to participate
in the development.

The log4j 2.0 discussion has led to a discussion on commons-logging.

log4cxx:

No development this period.

log4net:

Several new contributors have expressed interest in assisting to prepare
a log4net release. Stefan Bodewig has volunteered to provide mentoring
and commit submitted patches. This effort has just started in the last
week or so and hopefully it will result in a new release and additional
committers.

log4php:

log4php has released version 2.1 in July carried out mainly by two committers.
There were several contributions from users to log4php. Currently there are
discussions on the content of the next release.

Chainsaw:

No development this period. Expect release push after log4j companions on which
Chainsaw depends are released.

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

STABLE

3.2 branch is in the process of being released, currently waiting on the
release of snapshots dependencies on other projects.  Some users have already
started contributing patches to the pre-release 3.2 branch which is a definite
sign of pent up demand.  With a stronger push hopefully we can see this code
released in the next month.

TRUNK

Push toward Java EE 6 Web Profile certification of the Tomcat integration
(TomEE) continues in trunk.  Significant progress has been made since last
report.

Still some heavy lifting yet to be done and that last stretch is usually the
hardest.  The weakest area was in the CDI integration.  That is now in pretty
good shape in OpenEJB core and still some work yet to be done in the TomEE
side of the CDI integration.  JAX-RS support has also been added and is now
functional and brought with it an improved CXF integration.

The experimental distributed TCK setup on Amazon EC2 with my account seems to
have proven useful.  While only run occasionally -- couple times a month -- it
has been convenient to see overall progress.  Though convenient, it still is
not getting utilized to any critical capacity.  If that changes, we might want
to consider a more permanent solution or a setup similar to Geronimo's TCK
setup.  Regardless of where the TCK is run "all at once", the real bottleneck
to forward progress is the number of individuals with the TCK setup on their
dev machines.  Still only a handful of individuals setup for TCK work.
Hopefully we can improve that.

COMMUNITY

We are pleasantly experiencing a little bubble of new contributor activity
with patches coming in from 3 to 4 new faces.  Areas range from tooling such
as a twitter retweet bot, examples and documentation, to bug fixes.  Patches
have backlogged as a result. We've re-setup an old script to report unreviewed
patches in JIRA, sorted by patch date, and this has helped increase visibility
of overlooked/forgotten patches quite a bit.  With so many willing
contributors, better responsiveness and clearer definition of work to be done
will be key ingredients in turning this batch of contributors into committers.

There was an OpenEJB/TomEE presence at OSCON this last month.  The actual
presentation was business as usual, but there was a "Java Standards
Annoyances" fishbowl session I participated in just before my session that
bore some interesting fruit.  Specifically, JCP Chair Patrick Curran attended
and was thrown several questions/complaints about TCK transparency from
myself, Jeff Genender and others.  He detailed several changes in the proposed
JSR-38 that would disallow such secrecy and NDAs going forward in the JCP.
JavaWorld was there and covered the story[1].  I followed up with him
personally after OSCON to ask about immediate relief for the here and now, aka
the Java EE 6 TCK NDA requirements, and he implied there might be some
willingness to revise that requirement with current licensees.  This is
something we may want to pursue.  Certainly, being able to disclose results
would be a big help to OpenEJB, Geronimo and any other projects in the Java EE
circle subject to TCK testing.

Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Perl Project

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since the last report.

trunk is now compatible with the new Perl 5.14

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since the last report.

trunk is now compatible with the new Perl 5.14

work to fully support httpd-2.4 has been started and is moving along.

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

No new Apache-Test releases since the last report

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since the last report


--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

No new Apache-Reload releases since the last report.

-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

No new Apache-DBI releases since the last report

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
applied with due consideration for our production userbase.


-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is quiet, with a few bug reports and user questions.
nothing noteworthy has happened since the last report.


-- PMC --

The PMC has discussed the release process and would like to modify the release
process. This, however, would be against existing release rules at the ASF. We
have discussed a possible motion for the board to create an exception for some
of the perl subprojects.

Currently, a mod_perl-2.x release is made up of mod_perl itself, Apache-Test,
Apache-Reload, Apache-SizeLimit and Apache-DBI. The PMC stil feels that these
sub-modules need to be bundled as part of the mod_perl release, to provide users
with a useful, self-contained package.

However, since each of these sub-modules is a project in itself, releasing each
of them requires a vote. So, for a typical release, the release manager has to
create distributions for 4 modules, and get these voted on _before_ the mod_perl
release itself can even start.

In the past, this was not a big issue with a lot of active developers, but
nowadays, these votes are much slower in coming around.

Instead, what we are suggesting is to allow us to keep each sub-module separate
in source-control, but treat a +1 vote on the assembled mod_perl release
(including all modules) to effectively imply a +1 vote on release each of the
sub-modules as well.

The current proposed text of such an exception is:

'The mod_perl PMC petitions the ASF board to exempt the
Apache::Sizelimit, Apache::Reload, Apache::DBI, and Apache::Reload
modules to skip over the normal release rules governing ASF project
releases and be released directly to CPAN.  With the large number of
sub-projects the mod_perl project has spawned, the number of votes to
do a major mod_perl release can reach 12, which is 4x as much as some
other ASF projects.  Apache::Test continues to have participation from
httpd core members, and as such is consistently able to get enough
votes for releases, and does not need this exemption.'

The PMC would like the board's opinion on this issue and help getting this
issue resolved.

Attachment W: Status report for the Apache POI Project

Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft office
file formats.

Community
---------
In the last quarter we have added one new committer/PMC member, Jon
Svede. There are a few other potential committers who have submitted a
few substantial OOXML related patches, who we are working
with. Hopefully at least one of them will be proposed for
committership this quarter.

Traffic on the user list is steady this quarter, which is about 50% up
on this time last year. Dev list traffic is slightly up this
quarter. The number of reported issues is also up slightly, but we're
getting through quite a few of them, and patches are generally being
applied in a fairly timely manner.

Releases
--------
We've had two beta releases this quarter, 3.8 betas 1 and 2. We're
aiming for another beta release very soon, and likely 3.8 final this
quarter. (Our last stable release, 3.7, was released in
October). We're also in the process of moving to the new dist
svnpubsub model (as used by httpd et al), which we hope will make
releasing simpler and quicker.

Branding
--------
We believe we've now completed all the steps on the project branding
checklist.

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Qpid Project

Apache Qpid is a cross-platform Enterprise Messaging system which
implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), providing
message brokers written in C++ and Java, along with clients for C++,
Java JMS, .Net, Python, and Ruby.

Releases:

The current release is 0.10, with the 0.12 release currenty undergoing
vote for final release. The project has succesfully met it goal in
moving to a time based release schedule. The 0.10 and 0.12 release
have brought many new improvements from additional client binds to JCA
support for example.

Issues:

None to report.

Community:

User activity continues to be active, and there is quite a lot of
patch activity from new developers, which hopefully will earn
committership Keith has earned committership recently.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache River Project

Below is the August board report for River

Apache River is a distributed computing architecture, based on the JSK
Starter Kit Source code donated by Sun Microsystems, for the Jini
Specification.

Releases:
Our first TLP release (2.2.0) was finally made available on 28th July.

Progress:
As usual, the community is there but activity on dev@ is pretty slow.
There's usually a flurry of activity when one of our number manages to
find sme time and get something done.  We believe this proves that,
although small, the community exists and is still functioning well.

Community:
We made one invitation to committer/PMC status this period but it was
implicitly turned down (no response to offer email).  On the other
hand, the arguments which plagued the early days of River aren't
happening.  We're also getting involvement from Jini old hands.

Issues:
No board issues at this time.

Website/Trademark Checklist:
 - Project Website Basics : homepage is project.apache.org (COMPLETE)
 - Project Naming And Descriptions : use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc. (COMPLETE)
 - Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
   www.apache.org included (COMPLETE)
 - Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
   footers, etc. (INCOMPLETE, NOT CHECKED)
 - Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your
   site (INCOMPLETE, NOT CHECKED)
 - Project Metadata : DOAP file checkedin and up to date (INCOMPLETE,
   NOT CHECKED)

The board also asked to make sure that all PMC members had read the
PMC trademark/branding responsibilities.  [1]  4 out of 11 PMC members
confirmed that they'd read it, although I suspect that some of the
others had already read it given their involvement with other Apache
projects.  There was a very brief discussion that it wasn't
immediately obvious/clear when signing up for PMC duties that
"trademark enforcer" (quote from discussion, not referenced text) was
part of the role.  It seemed a fair comment but I hope that by
outlining the support provided by ASF we don't have to be legal
experts in this field to be able to keep an eye on how other entities
use the Apache River marks.

Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache Roller Project

Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based weblogging package that works
well on Tomcat and MySQL, and is also known to run on other servers and
databases.

The latest release of Apache Roller is v5.0, which was released
on May 8, 2011.

Since our last report, committer Shelan Perera has been working on mobile
theme support as part of his Google Summer of Code project. Work is wrapping
up this week.

Apart from that, the Roller community continues to be relatively quiet
with low traffic that mostly concerns technical support and installation
issues. No new committers or PMC changes to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

The Apache Santuario project is aimed at providing implementation of security
standards for XML.

There was one new release in the last quarter. Version 1.6.1 of the Apache
XML Security for C++ library was released in July, comprising of bug fixes
and a fix for the security advisory CVE-2011-2516.

Several bug fixes were made to the Java project. It is anticipated that a
1.4.6 release will take place in the next quarter. Work on the next major
release 1.5 slowed down a bit in the last quarter, but it is still expected
to be released in the next quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Subversion Project

** Board Issues

The Subversion project has no Board-level issues at this time.

** Community

The user community has seen its typical level of questions, answers,
and responsiveness. With our recent series of releases (see below),
we've seen some great testing as the project leads up to its 1.7 release.

The development community has been incredibly active since the 1.7
branch was created. There was a rather major division regarding the
underlying network provider to use for the 1.7 release. The community
handled this very well, working through the issue with lots of
discussion, stating positions, bringing up concerns, and bringing in
the necessary details to resolve the situation. While the community
disagreed, it was handled with the peer respect that we expect of our
communities. In the end, the issue was resolved just prior to this
Board report and meeting, and should allow the community to proceed
with the 1.7 release with many happier people.

** Releases

Since the last report, the Apache Subversion project has created the
stabilization branch for its 1.7.0 release. Since that time, the
project has release three alphas, and two betas (beta1 and beta3,
skipping beta2 for board-unimportant reasons).

The project is very close to releasing its first release candidate.
The only issue here is the rate of backports from trunk, and the
aforementioned network provider. Presumably, the rate of requests for
backporting to the stabilization branch will drop in the next few
weeks and an RC1 will be produced.

** Other

The project added two committers in June (moklo, arwin).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache Tcl Project

Tcl continues to turn over steadily but quietly, so there isn't much
to say, really. Massimo is running with Rivet, Ronnie is responsive
with Websh whenever anything arises there.

This milestone release is made for verification of the newly integrated
Fulcrum services and to gather experience (and documentation) on how to
migrate a 2.3.3 installation to the new architecture. It is not meant for
production use. We hope to get lots of feedback from users to release a stable
version of Turbine later this year.

Fulcrum component project

Work on migrating the build process of the Fulcrum components to Maven 2
continues.  No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

META project

There has been no activity on the META sub-project in this quarter.  No beta

Attachment AG: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project

The Web Services project develops several shared components that are
generally useful in implementing XML/SOAP based Web Services.

Summary:

Activity has been steady on our active subprojects, with light
community involvement.  Some project cleanup has occurred, but we
still need to wrap up some loose ends, get rid of commons, etc.

Code releases:

* Axiom 1.2.12 (July 6th)
* WSS4J 1.6.0 (April 15th)
* WSS4J 1.6.1 (June 8th)
* WSS4J 1.6.2 (August 11th)
* WSS4J 1.5.12 is in progress now
* Neethi 3.0.1 (July 21st)

PMC Membership:

Rich Scheuerle volunteered to drop off the PMC.  No other changes.

Cleanup, /dist/ and otherwise:

As per infra request, we did some cleanup in our dist area, but in
looking at it while writing this report, I believe there are still a
few dangling bits that should be removed.  This also reminds us that
we still haven't entirely finished archiving our retired projects,
although we made some progress in that regard as well.  I'd guess we
need a couple of days of concerted effort to finish this.

Branding requirements:

The top-level WS site as well as several subprojects have been
vetted/improved to match the branding guidelines.  However, we haven't
yet completed Woden or XmlSchema as of this report due to some site
building issues.  They should be in compliance shortly.

Board-level issues:

No issues to report.

Attachment AH: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

The PMC is in the process of spinning up from our recent re-forming.

Welcome to Steven Hathaway, who was elected the newest committer and PMC member!
Steven is working to get the Xalan-C documentation in order for the next
release.

We are still working on unraveling the issues around Xalan-J, XSLT 2.0, and the
"rogue" Google Summer of Code project that was started without any committer
involvement.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AI: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J

Our two GSoC students have been busy working on their projects over
the summer and are making the final push to complete them this week.

The focus of the committers is still on improving the schema
validator's conformance to the XML Schema 1.1 specification. Some
good progress has been made in the last few weeks.

We recently learned that the current release of Xerces-J does not
compile with Java SE 7. This issue with the build has been corrected
in SVN.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; about 230+ posts on the
j-dev and j-users lists since the beginning of May.

No new releases this quarter.

Xerces-C

No major development activity during the reporting period, except
for a few bug fixes.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; about 90+ posts on the c-dev
and c-users lists since the beginning of May.

No new releases this quarter.

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

Recently the trunk of XML Commons External was upgraded to the
StAX 1.2 APIs. This would be bundled with a future Xerces-J release.

No mailing list traffic to report other than JIRA issue updates.

The website and SVN location still need to be moved over from the
XML project.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

There's still some work left to do on the TLP website, including
adding TM to the project logo.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AJ: Status report for the Apache XML Project

The big news from the XML project is that we finally managed to start
the process of moving XIndice to the Attic. The vote just passed, and
the move will start in the next few days. Once we are done with that,
it will be time for a last call to the various xml-related projects to
see what we should do with the existing xml web properties (DTDs and
other resources), then we will be able to fold the XML project
altogether.

No other issues requiring board attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project
