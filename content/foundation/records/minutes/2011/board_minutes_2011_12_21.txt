 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Doug]

       There were a few protracted discussions on ASF internal mailing
       lists this month involving foundation members.  Not all dialog
       was constructive.  In general, I encourage everyone in the
       foundation to think before posting both whether they are making
       (1) a positive contribution to the conversation; and (2) good
       use of everyone on the list's time.  I also encourage officers
       that manage lists to step in promptly when a thread goes out of
       control.

       More specifically, a question about how the foundation operates
       emerged from these discussions.  I remind folks that board
       members do not individually set foundation policy.  The board
       as a whole either directly votes to create policies or
       delegates the setting of policy in an area to an officer.  Once
       an area (legal, fundraising, branding, etc.) is delegated, then
       all decisions for that area belong to the officer, not to the
       board, unless or until the board revisits that delegation.

    B. President [Jim]

       Apologies for not being able to attend this meeting.

       The last month has seen its share of sometimes-useful and sometimes
       not-so-much discussions on the 2 main ASF mailing lists. I want to
       ensure the membership that the ASF is running quite well; sure there
       are some issues that could be addressed in a more timely manner,
       but all-in-all, we have a lot to be proud of.

       The unfortunately named external blog post entitled "Apache Considered
       Harmful" succeeded in its goal of, as with most posts so named,
       grandstanding with a small smattering of useful data. Myself and
       others tried to clear the air and address some of the most blatant
       "inaccuracies" within that post and were quite happy to see the
       large and almost universal support of Apache and Foundations from
       the people who really know and understand such things.
       
       I'm quite happy with the continued work being done by #infra re.
       the evaluation and "testing" of git within the ASF, and want to
       also thank those projects offering to help as "test cases."

       I renewed our EA's contract for another 6 months. At present, her
       prime task is the finalization of the ASF wide calendar and she has
       contacted stakeholders in that effort. I am also aware of other tasks
       that other officers and Directors have in place and in vision for her.

       Sally is working on the Annual Report. There has also been some prelim
       budget discussions regarding infra and PR, and budgeting will start in
       earnest the start of the year. I also plan to start making more use
       of the EVP position to further optimize operations.

       2011 ends with the ASF in, imo, capable hands and doing quite well,
       thank you.

       See Attachment N

       Incorrect preamble. What Sam asked the Incubator to focus on
       was (a) police the lack of attention by mentors on projects
       that have been incubating for years, and (b) set the
       expectation that a podling produces AT THE VERY MINIMUM a
       credible plan that they are executing on which will lead to
       graduation at some point. Sam has reiterated these two points
       on the incubator mailing list.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. 990 tax disclosures for 2007-1010
       On the members list, Bill Rowe notes that those are still missing
       from http://www.apache.org/foundation/records/

       The Treasurer role should make sure that the IRS 990 forms are
       posted to the public web site.
    
    B. Annual report - where do your donations go?
       Are we planning to have such a report for 2011?
       
       Beyond any legal requirements, Apache's Annual Report should be
       useful as a marketing document.
    
    C. How do we improve invoicing and bill payment timeliness?
       We've had issues for months getting bills paid on time using 
       the normal procedures, including an invoice being sent very 
       late to get the ~$20k GSoC funds.  Who can improve this? 

       AI: Bertrand discuss with Sally how to get her invoices
       submitted in the appropriate place in svn.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management

Operations And Community
========================

The Apache OpenOffice podling has chosen that as their official name
going forward (by a [VOTE]). 

The Apache OpenOffice podling, trademarks@, and press@ dealt with a number 
of potential misuses of the OpenOffice.org brand, in particular a fundraising 
campaign run by a German charity Team OpenOffice e.V..  Along with a number 
of private requests to Team OpenOffice, we've also issued an open letter to 
the larger ODF ecosystem to better tell the branding story of where 
OpenOffice.org and Apache OpenOffice are going in the future. 

https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/open_letter_to_the_open

Special thanks to several of the Apache OpenOffice mentors who were working 
on the community and other aspects of this issue.

External Requests
=================

Team OpenOffice e.V. requested permission from the Apache OpenOffice podling 
to create a separate software product branded as OpenOffice.org.  This 
request has been denied.

As usual, answered a handful of regular brand usage requests on trademarks@, 
typically by referring to our published policies and FAQs.

Trademark Registrations
=======================

The existing Hadoop mark registration has been transferred from Larry Rosen to
SFLC / Aaron Williamson as our contact attorney.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising

SPONSORSHIP
Huawei Technologies will start as a silver sponsor effective January 1st.

Prepared and submitted invoice for 2nd half of Microsoft's platinum 
sponsorship.

Worked on a presentation for C-levels not familiar with open source who 
need to understand how the ASF's purpose aligns with their interests.  IBM
will be specific target, but we have shared an old version for now that 
Jim had.

Gav got the VMWare sponsorship pushed forward, we got the invoice made, 
the PO was issued, and payment is on the way.

AMD's renewal invoice was prepared and a quote to support it.  Payment is
on the way.

COMMUNITY
Gav and Daniel have been great pushing forward and taking some initiative.
I still owe a review on the status file data to make sure we're all on the
same page and they can run with certain tasks.

We were shared an issue with Open Office fragments try to claim that they
would accept fundraising, but Trademarks and Press and the PMC are
handling this issue and I do not see it significantly impacting
fundraising.

I offered to prepare the invoice for the GSOC money in the future since we
have our own invoice process for sponsorships.

In a couple of weeks, it'll be time to prepare the donation letters. This
should be straight forward as I've tested that I still valid paypal 
account credentials and the Word doc that I merge to create these letters.

Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

Most of the productive work of the committee continues via JIRA.  One
item I would specifically call to attention involves the Apache OpenOffice
project shipping GPL dictionaries:

  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-117

There was a significant abuse of the legal-internal mailing list.  That
has since quieted down.  Repeated abuses will not be tolerated, and will
result in the individual in question being unsubscribed.  Such an action
will not affect any read-only access that the individual may have via
the web archives, nor even their ability to post - it simply will be the
case that such posts will need to be individually moderated in.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

For November 2011: There continues to be a steady stream of reports of
various kinds arriving at security@.  These continue to be dealt with
by the security team.  

5      Support question
1      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
8      Vulnerability reports, of which:
       3  [httpd, via security@apache.org]
       2  [tomcat, via security@tomcat.apache.org]
       1  [tomcat, via security@apache.org]
       1  [myfaces, via security@apache.org]
       1  [oo, via securityteam@openoffice.org]

The Security project performs really two duties, we receive incoming
reports of security vulnerabilities in ASF software, and we help
projects understand and deal with such reported security
vulnerabilities.  These reports come to security@apache.org usually
from parties outside of the ASF.  We keep track of metrics of how many
issues get reported, in what way, along with the number of
non-security reports just to give the board an idea of the magnitude
of external reports and for trending.  Once an issue is passed to the
appropriate PMC we no longer track it, and therefore we can't give
overall summaries of how quickly ASF respond to issues or severity
trending or total vulnerability counts including those issues dealt
with reported direct to a PMC or found by ASF members internal to a
project. Because our interaction with each issue is minor, there isn't
much additional information we can give in our monthly reports.

Reminder: vulnerability handling process explained at
http://apache.org/security/committers.html

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

General
-------
We've had fruitful discussions with O'Reilly about OSCON. On the speaker 
side, we will be running "virtual tracks", where we highlight and 
signpost Apache related talks within the overall schedule. We'll also be 
encouraging Apache committers to submit to the CFP (due in a week or 
two), to help drive Apache content at OSCON.

Alongside this, we've been allocated a room on the Monday and Tuesday, 
in which we hope to run community events. The outline plan is a mixture 
of themed hackathons, fast feather style talks on new projects and 
longer talks on existing ones. We'll also hopefully do hackathons and 
community events alongside the main tracks, but likely offsite. Ross and 
Noirin in particular have agreed to help drive this, and we'll likely 
seek more volunteers + firm up the plan in the new year.

Cloudera agreed to the changes recommended by legal-internal, and so 
we've signed the renewal MOU. The signed copy is in 
/foundation/Contracts/

The speed of getting bills paid is causing some surprise for people who 
have paid for conference related things (eg the Asia Roadshow or 
ApacheCon Recorders). We are hopeful that recent board@ discussions on 
other bills is a sign this is already in hand.

Small Events
------------
We held our 2nd BarCampApache in Sydney on the 10th of December. 
Attendance was down on last year, but good sessions were had by those 
who did come. A very helpful brainstorming session on future events was 
held, and we hope this will lead to more small events, and a much bigger 
BarCamp next year.

There have been discussions on a small-ish event in the DC area, 
provisionally planned for early next year. Venues are being 
investigated, and we expect a firm plan and a wider call for volunteers 
once the space is identified. Provisional planning has begun for 
another Irish retreat. Initial interest indicates there may not be 
enough people who can make another weekend event, so we may need to look 
at another venue (the one used in the past is only available on 
weekends). This has also spawned discussion on another round of outreach 
to PMCs and Committers around small event interest, which may well be 
used to influence the retreat planning.

No other future small events are currently known about.

ApacheCon
---------
We're waiting to hear back from our potential host on which week in late 2012
we can have, and linked to that which exact conference centre + space we've 
got. (This is the process of turning our outline approval into a 
specific space on a specific date). Once that is all confirmed, we'll 
internally announce the details and ask for volunteers (previously self 
identified and others) to join the planners list and kick things off.

Work on the RFP has continued since ApacheCon, and we think we're still 
on track to open the process in early January.

At this time, we believe we have captured all the MUST and MUST NOT 
requirements we received from the board. (This is alongside the concom 
gathered requirements and areas for producer innovation). However, it's 
entirely possible that we've missed one of the board requirements, or 
mis-understood one. We'd therefore encourage board members to review the 
current draft, and give feedback if they feel we've missed anything. The 
draft is available in: 
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/foundation/Events/RFP_2011

Committee
---------
No new committee members have been added this month, and there are not 
currently any in the pipeline.

Planning for the future of the committee has taken a backseat to the RFP 
and the Sydney BarCamp. Once the RFP is out, we hope to be able to 
produce a plan that supports volunteers interested in putting on smaller 
events, welcomes new ones, and avoids the impression of not welcome new 
people. (This will need to also support the required interactions with 
external third parties, which is currently mixed in with volunteer 
events)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

Floated the concept of providing Sam Ruby a place to supply
a grab bag of useful CGI scripts he has developed over
the years.  Originally hosted on the id.apache.org server
as rubys.apache.org but is in the process of being redeployed
to a separate VM named whimsy.apache.org.

Rejiggered switch 2 (our "private" switch) with OSUOSL
help to better align it with our goals of a single switch
per cabinet.

Setup tethys.apache.org for dedicated service to the OpenOffice
extensions and templates services.  As these services include
providing downloads for non-open-source licensed products,
explicit permission by VP Infra for this purpose was granted.
VP Infra delegated the final decision on licensing to the
Incubator PMC once OpenOffice proposes to graduate.

Setup translate.apache.org which is a pootle-backed service
for projects to use in their language translation efforts.

Initiated "Git Friday" to focus on git-related support issues
across the whole team on a weekly basis.

Discussed installation of new aurora into SARA with Bart van
der Schans and Wim Biemolt of SARA.  Progress is gated on
Wim getting back to us on the status of our to-be-determined
additional rack space.

Tony Stevenson put in his notice to return to paid contractor
status starting Jan 1.

Opened the floor to input on contract terms for sysadmins, in
particular the immediate part-term post(s).  General feedback
on the idea of including explicit metrics in the terms was
negative.

Wrote a testimonial for the FreeBSD Foundation regarding our
FreeBSD deployments.

Gave the CMS a big performance boost by replacing the rsync
usage with zfs clones.

Put out an RFP for participation in our ongoing alpha test
of git hosting.  7 projects responded; all 7 were accepted:
  wicket, callback, cassandra, s4, cassandra, deltaspike,
  trafficserver, deltacloud.
Participating projects are required to provide an infra
volunteer to work on the git hosting code.

Got Thawte's nod for a wildcard cert via Bill Rowe's contacts
(waiting on Sam Ruby to chase up Brian the sales rep).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

General
=======

List is fairly quiet, some post-apachecon summary talk some digging up 
of past mails to satisfy a board report action item from last month.

No change to the committee membership.

ApacheCon NA 2011 Vancouver
===========================

Our TAC person on the ground Zoe provided a summary of the experiences 
at ApacheCon with the TAC attendees.
Overall they did a wonderful job, even adjusting to last minute changes 
and additions. It was felt that too much work was asked for some, such 
as evening presentation work in addition to day time roles. Yes we should 
be giving work for them to do as part of their experience at an event, 
but balance it fairly with allowing them time to enjoy the conference, 
the venue and the town/city also.

Costs are not calculated yet, I'll be asking our EA to collate that 
together soon.

Other Events:
-------------

No news about any other events happening at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache APR Project

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.

Releases
--------

The first apr-util 1.4.x release is in progress.  The 1.4.x branch
maintains the interfaces of the 1.3.x branch (the stable branch since
June 2008) and introduces several new features, the most important
of which is access to certain crypto capabilities in other libraries.
The branch has been in development for several years without a release.

The active branches had releases in May of this year.  The most
recent release of any branch was of the legacy APR 0.9.x branch in 
September 2011.

Community
---------
New PMC members or committers: none

The number of open bugs and enhancement requests has grown slightly
to 138 during the current reporting period, with little developer
activity focused on them, such that the newly opened bugs are mostly
unaddressed.

Mailing list activity has increased dramatically due to the activity
around the apr-util 1.4.x release, but is otherwise very low.

Development
-----------
Activity has been minimal other than resolving issues found while
preparing and testing the apr-util 1.4.x release.

Issues
------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Archiva Project

Apache Archiva is an extensible repository management software that helps
taking care of your own personal or enterprise-wide build artifact 
repository. It is the perfect companion for build tools such as Maven, 
Continuum, and ANT.

Releases
--------

* 1.4-M1 release 2011-10-26

Community
---------

* A number of users and contributors, including a past GSoC (2010) 
participant, has expressed their interest in working on the project.

Development
-----------

* As reported in the previous board reports, there were a number of planned 
  refactorings of Archiva trunk. Below are the status of each of them: 

  - moving the UI to another framework (in-progress)

  - removal of all plexus components (completed)

  - replace or overhaul the security system used (UI overhaul of current 
    security system used has been done to integrate with the UI refactorings
    in Archiva)

* For Archiva's UI refactoring, the aim is to make it fast and simple, and
to de-couple it with the core. For the latter aspect, the REST services for
Archiva's functionalities are already complete. The UI overhaul will start
at the integration with the recent UI changes made in the security system 
used, which is Redback (http://redback.codehaus.org/).   

* Patches have also started coming in for the OSGI integration with Apache
Karaf.

* 1.4-M2 release discussion is currently underway. The release will
possibly include improvements for the Maven index support, upgrades on some 
of the libraries used and a number of bug fixes.

Development

* 3.1 Milestone 3 release announced on September 27.
* Work on 3.0.3 (Stable/Bug Fixes) and 3.1 (Milestone 4) releases continue.
* Google Summer of Code completed creating a working and usable Eclipse plugin 
  for Cayenne Modeler which now needs to be integrated into the main distribution.
* DocBook migration of Confluence documentation continues.


Web site

Highlighting unfinished items from Branding Requirements 
(per http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs )
* Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org 
  included -> Needs work. Consider how to rearrange navigation to avoid confusion 
  between links which leave the Cayenne site and those which don't.
* Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site -> OK, 
  other than 'tm' symbols
* Further work on the website styling on hold pending our evaluation of Apache CMS
  as a replacement for Confluence (for the pages which aren't product documentation).


Community

* Christian Grobmeier published two articles about Cayenne (written in German) 
  in JavaMagazin.  In October, an introductory article about Cayenne and in 
  November, an article illustrating Cayenne's Remote Objects features.

* Mailing list activity is average on developer and user lists. The user list 
  and developer list are both seeing new names appear as more people seem 
  interested in Cayenne and are exploring it.  Also a number of bug reports and 
  patches have filtered into JIRA from these newcomers.

Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

Apache Commons provides a large set of reusable Java components. Commons
components are widely used in many projects, both at Apache and outside.

There are no particular problems that would require board support.

The functor component graduated from sandbox to the "commons proper"
category on 2011-09-19.

A proposal for promoting another sandbox component to commons proper
(commons-id) has been discussed and delayed. Some work and analysis has
to be done on it and several people are willing to have a look at it.

Several components have been released since last report:
        Commons DButils  1.4 (2011-10-24)
        Commons Digester 3.1 (2011-10-29)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds many ASF
projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java part of the
foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and log4net.

== Summary ==

No Board level issues.

== Releases ==

The ASF installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all
of the time.  The project is in a state of a perpetual beta.  There
have been no releases.

== Activity ==

The Gump project really consists of two parts, the code base for the
project and the ASF installations[1] running this code base to build
many ASF projects as well as some related projects.

The code base mostly does what its current users need so there isn't
much development going on at all.

There are only a few people contributing across all projects and a few
additional people maintaining the metadata of the projects they are
interested in the most.

This quarter we've seen quite a few of the external projects Gump
builds move to either hg or git (usually to github in the later case).
This probably is no new development, we mostly only notice it if the
old SCM stops working.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

No new committers to the code base, no changes to the PMC.

== Branding and Naming ==

We believe to meet all branding requirements.

== Statistics ==

As of Thu, 1 Dec 2011 the ASF installations check out a bit more than
180 source trees (114 from the ASF repository) and try to build a bit
less than 850 "projects".  A complete Gump run takes about ten hours
on vmgump and about eight and a half on the FreeBSD jail and nine on
Adam where more projects fail to build.

[1] the main instance at http://vmgump.apache.org/gump/public/ , a
    FreeBSD jail at http://gump.zones.apache.org/gump/public/ and a
    Mac OS X Server at http://adam.apache.org/gump/

-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Hive Project

Apache Hive is a data warehouse written on top of Apache Hadoop.  It
provides SQL to query and manage data (in the form of tables and
partitions stored in HDFS or external systems) and provides a
metastore containing metadata information about the stored data.

Releases:

No new releases.

The 0.8.0 release was delayed due to unexpected complexity while
putting together upgrade scripts for the non-trivial metastore
changes, but is expected within a few weeks for real this time.

Community:

* Ashutosh Chauhan was added as a committer.

* 424 contributors (commented, filed bugs or contributed to
Hive). This was 373 at the last report time (September 2011)

Branding Checklist:

We've created HIVE-2432 to track this, with sub-tasks corresponding to
each item.

* Project Website Basics:  [DONE]
* Project Naming And Descriptions: [IN PROGRESS]
* Website Navigation Links: [IN PROGRESS]
* Trademark Attributions: [IN PROGRESS]
* Logos and Graphics: [DONE]
* Project Metadata:  [IN PROGRESS]

Regarding the Project Metadata, a followup question about the DOAP
file was sent to trademarks@apache.org but has not yet received a
reply.  trac.usefulinc.com seems to have been attacked by spammers.
For details, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2433.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

We've all been aware that the Incubator has been growing more than
graduating, over the years.  Last month, Sam started a discussion regarding
being more proactive and pushing projects out of the nest, basically one way
or another, after a year.  A real issue is pushing out those really ready to
graduate, and doing the garbage collection on those that are already dead
(and may have even voted to terminate).  In-between are those projects that
are struggling to achieve critical mass, but are active with who they do
have involved.  The response from mentors of various projects was quite
encouraging, both in specifics and in concept, and hopefully we'll start to
see a wave of TLP requests, following ACE, Bean Validation, and Empire-DB.

Meanwhile, Apache DeltaSpike -- a collection of JSR-299 (CDI) Extensions for
building applications on the Java SE and EE platforms -- was voted for
Incubation.

There has also been excellent discussion about pruning and clarifying
Incubation rules and process, to be more streamlined and minimal.

With respect to the monthly board report, since the last report (and since
the schedule change), we've changed how reminders are processed, and hope to
be well on the way to cleaning up the problem where the wrong projects were
listed and reminded.  There were still a few glitches for this month, but
hopefully they're resolved for next.  Brett Porter, Dave Crossley,
Upayavira, Jim, and others have contributed to the efforts, and are well
deserving of continued thanks.

Even so, and despite an extra day and reminder, neither HISE nor KATA
reported.  Wave did take advantage of the time to report.

--------------------
Accumulo

Accumulo is a sorted, distributed key/value store based on BigTable's
design.  Accumulo entered incubation in September 2011.

In the move towards graduation, we must address:
1. Learning Apache procedures
2. Creating releases
3. Building a community

Community Development:
* active discussion on mailing lists and on JIRA tickets
* three new contributors have submitted patches this month
* logo voted upon

Project Development:
* made progress towards releasing 1.3.5 (now on candidate 10)
* incorporated lessons from failed release candidates into redesign of
release process for trunk
* fixed bugs / tested code / added documentation


--------------------
Ambari

Ambari is monitoring, administration and lifecycle management project for
Apache Hadoop clusters.

* Incubating since 30 August 2011.
* Picked CTR instead of RTC.
* Development proceeding actively. (129 jiras fixed so far, 15k of java)
* Should have first end to end test working soon.

Issues that must be addressed before graduation are:
* Making a release
* Attracting users and developers
* Increase diversity of developers outside of Hortonworks


--------------------
Amber

Amber has been incubating since July 2010. Amber is a project to develop a
Java library which provides an API specification for, and an unconditionally
compliant implementation of the OAuth v1.0, v1.0a and v2.0 specifications.
OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to authenticate and authorise access
by another party to resources they control while avoiding the need to share
their username and password credentials.

The most important issues that must be addressed before graduation are:

- Clarify status of code grant
- Attract users and developers
- Generate a release

The Incubator PMC / ASF Board should be aware that:

- Community activity is relatively low
- We need copyright signoff from University of Newcastle

How has the community developed since the last report

- New users / devs show up on the mailing lists both contributing patches
and asking for guidance/release

How has the project developed since the last report

- The old trunk has been moved to a branch amber-0.10 which reflects OAuth
0.10 spec
- The new trunk is being updated to latest 0.22 spec version
- Versions of artifacts have been aligned to the supported OAuth
specification supported
- Discussion about preparing for an initial release is ongoing


--------------------
Any23

Any23 is defined as a Java library, a Web service and a set of command line
tools to extract and validate structured data in RDF format from a variety
of Web documents and markup formats. Any23 is what it is informally named an
RDF Distiller.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Port Any23 code to ASF infrastructure and update license headers
  2. Develop a strong community with organizational diversity and with
strong connections to other relevant ASF communities.
  3. At least one Any23 incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC), Tika PMC, or ASF Board wish/need
to be aware of?

Yes, there has been ongoing work to bring the Any23 codebase to Apache SVN.
The final stages include loading the code dump to the Apache test repos,
there will then be a short time for the dev/committer team to review it,
before loading it to the real repos. A time frame for this has been set at
around a week.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Since our last report there have been no new committers. Development has
also not been tremendously active however when the code migration finally
completes this should improve.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Any23 was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on October 1, 2011.

As the code import has not yet been finalized, most of the project activity
has been off-site, this includes changes to the codebase. There has been
some interest from the Apache Nutch community to get an Any23/Nutch plugin
operational, for details see NUTCH-1129. In addition there is now a healthy
Jenkins nightly CI build running for the project. Issues in the short term
are to discuss Paolo Castagna's points regarding the integration of more of
the 'semantic web' projects which exist at Apache.


--------------------
BeanValidation

Bean Validation was accepted into Incubator on 1 March 2010.

The Bean Validation project is an implementation of the Java EE Bean
Validation JSR303 specification.

There are no other important issues open before a possible graduation.
The project has agreed to seek status as a TLP, and has agreed by an internal
vote on its readiness to graduate [1].  The primary task outstanding is the
completion of a charter.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of

* none

How has the community developed since the last report

* Mailing list and JIRA activity are extremely quiet.  We attribute this
to the nature of the podling, being but an implementation of a specification,
and the level of achievement of conformity to that specification.

How has the project developed since the last report

* we have upgraded to and continue to pass the latest available version of
the JSR303 TCK.
* we continue to track the progress of the JSR303 spec for the future.

--------------------
Bigtop

Bigtop is a project for the development of native packaging and stack
tests of the Hadoop ecosystem.

Bigtop entered incubation on June 20, 2011.

Primary issues blocking graduation:
* Need for increased diversity and additional committers.

Issues which Incubator PMC and/or ASF Board might need/wish to be aware of:
* Due to limitations in available platforms on Apache Jenkins
infrastructure and need for VM spin-up/spin-down for tests, we are
working directly with OSUOSL on build/test setup.

Community development since last report:
* Community meetup held Nov 8th, with mentors and committers alike
* Gave talks on Bigtop @ApacheCON 2011
* Bigtop was on the agenda of the HBase meetup on Nov 29th.
* Started a regular Bay Area Bigtop meetup/class:
http://www.meetup.com/HandsOnProgrammingEvents/events/43298072/

Project development since last report:
* 0.2.0-incubating released
* Added deployment code (puppet) to the project
* Work on the Bigtop stack based on Hadoop 0.22 has started
* Work on the Bigtop stack based on Hadoop 0.23 has started
* Used Bigtop to validate Zookeeper 3.3.4 and 3.4.0 releases
* Used Bigtop to validate HBase 0.92 RC
* Used Bigtop to validate Hadoop 0.22 RC and Hadoop 0.23 release
* Additional component project (Mahout) added.
* Supported platforms voted on.
* Next release of Bigtop has been voted on
* Increased the # and scope of integration tests


--------------------
Callback

Project Status
--------------

Infrastructure migration still underway; the only major sticking point is
that GIT is crucially important for our community and workflow. Additionally
we have voted to rename the project to "Cordova".

We are contributing to the CouchDB project documentation that describes use
and, more importantly, the cutting of Apache releases from Git
infrastructure. Our goal is to bring our project to that infrastructure, and
we recognize it's our responsibility to ensure the goals of legal and
community at Apache do not suffer for it.

A request to participate in the Git alpha testing has been made to
infrastructure. All mentors supported this request.

The name "Callback" was suboptimal for findability, and worse, authored
documentation relating to the JavaScript interfaces found in the project.
Cordova was the street of the old Nitobi office wherein the PhoneGap project
was conceived and has some community precedent in another related tooling
project. Discussion was positive, and the vote nearly unanimous. We now
need to address infra to engage the rename work (and probably send em a
bottle in thanks for being a pain the ass).

Community
---------

* Community is growing with documentation traffic, and downloads, up.
* The mailing list has been super active with new community members.
* Jira embraced however we are still getting issues logged on Github.
Committers are using Github as a funnel to capture issues, still, and
manually moving them to Jira once vetted.
* Renaming needs to be promoted.

Community Objectives
--------------------

* Migrate to the name Cordova and update the community appropriately.
* Continue to assist in documentation effort for CouchDB use of Git.

Releases
--------

* 1.2.x, Oct 31

(Proposed)

* 1.3.x, Dec 12 (this will not be an Apache release)
* 1.4.x, Jan 30
* 1.5.x, Feb 27
* 1.6.x, Mar 26
* 1.7.x, Apr 30
* 1.8.x, May 28
* 1.9.x, Jun 25
* 2.0.x, Jul 30


--------------------
Chukwa

Chukwa is an open source data collection system for monitoring large
distributed systems. Chukwa is built on top of the Hadoop Distributed File
System (HDFS), HBase and Map/Reduce framework and inherits Hadoop's
scalability and robustness. Chukwa also includes a flexible and powerful
toolkit for displaying, monitoring and analyzing results to make the best
use of the collected data.

* Completed migration to use HBase as data storage
* Updated documents for architecture, programming guide and quick start
guide.
* Preparing for Chukwa 0.5.0 release
* Migrated from ant build system to maven build system to reduce site
deployment overhead.

Chukwa depends on Apache Hadoop. More specifically, it requires a
stable version of Hadoop that supports append/sync. Since joining the
incubator, we have been unable to roll a release because these
requirements were not met. Now that there is a stable version of
Hadoop that supports the features we require, we expect to roll a
release presently, attract contributors, and set the project back on
track for graduation.


--------------------
DeltaSpike

(incubating since December 2011)

DeltaSpike will consist of a number of portable CDI extensions that provide
useful features for Java application developers. The goal of DeltaSpike is
to create a de-facto standard of CDI-Extensions that is developed and
maintained by the community.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention.

Since DeltaSpike entered incubation on December 7, 2011, we have
accomplished the following:

1. Setup of mailing-lists and confluence Wiki space.
2. Setup of JIRA project
3. Started initial discussions
4. Assist GIT documentation for CouchDB and other GIT users (like ourself).

Upcoming major goals:
--------

1. Finish setup (e.g. GIT repository)

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve before graduation:
--------
1. Build community
2. Create at least one release
3. Create Documentation


--------------------
DirectMemory

(incubating since October 2011)

Apache DirectMemory is a multi layered cache implementation featuring
off-heap memory management (a-la BigMemory) to enable efficient
handling of a large number of java objects without affecting jvm
garbage collection performance.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move
towards graduation.
1) Ensure branding requirements are met (still to be worked out)
2) Ensuring IP is cleared (closed: all initial code has committed by
Raffaele Guidi, which has completed the IP clearance and donation process)
3) Understanding process/decision making guidelines (new committer process
is ok, release process still yet to be worked out)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware
of

- We lost one mentor (still not too bad, we have others but we will miss
Christian)


How has the community developed since the last report

- Two more people have asked for inclusion in the team as committers up on
the mailing lists
- Tasks and proposals contributed by non-committers


How has the project developed since the last report.

- Healthy activity on 3rd parties integrations such as Apache Karaf
(complete with an ad-hoc module) and Apache Commons JCS (still in progress
with help from the JCS team)


--------------------
Etch

Etch was accepted into Incubator on 2 September 2008.

Etch is a cross-platform, language- and transport-independent framework for
building and consuming network services. The Etch toolset includes a network
service description language, a compiler, and binding libraries for a
variety of programming languages.

- We did some progress to implement the Etch binding-cpp runtime. Basic
framework parts like the OS abstraction layer, collection types, runtime
components are already done.
- The initial content for the new Apache Etch website
http://etch.staging.apache.org/etch/ has been completed and we plan to do
the transition while the next few days (voting has still to be done).
Technical Etch documentation will be converted afterwards (Docbook PDF and
HTML)
- We fixed some bugs in the C, Java and C# bindings
- All issues for our next release are resolved and we started to prepare the
release packaging and voting process
- Open issues towards graduation were identified and we started a discussion
on our mailing list about this
- The new PPMC and Committer Martin Veith could be acquired

future tasks:
- Bug fixing
- Technical documentation in the Docbook format
- Further development on the binding-cpp
- Community development
- Solve open issues towards graduation


--------------------
Flume

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data to
scalable data storage systems such as Apache Hadoop's HDFS.

Flume entered incubation on June 12th, 2011.

=== Progress since last report  ===

* Flume trademark inquiry has been resolved. Flume will retain its name as
an Apache project.
* Flume PPMC voted in two new committers - Prasad Mujumdar and Mingjie Lai
* Active development is going on in FLUME-728 branch.
 * FLUME-728 branch has gone through two milestones - "NG alpha 1" and "NG
alpha 2". A total of 50 issues have been fixed in these two milestone.
 * A release is being planned for 1.0.0-alpha-1 based on this branch.
* An inaugural Flume Meetup was held in New York on November 9, 2011 which
was attended by 40 users and developers.

=== Issues before graduation ===

* Create Flume web site.
* Make an incubating release.
* Grow the community size and diversity.


--------------------
Gora

Gora is an ORM framework for column stores such as Apache HBase and Apache
Cassandra with a specific focus on Hadoop.

A list of the three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation

  1. Fix failing module tests within the Jenkins CI build
  2. Update both project site and wiki documentation with specific emphasis
on Hbase, Cassandra and SQL modules as well as the release process
  3. Write tests for Cassandra module as this would provide an additional
layer of consistency to the project. This is fundamental before a
0.2-incubating release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  1. The Gora PPMC recently voted to extend an invitation to Ferdy Galema,
he has however noted that he is on holiday and will not be able to accept
until his return.
  2. The community plans a 0.2-incubating release soon, and it will likely
coincide with the graduation VOTE that Chris Mattmann, champion for Gora,
will put forth.

How has the community developed since the last report?

With the addition of Ferdy Galema, as stated above there has also been
interest from one of Ferdy's colleagues and additionally Keith Turner who is
working on the Accumulo (Apache Incubator) project. Keith's intention is to
build a gora-accumulo store which would add significantly to Gora.

The project is currently VOTE'ing on its graduation, at this thread:
http://s.apache.org/AbC. So far community response looks good. If the VOTE
passes, we'll head over to general@incubator
and raise the VOTE there. If all is well on that VOTE, we're targetting a
January 2012 resolution to the board.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Gora was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on September 26, 2010.

Gora 0.1.1-incubating was successfully released on 24 September 2011 which
displays that the project has made 2 releases since entering the incubator.
Additionally a Jenkins CI build has been established and work is on way to
firstly fix the broken tests, before working to improve overall code test
coverage. In particular the modular nature of the project meant that
developers have decided that a Maven build was more appropriate than an
Ant/Ivy implementation.


--------------------
Hama

Hama was accepted into Incubator on 20 May 2008. Hama is a distributed
computing framework based on BSP (Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing
techniques for massive scientific computations.

== Top 2 or 3 things to resolve prior to graduation ==

* Grow the community size.

== Issues for the Incubator PMC or ASF Board ==

None.

== Community development ==

* Increased committers divergence.
* Accounts were created for two new committers.

== Project development ==

* Many new features (Counters, Combiners, I/O interface, YARN module) are
added.
* Some bug and performance issues are fixed.

--------------------
HCatalog

HCatalog is a table and storage management service for data created using
Apache Hadoop.

The most important issues in moving the project to graduation are expanding
the community of developers.

Since the last report we have:
* We have made our first release from incubator.
* Continued feature development, adding two major new features (added a new
datatype binary and hbase integration).
* Added a new committer Francis Liu (Yahoo!)

Currently there are 75 subscribers to the user list and 70 on the dev list.
There were 60 and 59 respectively last report (September 2011).

Community Development

* the work on json viewer has brought spawned an independent open source
project
 *  http://code.google.com/p/restfulobjects-js/
* Reasonably active mailing list; first "real" problem/change request raised
(and fixed)
* Presented lightning talk at CodeKen 2011 conf.
* Reworking site to improve the messaging (to go live in next release)
* To support the new site, an example online app demonstrating Isis is now
live at http://mmyco.co.uk:8180/isis-onlinedemo

Top 3 Issues to address in move towards graduation

* Improve the "marketing message" to bring in more users
 * see mailing list thread about this
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-isis-dev/201111.mbox/%3C4

*** DID NOT REPORT! ***

--------------------
Lucene.NET (We missed our Nov report, so we are reporting for Dec)

Lucene.Net was accepted into the Apache Incubator in February 2011.
Originally it was a sub project of the Lucene Project.

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and
targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:
* Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating
and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize
with the Java Lucene release schedule.
* High-performance C# search engine library.
* Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that
end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes
advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.

Recent Activity:

* Lucene.Net 2.9.4 was officially released Nov 29th, 2011
* Build scripts were created
* New incubator website utilizing the Logo from the StackOverflow contest

Current Activities:

* Preparing Lucene.Net 2.9.4g (Generics version of 2.9.4) for release in
January
* Began porting Java Lucene 3.0.3
* Began porting Java Lucene 4.0

Long term goals:

* Have a nearly fully automated process to convert Java Lucene to C#. (This
has been a goal, but we are discussing if this is truly the best idea of
the project)
* Release Lucene.Net 3.0.3 (port of Java Lucene 3.0.3)
* Have a new .NET version of Lucene utilizing .NET constructs and idioms

Graduation thought:

* One of the mentors (Stefan Bodewig) has indicated he wants to start
pushing for graduation.


--------------------
ManifoldCF

--Description--

ManifoldCF is an incremental crawler framework and set of connectors
designed to pull documents from various kinds of repositories into
search engine indexes or other targets. The current bevy of repository
connectors includes Documentum (EMC), FileNet (IBM), LiveLink
(OpenText), Meridio (Autonomy), SharePoint (Microsoft), JDBC, CIFS
file systems, CMIS repositories, RSS feeds, and web content. Output
support includes Solr, MetaCarta GTS, and OpenSearchServer.
ManifoldCF also provides components for individual document security
within a target search engine, so that repository security access
conventions can be enforced in the search results.

ManifoldCF has been in incubation since January, 2010. It was
originally a planned subproject of Lucene but is now a likely
top-level project.

--A list of the three most important issues to address in the move
towards graduation--

1. We need at least one additional active committer, as well as
additional users and repeat contributors
2. We need the current committer base to each broaden their commits
to new areas of the project
3. We'd like to see long-term contributions for project testing,
especially infrastructure access

--Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to
be aware of?--

All issues have been addressed to our satisfaction at this time.

--How has the community developed since the last report?--

Talks on ManifoldCF were given both at Apache Eurocon 2011 in
Barcelona and at ApacheCon NA in Vancouver.  Both were well-received.
We have not signed up any new committers, however, this quarter,
although we've received interest from people towards contributing
especially in Vancouver.

Based on the feelings of our mentors, we have postponed further talk
of graduation, due to the still-not-well-distributed number of commits
among our committer base.

--How has the project developed since the last report?--

An 0.1 release was made on January 31, 2011, and a 0.2 release
occurred on May 17, 2011.  Another release occurred on September
20, 2011.  A fourth release is planned for December 15, 2011, and will
contain significant new features, including full support for HSQLDB and
a new Alfresco connector.

allowing them to fully utilize the other technologies driven by Maven.
NPanday has been incubating since August 2010.

We are now in the process of releasing NPanday-1.4.1-incubating and at the
same time developing NPanday-1.5.0-incubating, which will come with azure-
and silverlight support as well as quite extensive core refactorings
removing historical burden.

We are also happy to report that our community continues to gain new people
in terms of patch contributors and reporters on issues.

The top priorities towards graduation are:

* regular release
* guide regular patch contributors towards becoming committers
* improve engagement of existing committers

There are no issues for the Incubator PMC or board at this time.

[November Incubator report follows]



Notwithstanding the fact that members of the Board are active within the
Incubator, there are no issues requiring Board attention or intervention.

We are, however, recognizing that we've had growth issues of our own.  As
David Crossley pointed out, he made mistakes last month related to the
Reporting Schedule, and we continue to have issues.  The Incubator is almost
as big as the rest of the ASF combined.  David posted a plot chart
reflecting our growth: http://incubator.apache.org/history/

Roy proposed one change to help cut down on some commit karma logistics.
Sebb and David have been discussing some changes to help manage the
meta-data, e.g., reporting schedule.  Nothing is concrete, yet, but clearly
we need to make some changes to make things easier.

OpenMeetings -- project to provide video conferencing, instant messaging,
white board, collaborative document editing and other groupware tools using
API functions of the Red5 Streaming Server for Remoting and Streaming -- has
been accepted for Incubation.

SIS

Apache SIS is a toolkit that spatial information system builders or users
can use to build applications containing location context. This project will
look to store reference implementations of spatial algorithms, utilities,
services, etc. as well as serve as a sandbox to explore new ideas. Further,
the goal is to have Apache SIS grow into a thriving Apache top-level
community, where a host of SIS/GIS related software (OGC datastores,
REST-ful interfaces, data standards, etc.) can grow from and thrive under
the Apache umbrella.

* Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

Still slow progress on development. We started a thread here:
http://s.apache.org/Q2z
We were discussing the board report and then all of the sudden it turned
into a where is SIS going discussion. We were pretty realistic and discussed 
whether it made sense to keep going. The good news was that a few of the
community members (Adam Estrada and Luc Maisonobe) came out of the wood work
and seconded that what we are trying to do is a great idea and that people 
would use it. We hope to use this as something to help move us forward.

I (Chris Mattmann) care deeply about this project, and will try and step up
my development progress on it. Could still use a few more PPMC members and
interested folks though.

* Community progress since the last report

See above.

* Project progress since last report

SIS was voted into the Incubator by the IPMC on February 21, 2010.

Chris close out a couple JIRA issues, SIS-27 (a fix to the Maven parent pom
from Patrick O'Leary), and a website update (SIS-29) reported by sebb. Other

machines. (https://cwiki.apache.org/VCL)

Community Involvement
* Numerous Apache VCL community members have gained enough knowledge and are
actively answering questions on the mailing lists.
* Questions have been posted to the lists related to several new
installations from around the world.
* Development issues are being discussed with participants from many
different organizations.

Code Contributions
* Support for IBM Power7 hardware was discussed on the development list.
Code and documentation was contributed by Sunil Venkatesh of the University
of Maryland Baltimore County.
* Received a contribution from Satoshi Kobayashi of Hitachi Ltd. Japan to
add Multilingualization/internationalization of the web UI and several other
improvements.
* Received a provisioning module for VMware vCenter clusters from Aaron
Coburn at Amherst college.
* Mark Gardner from Virginia Tech is working on adding support for IPv6.

New Committers
* Several individuals from different institutions have expressed interest in
becoming committers.
* The main barrier encountered is obtaining university legal department
approval of individual and corporate contributor license agreements.
Current committers are working with interested individuals to share
experience and work through these issues.

Top Issues Before Graduation
* Diversity. The community has been working to attract additional
contributors to the project. Several committer candidates are being
discussed.


--------------------

Wink

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of REST
style web services. The core server runtime is based on the JAX-RS (JSR 311)
standard. The project also introduces a client runtime which can leverage
certain components of the server-side runtime. Apache Wink will deliver
component technology that can be easily integrated into a variety of
environments.

Apache Wink has been incubating since 2009-05-27.

Notable Activity:

* New users are starting to post to the wink-user mailing list, but
development list traffic and discussions are very slow. Hopefully community
members will start prototyping around JAX-RS 2.0 and energize the community
again.

Planned Activity:

* Work towards graduation.

Top issues before graduation:

* Getting more active dev community


--------------------

Wookie

Wookie is a Java server application that allows you to upload and deploy
widgets for your applications. Wookie is based on the W3C Widgets
specification, but widgets can also be included that use extended APIs such
as Google Wave Gadgets and OpenSocial.

Wookie has been incubating since 17th July 2009

Since August 2011:
   * Release 0.9.1 put out for vote
   * Community members attended Apache Hackathon in Amsterdam and linked up
with Rave and Poi committers
   * Major patch for oAuth support submitted from community member
   * Published maven artifacts, and demonstrated integrated deployment with
Rave
   * "Widget Store" collaboration mentioned in previous report is being
developed externally for now, and may be submitted as an incubator proposal
at a later stage
   * Identified a security issue, and took advice from security@apache on
resolution process

Next steps:
   * Finish 0.9.1 release and move onto a 0.9.2 release
   * Continue to work and liaise with other projects

Issues before graduation:
   * improve our release process
   * build community/expand user base

  We adopted an even/odd versioning scheme for stable/unstable releases
  and started cutting unstable 2.3.x releases directly from trunk.
  A stable 2.4.0 release and the accompanying stable 2.4 maintenance
  branch is planned for January 2012.

  The end of life of Jackrabbit 1.x was announced, with 1.6.5 being
  the last 1.x release we plan to make.

  Active work on the new microkernel prototype targeting
  Jackrabbit 3.0 continues.

o Infrastructure

  We started working on migrating from Confluence to the new CMS.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache JMeter Project

The Apache JMeter desktop application is a Java application designed to load
test functional behavior and measure performance.

This is the second board report for the JMeter TLP.

Work continues on fixing bugs and implementing new features and
generally tidying up the code.

There have been no changes to the PMC or committers since the last report.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
the committers.

As previously reported, it is believed that all the branding
requirements have been completed.

There are no board level issues at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Karaf Project

Apache Karaf provides higher level features and services
specifically designed for creating OSGi-based servers.

  Community
Guillaume Nodet and Jean-Baptiste Onofré were presents at
the ApacheCon.
Two talks were related to Karaf.

Several projects are interested to use Karaf.

The Karaf community starts to help others projects to be OSGi
compliant (work started on Apache Archiva and Apache Whirr).

  Development
A new release has been voted:
* Apache Karaf 2.2.4

We are now focusing on Karaf 3.0 release (lot of fixes, cleanups
and enhancements in progress).

We also included a new testing framework based on Pax Exam (part
of the Karaf tooling).

The resources for the sub-projects will be created soon (website, etc).

  Web Site
We published a new web site to fix some typo mistakes and update the
online documentation.
The site will be updated soon to announce and give visibility
to the new sub-projects.

  Branding
 * project website basics: ok
 * website nav links: ok
 * trademarks: ok
 * logo: we added the TM mention on the logo, and provide new "powered by Karaf" logo
 * metadata: ok

  Issues for board consideration
None so far. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Labs Project

Apache Labs hosts small and emerging projects from ASF committers.

[STATUS]

A typically slow quarter for Labs. The PMC remains vital, though,
and loosely discusses different options for making Labs more attractive.

[DETAILS]

== Community ==

PMC Chair changed during the quarter.  We lost two PMC members during
the quarter, Bernd (berndf) and Yoav (yoavs) due to lack of time.  The
community continues to passively discuss ideas for generating more
interest in Labs.  There also continues to be some interest in using
Git but not enough energy to do anything about it.

The community was supportive of a proposal to move to the Apache CMS
and has created the appropriate directory structure and INFRA-4113 to
pursue.

== New Labs ==
Magnet (PI: Hadrian Zbarcea): Showcase of integrating various Apache
projects to produce a real life application. This project intends to
offer the practical ability of advertising ASF projects on various
channels with the intent of attracting new contributors and potential
committers.

Yay (PI: Tommaso Teofili): The Apache Yay library contains an API for
describing and implementing neural network based systems.

== Labs Statistics ==

- new: 2
- status changes (last 3 months): 0
- total number: 38
 - active: 16
 - idle: 15
 - promoted: 3
 - completed: 4
- labs with commits: magnet, magma, noggit, yay, openelo

-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

Trademarks:
We have not made progress on trademarks since the last board report, but
do intend to finish the necessary pieces.

   * Project Naming And Descriptions :
     We believe this is complete, but are still reviewing.
   * Website Navigation Links : navbar links included, link to
     www.apache.org included.
     Likely complete, but under review.
   * Trademark Attributions : attribution for all ASF marks included in
     footers, etc.
     The main TLP site is converted, subproject sites have not.
   * Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent product logo on your
     site In progress.  Some have been converted to have TM, some not.
     We don't seem to have ready volunteers on the graphical front,
     so it is slower than we'd like
   * Project Metadata : DOAP file checked in and up to date
     Done
   * Once we finish migrating to the new CMS based Website trademarks
     need to be re-evaluated.


LUCENE JAVA/Solr

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit and Solr is a search server
built on top of Lucene. The community is very active. The community
has made significant progress on cutting over to the Apache CMS.
The community has recently released Lucene & Solr 3.5.

Open Relevance Project

The Open Relevance Project is a project aimed at providing Lucene
and others tools for judging the quality of search and machine
learning approaches.  The community is not very active, but
we don't expect it to be very high volume either as it is a niche
area.

PyLucene

PyLucene is a Python integration of Lucene Java.  Development is
almost entirely an automated port, so this project will never
require a lot of developers. The community is active and is working
towards a PyLucene 3.5 release.

PyLucene 3.4.0 was released on September 19th.
PyLucene 3.5.0 should be released shortly, the release vote is pending.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache OFBiz Project

Report for December 2011 for Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project)
as a top level project.

Apache OFBiz (The Apache Open For Business Project) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean:
ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Project Branding Checklist
Project Website Basics: complete

The main pages (index, download) should be now compliant with the project
branding guidelines; however there are several Confluence based pages (linked
from the home page) that still need to be reviewed.

Releases

* no new releases; the next releases to be voted will be two bug fix releases
  for 09.04 and 10.04 series and the first release for the 11.04 series
* two days ago we have received a vulnerability report for release 10.04 from
  security; this will probably affect the schedule of the bug fix release

Community and Project

Community interaction remains strong, user and dev mailing lists traffic
is high
Significant new development continues, for highlights see:

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache OODT Project

Apache OODT is a software framework, and an architectural style for
the rapid construction of scientific data systems. It provides
components for data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow
management, resource management and data processing.

Releases/Development:

We're still working on the 0.4 release.

Chris Mattmann, Andrew Hart, Paul Ramirez and Cameron Goodale are
working on OODT-157 [1] the OODT Operator Interface, a webapp for
monitoring the OODT PCS components. Work also continues on the
Workflow2 architecture improvements specified in OODT-215 [2],
including global workflow conditions, dynamic workflows,
parallel/sequential mode, a new workflow engine, etc.

Paul Ramirez and Cameron Goodale are working on OODT-120 [3], or
OODT RADIX, an easy deployer and installer framework for Apache
OODT.

We've also made some progress in the area of integration with Apache
Solr, contributing an OODT File Manager to Solr sync program in
OODT-326 [4].

Ricky Ngyuen has been working on a slew of improvements to XMLPS,
our XML configurable profile/product server (see OODT-61 [5],
OODT-333 [6],  OODT-336 [7], OODT-337 [8], OODT-341 [9].

Brian Foster has been leading the charge in developing CAS-CLI, and
integrating it into all of the OODT CAS components as our new
standard command line interface library.

We've also got a ton of new crawler actions including code that
allows action switching (ternary), branching, and failover. In
total, we've got 67 issues fixed so far ready to ship with the 0.4
release when the time comes (Paul Ramirez has volunteered to RM
it).

Community:

Sheryl John and Ricky Nguyen were added as OODT PMC members and
committers.

The Apache in Space! (OODT) track at ApacheCon NA 2011 went off
without a hitch! It was great. All slides are up online with Lanyard,
and audio is up with FeatherCast.org (thanks to Rich and others).

Paul Ramirez, Ricky Nguyen, Cameron Goodale, Andrew Hart, Emily Law
and Chris Mattmann were at the meeting to represent the Apache OODT
community.

Branding:

No updates beyond last report. Looks good.

Press:

OODT showed up as one of the Apache projects in the "Top five
head-scratchingest names for software projects" run by the SDTimes
website [10]. We're proud of our moniker. That is all.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Pig Project

Pig status report for December 2011.

Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level 
language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure 
for evaluating these programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that 
their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns 
enables them to handle very large data sets.

Releases:
* Pig 0.9.1 released on 10/5/11.

Community:
* PMC Chair is changing from Olga Natkovich to Daniel Dai
* No new committers or PMC members
* 247 subscribers to the dev mailing list (248 in the last report)
* 681 subscribers to the user mailing list (642 in the last report)

Status of branding checklist:
Project Naming and Description: DONE
Website Navigation Links: DONE
Trademark Attributions: DONE
Logos and Graphics: NOT STARTED
Project Metadata: NOT STARTED 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Pivot Project

Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable
Internet applications on the Java platform, by implementing a full
windowing toolkit, cross-network UI serialization and a fresh
Look&Feel.

The present PMC Chair, Todd Volkert, announced Oct 10 that he wished
to step down, citing a busy private life (3 kids under 6), but the PMC
wasn't 'engaged' enough to recommend a replacement. I will initiate
this and come back with a resolution proposal by next Board meeting in
January.

In the past quarter, the main activity has been work to get the next
release (2.0.1) out the door and to comply with trademarks policy.
There has been significant progress on both, but neither is completed.
The fact that Todd has "always" been the release manager, has strained
the community, but hopefully in a positive way, to not rely on a
single person.


The PMC grew with one new member in the past quarter; Roger Whitcomb.
The user community is steadily growing and I suspect a few will grow
into committers soon.

No issues require Board's attention at this point in time, other than
PMC Chair situation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Portals Project

This quarter Apache Portals has released new versions of :

Apache Portals Jetspeed 2.2.2 - October 9, 2011
Version 2.2.2 is primarily a maintenance and bugfixes release, but also
introduces some new features like Portlet Cloning, Apache Solr based portlet
search engine and security restrictions on admin roles maintenance, as well as
many improvements on the Ajax based JetUI rendering engine.

Applications Portals Applications: WebContent, RSS, Demo and DB Browser version
1.2 - September 29, 2011
The Applications Demo adds a JRuby Script Portlet example using the new Portals
Bridges Script Bridge 2.0.  Other changes concern primarily minor bugfixes and
maintenance.

Apache Portals Pluto 2.0.3 - September 27, 2011
This is the fourth GA release of the 2.0 line of Pluto conformant to the Java
Portlet 2.0 Standard JSR-286.
Pluto 2.0.3 is primarily a minor bugfix and maintenance release.

Apache Portals Bridges 2.0 - Portals Bridges Script - September 25, 2011
The Portals Bridges Script Project provides Portal independent integration with
Scripting Technologies such as Groovy, JRuby, Jython, BeanShell and Rhino
JavaScript.  The 2.0 releases for Portals Bridges Script provides the following
added features:
   * Support for Portlet API 2.0 Bridge Portlet for script languages such
     as Groovy, Jruby, Jython, BeanShell and Rhino JavaScript.
   * Support for Refresh Checking Interval to minimize IO.

There have been no changes to the PMC or committers group this
quarter. User list traffic is minimal.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache ServiceMix Project

Project Status
==============
While we continue to have an active community with good participation from
users on mailing lists, IRC, and issue reporting in Jira, we also have lost 
some of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality are being 
maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.

With the community objectives mentioned below, we want to ensure a new and 
better focus for the Apache ServiceMix project.


Community
=========

* Jonathan Anstey has been voted in as a new committer.


Community Objectives
====================

Our current objective is to release ServiceMix 4.4.0: we improved the project 
packaging to better meet common use cases and we also optimized our project 
structure to allow for more frequent releases of ServiceMix 4.x in the future.  
We keep on working on the documentation and website to ensure both new and 
existing users are finding their way around the project more easily.  

These changes will help us regain the momentum we need to work towards our 
second community objective - our next major release, Apache ServiceMix 5.x, 
planned for next year, will be where we start adding the necessary additional 
features to ensure that the project keeps adding value on top of what Apache 
Karaf and Apache Camel are offering.
 

Branding Status
===============
* Project Naming And Descriptions : Compliant
* Website Navigation Links : Compliant
* Trademark Attributions : Non-compliant, will be compliant in new web site.
* Logos and Graphics : Current logo is not compliant, new logo will be 
compliant
* Project Metadata : Compliant


Releases
========
* ServiceMix Archetypes 2011.01
* ServiceMix Specs 1.9.0
* A set of 5 OSGi bundles in September
* A set of 11 OSGi bundles in October
* A set of 18 OSGi bundles in December

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache Shiro Project

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:
- No new releases.

Community & Project:

- In our last report, we were considering voting on 1.2 as soon as possible.
  Instead, we delayed the vote to allow finishing a number of issues
  related to making password hashing much easier for applications.  That work
  is 95% complete and it is expected that a 1.2 vote will happen within a
  week or two.

- The community continues to grow, with new articles being written by the
  community.  We appreciated and were excited to see an extremely thorough
  article written by Meri covering Shiro cryptography:
  http://meri-stuff.blogspot.com/2011/12/apache-shiro-part-3-cryptography.html

- The mailing lists remain healthy.  Much of the community is awaiting the 1.2
  release, and this has become our highest priority.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Status report for the Apache Sling Project

Attachment AC: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Status report for the Apache Subversion Project

** Board Issues

The Subversion project has no Board-level issues at this time.

** Community

The user community is as active and healthy as ever. Many questions
and answers are being handled for the new 1.7.x series of releases.

The development community has been hard at work on the 1.8 release,
tentatively scheduled for late Q1 or Q2 of 2012. The roadmap has not
been positively defined, but there is a general feeling of coding to
fit that timeframe, rather than a specific set of features. The
community does not want to repeat a 2+ year development cycle, like
what happened with the 1.7 release.

We have added one new committer: Eric S. Raymond. No PMC Members have
been added for quite a while.

** Releases

This is the big news since our last report in August: the 1.7.0
release was made on October 11th. That is about 2.5 years from the
1.6.0 release in March 2009. The release has been well-accepted for
its new features and performance updates. It is important to note this
is the first release under the Foundation's policies, license, and
distribution (the 1.6.x releases were made via tigris.org).

Since that initial release, we made a 1.7.1 release on October 23rd,
and then 1.7.2 on December 5th. We do not have a schedule for the
1.7.3 release, but it will likely appear in the next few weeks.

** Other

Some private discussions have started about Subversion events next
year, but nothing has (yet) been finalized or made public. These
events have been very successful at bringing the development community
together for some great discussions and hacking. More information will
be provided as events are finalized.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Status report for the Apache Synapse Project

Apache Synapse is a highly performant, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus and mediation framework.

Community

There have been no new committers nominated this quarter.
The level of participation is consistent and active, but not currently
growing. However, the committership is active and constantly enhancing
the project.
During the reporting period there have been 66 commits from 7 committers.

Releases

There have been some significant updates to Synapse recently including
much better support for REST mediation.
There is current work on a 2.1 release. We are currently waiting for a
release of Apache Sandesha which has changes we require in order to
release.

Board issues

None identified.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AF: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the development of 
web application user interfaces.

We added one new committer this quarter: Nicolas LE BAS. We are hoping that a
beta release of Tiles 3 (the next revolutionary version of Tiles) will occur 
sometime in the next quarter.

The Apache Tiles project is in a rebuilding phase. Several of the original PMC
members remain on board primarily to build and mentor a new PMC. Almost all of 
the original PMC members have stated their intention to go emeritus once the 
project is re-established. We really need to add two or three more people for 
this to work, so I expect the process to take a minimum of several months to 
play out. It all depends on how much interest we generate. 

In the meantime work is ongoing to create a new revolutionary version of Tiles.
Previous versions of the framework required an online Servlet environment to 
render pages. Tiles 3 will abstract all the templating capabilities from the
Servlet environment so that sites can be constituted and rendered in an offline
mode. We are now moving toward a beta release of this functionality.

We have proposed to add Wicket to the list of git projects and Jeremy
Thomerson has volunteered to be our point man in helping out working out
the kinks. Infra has elected us to join the Git experience, and Jeremy is
working with infrastructure. We are very excited to be part of this effort.

We have chosen to adopt semantic versioning (http://semver.org) as the 
future basis to number our releases. Therefore we started with Wicket 6 as 
our next release. Coincidentally we require Java 6 as the basis for Wicket 6
(previously Java 1.5)

Infrastructure moved the Wicket code base to git last night.
Our committers have already pushed several commits to the git 
repository and Infrastructure is helping us migrate our buildbot 
setup to make use of git. The documentation of migrating towards 
git is excellent, and migrating our local copies didn't pose any 
problems other than lacking the clarity of mind to actually read 
and grok the available documentation (jay coffee). Many thanks 
and gratitude go out to the infrastructure team who have made 
this possible.

Attachment AK: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

About XMLBeans:
XMLBeans is a tool that allows you to access the full power of XML in a
Java friendly way. The idea is that you can take advantage of the
richness and features of XML and XML Schema and have these features
mapped as naturally as possible to the equivalent Java language and
typing constructs. XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces
and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance
data.


XMLBeans continues with activity on the mailing list, latest release was
made available in the maven 2 repository missing found by an outside
user. But in the same time code contributions are down, partly due to
code stability.

There were no new committers or PMC changes in the last quarter. 

The only problem worth mentioning is the amount spam on the wiki. It
can't be maintained manually anymore. I asked infrastructure@apache.org a
couple of times but there was no response. In my opinion, we require a
global solution for all Apache wikis, if there isn't one already.
UPDATE: Infra sent a response but I didn't received it. I opened JIRA
INFRA-4230:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4230 for tracking it.

Attachment AL: Status report for the Apache ZooKeeper Project

ZooKeeper status report for December 2011.

ZooKeeper is a reliable coordination service for distributed
applications.

There were two new releases in the last quarter; 3.3.4 and
3.4.0. 3.3.4 is a fix release while version 3.4.0 includes a number of
new features and is under active development (3.4.1 is expected soon).

Trunk is also under development for an eventual 3.5.0 release. So far
primarily code cleanup and refactoring has been applied to trunk.

Camille Fournier joined the ZooKeeper PMC during the past quarter.

Community:

Recently the new S4 project has been accepted into the Incubator -- it
is using ZooKeeper.

A discussion is currently under way regarding the possibility of
merging the recently open sourced "Curator" source base from
Netflix. These are client implementations of ZooKeeper "recipes"
(e.g. leadership election, group membership, etc...) which simplify
the act of using ZooKeeper in client side applications.

The authors of Curator are unwilling to join the incubator, this is
based on their past experience as well as some of the ongoing issues
they are seeing wrt projects entering the incubator. They have
expressed a preference to come in either as a subproject or as a
separate release artifact of the TLP.

A public meetup has been discussed for January and is currently being
debated/planned on the ZooKeeper developer's list.

Mailing list activity continues to be high and we are seeing more
contributor activity than we've seen in past quarters.

* 8 active committers representing 4 unique organizations
* 7 active PMC members representing 4 unique organizations
* 276 subscribers on dev (up from 255 last quarter)
* 551 subscribers on user (up from 504 last quarter)

BOOKKEEPER (ZooKeeper subproject)

BookKeeper status report for December 2011.

Bookkeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance logging
service. The project also includes Hedwig which is a highly scalable
Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper and Bookkeeper with strong
durability guarantees.

Our initial release 4.0.0 as a sub-project of ZooKeeper is out. It fixes
76 issues, and includes new important features such as fencing and
reading from open ledgers. Reading from open ledgers enables warm
standbys when using BookKeeper to propagate state updates to
backup replicas.

We are currently working the next release, 4.1.0, which we plan to have
during the first quarter of 2012.

Community:
* 28 subscribers to bookkeeper-dev
* 30 subscribers to bookkeeper-user
* 140 issues opened to date, 77 opened since Sep 1, 2011
* 14 reporters of Jira issues
* 6 patch contributors
