 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       I have set up and sent notice for the annual members meeting, to be
       held on IRC on 9 March 2021, with votes concluding on 11 March.
       In spite of the wild year 2020-21 has been, it doesn't seem like it has
       been a full year, partly because moving the date earlier has reduced
       us to 11 meetings. Please be sure to send in nominations before they
       close on February 28.

       I am happy to report that I finally managed to update our Bylaws page
       with Amendment II, as we approved in September, and sent the required
       notification to the members-notify list. Thanks to everyone who proposed
       or reviewed the changes on members-info. I set the bylaws change to
       take effect on 11 March 2021 so that it overlaps with the annual
       members meeting (maximizing implied consensus).

    B. President [David]

       I continued to spend time working on a single incident that generated
       multiple code of conduct complaints.

       I am behind on overall budget work, but most of the officers
       representing the bulk of the budget have pushed their draft requests
       forward. I had hoped to have a first pass ready for this board meeting
       but failed to meet that. Expect to see more on operations@ this week.

       Otherwise, things look to be running relatively well.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 8.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Treasurer’s work this month primarily consisted of providing the
       information and reviews necessary to complete our audit, and prepare
       our tax return.  I have been going slower on the goal of transitioning
       to TDBank, but the urgency for that task has not diminished.  I’ll be
       renewing our efforts in the coming month.

       Budget preparation

       IgniteSpot is currently preparing a pro forma budget as a starting
       point for officers based on the previous year’s expenses.  YTD
       officer’s expense control has been very good.  In general, I  expect
       spending in the coming year to necessarily increase to cover expenses
       that have been delayed in the past year.  But because there is still a
       greater than normal amount of economic uncertainty, I would ask that
       officers approach this carefully.

       Audit

       We completed our audit for the fiscal year ending on April 30, 2020
       with an unqualified result.  The full report has been provided to the
       board.

       The auditor did identify an area in which we can improve, with respect
       to apportioning our funds in a manner which keeps them under FDIC
       insurance.  Some improvements had already been made by the time of the
       audit, and we will continue to seek to improve in this area.

       Tax filings

       The work to complete our 990s is almost, but not quite complete.  All
       change requests have been discovered and we await only the final
       version.  This fiscal year there were several changes from previous
       years, including the introduction of ALC, and the introduction of a
       Conflict of Interest policy.  We are grateful to the TAC community for
       helping us respond to questions about grant making activities.

       Boston Private

       The assistant treasurer is now also listed as a signatory on the
       Boston Private account.  Thank you to the board for helping us get
       this done.

       Transition to TDBank

       The transition to TDBank is currently blocked on the introduction of
       treasury services.  Taxes and audit had higher priority in the last
       month, and so this work was put on pause, but it will proceed in the
       coming month.

       Accounting transition

       The transition to the new accountant is mostly complete.  We did
       identify one final item that we missed in the transition up till this
       point.  The ownership of our credit card account remained with Virtual
       until last Friday, the 12th.  I am still awaiting confirmation that
       transfer was successful.  Presumably the holidays and the inclement
       weather have produced additional obstacles.  This will result in
       interest and fees.  My hope is to bring our credit card service
       provider to the point where we can also easily transfer information
       between volunteers and accounting, and transfer responsibility from
       one volunteer to another.

       Financial reporting:

       Foundation financial reporting can be found in our quarterly report:

    D. Secretary [Matt]

    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       ApacheCon planning is underway. We are looking at a more coordinated
       effort between the North America/Europe event and the Asia event,
       especially in terms of sponsorship. CFP launching soon.

       for and 1 voting against.
       
       Niclas wishes to note that he voted against this resolution
       "on the basis that the appalling behavior wasn't done in the name
       of the ASF or the Tinkerpop project, nor on our lists. I don't like
       the slippery slope aspect of kicking out people based on idiotic
       things written elsewhere."

 8. Discussion Items

    A. What is the scope of applicability for our Code of Conduct?

    Specifically, https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct
    begins with:

      This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the
      Apache Software Foundation, including IRC, all public and private
      mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other
      communication channel used by our communities.

    and

      We expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who
      participates in the Apache community formally or informally, or
      claims any affiliation with the Foundation, in any Foundation-related
      activities and especially when representing the ASF, in any role.

    Roy believes that both of those sentences are overly long and ambiguous,
    and should be clarified so that the CoC volunteers do not find themselves
    trying to judge the behavior of all 8000 contributors when they aren't
    directly engaged in ASF-related communication.

    To be clear, there is no such scope limit for the Board; we can choose
    to remove committee members for any reason (or even without a reason).
    This scope is only for our expectations regarding the CoC process and
    its applicability to reported violations.

    Proposal from Roy, edit the above to something like:

      This code of conduct applies to all forum spaces managed by the
      Apache Software Foundation, to all officers, contractors, and
      employees of the ASF, and to any communication, participation, or
      activities conducted on our behalf, regardless of forum, that have
      an expressed or implied affiliation with the ASF or an Apache project. 

    The board discussed various ways in which we could slightly modify the
    CoC process to clarify its scope, and also whether the CoC process itself
    is governed by the board or merely affirmed by the board. Rich Bowen has
    volunteered to research how the existing text might be improved.
    There was no immediate action taken by the board.

       @Roy: review past board resolution about code of conduct

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- We were advised of a "sudo" vulnerability by the Security Team. Most
  of our machines do not have general access, and the users who can
  access them tend to have sudo. But with that said, we applied the
  corrective patches within hours across our entire set of hosts.

Finances
========
- Budget process is beginning.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Roll out a replacement for JFrog's Bintray. This will likely be a
  cloud-hosted Artifactory system (from JFrog), though we also have a
  Nexus v3 license from Sonatype. Evaluation continues.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- As usual: email and gitbox v2.

General Activity
================
- LDAP schema and definition/interaction changes, to deal with various
  types of naming across cultures.
- Investigating sign-in via Okta for future cloud-based services at
  Atlassian. Possible use of Okta within our own services.
- Performance issues related to backup, proxmox, puppet, and others.
  We continue to tune to keep the services smooth, and to align our
  needs with the appropriate underlying box.
- Improvements on what to backup, and general tooling around keeping
  disk usage within desired constraints on build machines, and our
  mail systems.
- Stood up a new TLP server, and dealt with a number of
  synchronization and update problems on the new server and old. Some
  tooling received updates for more bullet-proof operation. All TLP
  servers are now on Puppet v6.
- A large amount of doc updates and clarification around GitHub,
  Gitbox, and our use of git at the Foundation.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

On February 5th, the ApacheCon planners met to begin discussion of
ApacheCon 2021, which will, again, be a virtual event happening on the
Hopin platform. We have tentatively identified September 21-23 as the
dates for this event. Although this has not been announced publicly,
we expect that it will be by the time these meeting minutes are
published.

We are working on getting a CFP up, and will have a call for track
chairs very soon also.

Additionally, the following events have been approved for 2021:

* May 11-13. Kafka Summit Europe
* May 25. Apache Ignite Summit
* August 6th-8th. ApacheCon Asia
* September 14-16. Kafka Summit Americas

Plans discussed late last year to do some kind of internal "training"
events have fallen victim to lack of availability. However, the VP
Conferences is attempting to find more ways to delegate portions of
the job, so that this is not a SPOF going forward.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Henry Story (bblfish@) has joined the "Notation (N3) Community Group".

This is our first member to join so ASF has signed the W3C Community
Contributor License Agreement for the CG.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

One more pretty uneventful month: we've had a regular amount of usual requests
flowing through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Committee members took good care
of resolving most of these in time. We're slightly up at 35 unresolved issues
this month.

There has been some discussion about adding language clarifying our positions
on modified Apache Licenses and how, while allowed, they should clearly be
distanced from Apache License itself.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

This month we sent requests for information to 23 projects which had
old or stale outstanding security issues either that needed triage
completing or releases making.  Most projects responded by the
deadline with an updated status report and a number of issues were
closed/completed (some included in the stats below, some after).  We
still have some projects that are not dealing with their security
issues appropriately and we have continued to escalate these to the
projects themselves and the board where needed.

Where projects are unresponsive it reflects badly on the ASF and can
lead to users being exposed when reporters choose to go public without
a co-ordinated fix.  We worked with Press on the response to this
story:
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/undisclosed-apache-velocity-xss-vulnerability-impacts-gov-sites/

We published the 2020 Security Report https://s.apache.org/SecurityReport2020

Stats for Jan 2021:

     26        [license confusion]
     12        [support request/question not security notification]

Security reports: 46 (last months: 45, 45, 41)

     15        [site]
     3         [tomcat]
     2         [airflow], [flink]
     1         [commons], [cxf], [druid], [gobblin], [httpd], [hudi],
               [jmeter], [maven], [mina], [myfaces], [netty], [nutch],
               [nuttx], [ofbiz], [openmeetings], [openoffice], [poi], 
               [pulsar], [ranger], [shiro], [skywalking], [struts],
               [trafficserver], [xerces]

     In total, as of 1st Feb 2021, we're tracking 67 (last month:
     68) open issues across 42 projects, median age 61 (last month:
     80) days.  38 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     9 (last month: 7) of these issues, across 5 projects, are older
     than 365 days.  Some require esclation.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Ambari Project  [Jayush Luniya]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Ambari is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to Hadoop cluster management

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Ambari was founded 2013-11-20 (7 years ago)
There are currently 109 committers and 51 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Szabolcs Béki on 2020-03-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Tamas Payer on 2020-03-28.

## Project Activity:
We was working on Ambari 2.7.6 when [Cloudera
announced|https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/paywall-expansion.html]  to put
their public repositories behind paywall. As Ambari is strongly dependent 
on these HDP packages and its repositories, it has to be rewritten to 
use other repos / distributions like Bigtop. 

## Community Health:
There are no new committers in the project and the contributors' 
activity is decreasing. 

dev@ambari.apache.org had a 32% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
 (107 emails compared to 157)
37 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (no change)
24 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-48% decrease)
21 commits in the past quarter (-34% decrease)
6 code contributors in the past quarter (-45% decrease)
29 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-23% decrease)
25 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-24% decrease)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Materne]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Ant is the creation and maintenance of the Ant build 
system and related software components

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Ant was founded 2002-11-18 (18 years ago)
There are currently 29 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Magesh Umasankar on 2018-07-06.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jaikiran Pai on 2017-06-14.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:
    Ant 1.10.9 was released on 2020-09-30.
    Ant 1.10.8 was released on 2020-05-13.
    Ant 1.9.15 was released on 2020-05-13.
    Ivy 2.5.0 was released on 2019-10-24.

Tests with early version of JDK 16 worked.

## Community Health:
For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done.
But basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development.

For IvyDE we lack the knowledge of building Eclipse plugins on actual Eclipse 
versions. We hope to get the build running again so we could update that.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Mads Toftum]

## Description:
PMC Attic is responsible for the oversight of projects which otherwise would
not have oversight.

## Issues:
Current PMC Chair did not find time to work on Attic and does not expect to be
able to clear up sufficient time to make progress in the next quarter.

## Project Activity:
There are currently 20 projects being moved to the Attic: 5 added during 2020
Q4, 0 finished during this period http://attic.apache.org/tracking.html

## Community Health:
We have a backlog that represents 1 year of projects added, some work done to
do the move (with many automated tasks thanks to Sebb), but never until the
last step is done and move marked fully done.

There is no precise blocker, it's just about finishing the job.

We'll work on finishing some Attic moves, so we see progress over next months.


-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues to bring to the board's attention at this time. The PMC
has been actively dealing with CVE and trademark issues, as they are brought
to our attention.

## Membership Data:
There are currently 59 committers and 34 PMC members in this project. The
Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.

PMC and committer additions this quarter:
- Adding a new PMC member in currently in progress. The last PMC addition was
  Michael Semb Wever on 2020-04-09.
- Ekaterina Dimitrova was added as committer on 2020-12-10
- Yifan Cai was added as committer on 2020-12-19

## Project Activity:
The project's focus remains on testing 4.0 beta, with trunk remaining in
feature freeze. A 4.0 RC release is looking likely in the this quarter. A 4.0
GA looks to be soon after. This progress is being regularly reported with the
'Cassandra 4.0 Status' emails on the dev ML, and can also be visualised via
the jira board:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=355&view=detail&selectedIssue=CASSANDRA-16382&quickFilter=1661

The releases 3.0.24 and 3.11.10 address CVE-2020-17516. This took some time to
release and report but it was being actively addressed during what appeared
the waiting period. Furthermore, these releases were cut and published by a
new release manager, a positive sign in seeing the release manager become a
more rotating role.

The community is receiving and publishing monthly changelog blogs, which
include reaching out to users and getting use-case descriptions and quotes.
There also looks to be momentum in Cassandra getting involved in GSoC 2021.

Recent releases:
* 3.0.24 was released on 2021-02-01.
* 3.11.10 was released on 2021-02-01.
* 4.0-beta4 was released on 2020-12-30.

## Community Health:
The community appears to be in good health. The past quarter has seen a slight
reduction in activity but that would appear to be only to do with the time of
year.

final stages of our application.


## Community Health:
Our dev mailing list has seen a large increase in traffic compared to the
previous quarter (363 emails compared to 257). Even with the New Year break it
is good to see the discussion activity grow. Some of this increase is related
to the GSoC project requests and also github notifications for changes to the
comdev website.

Apache Groovy continues to rank well on the TIOBE language
popularity index between 10th to 12th for most of the past 6 months.
There are flaws with the index and it fluctuates somewhat
but it is still nice to be not too far down the ranking.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Joe Orton]

## Description:
The mission of HTTP Server is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to Apache Web Server (httpd)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache HTTP Server was founded 1995-02-27 (26 years ago)
There are currently 125 committers and 54 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mario Brandt on 2020-04-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Mario Brandt on 2020-04-27.

## Project Activity:
Apache httpd 2.4.46 was released on 2020-08-05, which is our latest release.

The HTTP Server project has been more active this quarter; in terms of
releases, the focus remains on improving the 2.4.x branch, with both large and
small changes backported from the trunk in recent months.  A batch of quite
significant enhancements to the proxy modules have been merged to 2.4, as well
as a variety of bug fixes, cleanups, and new configuration options.

A new release (v2.15) of the "libapreq" subproject passed a PMC vote. This
release addresses a security issue for the libapreq library which has been
outstanding for some time.  There has been no other development for the
various subprojects under the HTTP Server umbrella.

We continue to improve our use of CI, with automated testing using
AddressSanitizer [1] enabled this quarter.  Like other ASF projects, our
Travis CI configuration has been throwing intermittent failures when pulling
third-party images from Docker Hub, due to rate-limiting [2].  We plan to
migrate to other container registries to mitigate this.

[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-21197

## Community Health:
Mailing list (dev@httpd.a.o) activity was fairly stable on this quarter, with
commit reviews dominating the discussion.  Commit activity is up significantly
(75% more on last quarter), with 2.4 backports contributing here as discussed
above.

Use of GitHub Pull Requests continues to increase (20 new PRs filed, up from
13 in the previous quarter), with these being filed both by new contributors
and existing committers.  The ability to get quick and thorough CI results for
both these cases is proving useful.

It was announced this month [3] that the Internet Security Research Group has
contracted (httpd committer) Stefan Eissing to produce a Rust-based TLS
module as an alternative to mod_ssl.  It's exciting to see this kind of
work getting funded, and the announcement gathered some media coverage [4].

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for February 2021

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.
There are presently 39 podlings incubating. In January, podlings executed 4 
distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members, and none retired. There 
was one IP clearance in January, and there were no new projects. Goblin 
graduated last month, and Ratis is up for graduation this month. There was 
discussion about accepting EventMesh.

This month we were missing reports from Doris, Livy, NLPCraft, 
PageSpeed, PonyMail, Toree, Wayang and Weex. Livy, PonyMail and Weex 
have missed more than one report in a row. It not known why so many podlings
failed to report, but I would guess step time of year and world events.

The IPMC is waiting on the results of a roll call for BRPC. Roll calls have
been sent for Livy and PonyMail. Weex has been asked to consider retirement
(again) as they have failed to report several times in a row.

BlueMarlin has been asked to move communication to the dev list or be 
retired from the IPMC.

S2Graph has been retired.

SAMOA did not respond to an email to consider retirement, and the Incubator 
PMC will discuss retiring the project.

MXNet still has several trademark and branding issues that need to be 
resolved. The releases containing Category X code still have been finally 
removed. MXNet brought a release vote to the IPMC general list without the 
required number of PPMC votes.

Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases and graduations 
and finding new mentors. There were graduation discussions around Daffodil, 
DolphinScheduler, Flagon, Goblin, and Ratis. There are vote currently underway
for accepting EventMesh, and graduating Daffodil and DolphinScheduler.

## Training

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for
training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various Apache
and non-Apache target projects.

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Promote the information about Apache Training Project with increased 
     participation from community
  2. Create a tutorial on how the tools provided by this project can be 
     used to create own content
  3. Review current policies around contribution review and releases to 
     find a pragmatic compromise 

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  The Training Project has opened up the commit permissions to all the
  committers of Apache project to make is easy for experts in each area
  contribute to Apache Training presentations. This was announced in the 
  last week of September 2020. This will open up the project for
  contributions from other Apache projects.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Activity has remained down since the last report.
  There were 26 posts in last 3 months.
  We have to work on strategies to increase the queries for contributions
  from individual contributors.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  New training slides were added on following topics:

  * Apache Druid

  PR activity is normal since the last report.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
  There are currently some issues with this podling that we are working to
  address,
  we believe that the issues are not yet critical and can be turned around
  from within the community but want to make the board aware of this early 
  on.

  The name search process has not yet been started, as there is still time 
  to do that if and when graduation draws nearer. The PPMC is actively
  monitoring usage of the Podlings current name on other sites.
  The Podling is not directly affiliating with any sponsors donating content
  and presenting an independent image on the webpage.

Tuweni has been incubating since 2019-03-25.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Increase release pace and adoption
  2. Vote in a few more committers
  3. Organize outreach

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  No issues to report at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  We have pulled through a good set of features and the project is
  participating in efforts such as the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance,
  a non-profit.

  We have had a very small outreach effort building on publishing
  our docs on the website ; more drumbeating required.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We voted 1.3.0. 1.4.0 is under vote.
  We are working on a working Ethereum client now.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform for efficiently storing
and processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========
We released the 2.7.0, which includes the following key features.
- Configurable TCP connection timeout and improve the initial metadata fetch
- Enforce broker-wide and per-listener connection creation rate 
- Throttle Create Topic, Create Partition and Delete Topic Operations
- Add TRACE-level end-to-end latency metrics to Streams
- Add Broker-side SCRAM Config API
- Support PEM format for SSL certificates and private key
- Add RocksDB Memory Consumption to RocksDB Metrics
- Add Sliding-Window support for Aggregations

We’ve continued steady progress toward the task of replacing ZooKeeper in Kafka.
We expect to have some limited functionalities in the upcoming 2.8.0 release
that demonstrate much higher scalability for the metadata.

Tiered Storage work continues and unlocks infinite scaling and faster rebalance
times via KIP-405. The KIP proposal is getting closer for voting.

Community
===========
Dev mailing list had a 39% increase in traffic in the past quarter (3246 emails
compared to 2333).

User mailing list had a 33% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (378 emails
compared to 562).

We didn't add any new committer or PMC member in the last quarter.

We last added 3 new committers
Chia-Ping Tsai and David Jacot on Oct. 15, 2020, and
Sophie Blee-Goldman on Oct. 19, 2020.

We last added a new PMC member John Roesler on Aug. 9, 2020.

With the help from ASF branding committee, Kafka PMC passed a relaxed naming
policy for non-java clients and connectors. Quite a few non-java clients and
connectors have been using Kafka in its name. Those products form a critical
eco-system for Apache Kafka since Apache Kafka doesn't provide them directly.
We feel that requiring all of them to change their product name is
detrimental to the Kafka community. The relaxed policy can be found at
https://kafka.apache.org/trademark

Releases
===========
2.7.0 was released on Dec. 21, 2020.
2.6.1 was released on Jan. 7, 2021.

## Project Activity:
The Kibble community is relatively small and over the last quarter we have
been working to grow the community and also the active committer base.

Recently a community call was held to discuss a project roadmap [1]. The notes
from the meeting have been posted to the dev mailing list [2] and also the
Kibble wiki [3].

The community decision is to look at re-writing the implementation of Kibble
from scratch. Once the clean repo is created we hope to see project activity
increase again.


## Community Health:
Even though there has not been very much mailing list traffic we are seeing
some community growth and interest in defining and progressing a project
roadmap.

graduating to a TLP so we will try to prepare some small
giveaway for the contributions and the community (stickers).

## Community Health:

Community health continue to be OK. Most of the activity and
contributions happens on Github.

  updated C++ standards such as C++11.

## Community Health:
- Mailing list traffic and general traffic has decreased a bit the prior
  quarter likely due to holidays, personal affairs, and nothing out of the
  ordinary.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

## Description:
The mission of ManifoldCF is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to Framework for connecting source content repositories to target repositories 
or indexes.

## Issues:
Continued light activity, due to pandemic in all likelihood, although a new
connector was contributed.  There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache ManifoldCF was founded 2012-05-15 (9 years ago)
There are currently 25 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Markus Schuch on 2018-01-04.
- No new committers. Last addition was Cihad Guzel on 2019-08-17.

## Project Activity:
ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.17 release on December
28, 2020.  The next major release is due on April 30th, 2021.

A new connector was contributed this quarter, and work was done to bring all of
our connectors and the build process into compliance with JDK 11.

## Community Health:
We nominated and approved Cihad Guzel as committer on 8/16/2019. We nominated
and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did not sign up
any new PMC members or committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the
lookout for new PMC members and committers.  As was true for last quarter, the
light level of activity this quarter has limited our pool of new developers
considerably.  All developers we have have extensive outside commitments and
the pandemic has, if anything, made that situation worse.

However, existing committers have continued to contribute, and use the
product.

but the benchmark is also comparing to one of our least active quarters
ever before that. In general, MetaModel is a fairly quiet and low activity
project with just a few active contributors.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Yanhui Zhao]

## Description:
Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. It comes up with
durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and takes full
advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code complexity, avoid
SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing next generation computing
platforms. Mnemonic makes the storing and transmitting of massive linked
objects graphs simpler and more efficient. The performance tuning could also
be mostly converged to a single point of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to
process and analyze linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the
durable object oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to
normalize/join, SerDe(un)marshal, cache and store their linked business
objects with arbitrary complexity.

## Issues:
None at this this time

## Membership Data:
PMC Changes: 
- Yanhui Zhao replaced Gary Wang as the new PMC Chair
- Gary Wang becomes PMC member

Committer Base Changes: 
- Currently 19 committers. 

## Project Activity:
In this period of reporting (since last release done on Jan. 11, 2021) , 23 of
tickets have been created and 12 resolved. After our latest release of version
0.13.0, the community discussion prioritized our next release target focusing
on (1) redesign the current memory service selection mechanism preparing for
the incoming JDK upgrade, and (2) mnemonic-site reboot to reflect most updated
project information, development flow, release flow, project news, etc.

Our community has held regular meetings on biweekly basis, and we have covered
the following topics on the project meeting
- Project related training
- Release target discussion and planning
- New feature support discussion
- Blocker issue discussion and possible solution
- Encourage community engagement and looking to grow our developer communities

## Community Health:
Through our biweekly meetings, current committers and active developers are
actively contributing and participating in the project. Our project has PMC
chair change appointing Yanhui as the new project chair, and it is approved by
the board. Gary will still serve in the PMC and oversee the project
development. We plan to recruit new committers recently to grow our
communities.

Metric data below indicates increased activities since our last project
reboot, along with the new version release. Our project is now in a very
health state.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache OpenWhisk Project  [Dave Grove]

## Description:
The mission of Apache OpenWhisk is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a platform for building serverless applications with functions

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenWhisk was founded 2019-07-16 (2 years ago)
There are currently 53 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Rob Allen on 2019-07-16.
- Geonhui Kim was added as committer on 2020-11-30
- Ning You Gang was added as committer on 2021-01-19
- Seonghyun Oh was added as committer on 2020-12-02

## Project Activity:
We released OpenWhisk 20.11 - our first unified release that bundles together
compatible versions of all 22 separately released OpenWhisk components.

We finalized the donation from Naver corporation of VSCode and IntelliJ
plugins for OpenWhisk. Two new git repositories were created to hold the
donated code and we are progressing towards making the first Apache release of
these components.

We completed the migration from travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com for all of our
active repositories.

Technical progress in the core OpenWhisk repository is mainly being driven by
the integration of a new alternative scheduling subsystem.

I anticipate there will be a release wave across the openwhisk-runtime-*
components this quarter to propagate upstream updates to the various embedded
language runtimes. On our development branches, we've already picked up
upstream updates for Go, NodeJS, and PHP.

Recent Releases:
- openwhisk-runtime-nodejs-1.17.0 was released on 2020-12-16.
- OpenWhisk 20.11 was released on 2020-11-29.
- openwhisk-deploy-kube-1.0.0 was released on 2020-11-24.

## Community Health:
December was a quiet month, with many community members on vacation. This is
reflected across all of the statistical metrics of community health. Activity
picked up again by mid-January, mainly driven by work in the core repository
on a new scheduling sub-system and by the integration of the newly donated IDE
plugins.

There continues to be active technical discussion via GitHub issues. The bulk
of user support happens via our Slack, but also spills into GitHub issues and
Stackoverflow.

also made the first release of Apache Omid 1.0.2 on 
2020-11-23 and Apache Tephra 0.16.0 on 2020-12-03 after 
their adoption in Phoenix.

We are discussing having Phoenix Tech talks/meetup every 
month to share knowledge and discuss new ideas within 
the community for improvement and growth.

Discussion on dropping the support of EOLs Apache HBase 
versions (1.3, 1.4, 2.1) in the next release, to reduce 
efforts on maintenance of multiple compatibility modules 
and save build/infrastructure time as well.

Due to the lack of community support on nurturing 
Phoenix connectors for PIG and Flume and without 
exhaustive testing before release, we are considering 
marking them as unmaintained in the upcoming phoenix release.


## Community Health:
Phoenix community continues to remain engaged with 
multiple releases and code contributions.

We had closed more PRs/JIRAs than we opened, our commit 
activity had also improved, and there were 44% more 
code contributors than the previous quarter.

Our interactions on the user list steadily declining QoQ, 
though we saw substantial growth in the traffic on 
issues(+100%) and dev list(+23%) in the last quarter.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
  Apache POI was founded 2007-05-16 (14 years ago) There are currently 41
  committers and 34 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
  roughly 6:5.

  Community changes, past quarter:
  - Marius Volkhart was added to the PMC on 2020-12-27
  - Marius Volkhart was added as committer on 2020-12-19

## Project Activity:
  - We managed to release Apache POI 5.0.0 with some fairly large changes
    "under the hood", e.g. better support for Java 9+, new XMLBeans 4.0.0 with
    reworked build-procedure and some internal cleanup. Upgrade to ECMA-376
    5th edition
    (transitional) schemas and enhancements to the support for Word and
     PowerPoint files. Also a number of additional bugfixes could be included.

  - A bugfix-release 5.0.1 is planned soon to provide a number of smaller
    fixes that popped up after the 5.0.0 release.

  - Some work is going on to replace the self-built logging wrapper with an
    existing logging framework, likely Log4J.

## Project Release Activity:

    5.0.0 was released on 2021-01-19. XMLBeans-4.0.0 was released on
    2020-10-15.

## Community Health:
 - Some Discussion about changes related to Apache POI 5.0.0 and XMLBeans
   4.0.0, fortunately mostly caused by mixed up jars which can be fixed by the
   reporters themselves.

 - There are questions about features/behavior which indicates that Apache
   POI is used by a considerable number of people. Questions via email or on
   Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

 - We have a number of active committers currently. However we are still
   looking at ways to broaden the developer base as the code-base is large and
   so some areas are currently not maintained much at all.

 - Overall issue count went down this time mostly because some committers
   could spend some time over the holidays and we could triage and resolve
   some when releasing Apache POI 5.0.0.

### XMLBeans
 - A few bugs were reported by people using XmlBeans directly after they
   upgraded to 4.0.0, it seems there are still some users of it besides Apache
   POI itself.

 - Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low in general because it is a stable
   project in maintenance-mode.

## Bugzilla Statistics:

### Apache POI

 - 575 bugs are open overall (-7)
 - Having 158 enhancements (+6)

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Justin Erenkrantz]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Serf project is creating and maintaining of software 
related to HTTP and associated protocols.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Serf was founded 2015-08-18 (5 years ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Branko Čibej on 2018-09-12.
- No new committers. Last addition was Evgeny Kotkov on 2017-04-13.

## Project Activity:

Recent activity on the mailing list and JIRA relate to recent OpenSSL releases
which break long-standing API contracts:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SERF-198
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r5223c3a3629b2d58b8ddfcf887931cd87672e0a7c0b85cc49579990e%40%3Cdev.serf.apache.org%3E
There is discussion on-list in the thread above about whether we should cut a
1.3.10 release with these OpenSSL fixes or cut a fresh 1.4.x release.

## Community Health:

While relatively quiet, I do believe that there exists enough of a community
where we could cut a new Serf release with a quorum of PMC/committers.  If
a quorum isn't reached and a release can't be cut, we will then need to have
a conversation then about the community.  However, I remain optimistic.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:
The mission of Apache SIS is the creation and maintenance of software providing 
data structures for developing geospatial applications compliant with the model 
of OGC/ISO international standards.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache SIS was founded 2012-09-19 (8 years ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johann Sorel on 2017-09-07.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexís Manin on 2019-07-05.

## Project Activity:
The project activity has the same issue than the one reported 3 months ago:
about 7,600 lines of code added since previous report, but it still not the
work needed for making a release.

A joint ASF, Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and OSGeo code sprint will
happen from February 17th to 19th [1]. Apache SIS will participate, together
with Apache Jena and Superset. We plan to use this code sprint for starting
the work on the items that are blocking a release (filters, portrayal, access
to SQL database).

The JavaFX application demonstrating some Apache SIS capabilities is
operational. We will see after next SIS release if it help to attract
some users and developers.

[1] https://github.com/opengeospatial/joint-ogc-osgeo-asf-sprint-2021

## Community Health:
There is low activity on the mailing list. The work is still happening on a
branch, which may give the impression that the project is inactive. The merge
to master is still pending review of the same code waiting for review for more
than a year (next time we will try to use more feature branches for avoiding
such stall). But it does not have created friction as far as I know; both the
reviewer (myself) and the original code author are in the same situation,
lacking time for resolving this issue. The above-cited code sprint is our next
attempt to resolve this issue.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python, R and SQL as well as a rich set
of libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph
analytics.

Project status:

- The community is close to finalizing the first Spark 3.1.x release, which
  will be Spark 3.1.1. There was a problem with our release candidate
  packaging scripts that caused us to accidentally publish a 3.1.0 version to
  Maven Central before it was ready, so we’ve deleted that and will not use
  that version number. Several release candidates for 3.1.1 have gone out to
  the dev mailing list and we’re tracking the last remaining issues.

- Several proposals for significant new features are being discussed on the
  dev mailing list, including a function catalog for Spark SQL, a RocksDB
  based state store for streaming applications, and public APIs for creating
  user-defined types (UDTs) in Spark SQL. We would welcome feedback on these
  from interested community members.

Trademarks:

- No changes since the last report.

Latest releases:

- Spark 2.4.7 was released on September 12th, 2020.
- Spark 3.0.1 was released on September 8th, 2020.
- Spark 3.0.0 was released on June 18th, 2020.

Committers and PMC:

- The latest committers were added on July 14th, 2020 (Huaxin Gao, Jungtaek
  Lim and Dilip Biswal).
- The latest PMC member was added on Sept 4th, 2019 (Dongjoon Hyun). The PMC
  has been discussing some new PMC candidates.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Nathan Hartman]

## Description:

The Apache Subversion® version control system exists to be universally
recognized and adopted as an open-source, centralized version control
solution characterized by its reliability as a safe haven for valuable
data; the simplicity of its model and usage; and its ability to
support the needs of a wide variety of users and projects, from
individuals to large-scale enterprise operations.

## Issues:

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

## Membership Data:

Our developer and user community is all-volunteer and we'd like to
begin by thanking everyone for their support.

Subversion was founded in February 2000 (21 years ago) and joined the
ASF to become Apache Subversion on 2010-02-16 (11 years ago). There
are currently 88 committers and 49 PMC members in this project. The
Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

We have added one new partial committer since the last report: Daniel
Sahlberg (dsahlberg@) received a commit bit in December 2020.

No new PMC members have been added since the last report. Our most
recently added PMC member, Jun Omae (jun66j5@) joined the PMC in May
2020.

## Project Activity:

This quarter, our all-volunteer developers have burned the midnight
oil to prepare new releases in our 1.10 and 1.14 lines. These will
bring numerous bug fixes and improvements in the core code, build
system, regression test suite, Python 3 support, JavaHL bindings, and
other areas. Several long standing bugs have been brought to our
attention and fixed. The release candidates are now undergoing our
testing, signing, and voting process, and we expect to ship 1.10.7 and
1.14.1 later this month.

Last quarter, we reported that svn.haxx.se, "an unofficial Subversion
related mailing list archive," was about to shut down forever. That
would be a tremendous loss for our community because it would 404 the
only archive from Subversion's birth in 2000 through joining the ASF
in late 2009. That part of our history contains the most important
discussions about the design of Subversion's internals and might be
the only documentation of the rationale behind some significant
technical decisions. The impact of such a loss cannot be estimated.

We are pleased to report that we have coordinated with INFRA and the
original operators of svn.haxx.se and are now hosting the archive on
one of our PMC's virtual machines. We do not know whether this will be
a permanent arrangement or just a stopgap while we search for a better
solution. The current setup has the advantage of preserving URLs,
which are found throughout our archived emails and commit logs and
across the Internet. However, it has the disadvantage of living on a
virtual machine that we believe is not currently backed up, and
therefore continues to be at risk of loss. Nevertheless, we would like
to extend our most gracious thanks to everyone who helped bring us
this far, with a big shout-out to Daniel Sahlberg for the lion's share
of the work, to the long-time operators of svn.haxx.se for maintaining
the archive for over 20 years, and to INFRA for being very helpful
(and patient!) with our many questions and requests.

## Community Health:

Activity seems to happen in waves. While the previous quarter was
rather quieter than usual, activity has picked up significantly this
quarter. Developer email discussions increased 85% and commit activity
increased 222%. Recently, we received several questions at our users
mailing list about how to migrate to Subversion from other systems,
including Git. With the increased activity, work toward saving of the
archive, and upcoming releases, our community health feels much
improved this quarter.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiriccò]

## Description:
The mission of Syncope is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Managing digital identities in enterprise environments

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Syncope was founded 2012-11-21 (8 years ago)
There are currently 24 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Matteo Alessandroni on 2017-12-22.
- No new committers. Last addition was Misagh Moayyed on 2019-10-04.

## Project Activity:
We finalized 2.1.8 (with bugfixes, minor improvements and features). We are
currently engaged to the (hopefully final) steps to cut 3.0.0-M1 in few weeks.
We remark that the work towards Syncope 3.0.0 is leading to cooperation with
Open Source projects external to the ASF as Apereo CAS and Pac4j.

Recent releases:
* 2.1.8 was released on 2020-12-18.
* 2.0.16 was released on 2020-09-11.

## Community Health:
Discussions about new features and improvements keep appearing and being
followed up in dev@.

Newcomers approach user@ and are getting supported by the community.

GitHub's Pull Requests seem to have become the main contribution mean, from
both first-time contributors and committers.

hybrid runtime plans of local, in-memory operations and distributed
operations on Apache Spark.

## Project Status:
- Current major focus areas are the new backend for federated learning,
  various improvements across many components, and work towards an
  additional release on Spark 2.x and Java 8 (before we potentially move
  to Spark 3 and Java 11).

## Membership Data:

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Health

Reported in the last two board reports, the project has been focusing on
releasing more frequently.  January 2020 saw one release of TomEE 8, our main
branch, and long gap till the next TomEE 8 release in August, 2020.  We're
proud to report we've done 4 releases of TomEE 8 since August, with an
average of 2 months between releases.

We've also reported delays in getting enough PMC votes to get releases out
the door.  Things there have also improved and we average 6-10 days each
vote, with votes able to close early but just being held open to get more
feedback.

Also reported previously are efforts to expand the PMC to address some of the
health issues. This quarter we have voted in a new committer, Richard
Zowalla, and a new addition to the PMC -- name omitted from the report as the
72 hour lazy consenus from the board has not elapsed.

The project is very happy with the progress and good start to 2021. We hope
to keep up this momentum and will continue reporting on these fronts.

## Activity

The primary focus has been completing Jakarta EE 8 certification and pursuing
Jakarta EE 9 as a side effort.  Both of these come from the same codebase and
the Jakarta EE 9 release achived via tools that translate bytecode
referencing javax packages to now use the equivalent jakarta packages.  While
this is overall successfull and we are passing 99% (187 failing tests) and
98% (431 failing tests) of the Jakarta EE 8 and Jakarta EE 9 Web Profile
TCKs, we do see limitations for our embedded users, testing support and using
different dependencies in TomEE 8 vs TomEE 9.  For example, we'd like to use
Tomcat 10 in TomEE 9 instead of Tomcat 9.  Discussion is active on how we can
address that and solutions being discussed include doing an actual
javax-to-jakarta cutover in source.

A large chunk of our remaining failures for Jakarta EE 8 Web Profile
are only resolvable via test challenges that must be resolved in the
respective Jakarta specification projects at Eclipse.

The project has invested time shifting from Buildbot to Jenkins.  The
experience so far has been not great and our build time is roughly 2.5 hours
on Buildbot and over 4 hours on Jenkins.  The Jenkins install seems to have
significantly fewer resources, which is painful as Jenkins is significantly
better for Maven-based Java projects as it does track the pass/fail history
of each individual test and can point out things like intermittent failures,
frequently failed tests, etc.  Some effort has been placed into investigating
Github Actions to see if that can open new options.

The project has successfully completed migration away from the Apache CMS,
which is an activity that has been in progress since February of this year.
Work continues on the website rebranding and updating of the technology
used. David Jencks has put considerable effort into migrating the website to
Antora, which the project is still hoping to leverage.

We still have hopes to improve the documentation and further improve the
website infrastructure, though no activity was done on that this quarter.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Traffic Control Project  [David Neuman]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Traffic Control is the creation and maintenance of 
software related to building, monitoring, configuring, and provisioning a large 
scale content delivery network (CDN)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring the board's attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Traffic Control was founded 2018-05-15 (3 years ago)
There are currently 26 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Robert Butts on 2020-03-12.
- No new committers. Last addition was Zach Hoffman on 2020-09-03.

## Project Activity:
The community worked hard to get our 4.1.1 and 5.0 release candidates tested
and released.  We had some discussion about our next release and decided we
would try to do a quick 5.1 release to address a few minor bugs and then plan
on a 6.0 release in the spring.

Our Traffic Ops working groups spent a fair amount of time cleaning up old
issues in Github which allowed us to get a good sense for things that we need
to revisit and things that are no longer valid.

We recently merged a PR to make ATC a go module.


## Community Health:
Overall the community remains healthy even though the majority of
contributions are primarily coming from one company with a small number of
contributions coming from others.  We continue to see new users join our
community and set up Traffic Control, however we still struggle to turn them
into contributors.

 addition of Georg Kallidis (2012-09-19).

## Project Activity:
- Fulcrum Security 2.0.0 was released on 2021-01-04.
- Fulcrum Testcontainer 1.0.9 was released on 2021-01-04.

Main code activity was about accomplishment of Db Torque 5 integration in an
upcoming release, adding a new feature (URL mapping) into Turbine Core and
security updates in dependencies.

## Community Health:
- Turbine project has seen above average levels of activity in the last
  quarter in dev mailing list and commits.
- Active community seems to be small, but at least stable and prepared to help
  out, if needed, although efforts need to be taken to attract potential new
  community members. Accompanying the next main release (Turbine core) with a
  site revision seems to be the best way to test / achieve this first step.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
Apache Xalan exists to promote the use of XSLT. We view XSLT (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language Transformations) as a compelling paradigm that transforms 
XML documents, thereby facilitating the exchange, transformation, and 
presentation of knowledge. The ability to transform XML documents into usable 
information has great potential to improve the functionality and use of 
information systems. We intend to build freely available XSLT processing 
components in order to engender such improvements.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Xalan was founded 2004-09-30 (16 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 5 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-02-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-03-20.

## Project Activity:
There have been no new releases in this reporting period. The most recent
release was XalanC-1.12 on 2020-06-07. The activity on the mailing list is low
with most traffic directed at the C side of the house (as opposed to Java).

## Community Health:

Health is low with little activity on the mailing lists and no commits this
reporting period. I moderate out a ton of spam on all mailing lists though
which is pain.
