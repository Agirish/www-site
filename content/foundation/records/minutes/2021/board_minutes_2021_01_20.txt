 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Roy]

       I had a nice discussion with Ian Buck, VP at NVIDIA, and we
       resolved the longstanding issue impacting MXNet regarding our
       distribution of binaries compiled by NVIDIA's CUDA SDK.

       Other than that, my free time has been consumed by the HTTP
       specifications which are now in working group last call at
       the IETF. I hope to get more Apache work done this month.

    B. President [David]

       As we close out CY2020 and open CY2021 the Fundraising folks pulled
       together an impressive month taking advantage of the end of fiscal
       year for a number of our sponsors.

       I've spent some time this past month working with the Treasurer on the
       initiation of our TD Bank account and services.

       We have an ongoing Code of Conduct issue that's being worked and a
       fresh complaint that arrived shortly before drafting this report.

       We've filed the 2021 Annual Report with the state of Delaware as
       required to keep our corporation status active.

       I'm just starting work on the budget, and more coming on that as we
       enter February.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 8.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       While reading this and future reports, please keep in mind that
       reducing manual labor and increasing automatically accessible insights
       for volunteers and paid staff alike has been the major theme behind
       the changes we have made and will continue to make in the Treasurer’s
       office.

       Transition to TDBank:

       We have opened a new bank account with TDBank.  Currently we are
       depositing all donor checks to TDBank and directing payments from
       Stripe and PayPal to TDBank.  We are not currently requesting that
       sponsors remit to the TDBank account, and we also are not currently
       paying expenses out of it.

       Our evaluation of virtualizing our credit card expenditures is still
       lower priority, but opening the TD Bank account helps us towards this
       goal, because it allows us to provide the virtual credit card provider
       with read-only access to our bank account.

       TDBank also syncs automatically with QuickBooks Online, which reduces
       our manual work in accounting reconciliation.

       In the process of transitioning Boston Private, I requested that
       Trevor Grant be added to the signatories.  We’ve been asked to sign an
       agreement very similar to the Citizen’s agreement that recently
       required board action.  We should discuss how we wish to handle this.

       Support of Fundraising:

       Our new treasurer/accounting team spent a lot of extra cycles
       supporting fundraising/sponsor relations in December to help bring in
       last minute, end-of-year sponsorships, including a rather exciting
       double Platinum sponsorship invoice created and submitted to the
       Microsoft purchase order system by the Treasurer herself on the
       morning of the January 1st (European time) with extensive support from
       Greg Stein and Sally Khudairi.  IgniteSpot was very responsive,
       sometimes even during their vacation.

       Accounting transition:

       The transition to the new accountant is mostly complete.

       Still outstanding are:
       * Complete the tax and audit of our books from the last fiscal year,
         which are still held by our previous accounting firm.  Progress has
         been made, but this is not yet complete.
       * Recovering access to two last donation channel accounts.

       Of the outstanding items from the accounting transition mentioned in
       our previous report, we’ve been able to complete:
       * Transition our bank account out from under the previous accounting
         firm’s relationship with our bank, and provide the new accounting
         firm with read access to our banking data.
       * Complete the integration between bill.com and QuickBooks online, in
         order to automatically sync payment data.
       * Migrate the PayPal account, and the Boston Private account.

       Other items we have accomplished:
       * Our current accountant, with support from our previous accountant,
         was also able to complete the 1099’s for the year and is sending
         them out.
       * We have agreed on a notification schedule and format for incoming
         payments for fundraising.

       And finally, a reminder: for *all* email communications with our
       accounting team, please include team@treasurer.apache.org.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In December, the secretary team filed 48 ICLAs and four software
       grants.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       [no additional updates]

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       Big thanks go out to the many staff and volunteers who led the
       successful and smooth transition of many back office services to the
       ASF.  We always thank our many project volunteers for their work;
       let's also take the time to thank myriad organizational volunteers who
       keep our corporate being healthy too!

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Schedule the annual members meeting

       We should plan a date for the annual members meeting.
       For the past six years it has been held around the last
       week of March, which drops a new board into the end of
       budgeting for the coming year.

       Roy thinks it would be better to have a meeting on the
       first or second week of March [March 2-4 or 9-11].

       Would it be possible/desirable to use our virtual
       conferences platform to host the first part of our
       annual meeting?

       RESOLVED, the next annual members meeting shall be March 9-11, 2021,
       was approved by General Consent.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsors: we are working on $68K in renewals (one Gold, and three
Bronze Sponsors). We have $537K in invoicing (new Sponsorships or renewals in
place, with monies due to the ASF: this is for three Platinum; three Gold; two
Bronze Sponsors). We received $420K in Sponsor payments (two Platinum, two
Gold, three Silver, and two Corporate Charitable Contributions). We welcomed
(signed on) one new Platinum, one Gold, one Silver, and one Bronze Sponsor. We
are now administering/maintaining all Sponsor accounting records.

2) Targeted Sponsors: we are working on securing Targeted renewals for the New
Year, and completed end-of-year outreach with existing Targeted Sponsors.

3) Sponsor Relations: we have completed our end-of-year outreach to all
Sponsors. We are working with three organizations considering ASF Sponsor
promotional offerings as part of their sponsorship.

4) Event Sponsorship: no activity (there are no Apache events being planned at
this time).

5) Individual Donations and Corporate Giving: we successfully closed our
end-of-year Individual and Corporate Giving campaigns. We earned $7,602 during
December over 103 donations through donate.apache.org. Select Sponsors also
use our online donation platform to process payment of their Sponsorship
renewals.

6) The work of ensuring our sponsor recognition (thanks page) matches our
internal records is receiving a boost thanks to automation. Tooling now exists
that identifies deltas between the two locations and will continue to be
enhanced with the goal of full, automated synchronization.

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — January 2021

I. Budget: we are on-budget and processing standing vendor payments as
scheduled.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support day-to-day
activities within ASF Fundraising, focusing on end-of-year Sponsor renewals,
invoicing, and giving campaigns. We issued the December Month In Review
https://s.apache.org/Dec2020 , published Apache in 2020 - By The Digits

Operations Summary https://s.apache.org/Q2FY2021 , and published Part II of
the "Inside Infra" interview with Andrew Wetmore
https://s.apache.org/InsideInfra-Andrew2 and are preparing to publish the
final interview of the series. We helped coordinate response to an ASF
Code-of-Conduct violation, helped an Apache project community with planning an
upcoming event, worked with three Sponsors with promoting their support of the
ASF, secured a Board member spokesperson and wrote their presentation for a
Sponsor conference, and handled an Apache project logo re-publishing request

service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this timeframe.

IV. Informal Announcements: we published 8 items on the ASF "Foundation" Blog,
including 4 Apache News Round-ups and 1 monthly overview, totalling 354 news
summaries published to date. We tweeted 18 items to 59K followers on Twitter,
and posted 19 items to 45.6K followers on LinkedIn. The ASF's YouTube channel
had 14,232 views this month, with 8,421 subscribers to date.

V. Future Announcements: 6 announcements are in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

2,156 press hits vs. last month's 3,441, inclusive of coverage on the ASF,
Apache Projects, and initiatives such as ApacheCon.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received two analyst queries, provided background
to a EU analyst researching AI Service Clouds for an upcoming industry report,
and followed up on last month's Serverless Computing research query on behalf
of an Apache project PMC. Apache was mentioned in a total of 28 reports by
Gartner, Forrester, 451 Research, and IDC.

VIII. Central Services: Kenneth Paskett (Creative team) continues to make
updates and adjustments to apache.org related sub-pages. We are preparing for
the migration to the new CMS. Swapnil Mane (Editorial team) continues with
drafting and publishing Weekly News Round-ups and Month-in-Review summaries,
and has launched the new ASF news video highlight promotions, which we are
planning to produce on a regular basis.

IX. Events liaison: we are working with an Apache project community that is
partnering with other industry foundations on an upcoming event. We will also

we receive specifications. We continue to advise several Apache projects with
promoting their events.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: We completed the transition of billing
pass-throughs from HALO Worldwide to the ASF. We confirmed the clipping

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- Staff is now completely on our new PEO, three payrolls have been run
  successfully, and our benefits plan started on January 1. The 401k
  plan should start on March 1.
- A potential security gap in GitHub Actions led to our disabling of
  "untrusted" third-party Actions until we could investigate. We are
  on-track with security recommendations and a scanner to enforce that
  policy, as people adjust workflows [which use Actions].

Finances
========
- Budget planning will start very soon. Staffing represents over 85%
  of the Infra budget, and that was completed during our PEO
  transition. The remaining portion of our budget will be very
  straightforward.
- Overall, the Infra budget is doing well for FY21, as we did not
  backfill our open position (and had budgeted for a half-year).

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Finish the FY22 budget.
- Gitbox v2 launch, for a few private repositories.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Finish the mail system upgrade. It is in testing right now.
- Extract permalinks from our PonEE snapshot, and validate them to
  ensure we have a disaster recovery plan that includes permalinks.

General Activity
================
- Helpful edits for community.a.o and incubator.a.o
- Continued migration from old ubuntu/puppet.
- Gavin led another "Builds Meeting", with two people from GitHub in
  attendance to answer questions, and to take concerns, around the use
  of GitHub Actions (per the highlight above).
- Beginning to explore Okta as an identity platform. It will be used
  for when we migrate to the Atlassian cloud products. We may be able
  to use Okta in other areas of the Foundation.
- Ported the Buildstream repository (and other supporting data, and
  metadata) from Gitlab over to GitHub.
- Some volunteers are assisting with Jira administration, and JDK
  support via bintray.
- Beginning testing of GitHub's Container Registry, as their old
  package repository is deprecated and causing some issues.

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team
  who contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I
  landscape in the industry and for the foundation. The team also
  focuses on developing resources the projects can leverage to
  increase diversity and inclusion in their communities.

## Issues:

None
## Activity:

*** Operations

Preparing budget for 2021 FY Finalizing project wrap up with Bitergia
*** Project: User Experience Research on new contributors ***

Final report is underway Wrote and submitted an academic paper for
CSCW (Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing)[1].
CSCW is the premier venue for research in the design and use of
technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and
networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners, CSCW
explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges
of designing technology to support collaborative work and life
activities. The conference accepts novel, innovative and original work
and typically has a 20-25% acceptance rate – which means it’s a very
competitive conference.  The conference had 900 participants in 2020. 
We have submitted our work for CSCW 2021 and we will know about how
our paper did in April 2021, when we receive the review comments. We
hopefully get an Accept or a Major Revision. This will make the
research validated by a cross functional team of academics, helping us
complete our first short term goal of providing scientific validates
data on the state of D&I in the foundation. 


*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***

 6 interns on 6 different projects. All projects proceeding as
 normal.  You can check the working group notes here [2]
## Committee members changes:

Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

In December the ASF became the first organisation to get a live CVE
name using the new CVE project automation API. Instead of the security
team holding a pool of names requested in advance we now allocate them
on demand, with the service taking care of emails to the PMC and other
previously manual parts of the process. We expect more automation
available over the coming year allowing us to streamline the CVE
process for projects even further.

Special thanks go to Accumulo, Airflow, CXF, NuttX, Tomcat, and Unomi
who all used the new portal to handle vulnerabilities.

Stats for Dec 2020:

     18      [license confusion]
     11      [support request/question not security notification]

Security reports: 45 (last months: 45, 41, 32)

      9      [site]
      4      [servicecomb]
      3      [httpd], [shardingsphere], [struts]
      2      [activemq], [dubbo], [hadoop], [hbase], [openoffice], [tomcat]
      1      [accumulo], [cordova], [flink], [gobblin], [infrastructure],
             [kafka], [kylin], [maven], [myfaces], [shiro], [skywalking],
             [wicket]

     In total, as of 30th December 2020, we're tracking 68 (last
     month: 64) open issues across 33 projects, median age 80 (last
     month: 90) days.  29 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     7 (unchanged since last month) of these issues, across 4
     projects, are older than 365 days.  None require escalation.

Attachment 12: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations [Rob Tompkins]

I've submitted the paperwork for the membership application. I'm now sorting
out what membership at the $0 level affords us. Apparently to have any stake
in things we may have to chip in more than $0 ($6075.25 approx. annually).
That said, I'm not sure what the appetite here is for that level of
involvement. I plan to further correspond via email to the board to ask if
there is any such appetite.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Ed Coleman]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Accumulo is the creation and maintenance of software
related to a robust, scalable, distributed key/value store with cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing. It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and
Thrift.

## Issues:
Trademark issue with http://www.accumulodata.com: The owner of no longer has
access to the email used to register the domain, and the registrar will not
accept communications from alternate accounts.  Currently, the domain is set
to expire on 2021-06-28, and without access by the owner, should automatically
expire. The Accumulo PMC is currently trying to determine if other actions are
required. Initial emails are at [1] and follow-up discussions at [4].  Advice
received Brand Management VP suggested that allowing the domain to expire in 6
months is a viable option and allows volunteer efforts to be put towards
better uses.

## Membership Data:
Apache Accumulo was founded 2012-03-20 (9 years ago)
There are currently 38 committers and 38 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

## Project Activity:
- CVE-2020-17533 [5] was reported on 2020-12-09 and resolved within 14 days. 
  The CVE concerned allowed authenticated users to perform certain
  administrative operations without having the appropriate permissions.
- Project activity on the next release remains active with significant
  improvements to the current baseline. The remaining issues are being
  actively worked.
- There is community interest in improving support for cloud computing
  platforms (AWS, Azure) and alternate files systems.

## Community Health:
- Mailing list participation and GitHub issues are consistent.
- The large JIRA activity increase reflects migration or closing old JIRA
  issues in favor of using GitHub for issue tracking.
- 3 new contributors, each from different organizations showing continued
  interest from a diverse community:
  - Szabolcs Bukros [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/)

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Christian Schneider]

## Description:
Apache Aries software is a set of pluggable Java components enabling an 
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

## Issues:
The only issue is not very signification and relates to the migration away
from ASF CMS toward an Antora based site. While progress is slow, a recent
report from the member working on this indicated that progress was being made.
Since this is a volunteer, best effort, that's to be expected.

## Membership Data:
Apache Aries was founded 2010-12-14 (10 years ago)
There are currently 58 committers and 41 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carlos Sierra Andrés on 2018-07-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Romain Manni-Bucau on 2020-01-29.

## Project Activity:
Most activity has taken place in 3 projects, cdi, spifly over the last 
quarter, and most recently in jax-rs-whiteboard. There are more plans for 
even further activity on jax-rs-whiteboard and a couple of new integrations
with it are being conceived.

Of course the site migration away from AFS CMS is still in progress and
we recently got an update that, while slowly, this is progressing.

It should be noted that Aries does contain many widely used and highly stable
components that, while they do not provide much activity, issues for them
are important and are most often immediately addressed; Aries Blueprint, 
Aries Proxy, Aries SPI Fly to name just a few.

## Community Health:
Community engagement seems to at least be stable while trending toward a slight
improvement. However participation is still rather low. Hoping that new
releases and a new site can inspire a little more activity.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Wes McKinney]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Arrow is the creation and maintenance of software related
to columnar in-memory processing and data interchange

## Issues:

* After our past issues around scarce CI resources, we had managed to
  stabilize our CI setup around the relatively generous execution
  facilities provided by Github Actions, and a bunch of additional
  builds on other platforms (mostly for nightly builds). That
  equilibrium was unfortunately shattered after INFRA suddenly
  disallowed most third-party Github Actions helpers in response to
  security concerns. Our remaining Github Actions builds also seem to
  be queued longer. This has now been resolved
  (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-21239) but it was
  hugely disruptive to our community.

  Concurrently, Travis-CI also started to be much stricter with
  resource consumption, which is currently affecting several of our
  nightly builds until we manage to migrate them to other CI services.

  These factors compounded mean we'll finally need to provide and set
  up our own CI resources. We hope to be able to migrate a significant
  number of builds to Buildkite, using execution resources paid by our
  sponsors.  We also hope that INFRA rules around repository access
  and configuration won't stifle that endeavour.

## Membership Data:

Apache Arrow was founded 2016-01-19 (5 years ago)
There are currently 54 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Francois Saint-Jacques on 2020-03-04.
- Andrew Lamb was added as committer on 2020-11-06

## Project Activity:

- We'd like to release Arrow 3.0 around mid-January. The issues
  discussed above (diminished CI coverage due to disallowed
  third-party Github Actions, blocked nightly builds on Travis-CI,
  complex release procedure) make it more difficult than we'd like.

- There seems to be growing interest in zero-copy zero-dependency
  cross-runtime interoperability using our "C data interface". It is
  now concretely possible to share data in-process between R, Python
  and Rust, without any shared code and without going through IPC
  mechanisms (the latter still possible, of course, using the Arrow
  IPC format). Other projects such as DuckDB have started using this
  interface.

- The Arrow in-memory format is regularly being adopted and/or adapted
  to in other projects, especially in the dataframe and database
  communities.

## Community Health:

* The project is overall very active. The Rust implementation is
  especially thriving, with numerous pull requests being submitted and
  merged in due time. The C++ implementation is advancing at similar
  speed as in previous reports. A Julia implementation was recently
  contributed.

* Our pull request backlog has also grown slightly as a result of
  increased activity, but it does not seem to be posing a real problem
  for now.

* The weight of our release procedure puts a burden on our capacity to
  release often. The "weight" is a function of the project complexity
  but also limitations in our CI/CD resources and feedback cycles
  (e.g. builds that run only once a day overnight often fail and we
  end up blocked on releasing until those failures are resolved). Our
  goal is to cut a new feature release roughly once every two months,
  which often ends up challenging. This situation also makes us
  reluctant to put out bugfix releases in-between, except for critical
  fixes. Improved CI/CD along with improvements to streamline the
  release process itself (for example, addressing procedural issues
  with preparing the Java project to release) would help a great
  deal. We also need more PMC members to step up and help with release
  management. Most of the release management over the lifetime of the
  project has fallen on the shoulders of only 4 out of our 30 PMCs.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Mads Toftum]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Ismaël Mejía]

## Description:
Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Avro was founded 2010-04-20 (10 years ago)
There are currently 34 committers and 24 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ryan Skraba on 2020-09-14.
- No new committers. Last addition was Kengo Seki on 2020-07-08.

## Project Activity:
Apache Avro 1.10.1 was released on 2020-12-03. This release keeps the expected
pace of releases every six months discussed by the community. It updated many
dependencies and fixed issues across the several languages supported. One
particular issue fixes a regression that was blocking downstream projects
(Apache Hive and Apache Spark) from upgrading to Avro 1.10.x. For more details
see the announcement:

https://s.apache.org/avro-1.10.1-announce

The community decided to move its Continuous Integration jobs from Travis to
Github Actions for stability reasons. The migration process is ongoing.

For those who prefer metrics:

Mailing Lists:
- dev@avro.apache.org had 645 emails (34% decrease)
- user@avro.apache.org had 32 emails (35% decrease)
- issues@avro.apache.org had 232 emails (105% increase)

JIRA:
- 83 issues opened (76% increase)
- 33 issues closed (26% increase)

GitHub:
- 81 PRs open (138% increase)
- 46 PRs closed (70% increase)

Code Repository:
- 106 commits in the past quarter (211% increase)
- 14 code contributors in the past quarter (-12% decrease)


## Community Health:
Community health is doing well at drawing in contributions. The pace was
higher during this quarter due to the release, however the number of
contributors was smaller. The PMC keeps the ongoing track of recognizing
contributors through committership.

We have improved the release cadence in the last two years having in average a
release every two quarters which is a good pace for a ‘mature’ project like
Avro. We are also updating some of the technical infrastructure to make
contributors experience better.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Kenneth Knowles]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Beam is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing, 
enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution engines and 
providing extensibility points for connecting to different technologies and 
user communities.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Beam was founded 2016-12-20 (4 years ago)
There are currently 75 committers and 22 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:2.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alexey Romanenko on 2020-06-11.
- No new committers. Last addition was Heejong Lee on 2020-09-03.

The cause of the stall is simply lowered PMC activity. It has been noted
by the PMC and we are getting it moving again.

## Project Activity:

In the core model there is big news: "Splittable DoFn" is now the default
recommended way to write new data connectors. In simple terms: data sources
are now dynamic. Previously, data connectors were a root of the computation
graph (no inputs) and you said what you wanted to read before you started your
job. Now data connectors take their input specification at runtime. This opens
up a whole new realm of data processing, as you can take a "big data" number
of Kafka topics or HDFS paths on input and read from all of them, and the
rest of the Beam model "just works" with this (including unification of bounded
and unbounded data and watermarks, etc).

In the Python realm:
- Python 2 and Python 3.5 support dropped!
- Performance-driven type checking added (opt-in) [pytypes].
- An exciting new avenue for users is a Pandas compatible API. The goal is
exact compatibility. To that end, we are running Pandas own test suite
against the Beam module.
- Beam's cross-language capabilities continue to expand: Java-based KinesisIO,
SnowflakeIO, are available for Beam Python users

In the Java realm:
- Java 11 is officially supported and tested. Users are invited to use
  Java 11.
- We have started to develop BOMs that simplify dependency management for
  users who have committed to a particular ecosystem (where "ecosystem" is
  deliberately undefined and user demand can drive new BOMs being made).
- Our Hadoop connectors are now tested against Hadoop 3.

In the SQL realm: a bunch more connector capabilities:
- Avro, JSON, and Protobuf over Kafka
- Avro over Pubsub
- Bigtable connector
- Thrift format support

For the Flink runner there is a major change in the works: it was cloning
every item of data needlessly. This was noticed, diagnosed, and fixed, reducing
some pipeline runtimes by 80%.

For the Dataflow runner there is a major migration happening: "Dataflow V2"
is going more "all in" on Beam. Rather than translating Beam's pipeline model
to the Dataflow API it is using Beam's model directly. This also enables
cross-language pipelines and users to have simplified custom containers for
their UDFs. FlinkRunner and SparkRunner already had "portable" variants, and
this is the "portable" variant of Dataflow. (the term "portable" refers to using
Beam's new "portability" APIs that allow all the language-agnostic goodness).

Recent releases (we have a target cadence of 6 weeks):

- 2.27.0 was released on 2021-01-08.
- 2.26.0 was released on 2020-12-11.
- 2.25.0 was released on 2020-10-23.

([pytypes](https://beam.apache.org/blog/python-performance-runtime-type-checking/)


## Community Health:

There is an overall trend of reduced activity. The variance in usual quarters
is pretty high, but I would guess the pandemic has had a significant effect.

Verbatim stats, for reference:

- dev@beam.apache.org had a 21% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (811
  emails compared to 1017)
- github@beam.apache.org had a 37% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (7584 emails compared to 11968)
- issues@beam.apache.org had a 39% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (13471 emails compared to 21750)
- 565 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (3% increase)
- 697 commits in the past quarter (-37% decrease)
- 120 code contributors in the past quarter (-27% decrease)
- 610 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-27% decrease)
- 586 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-30% decrease)
- 114 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (570% increase)

issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======
There are no issues to raise to the Board at this time.

Releases
========

There have been no releases since the last report. The last release was
towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Community & Development
=======================

As noted in the last report to the board in September, discussions around
the idea of migrating the project to the attic on the dev list appeared to
demonstrate enough ongoing interest to continue the project. The PMC roll
call email confirmed that there were 4 PMC members willing to provide the
required oversight for the project.

Development progress remains slow but it was agreed that the project would
move to using git for new work.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Haisheng Yuan]

## Description:
Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data not
residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.


## Membership Data:
There are currently 51 committers and 23 PMC members in
this project.  The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3. 

No new committers or PMC members were added in the last 3 months.

Calcite community has the tradition of annual rotation for PMC chair,
Haisheng Yuan is selected as the new PMC chair.


## Project Activity:
Calcite 1.26.0 was released on 2020-10-06, with important features such as
supporting SEARCH operator and Sarg literal, adding PIVOT operator in SQL,
adding support for JDK 15 and Guava version 29.0-jre.

On Jan 20th, there will be online meetup for Calcite community with
presentations covering Calcite concepts, recent work on streams, spatial
query implementation.

## Community Health:
The overall activity in the community has slightly decreased in the past
few months without this being worrisome.

121 issues opened in JIRA and 79 issues closed in the past quarter
(40% decrease). The fewer number of design discussions and JIRA 
activities can be explained by the holiday season and low number of
active committers.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Pepijn Noltes]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache CXF was founded 2008-04-15 (13 years ago) There are currently 43
committers and 26 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andy McCright on 2019-02-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexey Markevich on 2017-12-29.

We have a few patches from various people, but nothing strong enough for
consideration as a committer.  We've tried to encourage some additional
involvement from various people, but many people more or less disappeared over
the holidays.   

## Project Activity:
The primary focus this period was bug fixes for a patch release for 3.4 that
was released last period.  There were several important regressions and bugs
in 3.4 that were fixed as part of 3.4.2.  Traffic on both the dev and users
lists was up a bit this quarter as people started migrating to 3.4.

Recent releases:
3.3.9 was released on 2020-12-28.
3.4.2 was released on 2020-12-28. 
Apache CXF Fediz 1.5.1 was released on 2020-11-30.

## Community Health:
For the most part, the project is making steady, but not stellar, progress.
Many of the protocols and specs that CXF implements are mature specs and don't
really change much (other than the above mentioned package change from
javax->jakarta).   Thus, steady progress and regular releases are a good
thing.   We are responding to bug reports and security issues and getting
patch releases out.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DataSketches Project  [Lee Rhodes]

## Description:
The mission of Apache DataSketches is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to an open source, high-performance library of streaming algorithms 
commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences. Sketches are small, stateful 
programs that process massive data as a stream and can provide approximate 
answers, with mathematical guarantees, to computationally difficult queries 
orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact methods

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache DataSketches was founded 2020-12-15 (a month ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- Charlie Dickens was added as committer on 2020-12-18

## Project Activity:
Over the past month (since graduation) we have been busy with the transition.
With the holidays, we have had only two weeks to work on the transition, 
nonetheless, as of this writing, we are about 95% complete. We have a number
of releases to do, which will be a strong test that we have all the pieces
in the right place. 

Our last release was our C++, Python Core on Sep 22, 2020.
We plan for a new release of Java Memory this month with a new release of
our Java core shortly thereafter.

## Community Health:
We suspect that some of the decrease in traffic on dev@ and users@ may be due
to the holidays. Also, much of our code has been very stable in its quality,
which is a good thing. We will be introducing some new sketches soon, which
will indubitably have concomitant traffic.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Shawn McKinney]

## Description:
The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:

- ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in
  Java, which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides
  LDAP it supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.

- LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
  replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).
  This is a "schema aware” API with some convenient ways to access all types
  of LDAP servers.

- Studio: A complete directory tooling platform intended to be used with any
  LDAP server however it is particularly designed for use with ApacheDS. It is
  an Eclipse RCP application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.

- Fortress: A standards-based authorization platform that provides role-based
  access control, delegated administration and password policy services with
  an LDAP backend.

- Kerby: An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains various tools
  to access and manage kerberos principals and keytabs. It provides a rich,
  intuitive and interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
  facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2) as desired in modern
  environments such as cloud, Hadoop and mobile.

- Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC (Multi Version
  Concurrency Control) support.

- SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification.

## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Directory was founded 2005-02-22 (16 years ago)
There are currently 58 committers and 19 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Radovan Semancik on 2018-09-28.
- new committer Jiayi Liu on 2021-01-11

## Project Activity:
Overall:

As first reported last quarter we are using the new CMS and the project
website migration (using it) was successful, made possible by a large effort
from a few members of our project team.

Per sub-project:

- ApacheDS: low activitity: security, bug fixes and work migrating to Junit 5.

- LDAP API: very low activity.

- Studio:   low activity: being maintained, with latest eclipse compatibility
  (its framework) and move beyond Java 8 is required.

- Fortress: low activity: security, bug fixes and enhancements. Planning for
  next release, late spring early summer.

- Kerby:    low activity: security and bug fixes.

- Mavibot:  low activity.  It was heavily modified during 2Q 2020.  At that
  time transactions across B-trees were added. Next is to add old revisions
  removal. This is quite a bit more work but the developer, Emmanuel Lecharny
  has made it clear that it will be done. It's considered important to the
  future of the directory server sub-project due to its promise of a stable
  database.

- SCIMple:  no activity.

## Community Health:
No problems to report.  4Q activity continues to be low but steady across most
of the sub-projects.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Druid Project  [Gian Merlino]

## Description

Apache Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database. It is
designed for workflows where low-latency query and ingest are the main
requirements. It implements ingestion, storage, and querying subsystems. Users
interface with Druid through built-in SQL and JSON APIs, as well as
third-party applications.

Druid has an extensive web of connections with other Apache projects: Calcite
for SQL planning, Curator and ZooKeeper for coordination, Kafka and Hadoop as
data sources, Avro, ORC, or Parquet as supported data input formats, and
DataSketches for scalable approximate algorithms. Druid can also be used as a
data source by Superset.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

We are currently starting the release process for our fifth major
post-graduation release, 0.21.0, which we expect to have ready within the
coming weeks. Additionally, we made our fourth major post-graduation release
0.20.0 on October 16, 2020.

Since our last board report we have had 7 community virtual meetups in various
"locations" across the globe (San Francisco, Bucharest, London, Bangalore),
with 2 more scheduled in January (San Francisco, London).

"Virtual Druid Summit IV", took place on 11/18, featuring talks from Druid
adopters showcasing a variety of different use cases, with 402 registrations
and 118 live attendees. Recordings of all talks so far can be viewed at the
Druid summit website, https://druidsummit.org/.

In-person events are still on hold due to COVID-19 related concerns around
nonessential gatherings.

Mailing list activity is a bit lower over the past quarter, but seems
relatively typical for the holiday season (commit and PR activity show a
similar decrease), with 76 emails on the dev list (dev@druid.apache.org) over
the last quarter. Our ASF Slack channel, #druid, has continued to grow, and
has reached over 1300 members, with daily activity of users asking questions
and offering support to each other.

  1.5.5, and 1.5.6 is still under development. The community starts to work on
  dubbo-go 3.0 to align with dubbo java but the progress is slow.
- dubbo don't have any release in this quarter, 2.7.8 is still under
  development. We are focusing on dubbo 3.0 development, and security issues
  reported against 2.7.8. In order to improve regression, we are building
  dubbo-samples as dubbo's integration test.
- dubbo 3.0 is under development and is expected to have a preview release in
  late of this month.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache ECharts Project  [Wenli Zhang]

## Description:

Apache ECharts is a powerful, interactive charting and data visualization
library for browser.

## Issues:
We have completed the new TLP tasks at jira 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-21290 .

## Membership Data:
Apache ECharts was founded 2020-12-16 (23 days ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- No new committers were added.

No new PMC member or committers added this quarter because we are mainly 
working for the graduation and the major release. But we do find some 
qualified candidates and should take further look next quarter.

## Project Activity:

We released a major version 5.0.0 on 2020/12/02.
In this version, we provide more than 15 new features. The overall 
consideration is to make it easier for developers to tell a better story
with Apache ECharts. Features include:
- Story-telling: We improved the ability to provide an easier way to show
    the changes of data overtime.
- Visual Design: We optimized design based on visualization theory to
    allow readers to have a better understanding of the data.
- Interaction: Multi-state design allows readers to participate in the
    interaction, the richness and fluency of the interaction makes the 
    users understand the association between data more deeply.
- Developer Experience: More powerful and better to use by default, so 
    that developers do not need to worry about data processing, i18n and 
    other issues, so that they can focus on telling a better story of the 
    data.
- Accessibility: With a more accessible default theme and using decal 
    patterns to distinguish data, ECharts 5 make it easier for developers 
    to enable accessibility design for their charts and let more people 
    understand the story behind the data.

We are also working on more tutorial posts and videos
to help the users learn about this major release. These promoting jobs
should be done before the end of Jan 2020.

We are currently testing our next release and hopefully should start 
voting next week.

## Community Health:

We are working with Sally Khudairi on the graduation announcement.
Thanks to Sally's help, it's almost finished now. We plan to announce
the graduation in Jan 2021 soon.

Commit activity:
473 commits in the past quarter (-29% decrease)
17 code contributors in the past quarter (-22% decrease)

GitHub PR activity:

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Awasum Yannick]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Fineract is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a core banking platform that provides a reliable, robust, and 
affordable solution for entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service 
providers to offer financial services to the world's underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Fineract was founded 2017-04-19 (4 years ago)
There are currently 41 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Aleksandar Vidakovic on 2020-10-11.
- No new committers. Last addition was Percy Enoabane on 2020-10-02.

## Project Activity:
We have had a lot of end user questions around Fineract 1.x probably due to
people deploying the latest 1.4 release we did in late September. Customer
support questions now account for more than 50% of the emails we get on our
Dev list. These issues or questions are being addressed in a timely fashion
and those that cannot be fixed immediately are logged on JIRA for volunteer
developers to pick up and fix.

We are beginning to have conversations around reorganizing the mailing lists:
adding back the dedicated users list which we disabled back in 2018. This
discussion is ongoing and we have not yet come to a consensus.

Alek, Mike and Petri worked a lot on expanding the swagger documentation and
create sample SDK clients for Fineract over the past few months.

Fineract 1.5.0 has been planned for the first quarter of 2021. Given the
moderate rate of contributions, we think it makes sense to release a new
version once every 3 months.

Rahul Pawar, one of our GSoC 2020 intern kept working on his Credit Bureau
Integration into Fineract projecct by adding more features which enables
Financial Institutions to check credit histories of customers before
processing loan applications

Fineract CN:-

We currently have 1 Outreachy intern working to improve Fineract CN. Audrey
Ndum under the supervision of Committer Kaze Nasser is working to upgrade the
deprecated dependencies in Fineract CN. So far she has update a few
microservices left over when the project started. We think she will be done
with all this by February. 

## Community Health:
Both Fineract 1.x and Fineract CN remain healthy as we see traction the the
Dev list and JIRA. There is a sharp decrease (above 50%) in email traffic on
our Dev List probably due to holiday seasons in December.

Number of issues reported have also dropped sharply probably as a result of
the recently released Fineract 1.4 which may have fixed some issues for end
users.

Code Contributors, PRs opened and commits made have drops by more than 40% as
the solution gets more stable and vacation in December. We need to do better
to get more people engaged with the community.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Karthick Narendran on 2020-04-16.
- No new committers. Last addition was Karthick Narendran on 2020-04-17.

## Project Activity:

 * All issues outstanding for a 2.0.0 release were resolved. An assessment
   was conducted to determine if Fluo is ready for a release and shared on the
   mailing list for discussion. The assessment determined there is more that
   could be done before release, but nothing that would block a release. There
   was agreement with this finding on the mailing list.
 * Nice improvements were made to the way Uno downloads dependencies.
 * Uno was updated to support running multiple Accumulo tablet servers.
 * Updates were made to Uno and Muchos subproject to work w/ latest Accumulo
   and Fluo dependencies.
  * Noticed the checksum on an InfluxDB rpm used by Muchos changed. Reached
    out to the influxdb team and they were not sure why it changed. 
    Researched this and found it was resigned.

## Community Health:
Activity on the project was very low this quarter. No large changes were
made, mostly smaller maintenance fixes were made. Any hurdles blocking a
release were cleared and we are ready to do a release. There were 19 commits
from 5 committers and 3 contributors. One of the contributors was completely
new to Fluo.

## Community Health:
User list seems kind of abandonned but we have some very good activity on dev
list and commit metrics. The main activity was to push a new specification
implementation (javamail 1.6) and some maintenance of other specification
implementations. We are expecting more activity to come around Arthur probably
and new Java versions requiring some our tool releases for ASF projects.

One CVE was announced:

CVE-2018-11764 Apache Hadoop Privilege escalation in web endpoint

Web endpoint authentication check is broken. Authenticated users may
impersonate any user even if no proxy user is configured.

Versions affected: 3.0.0-alpha4, 3.0.0-beta1, 3.0.0 Fixed versions: 3.0.1
Impact: privilege escalation Reporter: Daryn Sharp Reported Date: 2018/03/17
Issue Announced: 2020/10/21

Hadoop Common: The object store work is keeping people busy.
* There's now a storage connector for HuaweiCloud Object Storage, so Hadoop
  and other applications using the FileSystem APIs can work with data stored
  in Huawei's cloud.
* A new IOStatistics API has gone in to allow applications to query input
  classes (filesystems, streams, iterators) for IO performance details. This
  should allow tests and applications to identify performance issues during
  profiling and hopefully production
* AWS S3 is now consistent. This enables the maintainers of the S3A connector
  to remove all the S3Guard code, which relied on DynamoDB for a consistent
  view of the data. They are looking forward to this.

* The guava update is becoming a major friction for downstream applications to
  adopt new Hadoop releases. The community is working to shade guava as the
  solution. (HADOOP-16924)
* The native compression libraries for Snappy and LZ4 are now shipped with
  Hadoop binary, no longer requiring manual installation of the native
  libraries on the host machines, making them easier to use. (HADOOP-17125 and
  HADOOP-17292)

HDFS:
* A new encryption codec "SM4/CTR/NoPadding" was added (HDFS-15098).
* HDFS Router Based Federation received a number of new improvements,
  including balancer (HDFS-15294), isolation (HDFS-14090). Rename support is
  being worked on, starting this quarter. (HDFS-15747)
* The new View FS implementation is near completion. (HDFS-15289)
* The community is working to add dynamic mount support for both read and
  write for HDFS Provided Storage. (HDFS-15714)
* Dynamic disk-level tiering (HDFS-15547) continued from last quarter.

YARN:
* The consolidation of FairScheduler and CapacityScheduler started in Q3 and
  is near completion. (YARN-10370)
* Capacity scheduler is being enhanced to support auto queue creation.
  (YARN-10496)

## Community Health:
Overall, the community participation appears relatively healthy despite
Ozone's recent move to TLP. We had a steady supply of new contributors and new
features this quarter.

Erasure Coding appears to get traction in the last two quarters. Numerous EC
bug fixes and improvements were raised this quarter. It looks like Hadoop 3 is
getting adopted.

Code development and mailing list traffic were both down significantly quarter
over quarter, possibly due to the holiday season. Traffic in ozone-dev and
ozone-issues mailing lists were down because of the Ozone TLP.

dev@hadoop.apache.org had a 75% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (10
emails compared to 39) general@hadoop.apache.org had a 67% decrease in traffic
in the past quarter (15 emails compared to 45)
mapreduce-issues@hadoop.apache.org had a 39% increase in traffic in the past
quarter (237 emails compared to 170) ozone-dev@hadoop.apache.org had a 93%
decrease in traffic in the past quarter (13 emails compared to 174)
ozone-issues@hadoop.apache.org had a 80% decrease in traffic in the past
quarter (1180 emails compared to 5804) user@hadoop.apache.org had a 30%
decrease in traffic in the past quarter (56 emails compared to 80)
user-zh@hadoop.apache.org had a 45% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (5
emails compared to 9) 322 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-31% decrease)
242 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-34% decrease) 591 commits in the
past quarter (-3% decrease) 82 code contributors in the past quarter (-16%
decrease) 214 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-13% decrease) 185 PRs
closed on GitHub, past quarter (-20% decrease)

In addition to mailing lists, JIRA and GitHub PR, we are seeing more traffic
in the official ASF slack hdfs (113 users), hadoop (119 users) and yarn (39
users) channels over the last quarter. They are being used to communicate
community online meetup events and troubleshooting issues.

## Project Activity:
- Recent release: 2.4.0.0 was released on 2018-09-21
- Activity: 2020 PostgreSQL Conference China

## Community Health:
Overall community health is action required. The development of Apache HAWQ is
pretty good in the past quarter, with 213% increase in the issue traffic, 200%
increase in the opened JIRA, and 400% increase in the closed JIRA. The reason
is that we focused on the new features and facilities which were added to the
project recently. However, we need to be more active in the community. Such as
discuss and draft the roadmap, plan the new releases, have more interaction in
the dev@hawq.apache.org, make more more committers and PMC members in the
project.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Duo Zhang]

## Description:
Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational
database. Apache HBase gives you low latency random access to billions of rows
with millions of columns atop non-specialized hardware.

mitigate the impact of our dependency choices on the wider ecosystem.

hbase-connectors is a collection of integration points with other projects.
The initial release includes artifacts for use with Apache Kafka and Apache
Spark.

hbase-filesystem contains HBase project-specific implementations of the Apache
Hadoop FileSystem API. It is currently experimental and internal to the
project.

hbase-operator-tools is a collection of tools for HBase operators. Now it is
mainly for hosting HBCK2.

hbase-native-client is a client library in C/C++, in its early days.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:
2.4.0 was released on 2020-12-15.
hbase-thirdparty-3.4.1 was released on 2020-11-27.
2.3.3 was released on 2020-11-02.

A new minor release line 2.4.x has been established, which is the fifth minor
release line for 2.x.

We discussed whether to purge the hbase-backup module because it has not been
included in any releases and now lack maintenance and there was a user in
the community who wanted to maintain it.
https://s.apache.org/k5b9i

We discussed how to better make use of 'Signed-off-by' in the commit message.
There is no consensus so far, mainly because whether to use 'Reviewed-by'
instead of 'Signed-off-by' for non committer reviewers.
https://s.apache.org/tgjup

We decided to move the stable pointer to 2.3.x and EOL the 2.2.x release line.
The final release for 2.2.x will be 2.2.7.
https://s.apache.org/7rqow

We switched from OpenTracing to OpenTelemetry for implementing our tracing
system.

- GitHub PR activity:
337 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-34% decrease)
313 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-38% decrease)

We had a new minor release this quarter but still not too many new commits.
This means 2.x is getting more and more stable and no big new features for
2.x. This is a sign that we may need to kick the 3.0.0 release. A good news is
that the number of contributors remained at the same level.

## Community Health:
Last quarter saw bit of decrease of activity across jira and mailing list. We
attribute that to end of year holiday season slowdown. Nothing concerning.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for January 2021

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 40 podlings incubating. In December, podlings executed 
9 distinct releases. We added three new IPMC members, and none retired. 
There was one IP clearance in December. We have one new project Wayang. 
ECharts and DataSketches graduated last month, and Ratis and Flagon should 
graduate next month.

Annotator and Liminal, which failed to report last month, have reported 
this month. BRPC did not report again, and a role-call will be carried out 
to see if there is still an active PMC. This month we were missing reports 
from BRPC, Livy, PonyMail and Weex.

BlueMarlin still seems to be having some difficulty communicating on their 
mailing lists. They have submitted a report this month which is a good 
start.

Liminal has corrected the issue with its unapproved releases.

S2Graph will be retired shortly.

Weex, who was considering retirement, has managed to get the needed 3 +1 
PPMC votes for a release and their release is now up for IPMC vote.

SAMOA currently has no mentors but given there's little, or no activity on 
the mailing list and no commits for 9 months that's not a big issue. The 
project will be encouraged to retire.

Andrew Wetmore went though and simplified the language on many incubator 
site pages, including the policy page. There's a couple of missing links 
that still need to be corrected.

The major licensing issue with MXNet has been resolved with permission 
given to distribute it under the Apache 2.0 license. There are still 
several trademark and branding issues that need to be resolved. The project 
states it's nearing graduation, but IMO some work still needs to be done 
before that can happen. Their last release failed to get the required 
number of IPMC votes due to the difficultly in reviewing it. The previous 
releases containing Category X code still have not been removed (see 
INFRA-20442).

Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases and graduations. 
There were graduation discussions around ECharts, Flagon, Ratis and Goblin.

     Comments: Flagon was to do degree blokced from graduating within the 
     last ~3 months. I personally felt that the IMPC review of the DRAFT
     graduation resolution could have been better handled by the IPMC. There
     were a number of non-blocking items which were raised and which 
eventually
     impacted the motivation to graduate. It would be nice if Flagon could
     graduate as ther podling has shown excellent underatanding of the 
Apache
     Way and it's patience to mature as a podling. I will work with the 
Flagon
     PPMC on the next steps as highlightes in the above report.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: Looking at the email discussion I can't see how it was 
blocked,
  a few minor things were raised that were easily fixed. All of the proposed
  PMC members have still not signed up the the private list.

## Hop

Hop is short for the Hop Orchestration Platform. Written completely in Java
it aims to provide a wide range of data orchestration tools, including a
visual development environment, servers, metadata analysis, auditing
services and so on. As a platform, Hop also wants to be a reusable library
so that it can be easily reused by other software.

Hop has been incubating since 2020-09-24.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. identify and resolve the last remaining incompatibly licensed 
  dependencies (if any)
  2. create a first release
  3. grow the community

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  No known significant issues at this moment

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  - 3 additional committers, lots of committer and community activity in 
  the last month
  - 14 new registered chat members (108->122)
  - 1 new subscriber to dev (21->22), 0 to users mailing lists (11)
  - significant follower growth on LinkedIn (309->321), Twitter (233->253) 
  and YouTube (40->50)

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  Two releases candidates (0.50-rc1, 0.50-rc2) were created but failed to 
  get enough positive votes.
  Hop will take the feedback and lessons learned from 0.50-rc1 and 0.50-rc2 
  to build a new 0.60-rc1.
  Summary of the 2 RCs: https://s.apache.org/06hws

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?
  2020-12-2

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  Julian Hyde and François Papon regularly check in and provide valuable 
  input. We're sure our other mentors will step in for RCs after the holiday
  period.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  There are no known brand and naming issues. The PPMC only uses "Apache 
  Hop (Incubating)" as the official project name and has explicitly called
  "Project Hop" deprecated as of the moment of acceptance in the Incubator.

     Comments:  I agree with Julian. The community is great, obviously a 
     lot 
     came from knowledge of the previous life and interest in seeing it 
     progress which is good. The chat vs mailing list stuff is true, I 
     don't 
     follow the chat too much, just lurk but there is a lot going on there, 
     not necessarily decision making but communication that could be missed 
     for 
     those who choose not to use it. Conversely I would say that a lot of 
     the 
     folk on the chat room are users as opposed to developers, and as such 
     don't 
     have to be treated in the same manner. Might be worth checking 
     committers vs 
     chat vs dev list? I suspect its probably pretty much up to date. Great 
     progress on the software front, good to see it coming together.
  - [X] (hop) Julian Hyde  
     Comments: Good report! I'd say you are through 'initial setup' and can 
     uncheck that box next time. The community is going great, and I'm sure 
     that
     the first release will happen very soon. One concern: the difference 
     in the
     number of people on chat vs the dev list (122 vs 22). The traffic on 
     chat
     is benign (e.g. no major decisions being made) but I am concerned that 
     with
     so few of the regulars on the dev list, chat will become the de facto 
     place
     to make decisions. Also I couldn't find a public archive of chat. I'll
     raise this issue on the dev list.
  - [X] (hop) Maximilian Michels  
     Comments: I'm continuing to be amazed by the progress of the Hop 
     project. There is a constant flow of incoming pull requests and the 
     first
     release is nearing completion. It might not be clear to all community
     members but I've tried to only step in when necessary, e.g. give 
     feedback
     to unblock the release process.
  - [X] (hop) Francois Papon  
     Comments: The community is still very active and starting to learn the 
     release process. For now, the only issue in the release is the license 
     part
     and the team is focused on it to prepare a new vote.

--------------------
## Milagro

Milagro is core security infrastructure and crypto libraries for
decentralized networks and distributed systems.

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Continue to build relevant and useful crypto libraries and applications
  for decentralized networks in order to grow the ecosystem of users and
  contributors to the project.
  2. Continue to improve compliance with the Apache Way. In particular to
  update the Milagro website and other project sites (e.g. Whimsy) in
  accordance with Apache policies.
  3. Further releases to increase the scope of the Milagro project, extend
  the capability of existing releases and to demonstrate improved
  compliance with the Apache Way.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No significant issues, however some administrative tasks around the
  project are still outstanding but are being addressed.  In particular,
  a PPMC meeting has been proposed for 3rd February to discuss
  outstanding issue with a follow on meeting for the entire Milagro
  community to discuss the project's roadmap.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  No change.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Work continues on the C and Rust versions of the core cryptographic 
  library
  and on preparing the Multi Party Computation library for its first 
  official
  Apache release.

## MXNet

A Flexible and Efficient Library for Deep Learning

MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Address licensing and trademark issues for the binary releases in the
  community.
     - ONGOING. Close to completion. See update in the next section.
  2. Address release issues, improve automation for license checks, and
  make it easier for auditing. Successfully and smoothly make releases
  without WIP disclaimer.
     - ONGOING.
  3. Improve brand management.
     - ONGOING.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  1. The community is fixing the remaining releases that have license
  issues. See summary below.
  2. MXNet 2.0 first public beta, interoperable with NumPy, is on the way:
     https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/projects/18
     RFC: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16167
  3. The community is including brand usage reviews as part of the
  quarterly report process to proactively manage our brand going forward.

#### Status on license and branding issues

  Most of the issues from last update hinged on the resolution of LEGAL-516.
  We are very glad that LEGAL-516 concluded that ASF projects compiled using
  NVIDIA’s CUDA compiler may be distributed under the Apache License 2.0,
  which unblocks many of the distribution practices that are essential to
  the
  wide adoption of software that utilizes GPU. We would like to thank for
  the
  help, the patience, and the leniency and flexibility that the incubator
  and
  legal granted us, and the numerous helps we received along the way from
  the
  ASF members and our community members from NVIDIA. Especially, I would
  like
  to thank Michael O’Conner and Triston Cao from NVIDIA for pushing this
  through within their organization.

  Based on the conclusion of LEGAL-516, binary distribution of CUDA-compiled
  Apache projects can be properly licensed as ALv2. In addition, the
  branding
  issues from distribution pages from Amazon, NVIDIA, and Intel have all
  been
  acted on. As a result, among the 9 pending issues from last update, 5 can
  be resolved. We are following up on the remaining items to resolve all
  issues in INCUBATOR-253.

  As part of our improvement in brand management, we are including
  third-party brand usage review in our quarterly reports and we will keep
  it
  as part of our regular practice beyond graduation.

  Status on open issues since last update:
  1. Source and convenance binary releases containing Category X licensed
  code. (pending item 5) * Source code releases by the PPMC do not contain
  Category X code.  Takedown and backfill of compliant binary releases by

  correction according to the branding guideline on AWS marketplace that are
  related to AWS Deep Learning Container/DLAMI, and they have all been
  resolved.

  From recent brand usage review for MXNet third-party distributions,
  we found several listings on AWS marketplace that need update. The PPMC
  is reaching out to the publishers of these listings for correction.

--------------------
## NuttX

NuttX is a mature, real-time embedded operating system (RTOS).

NuttX has been incubating since 2019-12-09.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Clear any potential infringing use of the NuttX trademark
  2. Make more releases under Apache
  3. Continue to grow the community with people from different background

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Most communications have moved from old venues to dev@nuttx.apache.org. 

  The dev list contains 210 subscribers, an increase of 6% since our
    previous report, and is the home of all development discussions and  
    user questions.  
  * Github's PRs and Issues also have their own discussions.  
  * We are seeing new contributors to the project through Github.  
  * One new committer has been added since the last report.  

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  * We have made significant steps toward license clearing, needed for  
    graduation: In this quarter, we have secured 34 ICLAs and 7 SGAs,  
    the most of any quarter so far, from past and present contributors.  
  * We have successfully made our third, fourth, and fifth releases  
    under the ASF umbrella: NuttX-10.0 followed by security fix releases  
    NuttX-9.1.1 and NuttX-10.0.1.  
  * Contributions are flowing regularly as PRs in GitHub with occasional  
    patches in the dev list.  
  * Many technical improvements, bug fixes, and new architectures have  
    been collaborated and work continues with an average of 6 and  
    sometimes as many as a dozen pull requests merged per day.  
  * We have listened to the valuable feedback received during our  
    previous releases and continue to improve our documentation. This can  
    be found at https://nuttx.apache.org/docs/latest/.  
  * We've implemented additional automatic checks on PRs.  This has  
    helped us to improve our review process.

## Pegasus

Pegasus is a distributed key-value storage system which is designed to be
simple, horizontally scalable, strongly consistent and high-performance.

Pegasus has been incubating since 2020-06-28.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Attract more contributors and committers.
  2. Make more releases in ASF policy regularly.
  3. Resolve the license problems.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  N/A

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have recently attracted a new contributor empiredan, who have merged 2 
  PRs until now.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We are still actively working towards the next big release, which may be 
  called 2.2.0.
  We have open-sourced 3 subprojects that were temporarily maintained 
  outside the Apache orgnization:

  - https://github.com/pegasus-kv/admin-cli
  - https://github.com/pegasus-kv/pegic
  - https://github.com/pegasus-kv/meta-proxy

  Those are tiny tools but also considered as very important complement to 
  the Pegasus ecosystem.
  `pegic` and `meta-proxy` are still in the initial stage. Developing under 
  the "pegasus-kv" orgnization gets us full control of the Github settings 
so
  that we can move faster.
  `admin-cli` is nearly completed and license-cleared and will soon be 
  migrated to Apache.
  The three projects will all eventually be moved to Apache.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: I like to see some explanation on why the sub-projects
  are being maintained outside of the project. There are branding and
  trademark issues and it may be best to consider moving them in-house.
  Also please list 3 unfinished issues that you still need to do to 
  graduate.

  Justin Mclean: Thanks for the explanation, if might be better if you you 
  worked with Infra on the GitHub settings, developing code outside the
  ASF is likely to cause a number of issues in the future when the code
  is moved.

## TubeMQ

TubeMQ is a distributed messaging queue (MQ) system.

TubeMQ has been incubating since 2019-11-03.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1.Adjust project goal && project name
  2.Keep growing the community, attract more contributors and committers
  3.Release Apache standard releases regularly

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  We hope more IPMCs will pay attention to our project and give more 
  suggestions.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Since the last report, the TubeMQ community has continued to improve its 
  functions
  as well as external publicity and communication; at the same time, we 
  PPMCs conducted
  a discussion on adjusting project objectives and project names.
  We hope to provide a complete one-stop streaming data service platform: 
  the system
  integrates a series of components in the form of plug-ins for collection, 
  aggregation,
  storage and forwarding to build a complete data reporting service; based 
  on this platform,
  users only need to publish and subscribe to data, and they can easily 
  build analysis and
  applications based on streaming data; and TubeMQ will continue to develop 
  in this project.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  At this stage, we released the SDK of the Python language and the 
  tubemq-manager module for
  cluster management. The tubemq-manager module is used for cross-cluster 
  control to make
  the project more usable; we have also made a number of improvements in 
  the function of the project,
  for details information, please refer to our project issues: 
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/TUBEMQ/issues.

## Wayang

Wayang is a cross-platform data processing system that aims at decoupling
the business logic of data analytics applications from concrete data
processing platforms, such as Apache Flink or Apache Spark. Hence, it tames
the complexity that arises from the "Cambrian explosion" of novel data
processing platforms that we currently witness.

Wayang has been incubating since 2020-12-16.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address:

  1. Finishing the Software Grant paperwork
  2. Onboarding of the existing team at Apache 
  3. Getting Wayang setup on Apache infrastructure

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  There are no issues present at the moment

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are in the onboarding process, but got new developer requests which we 
  process when the project is fully onboarded

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We are in process to sort the software grant, getting the team on board and 
  started code rebranding to fit the ASF regulatory framework

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Johan Doornenbal]

## Description:
The mission of Isis is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Isis was founded 2012-10-17 (8 years ago).
There are currently 15 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jörg Rade on 2020-04-12.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jörg Rade on 2020-03-23.

## Project Activity:
There continues to be substantial development work on v2.0, with the
framework being "re-platformed" to run on top of Spring Boot.  

The main focus during the last quarter has been the persistence layer, with the
aim of supporting both JDO and also JPA. This is still ongoing, and has
allowed the existing JDO implementation to be massively simplified.

There has also been work to automatically generate docs from sources [1],
and the demo/tutorial app continues to be extended, now available online [2].

The last release was 2.0.0-M4 on Oct 17 2020.  We hope to finally release 
v2.0 in Q1 this year.

## Community Health:
This is a mature project. The framework is generally stable.  While there is
little activity on the mailing lists, there is general activity on the Slack
channel.

## Project Activity:

The project saw interests on the JMAP protocol, raising discussions on project
mailing list and start being used. JMAP protocol had been used with a tier app
(LTT.RS) proving interoperability. Development efforts are now oriented
 toward JMAP PUSH specifications, enabling efficient mail client
 re-synchronization.

The project saw active contributions around setting up an Apache CI, as well 
as bug-fixes and build stability improvements related to it.

## Community Health:

Linked to the build improvement activities, the number of pull requests had
significantly increased:

 - 32 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (77% increase)

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Ignasi Barrera]

A cloud-agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We have upgraded our Guava and Guice dependencies, addressing several user
issues. However, these changes introduced some incompatibilities in OSGi
environments, and we're looking at addressing those and relaxing the
constraints on the core dependencies of the project to minimize the impact on
the jclouds ecosystem.

We are looking forward to releasing 2.3.0 once the fixes are in place.

== Community ==

There have been contributions from people in the community, especially around
our OSGi integration. This is an ongoing effort mainly driven by a fairly new
contributor that is being really helpful and unblocked several issues that
prevented jclouds from upgrading to newer Java versions. Apart from this, the
overall activity remains low.

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Release 2.3.0 in Q1 2021.

== Releases ==

The last major jclouds release, 2.2.0, took place on 2019-10-21.
The last bugfix release, 2.2.1, took place on 2020-05-14.

on Searches and Workflows' persistence on disk, introduced on 2.11.0.M7.

This release also contained features provided by community members: 
completed translations for french and german, and another patch reworking
a previous fix in one of the plugins bundled with JSPWiki. 

After 2.11.0.M8, activity has been focused on attending several PRs 
created by the dependabot (dependabot configuration was provided by another

where the Docker page got a big rework.

2.11.0 should be the next planned release.

## Community Health:
There's enough project oversight, although project activity is low.

We are looking for some continuity on previously noted contributors, as they 
may end up becoming potential PMC members / committers.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Trevor Grant]

## Description:
The mission of Mahout is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Scalable machine learning library

## Issues:
Nothing requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Mahout was founded 2010-04-20 (11 years ago)
There are currently 28 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Trevor Grant on 2017-02-03.
- No new committers. Last addition was Christofer Dutz on 2020-06-08.

## Project Activity:
Since last board report Trevor Grant has taken over as PMC Chair and initiated
weekly status call meetings, with minutes posted to mahout.apache.org and posted
back to the mailing list. 

Also- the community has taken up an initiative to begin releasing Python 
bindings, and hope to include this in the next release.

## Community Health:

We are MUCH healthier than we have been for some time, due alone to our ability
to execute builds. This isn't really reflected in the statistics, but is a huge
boon for the project.  Secondly, after Trevor Grant took over as project chair
and began hosting weekly meetings this has negatively impacted mailing list 
activity as often interested parties will discuss their plans and get feedback
on a weekly call whose minutes are reported back- however the entire thread is
not archived on the list (decreased mailing list chatter). 

We are starting to see more action in meaningful PRs and large initiatives, 
such as Python bindings, Zeppelin+Mahout Getting Started Docker containers, and
others are of course still discussed on the list as well as at community 
meetings. 

An interesting bit- is that the opened and closed JIRA tickets are greater
than open and closed PRs. This is due to some JIRA pruning and deleting old
spammy JIRA tickets (from over the prior quarter- one of the first topics of
the weekly community call meetings). Issues mailing list was also up due to 
this. 

We have resumed a focus on the hunt to bring in  fresh committers to our 
community and have promising leads from ApacheCon and other sources. We have
also as a project begun to re-envsion ourselves from just anotherML lib to 
distributed statistics, a niche exploitation strategy that we hope will help
us attract more interest. 

In this vein- Apache Mahout was used in an example in a new O'Reilly book and
we hope that will also help us with this rebranding (using DS-SVD to decompose
COVID lung scans).

Finally, after a big push to release, and with holidays and other life events
of some of the main committers, we all just took a breather. And still the 
project has healthy statistics. We look forward to some great progression in 
2021. 

- dev@mahout.apache.org had a 48% decrease in traffic in the past quarter 
(64 emails compared to 123)
- issues@mahout.apache.org had a 76% increase in traffic in the past quarter 
(92 emails compared to 52)
- user@mahout.apache.org had a 70% decrease in traffic in the past quarter 
(4 emails compared to 13)
- 8 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-50% decrease)
- 9 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (125% increase)
- 15 commits in the past quarter (-63% decrease)
- 3 code contributors in the past quarter (-40% decrease)
- 5 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-16% decrease)
- 6 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (100% increase)

## Issues:
Unsure if this is only related to Covid19, but in general most PMC members don't
show involvement on the project. We were already seeing that the 3 required +1
PMC votes for releases were done by alomost the same group of people. We clearly
see a decrease of motivation here.

Partner (free of charge). We've accepted it.

Under normal circumstances, the next release of Maven will be 
4.0.0-alpha-1. We've added a lot of new features that justify a 4
release. Due to changes in the architecture we need a lot of alpha
testers to verify this release.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gordon King]

Description: 

Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable
object-oriented programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. It
comes up with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code complexity,
avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing next generation
computing platforms. Mnemonic makes the storing and transmitting of massive
linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient. The performance tuning could
also be mostly converged to a single point of tuning place if based on
Mnemonic to process and analyze linked objects. The programmer is able to
focus on the durable object oriented business logic instead of worrying about
how to normalize/join, SerDe(un)marshal, cache and store their linked business
objects with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:

Activity: 

In this period of reporting (since Dec. 06, 2020) , 31 of tickets
have been created and 29 resolved, basically, we were working on migrating
Maven build to Gradle for efficiency and flexibility. A new version has been
released. Our community has held several regular meetings every 2 weeks, the
agenda mainly covered the following topics
- Gradle migration
- Preparing new release
- Releasing workflow
- Issues evaluation
- New features and improvement

Health Report: 

Our community and PMCs are working together on Gradle migration
and released a new version of Mnemonic, we are closely tracking the progress
of project and community activities. New PMCs and contributors are actively
contributing and participating in the project. The release plan got closely
tracked and fulfilled, Yanhui and other PMCs contributed lot of efforts on
community growth and project development.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
The mission of NiFi is the creation and maintenance of software related to
providing an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
distribute data.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
Java and C++ implementations.

Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
MiNiFi.

Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
NiFi classloader isolation model.

Apache NiFi Flow Design System is a theme-able set of high quality UI
components and utilities for use across the various Apache NiFi web
applications in order to provide a more consistent user experience.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache NiFi was founded 2015-07-14 (5 years ago)
There are currently 48 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Arpad Boda on 2020-05-24.
- Marton Szasz was added as a committer on 2020-07-13

The PMC is discussion committer and PMC candidates right now. Three
candidates are likely to be voted upon within the coming days and 
the pipeline remains strong.

## Project Activity:
The last release of Apache NiFi was 1.12.1 on Sep 29, 2020.  We're now in the
release candidate creation phase of Apache NiFI 1.13.0 which is a full feature
bearing release including over 200 JIRAs.

With respect to Apache NiFi MiNiFi Java the work is still progressing for
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MINIFI-422 which will merge MiNiFi Java
back into NiFi as a headless form of NiFi supporting both broad use case
patterns well and reduce the release/codebase burden.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi CPP 0.8.0 is still in progress with over 180 JIRAs with the
0.9.0 release already begun as well including nearly 20 JIRAs and an initial
framing of a 1.0 (major) release in progress as well.

## Community Health:
We observed a decline in mailing list activity as well as JIRAs and commits
this quarter but this is largely due to what appeared to be a solid couple of
weeks of limited engagement likely due to the holidays.

However, there are many vibrant and engaging threads related to release
activities or feature work and contribution reviews so health remains quite
strong.

The Apache NiFi slack channel activity continues its impressive growth in
viewership and engagement growing another 200 users in the past quarter which
seems to be consistent.  It does seem like a lot of mailing list activities
have moved there but we still encourage people to take anything lasting or for
which they dont get prompt responses back to the mailing list.

Activity on twitter, stackoverflow, youtube, blogs remains interesting and
much of it happens by people not engaged in the Apache NiFi community at all.

Stale PRs remains an area of concern as we've noted in previous reports though
we are still not specifically addressing that problem.  We've done some
research into how other communities handle it (or dont) but do not yet have a
specific plan.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Carl B. Marcum]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

### History

2012-10-17 - Apache OpenOffice was established as Top Level Project (TLP)
2011-06-13 - OpenOffice.org was accepted as Incubator project in the ASF
             with the new name Apache OpenOffice 

## SUMMARY

Latest Release (4.1.8) was in November 2020. The community activity in general
is on a low but sustainable level. A major obstacle is the complex code and
build system. Therefore it is not easy for new people to gain a foothold into
the code when the first build is hard to be done. There is recent activity to
update the building  guides to make it easier to get builds working.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

No issues

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines:

1) 4.2.0 is the next minor release, planned to be released into a beta phase.
We have missed our goal on going into the beta in 2019. We managed only to
solve the biggest blockers. Currently a new dev test version is released
to be more widely tested. An alpha and/or beta release is planned
for the next quarter.

For that release we are improving the translation process. We are now able to
sync our translation server Pootle with the code.
Together with ASF Infra we were able to set up a new (updated) translate VM.

At the moment we support 65 languages in Pootle. We plan to add some new
languages to the 4.2.0 release.

2) Due to a problem with the recently published macOS version 11 (Big Sur) it
is necessary to fix a bug (cannot open any Microsoft Office .docx, .xlsx,
.pptx document) and therefore to release a new version 4.1.9. This is planned
to be in January.

The motivation in still maintaining the 4.1.x release line is not very high.
Therefore we will shut it down as soon as we have a stable release of 4.2.x.

## LATEST RELEASE HISTORY

2020-11-10 4.1.8
2019-09-21 4.1.7 
2018-11-18 4.1.6 

## COMMITTER & PMC DATA

There are currently 143 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members
  Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N. McKenna (knmc).
  Last PMC member withdrawal was on 2019-Sep-24 Roberto Galoppini (galoppini).

- 1 new committer has been accepted, we welcome Arrigo Marchiori (ardovm)
  Last committer addition was on 2020-12-24 Arrigo Marchiori (ardovm).
  Last committer withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid).

## COMMUNITY HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT

Community overall health is improving. With Arrigo Marchiori a new developer on
the code has been accepted by the community.

With the finished migration we see first steps on website and documentation
updates. The community looks forward into 2021 with a positive spirit.

### FOSDEM 2021 Conference

The conference is online this year and talks are pre-recorded. OpenOffice has 
a developer room and we have had some talks accepted and volunteers are 
preparing them. The scheduled conference dates are February 6th and 7th.

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We have completed the migration from the old Apache CMS to a Jbake site
for "www.openoffice.org". The repository is now in GitBox and GitHub. Jenkins
is used. The Infrastructure team has been very helpful. We have converted
the "openoffice.apache.org" site to use .asf.yaml and Pelican.

Our Windows and Linux build bots are functional again. Work still needs to be
done on the RAT builds.

We are working on a Mac build bot in order to enhance our changes. The machine 
is sponsored by MacStadium.

We have been able to fix a problem with our MWiki wiki.oo.o due to a tag 
extension used to write URLs to our API documentation during the previous
server migration. The issue resulted in hundreds of blank pages throughout the
developer guides. Additional work has been done to update the skin as well.
These customizations have been placed in Git repos now.
We are now planning a new migration of this wiki to a new VM.


### Google Analytics

Apache OpenOffice uses Google Analytics. We are aware this is a controversial
topic within the ASF. Current setup is to collect as few data points as 
possible. We do not use Google Analytics for advertisement. Disclaimers are 
placed.

We use the Data to evaluate the speed we can apply to renew the code and raise 
the minimal requirements of OpenOffice.

The general controversy has reached the project. We are evaluating alternatives
that will meet our requirements. A log file does not meet our requirements, 
since nobody can read statistics from a bare text file.

## MARKETING

Due to corona all live action marketing has been currently postponed.

We have reorganized the flyer activity. Currently we are preparing material for
the next year.

### Facebook

We have one Volunteer representing Apache OpenOffice on Facebook. The activity 
is irregular. Most engagement is helping users with issues. Articles reach 
about 2.2K People.

### Twitter

Our Twitter account is maintained by one person.

## DEVELOPMENT

### Apple Code Signing

We have done one signed test build and the AOO 4.1.8 macOS DMG images are
also signed. However since Apple has changed the standards, users may still
see a Gatekeeper warning (this is due to the AOO 4.1.x builds requiring an
older SDK). Signing is done manually but via scripting and follows Apple's
preferred process:

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow

### Windows Code Signing

We sign all Windows installer beginning with the 4.1.8 release.
There is some discussion to switch from the current Installer to a MSI
installer. But there are technical hurdles to be solved.
Windows code signing is currently a manual process.

### Unmaintained Python 2 code

Python 2 is unmaintained. We have in the development tree the external python3
support. Internal python 3 support is difficult. We are checking alternatives.
Planned for the next major release.

### New ODF Version

Our default file format, the Open Document Format, has received a new Standard
update. We plan to support this format.

Community health remains the same. Still enough oversight on the PMC, but
other than that there is not a lot going on at present. We do not consider
this problematic (as of yet), but would of course love to see new people
getting involved with the project.

## Community Health:
- Adding committers and growing the PMC will remain a focus.
- We need to identify and execute strategies to reach out to likely
  interested users and developers.
- We need to conduct more regular roadmap planning, create and deliver based

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favours convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support patterns and technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made one release in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.5.26 - Bug fix release (2020-12-06)

The last Struts releases besides the core framework were
* Struts Master 14 - Apply Apache Parent POM and plugin upgrades
(2020-02-05)
* Struts Annotations 1.0.7 - Enhancements in preparation for the next
  framework release (2020-02-23)

Within the last quarter we saw increased activity again. This goes both for
development related mailing list traffic and development activity, with 58
opened and 55 closed pull requests in the reporting period compared to 17/18
in the previous quarter. The user mailing stays low on traffic. Users are
seemingly looking for help mostly on Stack Overflow, rather than the project
mailing list.

We released one new security bulletins in the last quarter: [1]
* S2-061 - Forced OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in tag
  attributes, may lead to remote code execution - similar to S2-059.
(CVE-2020-17530) [2]

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Tez Project  [Jonathan Turner Eagles]

## Description:
Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which can be 
used to process arbitrarily complex DAGs of data-processing tasks and also a 
re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can be used by other projects.

## Issues:
Comments clr: Please keep the board informed regarding almost half of the PMC
not being subscribed to the private mail list. It should be easy enough to ask
if these folks really are still interested in providing oversight.
- Sent request to 14 Tez PMC members to understand to understand interest in
  taking active role in providing oversight for the project and to present
  options of signing up to the private list, going emeritus, or resigning.
  Received 4 responses: 1 private list sign-up, 1 emeritus, 2 resignations.
  Leaving 11 PMC unsubscribed to private list. Will follow up again this
  quarter to address remaining 11 accounts.
## Membership Data:
Apache Tez was founded 2014-07-15 (6 years ago)
There are currently 38 committers and 35 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- László Bodor was added to the PMC on 2020-11-23
- No new committers. Last addition was László Bodor on 2020-01-22.

## Project Activity:
New PMC member created release 0.10.0 was released on 2020-10-15. This release
has future jdk release support and works with Apache Hadoop 3+. Ongoing github
integration made great progress, by reaching out to yetus project and receive
patches that will enable full support. Likely this quarter full yetus, github
integration will be working.

## Community Health:
- many github PRs were closed this quarter to prepare for this being a more
  active way to contribute to the project.
-interest from apache nutch led to more user discussion that usual this month.
-holiday vacation led to decreased activity overall on the user lists and
 active jira.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Thrift Project  [Jens Geyer]

## Description:
The mission of Thrift is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Framework for scalable cross-language services development

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Thrift was founded 2010-10-20 (10 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 18 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Duru Can Celasun on 2019-11-11.
- Mario Emmenlauer was added as committer on 2020-12-04

## Project Activity:
 * 0.13.0 was released on 2019-10-16.
 * Still working on release 0.14.0. The initial idea was to have the release
   ready end of 2020. This has not been achieved, but we now push again to
   prepare the planned release to be ready in the next few weeks.

## Community Health:
Despite the numeric decrease in most areas there have been certain valuable
contributions to the code base. We also finally managed to switch the Apache
Thrift web site away from the deprecated CMS, last not least thanks to some
support we got from INFRA. Key bottleneck is still the review pipeline.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Tim Allison]

## Description:
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from, a
growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognized by IANA and other standards bodies.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tika was founded 2010-04-20 (11 years ago)
There are currently 32 committers and 31 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Peter Lee was added to the PMC on 2020-11-24
- Peter Lee was added as committer on 2020-11-25

## Project Activity:
We released 1.25 on 2020-11-40.  This version included numerous dependency
upgrades, a critical license issue with Adobe's xmpcore, and several new
parsers. We are on the cusp of a release of Tika 2.0.0-ALPHA.

On our file corpus development side project, we gathered "stressful"
attachments from 35 parser issue trackers. This includes more than a million
files (551GB).  These are critical for stress testing our own parsers, and
we're making the corpus available to other open source and commercial
projects: https://corpora.tika.apache.org/base/docs/bug_trackers/. See, for
example: https://www.pdfa.org/a-new-stressful-pdf-corpus/ and
https://www.pdfa.org/stressful-pdf-corpus-grows/

## Community Health:
As noted above, we've added Peter Lee as a committer/PMC. A number of our JIRA
and GitHub health metrics were down slightly in the last quarter.  We attribute
this to the holidays/new year. However, we saw an uptick in user@ traffic and
a slight increase in commits.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop released version 3.4.9 during this reporting period. This version
was the largest release of the year in terms of the number of JIRA issues
completed, almost matching the total number closed in all the previous
releases of 2020 combined. Much of this activity was driven by existing
committers who were re-focused on the project in the last quarter of the
year. We'd alluded to this re-focus in our last report, as well as the
notion of new contributors, but new contributor activity trailed off a bit
as we passed through October. Hopefully, some of those folks will return
with the start of this new year.

We've decided to put a stake in the ground for release of 3.5.0, which has
been in development for over a year now, and release it in the March/April
timeframe. While it is not everything we had expected it to be, it does
contain a lot of necessary dependency and runtime upgrades. We will
therefore refer to it as a "heavy maintenance release" and push off some
major features to a future version of 3.6.0.[1]

In our last report, we'd also noted that we had started the process for
bringing gremlint.com[2] into the project as the official Gremlin language
formatter. At this point, the owners of gremlint are still settling
paperwork on their end. The most recent update from the author of gremlint
can be found here[3].

In addition to gremlint, a second code contribution proposal has been made
recently to provide an ANTLR grammar for Gremlin along with related
code[4]. This source code would also go through the IP Clearance process.
This proposal is still in an early stage, but would hopefully be completed
in time for release of 3.5.0.

In the wider TinkerPop ecosystem, we've recognized HugeGraph[5] as a graph
database provider. HugeGraph is high-speed, distributed and scalable OLTP
and OLAP graph database with visualized analytics platform. The addition of
HugeGraph further solidifies TinkerPop and the Gremlin graph query language
as a critical component of the graph processing space, with support for
over two dozen graph systems.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.4.9 (December 7, 2020)

## PMC/Committer:
- Last PMC addition was Jorge Bay-Gondra - October 2018
- Last committer addition was Divij Vaidya - November 2019

- Brian Neradt was added to the PMC on 2020-10-23
- No new committers. Last addition was Brian Neradt on 2020-08-31.

## Project Activity:
We released ATS 9.0.0, our next major release of ATS. We also made two
additional security and bug fix releases for the 7.1.x and 8.1.x branches.

With the 9.0.0 release we are ending support for the 7.1.x branch.  ATS 8.1.x
is now our LTS release branch.

## Community Health:
We held our Fall summit remote in October of last year.  The summit was well
attended and we had people join and present from countries around the world.
Our Spring and Fall summit this year will be remote.

We are continuing to have monthly meetups during the pandemic to help keep the
community socializing and communicating about current projects and corrdinate
releases.

In general statistics for the mailing lists and GitHub are down last quarter
and this is normal for the time of year.  The activity on GitHub and the
mailing lists should increase this quarter.

## Description:

Apache TVM’s extensible full-stack framework enables deep learning
applications to efficiently deploy across an array of hardware modules,
platforms, and systems,  including mobile phones, wearables,  specialized
chips, and embedded devices.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache TVM was founded 2020-11-17 (2 months ago)
There are currently 38 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:2.

Community changes, past month:
- The community is discussing and voting new PMC members.
- Chenfan was added as committer on 2020-12-18

## Project Activity:

Software development activity:
- We land the first complete version of the automatic scheduling code
  generation.
- The community has been working on improving the robustness of the 
  internals (better logging and error messaging). 
- Improvements to uTVM (micro-controller compilation support).
- Last project release was v0.7.0 (2020-10-02), the community is working 
  hard to push for the v0.8 release cycle.
 
Meetups and Conferences:
 - Annual developer conference(see the community health)

## Community Health:

Overall community health is good. The amount of PRs drop to 100 (was 150) 
monthly. But this is expected due to the holiday season. Followed by a 
successful announcement of the TLP. The community successfully held a three 
day virtual developer conference (https://tvmconf.org/) on Dec 2-4. Nearly 
1000 people registered.

The conference attracted talks from major industry users, such as AMD, ARM, AWS,
Qualcomm, OctoML, Xilinx, Alibaba, Huawei, and academic contributors from UW,
UC Berkeley, Cornell, UCLA, Beihang University. During the conference, 
the community celebrated the apache way and talked 
about their applications and contributions to the Apache TVM.

Attachment BZ: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Web Services was founded 2003-01-22 (18 years ago)
There are currently 223 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2016-05-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2014-09-14.

## Project Activity:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required. However, user
questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed, and there are at
least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project can continue to
produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer
considered state of the art, we don't expect a major uptick in new development
efforts, new committers, etc...

There was very little work done this quarter.   There were a few fixes
in wss4j that we released as they were needed for CXF.   There was also
a bunch of activity in Axiom to upgrade to newer versions of various 
dependencies as well as be able to build/test with Java 11+.

Past Releases:
WSS4J-2.3.1: 2020-12-15
WSS4J-2.2.6: 2020-12-15
XmlSchema-2.2.5: 2020-01
Neethi-3.1.1: 2018-01
Axiom-1.2.21: 2018-11
Woden-1.0M10: 2015-09


## Community Health:
As mentioned, SOAP/WebServices is not considered state-of-the-art anymore and
we are getting very little contribution from anyone other than the 2 or 3
regulars" that are driving features and changes needed for CXF (which is
being driven by their employers).   Thus, we are not seeing any possibilities
for future new committers or PMC members.  However, there are plenty of
people around that can do releases and answer questions and respond to
security issues.  It's a mature project.
