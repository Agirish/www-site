 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Board Chair [Roy]

       I am happy to report that the Annual Members Meeting took place on
       schedule, 9-11 March, without a hitch. My thanks to Daniel Gruno for
       organizing the voting process using Apache STeVe, our vote monitors for
       their oversight, and to all of our officers and members for showing up
       on time (in person or by proxy) so that we could finish in 40 minutes.

       Thanks also to our outgoing directors Shane Curcuru, Niclas Hedhman,
       and Patricia Shanahan for their effectiveness over the past year in
       helping the ASF get through crazy times.

       Congratulations to our new directors, Sharan Foga and Sheng Wu,
       and also to our returning director Roman Shaposhnik. I am looking
       forward to the new perspectives you will bring to our deliberations.

       As mentioned previously, this will be my final meeting as Board Chair.
       I have to say that this is "just in time", since the combination of
       dealing with repercussions from the last board meeting while organizing
       a members meeting immediately followed by the first board meeting are
       just a little too much for me to handle. I am exhausted. I suggest
       that next year's annual meeting be planned for 1-3 March instead,
       just to give the new Board two weeks (instead of one) to get started.

    B. President [David]

       Most of my work this month has been spent with the budget. While it's
       not 100% final, it's in relatively good shape and hence I've added a
       discussion item to the agenda.

       I've received and dealt with some regulatory matters for the state of
       Tennessee and the City of Wilmington.

       In addition, I've spent some time with Ruth Suehle around division of
       our labor and strategic items we want to tackle for the coming fiscal
       year.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 8.


    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Shift to accrual accounting

       We are preparing for a change to accrual accounting at the beginning
       of the new fiscal year on May 1st.  IgniteSpot has combed our books
       for any problematic entries, and over the course of several meetings
       we have discussed how to handle various cases.  In general we expect
       this to produce budgets and reports that are more intuitive for
       officers and board members to read.  The price of this is that the
       accounting effort to generate those reports will increase in some
       cases.  The good news is that because of our shift to bill.com, most
       of the information necessary to make that transition is already
       available and extracted for accounting purposes.

       Advising VP Data Privacy

       VP Data Privacy is putting together a list of external services
       consumed, and Treasury is assisting.

       Reporting and Budget preparation

       We continue to work with the president and the officers to prepare the
       budget for the coming year.  In particular, in preparation for a
       switch to accrual accounting, we are meeting with officers
       individually to give them an opportunity to ask questions and discuss
       how this impacts their budgeting areas.

       We also prepared the quarterly and the yearly member’s meeting report
       this last month.

       Tax filings

       Our 990 is now complete and submitted.

       Transition to TDBank

       TDBank now has all of the paperwork necessary to implement Treasury
       services.  By their predictions, that should be completed within the
       next week.  Once Treasury services are implemented, we can start
       shifting accounts receivable to TDBank.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In February, the secretary received 56 ICLAs, 3 CCLAs, and 3 software
       grants. We continue working with VP, Privacy, to plan out privacy
       policies related to document handling.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ruth]

       We're on track to have a semi-dual ApacheCon virtual ApacheCon event,
       with one in August for Asia time zones and one in September for North
       America/Europe time zones. Sponsors will have the option to sponsor
       only one or to create a custom sponsorship package of both at a
       discount. We already have some significant interest in each. For more
       ApacheCon details, see VP Conferences report.

       Does this time (20:00 UTC) work for everybody going forward?  Should
       the time be adjusted to match the daylight savings time for a
       geographic region? Should we rotate times so that everybody can share

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Mark Thomas]

Covering the period February 2021

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.


* OPERATIONS

Responded to the following queries, liaising with projects as required:
- one request for logo usage on t-shirts
- one copyright permission request to use material from STRUTS for a book was
  directed to the ALv2
- approved event requests for IGNITE and PULSAR
- approved name searches for RATIS, EVENTMESH and INLONG
- provided advice to PHOENIX on options for hosting tech talks
- one request to use project logos on an external website


* REGISTRATIONS

Work with counsel and APISIX PMC to progress transfer of APISIX registrations
in China to the ASF.

Continued to work with counsel to complete the change of registered address
for our registrations. Some of these are on hold as they require notarized
paperwork. I expect to be in a position to obtain that in the next few months.

Counsel has identified a mechanism that will allow us to proceed with the
application to register APACHE in China without requiring paperwork signed by
all 9 directors, notarized and then legalized.


* INFRINGEMENTS

Provided advice to KAFKA regarding a potential infringement.

With help from Willem Jiang and Sheng Wu, had a domain registration in China
that was using a domain based on one of our marks to host pornography removed.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

1) ASF Sponsors: we are working on $237K in renewals (one Platinum, two Gold,
and two Bronze Sponsors), $56K of which is remaining in renewals for FY2021.
We signed on three new Sponsors (one Gold and two Bronze), are discussing
Sponsorship with two candidate organizations, and have $287K invoiced
outstanding (new Sponsorships or confirmed renewals from one Platinum, three

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi is successfully advancing
day-to-day activities within ASF Fundraising as we are nearing the end of the
Fiscal Year. The Q3 FY2021 operations summary is on hold pending a few delayed
reports. We have been actively supporting corporate producers of Apache
project events, and coordinating with ASF Brand Management on event
positioning and promotion where needed. We have begun to promote the CFP for
ApacheCon@Home.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
There is nothing to highlight beyond the budget that Infra has
submitted to the President/Operations.

Finances
========
Infra has submitted a draft budget to the President for presentation
at the March meeting of the Board.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Complete transition to new Puppet setup

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Finish our hermes mail system migration

General Activity
================
- Constructed new Puppet system in EC2, across several machines, to
  improve responsiveness and speed
- Moving from Bintray to an Artifactory instance, sponsored by JFrog
- New service for simple exec when a commit happens
- Refinement of red/orange/yellow status issues, with related paging
- Work on meet.a.o for our communities to conduct meetups.
- Infra contributed support for the Annual Members Meeting
- Doc updates across infra.a.o
- Lots of "aardvark" work. This is a honeypot to capture spammers and
  subsequently lock them out of our systems.
- Initial work on selfserve for mailing list moderator changes


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

On Monday, March 8th, we announced[conf1] the Call for Presentations for the
upcoming ApacheCon @Home 2021. We expect to have registration live by
the end of the month, and sponsorship opportunities available by next
week. The website is also live[conf2].

Rather than trying to service all time zones, like last year, this
time we will be running to events - one focused on
Europe/Africa/America time zones, and the other on Asia/Oceania time
zones. We expect to announce the Asia-centric (ie, timezones) event before 
the next board meeting.

We have volunteers to run 20 tracks for the EU/AM event:

API & Microservice
Big Data
Cassandra
Community
Content Delivery
Content Management
Drill
Fineract & Fintech
Geospatial
Groovy
Incubating
Integration
IoT
Karaf
Observability
RDF and Linked Data
Royale
Search
Social Data
Tomcat

This event will, of course, once again be online, like last year.

Anyone wishing to participate in the planning of this event, or
volunteer for any event duties, is requested to subscribe to the
planners@apachecon.com mailing list and introduce themselves there.

We are still operating under the expectation that there will be no
ASF-approved in-person events in 2021. We will continue to revisit
this situation over the coming months as the pandemic situation
continues to evolve, and international travel restrictions change.

Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

We recently started spending more time on stalled issues to get them
moving again, and this has led to a some of the old issues being
completed. Unfortunately we also have had to escalate issues to a
handful of unresponsive PMCs, both directly and by using board
roll-calls. Some of this escalation has worked, but we continue to
stay on top of the rest until resolution.

Stats for Feb 2021:

     25        [license confusion]
     32        [support request/question not security notification]

Security reports: 46 (last months: 46, 45, 45)

     10        [site]
      7	       [druid]

               [shardingsphere], [struts], [tapestry], [tika], [tomcat],
               [trafficserver], [unomi]

     In total, as of 1st Mar 2021, we're tracking 76 (last month:
     67) open issues across 44 projects, median age 62 (last month:
     61) days.  48 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     10 (last month: 9) of these issues, across 8 projects, are older
     than 365 days.

  were released on 2021-02-08 and again on 2021-03-08.
- Backport Provider Packages (the same code as the normal provider packages,
  but compatible with 1.10.x series) were released on 2021-02-10 and again on
  2021-03-08

### CVEs published

Airflow published four CVEs this past quarter:

- CVE-2020-17513: Apache Airflow Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Charts
  & Query View
- CVE-2021-26697: Apache Airflow: Lineage API endpoint for Experimental API

  text
- CVE-2020-17515: Apache Airflow Reflected XSS via Origin Parameter

### Events:

- “Airflow Virtual Meetup” was organized on 2021-01-28
- “Bangalore Airflow Virtual Meetup” was organized on 2021-02-12
- Airflow Virtual meet-up will be held on 2021-04-08
- We are working on organizing a virtual Airflow Summit 2021 conference which
  will be held on May 20-28 2021. The call for papers is already open and
  will close on April 12.

## Community Health:

Despite the decrease in activity we are pretty healthy.

- We created a community-managed Airflow publication on medium.com and dev.to
  to gather Airflow-related blog posts under one umbrella to promote the
  project.

- We have two recurring community calls organized every fortnight:
    - Airflow Dev Call
    - Airflow Issue Triage process

- Apache Airflow project started using Github Discussions and we observed a
  constant flow of users' questions.

- We are also releasing a “Airflow Newsletter” to dev@airflow once a month.

- We conducted a community survey among Airflow users and the results are
  here: http://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-survey-2020/

- In Q4 2020, there was a very large effort to make major upgrades in
  preparation for 2.0. This effort, while necessary, was also an
  unsustainable effort (lots of nights and weekends from committers/PMC
  members). Since 2.0 is now released, it is both reasonable and healthy for
  there to be a drop in the commit and PR pace (48% decrease in commits vs
  the previous quarter). However overal commits are still continuing at a
  healthy pace - 1535 commits form 199 contributors in in Q1

- We have seen a slight decrease in issues being opened (543, down 16%)
  possibly as a result of enabling GitHub Discussions, meaning users have an
  alternative means of asking for help rather than opening GitHub issues or
  posting on the lists.

have been addressed for the 2.5 development drive so a 2.5 release 
candidate could easily be produced.

## Community Health:
Community health is quiet but nominal. We will most likely submit
a presentation to the RDF / Linked data session @ApacheCon.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Axis was created on 2001-01-19 (20 years ago).

There are currently 63 committers and 62 PMC members in this project, a vote
in 2010 made all committers automatically PMC members. One PMC member
resigned.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - Currently 62 PMC/ 63 Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## Health report:
This was a good quarter for Axis2 as our project's most prolific PMC member by
commits, Andreas Veithen, became more active in the project once again and
helped greatly by settting up GitHub Dependabot and fixed some issues with our
recent dependancy upgrades.

Also fixed this past quarter is JDK 11 compliation support and beyond by
removing some features such as XDoclet that are no longer available in later
JDK's.

The project lacks committer growth because most of our users are using Axis2
for SOAP. We remain hopeful that as JSON and REST become more popular, Axis2
can transistion to that user base.

Concerning JSON, our implementation is based on GSON though the newer
alternative Moshi is likely to be contributed for JSON support since our day
jobs are rapidly moving to Moshi.

We have started a thread on the dev mailing list concerning the outstanding
reamining items that need to be resolved for the next Axis2 release.

Axis2 C PMC member Bill Blough activity includes "working on Axis2 C last
quarter for my employer (mostly rampart related), but I still need to clean up
and merge the changes into the repo. "

## Axis2 java Jira issues opened in the last 90 days: 2

## Axis2 java Jira issues closed in the last 90 days: 16

- We released Camel 3.7.0 on 2020-12-16.
- We released Camel 3.4.5 on 2020-12-23.
- We released Camel 2.25.3 on 2020-12-24.
- The Camel 3.7.x releases are part of the second LTS for Camel 3. We are
  planning to support 3.7.x for one year. The release 3.7.3 for 3.7.x LTS is
  on vote at the time of writing this report.
- We are already working on 3.9.0 release: this release will be the prelude of
  the first LTS release of 2021, 3.10.0.
- We released Camel-K 1.3.0 on 2020-12-22
- We released Camel-K 1.3.1 in 2021-02-01
- We are improving the Camel-K experience and we introduce the Kamelet
  concept, while pushing the project ahead, by aligning to the Camel main
  releases.
- We are continuing supporting Camel-Quarkus by releasing 3 versions this
  quarter
- We released camel-quarkus-1.7.0 on 2021-02-22
- We released camel-quarkus-1.6.0 on 2021-01-18.
- We released camel-quarkus-1.5.0 on 2020-12-18.
- We are continuing working on the Camel-kafka-connector project and we
  released four versions of it
  - 0.7.0 on 21 Dec 2020
  - 0.7.1 on 24 Jan 2021
  - 0.7.2 on 14 Feb 2021
  - 0.8.0 on 23 Feb 2021
  - The 0.7.x releases are based on the second LTS of main Camel, 3.7.x
  - At the time of writing this report, we are preparing to release 0.7.3,
    based on Camel 3.7.3

## Community Health:
- dev@camel.apache.org had a 39% increase in traffic in the past quarter (468
  emails compared to 336): This increase is related to some technical
  discussion around what to do with some new ideas into the Camel project.
  Also we started to have feedback from people using the second LTS releases
  of Camel 3.
- issues@camel.apache.org had a 3% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (2300 emails compared to 2358): Here we are more or less at the same level
   of last report. We are creating new issues for the third LTS release, but
   we are also starting to see issues for 3.7.x. So the situation is stable.
- users@camel.apache.org had a 13% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (346 emails compared to 306): the increase is related to people switching
   from Camel 2 to Camel 3, since we are already at the second LTS, so we are
   looking at discussions about this and also issues with Camel 3.
- 387 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-4% decrease) and 356 issues closed
  in JIRA, past quarter (-2% decrease): as reporte above, the situation is
  stable. We are facing issues and improvements for 3.10, but also starting to
  see new issues for Camel 3 and the 3.7.x LTS releases. The activity related
  to Camel 2 is near to zero, even though we are still see people asking for
  issues.
- 4974 commits in the past quarter (6% increase) and 117 code contributors in
  the past quarter (-23% decrease): the core work of Camel 3 is more or less
  done by the same number of contributors, the fact is the past we had some
  contributions related to documentation and website. In this quarter we were
  much more stable in this area.
- 1284 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-13% decrease) and 1276 PRs closed
  on GitHub, past quarter (-13% decrease): some of the PRs in the past quarter
  were coming from bot and gh action, with the new security policies adopted
  some of this work needs to be done by hands.
- 332 issues opened on GitHub, past quarter (-1% decrease) and 270 issues
  closed on GitHub, past quarter (-15% decrease): the number of issues is the
  same but we closed less backlog issues this quarter.

database mapping/modeling/development tool.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data

Apache Cayenne was founded 2006-12-19 (14 years ago).
There are currently 23 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Nikita Timofeev on 2017-06-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Arseni Bulatski on 2018-12-10.

## Project Activity

Development is focused on Cayenne 4.2.  Prior versions are
maintenance-only.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

## Description:
Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the
CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in
Java, Python, PHP, .NET, Objective-C, and JavaScript (and possibly other
languages).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Chemistry was founded 2011-02-16 (10 years ago)
There are currently 38 committers and 36 PMC members in this project.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Laurent Mignon on 2017-09-23.
- No new committers. Last addition was Laurent Mignon on 2017-09-20.

## Project Activity:
There was no activity in the last three months.
Last releases were in 2017.

## Community Health:
We have a mature code base. No major development is expected.
Because there hasn't been much activity in the last three years, we
consider moving the project to the attic after a final OpenCMIS release.
A few fixes and dependency updates have been accumulated over the years
and users have asked for official release of those.
So far, nobody volunteered to cut the release, though and therefore
there is no movement.

to reflect latest releases of all modules.

## Community Health:
At the moment, there is no improvement with respect to community health.
We hope this will change after GSoC 2021 participation.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Jesse MacFadyen]



## Status report for the Apache Cordova project - March 2021

## Description:
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
   JavaScript.

## Activity
Recent work has been around keeping up with recent changes to iOS and Android,
our most used platforms.  We continue to work towards reducing technical debt,
and 'running the business' We are finalizing a list of test devices to be used
by active committers, and the possibility of either MacInTheCloud, or Amazon
EC2 Mac Instances so we can support Apple's M1 hardware.

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Health report:

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green -
failures are usually due to external service issues that do device testing.
Our nightly builds have been extremely stable.

ASF Project Statistics gives the project a Community Health Score (Chi): 4.7
(Healthy)

We are still only seeing contributions from a small group of dedicated
individuals. This makes it harder to make large changes. All the large
corporate sponsored development has ceased, but the project continues to see
good traffic, and usage has been stable.

The cordova-cli, the base tool used for creating/building/running gets 125k
downloads a week on npm, and has been consistent for the last year.  Various
core plugins see usage in the 50-80k/wk range.

Our primary channel for helping, and hearing from users is via our #slack
community, which has ~4k users and continues to be fairly active.  There has
been some interest in also exploring github discussions.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Curator Project  [Enrico Olivelli]

## Description:
The mission of Curator is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Java libraries that make using Apache ZooKeeper easier

## Issues:
No critical issues. But we are lacking of continuative contributions from non
committers. We started a discussion about how to engage more with the
community in order to have candidates to invite, but actually we are not
making process in this direction.

## Membership Data:
Apache Curator was founded 2013-09-18 (7 years ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new committers. Last addition was Zili Chen on 2020-08-06.

## Project Activity:

Recent releases:
5.1.0 was released on 2020-07-03.
Apache Curator 5.0.0 was released on 2020-05-28.
Apache Curator 4.3.0 was released on 2020-02-29.ta here]

## Community Health:
The project is healthy, there is not much activity, this is probably due to
the current stability of our codebase and to the fact that we are mostly bound
to the pace of releases and new features of Apache ZooKeeper.

We recently added a new high level feature from a new contributor and we are
planning to cut a new major release soon, but probably this will be happen
right after the next major release of ZooKeeper (that is under VOTE during
these days).

We see good discussions on the ML and on JIRA.

Relevant stats:
- 5 commits in the past quarter (66% increase)
- 4 code contributors in the past quarter (33% increase)
- dev@curator.apache.org had a 155% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (174 emails compared to 68)
- user@curator.apache.org had a 100% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (0 emails compared to 14)

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Daffodil Project  [Mike Beckerle]

## Description:
Apache Daffodil implements the Data Format Description Language (DFDL) for
parsing (and unparsing) rich structured binary and text data described using
DFDL schemas.
## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention. 

## Membership Data:
Apache Daffodil was founded 2021-02-16 (16 days ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Olabusayo Kilo added to PMC - as part of graduation process
- No new committers were added, though one PPMC member decided
  to just be a committer going forward as TLP for now.  
  This also happened as part of the graduation process. 

## Project Activity:
This is our first board report after graduation from incubator.
- Last prior release was Daffodil 3.0.0 (incubator) released Nov 2020. 
- We are still working on the first TLP release which will be Daffodil 3.1.0,
  but we are a few weeks from where we can start that process.
- We had a good press release and activity around the graduation to TLP. (Many
  thanks to Sally K. for leading us through this. We actually got complements
  like "what a great press release". and people were happy we delayed things a
  couple days to get their statements included.)


## Community Health:
The project hasn't slowed down in the past quarter (part of which was while we
were still incubating). Many new features and contributions from across our
developers.

User list traffic is sparse, but not abnormally so. We have users who even
agreed to be listed on the press release as Daffodil users (I speak of
Perspecta Labs), but who have created zero traffic on users@daffodil mailing
list. It seems this means some users are successful with daffodil without need
of support which is encouraging with respect to software quality.
(That said, we will prod them to particpate in the users list.)

We continue to need to attract new developers and users for Apache Daffodil.
Being a TLP will help this.

 Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
 your CDI enabled projects.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 We created a new release and did some maintenance on existing features.
 There also have been some security enhancements.

## Health report:
 As explained before, we focus on stability, so we don't see tons of big changes.
 We had quite some contributions when we thought about shipping a new release.
 Plus we also had no issue with getting the votes done. So all fine.

## Releases:
 - 1.9.5 was released on 2021-03-10.
 - 1.9.4 was released on 2020-06-12.
 - 1.9.3 was released on 2020-02-05.

## Project Activity:
- The last version was released on 6th Feb.
- We are working on the next version 5.1.0 which will start testing from
31th March.

## Community Health:
We see more contributors to the project and the issues opened and closed
are both increasing. This is probably caused by our new major version 
release. We see some of the new contributors are encouraged by our current 
committers to start contributing with minor changes to the project. This
is a good thing to see and we plan to attract more people to contribute.

- No new committers. Last addition was Greg Dove on 2016-09-07.

## Project Activity:
Flash has been blocked by Adobe since January 2021 and is therefore no longer
available within the browser. The only remaining supported runtime is AIR,
maintained by Harman. No changes have been made to the Flex framework for a long
time and it is unlikely that another release will appear.

## Community Health:
Even the daily mailing list activity is decreasing,
users still come back when issues needs to be resolved.

Apache Flink is a distributed system for unified batch- and streaming data
processing. Flink consists of a scalable high-performance runtime and
many APIs and libraries, including SQL, functional DSLs in Java, Scala,
Python, and the Stateful Functions library for event-driven applications.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam, Kafka, Pulsar,
Hadoop, HBase, Cassandra, Calcite, Iceberg, Hudi, and various others.

## Issues:
 - There are currently no community issues that require board attention.

There are currently 71 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.

## Releases

The following releases were made since the last board report:

 - Flink 1.12.2 was released on 2021-03-05.
 - Flink 1.12.1 was released on 2021-01-19.
 - Flink 1.11.3 was released on 2020-12-17.
 - Flink 1.10.3 was released on 2021-01-29.

 - Flink Stateful Functions 2.2.2 was released on 2021-01-02.

## Project Activity:

  - The community is approaching the Flink 1.13.0 release, which introduces
    new features like reactive scaling, various improvements for K8s
    deployment, SQL semantics, unaligned checkpoints, and savepoints.

  - In the meantime the community has released a set of bugfix releases, also
    for older Flink versions to address two reported CVEs.

  - The Stateful Functions project is approaching the 3.0 release, which is
    putting the focus onto remote functions, a new type system, and extending
    the set of SDKs (currently Java and Python).

  - The project is discussing how to handle confusion with users about Flink
    supporting code execution. Distributed code execution (over data streams)
    is what Flink is meant to be, however we repeatedly see some users
    confused about whether this is a vulnerability.

## Community Health:

The activity on mailing lists and JIRA remains high, but slightly lower in
this quarter (which contained the Christmas Holiday and Luna New Year seasons)
compared to the previous quarter.

  - user@f.a.o is at 2219 mails/quarter
  - user-zh@f.a.o is at 2130 mails/quarter
  - dev@f.a.o is at 2420 mails/quarter

  - 1114 JIRA tickets created
  -  787 JIRA tickets closed
  -  839 PRs opened
  -  779 PRs closed

  - The community created around 15 new major feature proposals
    (FLIPs = Flink Improvement Proposals)

holiday season and the release of 1.3.0.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

## Description:

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server. Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems. The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well as
non-ASF projects and their dependencies. It started in the Java part
of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
OpenSSL.

## Summary

Nothing has really changed over the past three months and we honestly
do not anticipate changes in the foreseeable future.

The Tomcat community is the only one still using Gump actively and the
only activity in Gump is around keeping the infrastructure alive and
tweaking things for the benefit of Tomcat builds.

We will certainly support any other project that wants to get the
benefit of the early warning system for backwards incompatible changes
Gump provides, but we are not actively recruiting projects.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Project Activity

The migration to a new VM is complete by now, but we still need to
update a bit of information at gump.apache.org to reflect this.

## Releases

Gump has never done any releases. One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

## Membership Data:

Apache Gump was founded 2004-02-18 (17 years ago) There are currently
16 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.  The
Committer-to-PMC ratio is 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mark Thomas on 2014-12-03.
- No new committers. Last addition was Konstantin Kolinko on 2015-02-11.

~15% indicating increased dev activity this quarter. Also, with 72 code
contributors this quarter that number increased by ~28%. Overall, community is
very healthy.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Hudi Project  [Vinoth Chandar]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Hudi is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to providing atomic upserts and incremental data streams on Big Data

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Hudi was founded 2020-05-19 (10 months ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Sivabalan Narayanan on 2020-10-07.
- Li Way was added as committer on 2021-01-26
- Xianghu Wang was added as committer on 2021-02-02
- Wenning Ding was added as committer on 2021-02-17

## Project Activity:
We released a very significant 0.7.0 version, with flink support and foundations
for supporting different types of table metadata. We also take pride in calling
out that fully managed data clustering is available in Hudi, as a first of
its kind in open source big data management. We have also made several bug fixes
and improvements. We are preparing for 0.8.0 release soon, that vastly 
improves Flink integration and also provides different multi-writer 
concurrency modes. 

Community members gave presentations at Uber organized meetup, that had over 
~250 signups. Engineers from Uber, also shared content from a engineering wide
learning series, with rest of community. We added few more names to our 
powered by list.

## Community Health:
As evidenced by the metrics, there was significant uptick in activity leading 
upto the 0.7.0 release and beyond. We had noted that the PMC/Committers were 
working on process/code abstractions to help improve the velocity of the
community. Some of those efforts bore fruits, by way of organizing/streamlining
work in umbrella JIRAs etc.

Going forward, the challenge we need to tackle is scaling code reviews. We also
faced significant issues with travis CI during our release (seems to have
 recovered since). We are exploring azure CI which provides unlimited minutes
(similar to Flink's setup), and investing with more regression/stress 
tests to gain much higher confidence for landing PRs.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Iceberg Project  [Ryan Blue]

## Description:
Apache Iceberg is a table format for huge analytic datasets that is designed

- Peter Vary was added as committer on 2021-01-23

## Project Activity:
0.11.0 was released on 2021-01-26 and included several important new features:
* Support for partition evolution
* Spark SQL extensions with support for MERGE INTO, DELETE FROM, and new DDL
* Spark support for table maintenance through stored procedures
* Streaming reads, filter pushdown, and experimental CDC writes in Flink
* AWS module with better integration for S3 and Glue metastore
* Nessie metastore module

The community is working toward finalizing the v2 format spec and the next
release. There is good progress on metrics collection for Avro data files,
Hive integration, Spark UPDATE support, and more table maintenance actions.

## Community Health:
The overall number of pull requests merged in the last quarter decreased from
the previous quarter, but this is mostly due to annual holidays. Leading up to
the release in January, the project set a new record at 78 PRs merged in a week.
More importantly, although there was a decrease in PRs merged, the number of
contributors still increased slightly, to 50 code contributors in the quarter.
Peter Vary was also added as a committer in January.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for March 2021

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 37 podlings incubating. In February, podlings executed 
5 distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members, and none retired. There 
was one IP clearance in February, and there was one new podling, EventMesh. 
Ratis and Daffodil graduated last month.

This month we were missing reports from Hivemall, Livy, PageSpeed, Spot, 
Toree, Weex. Toree has missed more than one report in a row, and the IPMC 
will take a roll call. NLPCraft will be asked to report again due to a 
minimal report. SAMOA has been retired and Weex will be retired shortly. 
Livy failed to report despite a recent roll call that received 3 PPMC 
member reponses. Currently, Marvin-AI does not have signoff by 
mentors and will also be asked to report next month if they don't get 
signoff.

A vote to remove BlueMarlin from the Incubator was taken. This caused some 
action on the project's part, and they have moved communication to the dev 
list and the code to the ASF repository. Currently, they will be allowed to 
continue in the Incubator.

MXNet still has several trademark and branding issues that need to be 
resolved. MXNet is having trouble getting its mentors or IPMC members to 
vote on its releases. This is possible due to continuing issues and 
bandwidth required when dealing with this project.

A new proposal LXDB is under discussion.

Some retired podlings need some cleanup and be correctly retired, so the 
public is aware of this. Some of the old release directories were removed.

Most discussions on the mailing list were around releases, new project 
proposal, graduations and finding new mentors.

  2. trademark (re)search
  3. [HOP-2469](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HOP-2469): Ensure 
  that Hop complies with ASF encryption policy

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Community and interactivity on social media continues to grow (LinkedIn: 
  400+, Twitter: 325+, Youtube: 80).
  We're actively engaging in discussions on the dev mailing lists. There's 
  still some room for improvement, but we're convinced this will grow over 
  time and as the community continues to grow.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  0.60 was released as source only. This allowed/forced us to tackle the 
  most pressing licensing issues.
  We're working towards the 0.70 release. Since this release will include 
  binaries, we're cleaning up any remaining license issues with dependencies 
  and the notice, license and other files.
  Development continues at a fast pace. We're starting to see a steady 
  stream of contributions from a variety of community members.

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?
  November 2020

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  We've been able to get all the help and answers we needed. Julian Hyde 
  has been especially helpful since the start of the incubation process by 
  pointing out risks, providing guidance in adopting "The Apache Way" and 
  being an overall great support to the Hop team.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  The "Apache Hop" brand name seems to be used correctly, we are not aware 
  of any violations. Third parties may not always use the "(Incubating)" 
  suffix sufficiently, but since this is mentioned extensively in our own 
  communication, website and social media accounts, we consider this to be a 
  minor issue.
  Trademark search still needs to be done, but is high on the PPMC's 
  priority list.

     Comments:  Hop are doing great. After some prodding from
        the mentors, they have moved discussions away from
        chat and onto the dev list. They flag themselves as
        "nearing graduation" and I concur.
        Note that we need some help from Justin to register
        the project's use of encryption.

     Comments:  The project is doing well. More and more blockers 
                for graudation got resolved, e.g. licensing headers 
                and the first release. Let's keep up the good work!

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Dave Fisher: Its great to see an active and engaging community on the dev 
  list.
  I think that the PPMC does need to grow in numbers some prior to 
  graduation.

     a migration from an 
     alternative mailing list software. Our small community size means 
     responding to specific
     requests can take time so building community numbers is still 
     important. Getting another
     committer on board could really help.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## Wayang

Wayang is a cross-platform data processing system that aims at decoupling
the business logic of data analytics applications from concrete data
processing platforms, such as Apache Flink or Apache Spark. Hence, it tames
the complexity that arises from the "Cambrian explosion" of novel data
processing platforms that we currently witness.

Wayang has been incubating since 2020-12-16.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Educate the new PPMCs to be able to do Apache releases
  2. Do our first Apache release
  3. Grow the community 

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Until the moment of this report it was created and didn't have any issue, 
  because all the important issues got solved.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  In the last month the community did a meeting where they created the most 
  important point to be focused on. The main focus points are the creation of 
  a Python API, SQL API and maintenance on the Core to be enabled to support 
  the new API's. The protocol of that meeting can be found it on dev@ list

  Additional to that the community is searching for more developers that 
  can be part of it.

  Also during the last month the issue with the software grant got solved 
  and we are waiting for the document to get signed.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has moved the codebase to Apache's Git repos as well as 
  successfully setup the CI jobs. Also the Website is now up and running.

  The team is finishing the process of renaming the project from Rheem to 
  Wayang, and is important to review that everything is placed in the right 
  spot.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache IoTDB Project  [Xiangdong Huang]

## Description:
The mission of Apache IoTDB is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to an IoT native database with high performance for data 
management and analysis

## Issues:

In our last report, the Board leaves comments:

jm: Please make sure if you have meetings that the what is discussed
      is brought back to the mailing list so the whole community can
      be involved.

Reply:
The discussion is recorded on Confluence [1] and some notifications [2]
on the mailing list.

[1] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IOTDB/Bi-weekly+meeting
[2] https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@iotdb.apache.org:lte=3M:bi-weekly

## Membership Data:
Apache IoTDB was founded 2020-09-16 (6 months ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Gaofei Cao on 2020-09-16.
- Jesse Zhou was added as committer on 2021-02-20
- Houliang Qi was added as committer on 2020-12-15
- Xinyu Tan was added as committer on 2020-12-19
- Alima777 was added as committer on 2021-02-20

## Project Activity:

 - IOTDB-0.11.2 was released on 2021-01-22.
 - IOTDB-0.11.1 was released on 2020-12-11.
 - We are working on developing 0.12.0.
 - Some interesting features are merged into the main branch,
e.g., the UDF (User Define Function), Cluster module, Integration with 
Apache Zeppelin. 

## Community Health:

According to Github's statistics, the number of IoTDB's code contributors
reaches to 100! 

The number of discussions on the dev@ mailing list, the number of PRs 
decreases, the Chinese New Year holiday is one of the reasons.

However, we can see the number of emails in the review@ mailing list 
increases, it is good because it indicates more discussions happen.

The number of opened issues also increases, which indicates more and 
more user requirements are received.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Marcel Reutegger]

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained.
 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding 
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Membership Data:

Apache Jackrabbit was founded 2006-03-15 (15 years ago)
There are currently 58 committers and 58 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Miroslav Smiljanic on 2020-10-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Miroslav Smiljanic on 2020-10-27.

## Project Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the main development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

We continue making regular feature releases of Jackrabbit Oak. The
most recent release was Jackrabbit Oak 1.38.0 that was made available
on January 28th.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

Mid-February the team decided to drop support and deprecate
the 1.2 branch of Apache Jackrabbit Oak. Users are encouraged to upgrade
to the latest stable 1.38.0 version (https://s.apache.org/ih4ms).

On March 1st a JCRSITE issue was created with spam content. The ticket
INFRA-21489 was processed very quickly by the ASF infrastructure team.
Thanks! At the same time the Jackrabbit team also noticed Jukka Zitting
is set as the project lead for the JCRSITE. Jukka is not active anymore
on the project and INFRA-21488 requests a change of the project lead.

## Community Health:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
lists as well as on the various JIRA issues. 

Commit activity is moderate mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues and the desire of the individual contributors to bring
features and improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.

## Releases:

 - jackrabbit-2.21.5 was released on 2021-01-14
 - jackrabbit-oak-1.22.6 was released on 2021-01-19
 - jackrabbit-filevault-3.4.8 was released on 2021-01-22

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Karaf project is to provide an application
ecosystem. Apache Karaf runtime is a modulith runtime allowing to run any kind
of applications. Karaf subprojects bring additional features for this runtime
and running applications.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Karaf was founded 2010-06-16 (11 years ago)
There are currently 31 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Francois Papon on 2018-11-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Francois Papon on 2018-05-19.

## Project Activity:
We are working on Karaf5 proposal (https://github.com/jbonofre/karaf5). We
would like to have a first "concrete" base to have a discussion/vote on the
mailing list. Karaf5 will be an important milestone for the project, changing
the Karaf perspective opening Karaf to new communities and users. We are also
working on other Karaf runtimes branches, especially Karaf 4.3.1 will be
released soon, fixing/improving Karaf 4.3.x series. The Karaf subprojects are
also active, especially Decanter with a release including new features
(Decanter 2.7.0).

To summarize, here's the releases during the period:
- Decanter 2.7.0 was released on 2021-02-15

## Community Health:
We are still working closely with other communities (Camel, ServiceMix, ...).
We have some actions planned with Camel community.
Karaf 5 will be very important and strong milestone for the project, opening
Karaf to even more communities.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Michael Sokolov]

## Description:
The mission of Lucene is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Search engine library

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Lucene was founded 2005-01-18 (16 years ago) There are currently 87
committers and 60 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- One new PMC member was added: Bruno Roustant on 2021-03-01.
- No new committers. Last addition was Julie Tibshirani on 2020-11-18.
- Erick Erickson announced his intention to retire, but remains a committer on
  the PMC
- There were two vote discussions for new committers. In both cases, the votes
  were deferred. We also had one vote discussion for a new PMC member that
  was deferred.

## Project Activity:

Last year the project voted to spin off Apache Solr as its own top-level
project. Recently, the work to do so has begun in earnest. The top-level
project itself has been created. We decided by majority vote to induct all
current Lucene committers and PMC members with the same status in the
newly-formed project. Jan Høydahl was elected Solr PMC chair. There will be no
change to the Lucene PMC or committers list. Work to split the code
repositories, release processes, and websites has also begun (see the Solr
report for more details). At the same time, the community has begun to focus
on the next major release, which will be 9.0. That release will be
Lucene-only; Solr will follow its own release cadence. The remaining 8.x
releases will remain more tightly coordinated due to the need to maintain
backwards-compatibility guarantees.

This quarter's activity statistics continue to reflect work on both core
Lucene and Solr. Work on Solr is desribed in the report on that newly-separate
top-level project.

Highlights from Lucene's 8.8.0 release include: enhanced synonym filter with
flags, improvements to geospatial queries, configurable DocValue compression,
and an implementation of CJK character width normalization as a CharFilter.

We do anticipate a substantial drop in Lucene's activity metrics (JIRAs,
commits) in the next quarter as Solr activity migrates to its own project.

### Releases

The most recent release was 8.8.1, released on 2021-02-22.

* 8.8.0 was released on 2021-02-12
* 8.7.0 was released on 2020-11-03.
* 8.6.3 was released on 2020-10-07.
* 8.6.2 was released on 2020-09-01

## Community Health:
We continue to see healthy participation both from the community of committers
as well as from outside contributors. Some statistics show a decrease in the
past quarter; I expect this can be attributed to seasonal fluctuation.

We do plan to sunset the general@lucene.apache.org mailing list since it sees
very low traffic. PyLucene release notices that were going there will now be
folded in with the dev@ list.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Laimonas Simutis on 2020-09-08.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jens Melgaard on 2020-10-20.

## Project Activity:
Progress:
- Several user-reported bug fixes
- 25 PRs were submitted
- We are continuing to expand testing, adding build hang detection, and
  Xamarin.Android tests to J2N
- Work has begun on tracking down concurrency contention problems
- Work has begun on reviewing tests for incomplete/partially implemented
  tests, API usability problems, and performance issues
- We are making preparations for the release of Lucene.NET 4.8.0-beta00014

We have also been steadily improving performance, refactoring APIs to be more
.NET-like than Java-like, and expanding testing.

Recent releases:
- Apache-Lucene.Net-4.8.0-beta00013 was released on 2020-11-16.
- Apache-Lucene.Net-4.8.0-beta00012 was released on 2020-09-19.
- Apache-Lucene.Net-4.8.0-beta00011 was released on 2020-07-24.

Average Daily Downloads of Lucene.NET from NuGet.org (all versions): 2,680

## Community Health:
Since our move to GitHub Issues, we are now getting bug reports that have been
long underreported. This new collaboration channel with end users is helping
us zero in on bugs, and is also helping to drive some PR activity from
contributors.

This quarter has seen a decrease in activity on Lucene.NET due to focus on the
Xamarin.Android tests, which were added to the smaller J2N dependency project
first before we scale up the approach for use in ICU4N and Lucnene.NET.

dev@lucenenet.apache.org had a 30% decrease in traffic in the past quarter

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Yanhui Zhao]

## Description:
Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. It comes up with
durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and takes full
advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code complexity, avoid
SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing next generation computing
platforms. Mnemonic makes the storing and transmitting of massive linked
objects graphs simpler and more efficient. The performance tuning could also
be mostly converged to a single point of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to
process and analyze linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the
durable object oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to
normalize/join, SerDe(un)marshal, cache and store their linked business
objects with arbitrary complexity.

## Issues:
None at this this time

## Membership Data:
There are currently 20 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.

## Project Activity:
In this period of reporting (since Feb. 07, 2021) , 24 of tickets have been
created and 16 resolved. We achieved two milestones of (1) redesign the
current memory service selection mechanism preparing for the incoming JDK
upgrade, and (2) mnemonic-site reboot to reflect most updated project
information, development flow, release flow, project news, etc. We are
planning our 0.14.0 release this month. Our community has held regular
meetings on biweekly basis, and we have covered the following topics on the
project meeting
- Project related training
- Release target discussion and planning
- New feature support discussion
- Blocker issue discussion and possible solution
- Encourage community engagement and looking to grow our developer communities

## Community Health:
Through our biweekly meetings, current committers and active developers are
actively contributing and participating in the project. We recruited Xiaojin
Jiao as our new committer, and plan to grow our community by recruiting other
active developers.

We maintained active developing activities that lead to our upcoming release
of 0.14.0, and we are planning 0.15.0 release to (1) reduce third party
library dependencies, (2) improving on all existing test cases and code
qualities, and bug fixing and improvement on website

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache PLC4X Project  [Christofer Dutz]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache PLC4X project is creating a set of libraries for
communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a
variety of protocols but with a shared API.

## Issues:
There are currently no issues needing board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache PLC4X was founded 2019-04-17 (2 years ago) There are currently 18
committers and 12 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ben Hutcheson on 2020-11-08.
- No new committers. Last addition was Ben Hutcheson on 2020-09-26.

## Project Activity:
In January we finally managed to bring all ongoing work to a state in which we
could finally do a release again. We are planning on releasing way more often
after these intense refactoring has been completed.

We have seen an increase of incoming questions and support-requests on the
mailing list from new sources, which seems to imply a growing usage in public.

The main areas the community has been working on are:
- Rebuilding the Kafka Connect adapter, having that validated and made
  available in the Confluent Hub for easy installation
- Implementing an MSPEC based OPC-UA driver for PLC4X, which will allow us to
  support OPC-UA in other languages (We were currently relying on Eclipse Milo
  for that)
- Creating an API for Discovery and Browsing (Testing this in PLC4Go)
- Implementing Auto-Discovery and Browsing for the KNX protocol

PLC4X has reported to be mentioned in more and more Industrial IoT related
podcasts and videos.

Conference-wise this quarter has been very quiet.

## Community Health:
I think the community is generally in a good shape and continuously growing.

We have continued our monthly community zoom call on every first Wednesday of
the month, which we stated last year, but this is mainly used for community
building and sometimes for answering questions, not for discussing important
project matters.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations. The primary goal is to provide
an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if
not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is
built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work
around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.

## Issues:
No issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) was founded 2000-12-01 (20 years ago)
There are currently 68 committers and 43 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2020-08-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2020-08-29.

## Project Activity:
The project has again been quiet.  One matter of possible interest:
there is a proposal (from a longstanding member of the community) for
an associated commandline toolkit apr-tools.  The proposer has
announced the first such tool, currently at github.

No release since 1.7.0 (April 2019), nor is a new release imminent.  In the
absence of a major bug or security issue, the most likely trigger for a new
1.7 release is to resolve glitches reported with new/updated toolchains
including Xcode 12 (Mac) and autoconf 2.69/2.70 (Gnu).

## Community Health
The community remains stable, with ASF projects using APR always a prime
focus. As is often the case with APR, there has been no proactive effort,
but we are responsive to questions and issues raised by users.

A major incompatible change of 2.0.0 is the API change (RATIS-1181, RATIS-1242).
It is to formally define a set of public APIs for StateMachine implementations.
We also have moved the new APIs to a new maven module.


## Community Health:

- 103 commits in the past quarter (-23% decrease)
- 16 code contributors in the past quarter (-5% decrease)

GitHub PR activity:
- 103 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-27% decrease)
- 108 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-21% decrease)

The metrics above show a decrease of activity from the quarter compared
to the last quarter.  The main reason is that this quarter (December to 
March) include many holidays around the world.  It is expected to have 
a lower activity in the project.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache River Project  [Roy Fielding]

Peter Firmstone has resigned as chair and PMC member. Roy has
initiated a formal roll call of the PMC and explained the process
on the dev list. The roll call revealed only 2 active PMC members.

A call for volunteers has begun on the dev list [1] and there
appears to be a sufficient number of volunteers to revive the PMC.

[1] https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rea5d032849f3953f5113e59df57d79433d0473d050e9366f0e366735%40%3Cdev.river.apache.org%3E

Now we just need to follow-up on the list and prepare a resolution
for next month.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Piotr Zarzycki]

## Description:
Apache Royale implements the principles of Apache Flex to support development
of applications designed for JavaScript instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes.
Apache Royale improves developer productivity in creating applications to run
wherever JavaScript runs, including on browsers, in Apache Cordova
applications, on Node, and on other platforms.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
- Hugo Ferreira became a committer on 5 October 2020.
- Christofer Dutz became a committer on 4 September 2020.

## Project Activity:
One of the committers has started improving how we build the Apache Royale
distribution package using Maven. There is also a significant amount of work
around emulation components, which help users smoothly migrate their
application from Apache Flex to Royale. We have been working intensively with
several users who want to port existing applications from Flex to Apache
Royale. Each migrating application brings specific challenges; as we answer
those challenges, we make Royale stronger and more useful to all users.

Work toward release 0.9.8 has been on hold for some time due to unavailability
of committers to finish the whole process.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Solr Project  [Jan Høydahl]

## Description:
Solr is a highly scalable search server based on Apache Lucene.

## Issues:
We have a question: "Can the Lucene PMC release a Solr bugfix release for the
previous 8.x version in the lucene/solr release repo, by vote in Lucene PMC?

Here's the background for the question: Lucene + Solr are intertwined and
currently have common git repo, build, release process and release repository.
The latest joint release is 8.8.1, built from a release branch using Ant
(master is quite different, using gradle). We do not currently plan to perform
 a code and build split on the 8.x ant branch, and we have no current plans
 for another 8.x feature release.

However, there will likely be a need for bugfix- and security releases on the
v8.x (ant) branch. How to plan for this?

If Lucene PMC cannot formally release a Solr release, we imagine that the
Lucene Release Manager can build both the lucene and solr artifacts, and then
hold the VOTE, requiring 3 "+1" from both the Lucene and Solr PMCs (which are
right now 100% identical). Then in the final step of the release, move the
Solr artifacts to the Solr release repo, and each PMC announce their own
releases separately?

Let us know what you think.

## Membership Data:
Apache Solr TLP was founded 2021-02-17. However Solr has existed since
2006-01-17 as a Lucene subproject.

There are currently 87 committers and 60 PMC members in this project. The
Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5. The project was bootstrapped with the
same set of committers and PMC members as its mothership, Lucene.

Community changes, past quarter (Since February 17th):
- Bruno Roustant was added to the PMC on 2021-03-01

One PMC member nomination in-flight.

## Project Activity:
Our main focus has been to migrate Solr from the Lucene project, and we have
completed the website and mailing list migrations.

We're currently working on splitting the Lucene/Solr code base into separate
git repos and untangle builds. Cutover this week.

Expecting to spend a couple more weeks to finalize build, Jenkins, release
processes etc. We are working closely with Lucene PMC to complete remaining
steps.

Upcoming releases:

We're preparing for the first-ever Apache release of the solr-operator, which
is a Kubernetes Operator for Solr which was donated by Bloomberg last year. We
are establishing it as a sub project. The operator is written in Golang.

Next up will be Solr 9.0, which will happen after Lucene releases lucene 9.0,
as Lucene is now a binary dependency for Solr.

## Community Health:
Many community members are active in the migration process.

As we are fresh as TLP, please see the Lucene report for relevant community
health last quarter.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for March 2021

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running our rule update infrastructure and
our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

SpamAssassin 3.4.4 was released on 28 January, 2020. It was primarily a
security release, fixing two CVEs, all then known outstanding open security
issues on the project.

Previous reports to the Board have described the release of SpamAssassin 3.4.5
as "imminent", fixing a CVE obtained in February, 2020. That should have
triggered a process resulting in a release with 90 days. The last publicly
released build for it was 3.4.5 Pre-Release 1 built on June 21, 2020.
Development continued after that, without a formal release yet. We recognize
that this has been unacceptable. There do not appear to be any issues blocking
the release at this time. We intend to run the release process as soon as
possible on the current 3.4 branch. After that we will look at how to modify
our development and release processes to better conform to modern CI
practices, further automate releases, and add time targets to our process
steps.

We intend to return our primary focus to development of version 4.0.0 once
3.4.5 is released.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.4 on 28 January 2020.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

https://velocity.apache.org/news.html#CVE-2020-13959

## Community Health:
The project remains, as one PMC member put it, "hyper stable", with the devs
largely focused on other projects, but still rallying (eventually) when work
needs to get done. Issues do eventually get addressed. The community is small,
the active community is smaller, but it is functioning.

The board called for a roll call due to our developer's schedules not being
satisfactory in regards to the CVE. Three PMC members responded (with various
levels of irritation). The PMC member who did most to implement the fixes
ignored the roll call thread. When it came time to get the releases out, the
PMC showed up to test and approve with 5 binding +1 for the Engine release and
6 binding +1 for the Tools release. I'd call that the actual, meaningful "roll
call".

Xerces-J

With help from the community, Xerces-J 2.12.1 was finally published to Maven
central at the beginning of the year. It's been otherwise quiet on the
development front with only a couple commits to fix a defect and improve the
documentation.

In January, there was a potential security issue that was reported through
security@ but it appears to be a problem with the JDK's fork of Xerces-J and
the serializer component that is bundled from Xalan. We forwarded the details
to the Xalan PMC for them to assess.

Mailing list traffic has been very low; roughly 30+ posts on the j-dev and
j-users lists since the beginning of November 2020.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-J
2.12.1 (January 11th, 2020).

Xerces-C

There was one short discussion on the mailing list and a bit of activity in
JIRA. Otherwise, there's nothing notable to report.

Mailing list traffic has been very low; roughly 15+ posts on the c-dev and
c-users lists since the beginning of November 2020.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-C
3.2.3 (April 10th, 2020).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity over the
reporting period.

XML Commons

No activity over the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in April 2017 (Xerces-C) and May 2017
(Xerces-J).

No new PMC members since the last report. The most recent addition to the PMC
was in June 2016.

One committer has committed changes to SVN since November 2020.

Attachment CA: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Allen Wittenauer]

## Description:

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and
release processes for software projects.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.   

## Membership Data:

Apache Yetus was founded 2015-09-15 (5 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-12-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-02-06.

## Project Activity:

The usual post-release lull quarter... with a twist.

Usually, there is a quarter of people doing upgrades for their
individual projects in the ASF.  But it appears the adoption of the
latest release (0.13.0) is significantly higher outside of the ASF, 
primarily due to GitHub Actions support. In fact, there is only one 
ASF projectthat appears to have even attempted to upgrade to this 
release. That deployment is (effectively) reverting some code in
order to revert back to previous behavior.  It is greatly disappointing
that a lack of participation in the ASF during the release process
didn't help discover these bugs earlier, but it is what it is.

## Community Health:

How down was this post-release lull?  Might be our biggest one, and
that is likely reflective of most of the work in the project being
done by one person who didn't do much of any contributions this
quarter:

- dev@yetus.apache.org had a 68% decrease in traffic in the past 
 quarter (16 emails compared to 50)
- 0 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-100% decrease)
- 2 commits in the past quarter (-98% decrease)
- 2 code contributors in the past quarter (-50% decrease)

Attachment CC: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Paiva Junqueira]

## Description:
Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It enables
the implementation of a variety of primitives and mechanisms that are
critical for safety and liveness in distributed settings, e.g., 
distributed locks, master election, group membership, and configuration.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache ZooKeeper was founded 2010-11-17 (10 years ago)
There are currently 30 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Enrico Olivelli on 2020-01-15.
- Ling Mao was added as committer on 2021-01-16

## Project Activity:
3.5.9 was released on 2021-01-14.
3.6.3 and 3.7.0 are in progress

The community has focused on minor releases of the 3.6. branch
and it is also getting ready to release 3.7.0. 3.7.0 has had a release
candidate, but it has not passed the vote. The work towards cutting
these releases will continue in the next period.


## Community Health:

The project overall had more discussion and more commits as part
of closing on releases, but fewer GitHub PRs have been created
and closed compared to the previous reporting period. The difference
reflects the current community focus on releases.   

- dev@zookeeper.apache.org had a 34% increase in traffic in the past quarter
(402 emails compared to 298)
- notifications@zookeeper.apache.org had a 38%
decrease in traffic in the past quarter (650 emails compared to 1035)
- user@zookeeper.apache.org had a 50% increase in traffic in the past quarter
(90 emails compared to 60)
- 115 commits in the past quarter (26% increase)
- 31 code contributors in the past quarter (3% increase)
- 68 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-35% decrease)
- 57 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-44% decrease)
