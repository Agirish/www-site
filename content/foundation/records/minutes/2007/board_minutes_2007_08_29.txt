 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Jim]

       The new board, and officers, are starting to gell and find
       their own way. This is most clearly indicated by the reduced
       direct activity regarding the JCP (and the jcp-open list), and
       allowing others to express their points of views and opinions.
       There was a slight issue during the renewal of the D&O insurance
       where, due to the officer changeover, the invoicing and payment
       was not as streamlined as it could have been, but this was
       quickly resolved and the policy was renewed on time.

       There has been, as one would have expected, much discussion within
       the foundation regarding the events of the last month regarding
       Java, the JCP and the ASF's involvement. Even so, the membership
       and the PMCs are not being distracted and activity seems very
       good and healthy.

       On a more personal note, the board, as well as the membership and,
       indeed, countless others outside of the foundation, wish Greg
       Stein a speedy recovery from the injuries received when he was
       mugged. This is on top of the broken leg he already had from
       an accident earlier in the summer. Kevin Burton has setup a
       fund to help Greg out. This fund is not affiliated with the ASF.

    B. President [Justin]
    
       The four new machines referred to in the last report are all
       now operational.  We now have a new VMWare server, a new
       mail server at OSU OSL, and redundant mail servers and web
       servers functional in our Netherlands co-lo.
       
       With an operational backup data center now provisioned, we hope
       to be able to handle lengthy outages or disaster recovery with
       minimal user-facing downtime.  However, we do not yet have
       developer-facing redundancy - that is, we do not have hot
       standbys for Subversion, issue tracking, or core mailing lists
       in separate co-los.  However, we are planning to prepare one
       machine as a 'cold' standby for these services at OSU OSL.  In
       my opinion, this would be the next set of machines to procure -
       but we can queue incoming email and serve the public websites
       from our backup co-lo.

       We are currently in process of preparing the replacement for
       people.apache.org.  This machine was donated by Covalent, as
       part of their sponsorship, which caused some interesting
       procurement difficulties as there was a lot of confusion about
       what to order.   Some essential parts were not ordered with the
       machine, so it has taken longer than expected to be able to
       bring this machine up.

       Earlier this month, our account at our registrar (Dotster) was
       hacked into.  For a brief period, apache.org was pointing to
       the wrong name servers.  This caused a few day outage for
       folks.  We had several discussions, including several email
       exchanges and phone calls, with Dotster who refused to provide
       us with any substantive details about the breakin.  We
       immediately changed the password and are investigating
       alternative registrars with better security policies.
       
       We have received an substantial offer for equipping an off-site
       build farm from a relatively large company friendly to the ASF.
       The infrastructure team is currently discussing whether we
       should pursue this and how we'd manage it.
       
       Finally, I spent a decent chunk of this month coordinating with
       Aaron on the Treasurer transition.  As planned, I was
       responsible for preparing our 990s.  These should undergo final
       review today and will be submitted to the IRS as soon as
       possible.

    C. Treasurer [J Aaron]

       On Aug 10, Justin and I visited the Wells Fargo branch in Irvin
       in order to add my name to the accounts.  With the exception of
       foreign currency wire transfers, I think I now have access to
       all the financial accounts (don't have any checks on hand
       though).

       On August 2nd we received a bronze level sponsorship check from
       Two Sigma Investments, LLC.  On Aug 21st, Geir wired funds from
       his personal account our D&O Insurance.

       Justin has been working with myself and the Audit committee on
       the 990 filing.  Drafts have been placed in the financials
       repository.

       Current balances (as of 29 AUG 2007)

        Paypal                $    898.00  (+$   691.28)
        Checking              $ 51,796.86  (-$11,518.31)
        Savings               $154,798.77  (+$   663.42)
        Total                 $207,493.63  (-$10,163.61)

       (differences are since 19 JUN 2007 which was the last reported
        balance in the board meeting minutes)

       We also discussed the status of the upcoming Yahoo! sponsorship,
       and directed the treasurer to reimburse Geir for wiring expenses.
       (Thanks, Geir!)

    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Sam]

       As Jim indicated, the D&O insurance has been renewed.  The invoicing
       issue was not the only issue however, obtaining the policy also
       involved addressing a number of workflow issues.  I'm also seeing
       a number of other workflow issues elsewhere, and have been trying
       to figure out how I can help, but instead came to a low-tech
       recommendation:

           Let's create a calendar section in board/STATUS which lists
           important upcoming dates which will require an officer of
           the foundation's attention.  Everything from D&O to 990 to
           members meetings can be put in there.

       Which reminds me, it is time to renew the contract with Jon
       Jagielski, and unless there are any objections, I plan to just
       do it, under exactly the same terms and duration as the last
       contract.

       Other than that, I see no other issues requiring board attention.

    D. Apache Travel Assistance Committee [Jim Jagielski]

       See Attachment 4

       While this continues to be monitored, the consensus was that
       it was premature to act.

       Approved by General Consent.

       Directors).

       Approved by General Consent.

    G. Apache Public Relations Project [Jim Jagielski]

       See Attachment 7

       We discussed what it would talk to properly fund this activitity
       properly (i.e., with staff).  Ballpark estimate was $60K/year +
       expenses (note: > 25% of annual ASF expenditures?) vs. strong
       support for the need for this function.  This statement of
       support was backed up by numerous requests by sponsors.  Should
       we find this unsatisfactory, we could simply cancel or not
       renew the contract.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Role of infrastructure

       Various input, not all consistent or coherent:

         * great job, need a solaris zone for new services
         * we need to do a better job organizing volunteers
         * more use of sandbox/asylum 
         * infra role mixes policy vs resources
         * dim's idea of using yahoo boxes for sandboxes
         * a smaller number of services, well supported is better than a
           large number of services spottily supported
         * unpaid volunteers without a track record are presumed to being
            prone to disappear.  Products like MoinMoin, JIRA and others
            tend to be used beyond expectations, so sandboxes don't solve
            the problem.  Sandbox takes a lot of time.  More machines can
            be ordered, but people can't be.
         * need and don't have an infrastructure roadmap
         * we need a way to "grow" new volunteers
         * happy with three 9's.  hiring people makes us lose volunteers
         * self fulfilling prophesy: pushing away volunteers, and using that
           to justify the need to hire
         * need two realms, one at 3 nines, another at a higher level
         * need a volunteer to help coordinate

    B. When to schedule next board meeting. Is Sept 19th too soon?

       We decided to hold the meeting on Sept 19 as originally planned.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    Geir: update http://www.apache.org/jcp/ with:
     * an authoritative statement on what TCK aspects can be discussed in
       public based on the TCK NDAs.

       Status: Awaiting input from Sun

    Sam: Copyright/license of .dtd/.xsd files and other Reference Material
       Review (and possibly update) <http://www.apache.org/legal/3party.html>.

       Status: Complete. Version 0.53 of 3party.html has been published,
               and this seems to have satisfied MyFaces and Geronimo's
               immediate concerns.  Revision of this document is ongoing,
               and the legal committee chair will seek a new owner and
               will be reporting on the progress as a part of the legal
               affairs report.

    Geir: come up with and execute a plan whereby he delegates a number of
       the more routine activities currently only assigned to the VP, JCP.

       Status: Deferred.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Legal Affairs

* Continuing to work on Yahoo! patent scope FAQ.
* Updated web page concerning Apache License and GPL compatibility
* Updated 3rd party policy, resolving Geronimo and MyFaces issue
* Participated in two call with ASF council regarding JCK/FOU issue
* Continuing to work with Sun over ASF license code issues in Glassfish

My goal continues to be to delegate more of this.  If necessary,
I will recruit more people onto the legal committee in order to 
make this happen.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of JCP

The main event of interest this month was the JCP F2F 
meeting on Aug 16th-17th in Munich, DE.  Notes were posted 
to the board-private@ list, and after discussion, posted 
to the board@ list for general member consideration.

The key element for us at the meeting was our attempt to 
measure JCP self-governance via the motion to affirm our 
view that FOU restrictions are contrary to the letter and 
spirit of the JSPA.  Due to lack of quorum, the motion had 
to be submitted electronically.  The motion was submitted 
yesterday after consultation with other EC members to clarify 
and simplify.  The voting deadline will be 10 business days 
from the date that the JCP PMO officially starts the vote, 
which I expect will be today.  Therefore, I expect a result 
by Sept 14 (adding 1 day for Labor Day, and 1 day for the 
PMO not getting this started until tomorrow.  I apologize
if I have misled anyone about the timing - I didn't realize
there was a mandatory 10 business day process.  In all, 
I think it's good as it gives time for internal consultation
by EC members, hopefully reducing their urge to abstain.

The public has been made aware of our motion via jcp-open@, 
and to date, there have been no comments.

Other than that, things have been quiet.  There have been 
two volunteers co-opted to help scale workload, and I'm 
waiting for a response from Sun regarding my promised work 
to narrow the scope of and clearly state the requirements 
of the NDA for TCK participation.

Attachment 3: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

Activity on the ATA committee has been worrisomely quiet. After noting
my intent to step down as chair, there was a huge silence. After repeated
pinging, we finally got some sort of movement within the committee, with
a nominee for Chair and some adjustment of committee members, as reflected
in the resolution to be voted on later on in the meeting. It is hoped
that the new blood will kick-start the committee. If not, the board
should consider terminating the committee.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

Concom: After significant effort from J Aaron, and much delay (not J
Aaron's fault), we now have a website for ACUS07. J Aaron has a vision
for where we should be wrt websites and has solicited feedback on the
options available going forward. There has also been discussion about
potential new formats for Apache events, focused on longer trainings,
and solicitation of training sessions from some of our members.

Both ACUS and OSSummit are fast approaching - concom would appreciate
efforts by other PMCs to promote these events among their communities.
In particular, where a training has been scheduled for a project, we
would greatly appreciate that project working on advertising the
training to its community! =)

ACUS07: The website is now available for ACUS07! A number of issues
with how it displays have been reported, and are being dealt with.
Registration is now
open, and a press release has been made to this effect. Jim Gettys of
OLPC has agreed to keynote on the Friday, he will hopefully also bring
some OLPC laptops with him. Ora Lassila has also agreed to keynote -
probably on Thursday. The third keynote slot has yet to be locked in.

OSSummit: Press releases in a number of languages have been made
across APac, and some work has begun in the English-speaking press.
There has been a minor but steady trickle of enquiries about the
conference. The session selection and scheduling is almost complete -
some last minute scheduling issues have delayed speaker notifications
and publishing of the schedule.

ACEU08: Planning meeting is expected to happen in Atlanta, the weekend
before ACUS. CFP will probably open September 14th, running for six
weeks (til October 26th).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Audit Project

The Audit committee were intended to look at the 990 after Justin and 
Aaron had put together a draft, but there was very little activity. 

Given that there's only one task each year, it might be best for 
the committee to be reformed each May.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Public Relations Project

The last month has seen limited activity. On the plus side, we
received notice that Yahoo! has agreed to a Platinum Sponsorship.
An invoice was received, signed and returned to Yahoo! for payment.
Two Sigma Investments is also a new Bronze sponsor. There was some
confusion since the payment, and a note detailing their desire to
be a Bronze sponsor, was sent directly to the lockbox. The Sponsorship
page has since been updated to make it clear that all Sponsorship
donations should be coordinated with the PRC.

Kernel Concepts has made the PRC aware that the agreed-to
ASF Feather Pin is now available. It looks quite nice. We have
also been informed that they have submitted $198.02 (via Paypal)
to the ASF in relation to the T-shirt sales. A press release regarding
the release of Geronimo 2 was finalized and sent to the wire for
release on August 28th.

The PRC is discussing how to better document acceptable logo usage.
As reported previously, we are looking at the Eclipse guidelines as
a starting point for ours. Some of this came about due to Emails on
the dev@httpd list and ApacheLounge.

We are discussing the potential for a dedicated ASF marketing and
PR person attending AC Asia / OS Summit Asia.  If agreed to, the PRC
will be requesting funds from the ASF to support this effort.
It is also possible that some sort of contractual retainer effort
will be the better solution. In any case, it is becoming more
clear that PR and Marketing, a necessary evil, might be the next
area where we need to outsource expertise.

Attachment A: Status report for the Apache ActiveMQ Project

July board report was missed in part due to a change in PMC chair.

Community:
 * The developer and user communities remain very active.
 * New committer added: Albert Strasheim

Development:
 The CMS API has been extracted from the ActiveMQ CPP module and turned into
 an independently versioned module.  ActiveMQ 5.0 is starting to solidify and
 in all likelihood will be released within the next quarter.

Brand New Releases:
 * ActiveMQ CMS 1.0 - Defines an abstract messaging API for C++
 * ActiveMQ Camel 1.0.0 - A routing and mediation engine

Maintenance Releases:
 * ActiveMQ CPP 2.0.1 - Updated to use the CMS 1.0 API
 * ActiveMQ CMS 1.1 - Updated to build as a shared lib

Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Ant Project

o Current Releases

Core
----
Ant 1.7 was released on December 19, 2006.

We are considering a 1.7.1 release but have not progressed to a detailed
plan (release manager, must fix bugs, etc) at this stage.

o Development Activities

There has been a lot of commit activity in the quarter but a lot of that
is related to tidying up the current codebase. We have agreed to remove
tasks which depend on proprietary libraries from the Ant core codebase
and place these in antlibs.

o Community

No issues.

Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

RELEASES / ONGOING WORK
- The release artifacts for Cocoon 2.2RC1 are available and the
  PMC voting passed. The official announcement will go along
  with the publishing of the new website
  (see http://cocoon.zones.apache.org/dev-docs/) which needs
  little more work though.
- Cocoon 2.2RC2 is scheduled for the end of September.
- Our this year GSoC student Grzegorz Kossakowski, who is also
  committer and PMC member, makes good progress with his ambitious
  project of "Unified expression handling and unified object model".
- In general, over the summer months the development was steady but
  slow.


COMMUNITY
- emeritus PMC member: Niclas Hedhman
- The 6th Cocoon GetTogether, edition 2007, was announced and will take

-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Issues needing board attention
------------------------------
None.

Changes in the PMC membership
-----------------------------
Brian Dube (bdube) is a new committer and PMC member. He was in the process of
being added at the time of the last report and is now established.

General status
--------------
Progress has been generally slow this quarter. Most devs seem busy with other
stuff.

We have two "Google Summer of Code (GSoC)" students this year. Progress was
disappointing. Input from the rest of development community also seemed slow.

Any issues on the user mail list are being attended to by various developers.
That list is also quiet.

Issues still to be dealt with by the Forrest PMC
------------------------------------------------
Just the usual continue to develop project guidelines doc. There was another
short discussion about branch development.

Progress of the project
-----------------------
Two new plugins have been commenced in the whiteboard as a result of GSoC:
- "skos" to handle input documents as Simple Knowledge Organisation Systems
(SKOS).
- "foaf" to handle input documents in Friend of a Friend (FOAF) format.

Another new plugin commenced in the whiteboard - "tei" to handle input and
ouput documents as TEI-Lite Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).

Also the "doap" plugin has received some attention, which has driven the
Dispatcher forward in a "power use" environment, ironing out some bugs. This
has enabled us to create considerably more flexible sites and plugins which
take Forrest to a new level of utility.

No releases since 0.8 on 2007-04-18.

There was some discussion commenced with the Apache Maven project about a
section of code in the Forrest SVN (codename "forrestdoc") which was rescued
long ago from the defunct Apache Jakarta Alexandria project. It has never been
actually used by Forrest. The Forrest developers have had a discussion about
their position, but not yet finalised by following up with Maven.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache HiveMind Project

There is really not much to report.  The HiveMind project has remained
almost completely inactive during the last 3 months.  There have been
a few questions asked/answered on the mailing lists and maybe some
JIRA issues filed (mainly because of a release of Tapestry 4.x which
uses HiveMind).  As for development, I do not believe there are
currently any active committers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

The Apache HTTP server project has no board-level issues at this time.

Nóirín Plunkett has joined the PMC this quarter.  We have also added
two new docs committers: Vincent Bray and Tony Stevenson.

We successfully kicked mod_python up to the Quetzalcoatl TLP, though
the subversion and lists have yet to be moved due to summer vacations.

In spite of a general increase in activity and a good try at tarballs,
we failed to release any software this quarter.  At least our quality
control process has been tested. ;-)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

The Incubator enjoyed a nice quiet summer month.  Woden, CXF, Tuscany each
did a release.  A few new PMC Members were added, and a couple of people
stepped up as Mentors.  All in all, a nice quiet month for a change.

A couple of projects appear very close to graduation, e.g., Woden.

Lokahi did not report this month, and will be asked to report next month.
The project has been quiet lately, which is probably not a good sign, since
it is in real need of community.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Abdera

Date of entry: May 2006

Abdera is an implementation of the Atom feed format and publishing protocol.

Code wise there has been a bunch of work done to update the publishing
protocol implementation to match the latest versions of the internet draft
(which will become the RFC). The code is currently being prepared for a new
release.

On the community side we added a new committer (Brian Moseley) who has been
using Abdera's server side code in the Cosmo project and has contributed
back various improvements. We continue to see a steady stream of questions
about the project, which implies that it is being used.

The only remaining goal to be reached before graduation is diversity
related, while we do have more than the minimum number of committers from
separate companies there remains some concern about the fact that many of
them are not overly active.

NMaven

NMaven develops plugins and integration for Maven to make building and using
.NET languages a first-class citizen in Maven.

Incubating since: 2006-11-17

Items to resolve before graduation

More active committer involvement. This involves getting a group of
developers familiar with the NMaven internals (both .NET and Java), as well
as growing a larger community of developers who are creating Maven plugins
in .NET.

Closer interaction with the Maven team.

Status:

Added new committer: Evan Worley

Attempted to reach out to Lucene.NET (and other .NET projects external to
ASF) but no response from any projects.

There is some concern that NMaven may be drifting from Maven in terms of
common architecture/code. Made (and making) active attempts to raise
visibility of NMaven issues among general Maven developers by posting to
maven dev list and submitting proposals for review.

Plans:

Major IDE features

Preparing for a release


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----


ServiceMix

The ServiceMix community has voted for graduation and the Incubator PMC has
voted to accept ServiceMix graduation as a TLP (Guillaume Nodet has been
voted as the PMC chair).

ServiceMix 3.1.1 has been released on 04/Jul/07, and we are planning a 3.1.2
after graduation has completed. A 3.2 release is also planned for end of
september / early october.

Discussion on the next major version 4.0 have begin on the mailing list.

Thomas Termin and Gert Vanthienen has joined the PPMC.

Tuscany

Tuscany provides infrastructure for developing service-oriented applications
based on Service Component Architecture (SCA) specification and Service Data
Objects (SDO) specifications. These specifications were submitted to OASIS
in March 2007 by OSOA (www.osoa.org), and OASIS have now issued a "Call for
Participation" for the technical committees to advance the specifications.

Incubating since: 2006-11-30

Top issues?

Start openly discussing what needs to be done to graduate

Community aspects:

Tuscany PPMC formally announced

Voted Andy Grove and Fuhwei Lwo as a new committer

Integration with Apache Projects started or ongoing

Working with Apache ODE to provide BPEL integration

Working with Apache Geronimo to provide Tuscany hosting. A simple scenario
is now working.

Working with Apache Directory to provide DAS LDAP (patch with initial
implementation ready)

Working with Apache ServiceMix and Apache Synapse on design of integrating
SCA

Apache Lab project called Fluid extends Java Persistence Architecture (JPA)
for SDO and prototyped integration with DAS.

Good community involvement. Users are providing patches and helping to
answer questions.

Continuing to enhance Tuscany website to improve information sharing.
Provided quick get started document and extended user documentation.

Provided nightly builds and downloads through Continuum.

Releases since last report:

Released Java SCA 0.90 and Java SCA 0.91, with another SCA release this
month under discussion on the ML

Improved usability, created stable extension SPIs and changed architecture
to be modularized for easy integration,

Java SDO 1.0 release is currently going through vote process, following the
1.0-incubating-beta1 release in May

This release compeletes SDO 2.1 spec implementation, improved samples and
includes contributions from SDO users. Thanks!

Java DAS beta1 releases is currently going through vote process


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----


Woden

Woden is a library for working with WSDL 2.0 files.

The W3C WSDL working group completed their work and the  WSDL 2.0
specification is now a recommendation. This is exciting news for Woden as
there is now an official W3C recommended spec to implement. The Woden team
is still reporting issues and asking questions from the W3C Web services
group and plans to contribute further test cases to the WSDL 2.0 test suite.

 Woden M7b was released on Aug 3, in support of Axis2. The Woden team is
currently working towards an  M8 release that will include full support for
the WSDL 2.0 spec, including assertion checking. Also of note in this
release will be a mechanism for extending Woden in both parsing and
assertions. Woden has also received a serialization contribution from Sagara
Gunathunga that is under review and we hope will be able to add a key piece
to Woden.

Woden has been an incubator project for roughly two years. Most items on the
graduation list have been completed. We're currently working towards
completing the few remaining items and then will propose to the WS and
Incubator PMCs that Woden graduate to the Apache Web Services project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----


WSRP4J

The WSRP4J Project is an implementation of WSRP 1.0 Producer. WSRP is an
OASIS specification that describes a protocol which allows portlets to be
accessed remotely using Web Services.

Incubating since: 2003

Not much news for WSRP4J - Apart from one committer working on refactoring
the code base to match latest Pluto versions and one or two questions on the
user mailing list, nothing really happened.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----


XAP

Description - XAP is a client side declarative Ajax framework for building
and deploying rich internet applications

Date of entry - June, 2006

The top three items to resolve in last report have seen very good progress:

Dojo 0.9 migration - XAP is currently using Dojo 0.4 as the default Ajax
toolkit. Dojo 0.9 is a complete rewriet of Dojo. Though it is not compatible
with Dojo 0.4, Dojo 0.9 seems to have fixed many problems of Dojo and is
likely to become a solid foundation for future Ajax development. XAP
developers are investigating whether/when/how to migrate to Dojo 0.9.

Release - XAP has made one release within the community so far (XAP 0.3
release on March 2007);

Growth of community - XAP community is growing, we see more and more
contributions in many forms from people other than the initial committers:
feedback on the mailing lists, documentation and code patches... The
commuity has voted to add a new committer.

Community aspects:

Contributions from various non-committers continued in areas such as bug
reports, code patches, and discussions;

Vote of a new committer passed

Coach Wei gave a talk on Apache XAP and Declarative Ajax at AjaxWorld
Conference in march 2007 at NYC;

We have reviewed the web site tracking and added mechanism to collect XAP
download statistics.

jQuery integration is done. XAP customers can leverage jQuery as well -
plugin available both from jQuery website and XAP website(
http://jquery.com/plugins/project/xModify).

Code aspects:

Significant work went into xModify - now we have a 3KB engine (leverages
jQuery) for declaratively "ajaxify" HTML web applications. Customers can get
"Ajax" result without writing a single line of Javascript, by using the 3KB
"xModify with jQuery" module.

Web site has been updated

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Yoko

The Yoko project is a robust and high performance CORBA server which is
usable from inside any JVM.

Since our last report there have been some changes in mentorship and we have
continued to improve the Binding runtime and type support for idltowsdl and
wsdltoidl as listed below.

1) Items to resolve for graduation

* We are also planning to improve the documentation for Yoko, with the goal
of providing more in depth information to users of the Yoko project and to
assist any future committers in understanding the existing code and
functionality.

* Work on stabilizing the code and get it ready for a 1.0 release which
should improve overall quality.

2) Community aspects * We have a new mentor on board: Welcome Matt
Hoggstrom! and thank Ken Coar for his contributions.

* Discussion started about the project status and how it may work better
and/or graduate into other projects like Geronimo, Harmony, and CXF.

* Increased activity on user/dev list around the binding components,
possibly due to the release of CXF driving some interest in the corba
binding components.

3) Code aspects

* Adding more new type support to the binding runtime.

* Continual improvement of performance for the runtime binding in terms of
marshaling and unmarshaling data.

* Adding new type support to the IDLToWSDL and WSDLToIDL tools and adding
quite a number of new tests.

* Fixing some issues in the ORB core code.

* Currently working on preparing Yoko for a 1.0 release.

* Cleaning up the jira issues for the 1.0 release.

Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Lenya Project

RELEASES / ONGOING WORK
 - We decided to rename 1.4 to 2.0 to reflect the magnitude of the changes
 - Our hotlist of bugs to be resolved for 2.0 is currently down to 1
   bug, so with luck we will release soon.

COMMUNITY
- new committers: Juergen Ragaller
- Another Lenya Hackathon (Oct 2007, Freiburg Germany) is in the planning
  stages.

LEGAL
- no issues


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Logging Project

log4j:
A release vote for log4j 1.2.15 and log4j-extras 1.0 is now underway.  In
addition to a large number of bug fixes, log4j 1.2.15 is the first log4j
release built using Maven 2.  log4j-extras contains many log4j 1.3
features and some new ones that will work with with log4j 1.2.9 and later
and possibly some earlier versions.  Additional log4j "companions" are
expected to be released during the next reporting period.  With the
release of log4j 1.2.15 and log4j-extras, there are very few missing
features that would entice people to use the abandoned log4j 1.3 line. 
There has been no progress on log4j 2.0 development in this period.

Chainsaw 2:
Chainsaw 2 has broken its ties with log4j 1.3 and a Chainsaw release
build using log4j 1.2.15 is expected in the next reporting period.  A
Chainsaw 2 alpha has been available from the LS web site
(http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/chainsaw.html) since March 2006
using Java WebStart signed with the personal email certificate of one of
the Chainsaw developers.  A forthcoming Chainsaw 2 release would have a
traditional tarball/zip distribution using the mirrored distribution
servers.  However, there is a desire to keep a WebStart option, but it is
hard to figure out how to do that the Apache way.  There was a recent
thread on general@incubator about digital signing of jars for WebStart,
but there was no conclusion.

log4cxx:
log4cxx migrated to Maven 2 for generation of the log4cxx web content and
release documentation.  However, log4j consumed most of the development
resources that could have moved log4cxx toward its first official Apache
release.

log4net:
log4net mailing lists have been active but there has been no development
activity in the reporting period other than migrating the log4net
documentation to Maven 2.

log4php:
In June, Knut Urdalen posted a request on log4php-dev asking to become
maintainer of log4php.  The following discussion collected a group of
developers who prepared a incubation proposal for restart log4php.  The
Logging Services PMC supported this proposal and the Incubator PMC
accepted the proposal in July.  2 new committers were added and a
substantial part of a PHP 5 migration was committed shortly thereafter,
but there has been little activity since then likely due to vacation and
such.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache ODE Project

General
-------
Following up on our graduation from the incubator, all the tasks to
establish us as a TLP have been completed. It's been pretty quick,
mostly thanks to the infra team, Niclas and Henri. So the web site,
SVN and mailing lists have been migrated, the PMC has been established
as well as the chair. The foundation files have also been updated. So
far we're all happy campers, no particular issue to bring to the board
attention.

Release
-------
We're preparing our first out-of-incubator release (1.1), in terms of
development it's going to be mostly a bug fix release with some rough
edges polishing. It should be our most stable release ever.

Development
-----------
Meanwhile, we have started a new development branch named BART to
better address messaging integration and quality of service aspects
(BART = blocking, asynchronous, reliable and transactional). This
represents significant refactoring of the integration layer and will
be the basis for our 2.0 release.

Community
---------
Nothing groundbreaking on the community side as we've been mostly busy
with graduation. The mailing lists traffic keep on picking up and we
try our best to support new users.  Our new committer, Tammo, is I
believe going on very well with the rest of the team, owning massive
quantities of karma by fixing tests.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

Work on the OpenEJB 3.0 release is coming to a close. Documentation
remains the largest outstanding item. A complete audit of all
documentation was completed and concrete steps to improve it were
detailed.  Progress on updating the out-of-date documentation has
already been made.

The usability of the codebase has matured significantly through many
contributions from the community and very little remains to be
completed in that regard.

Developer activity is up. We are delighted to have voted in a
dedicated contributor, Karan Malhi, as a new committer and he has
proudly excepted. No CLA is on file yet.

User list activity overall remains low, though some new faces have
started to pop up whom we are hoping can provide us with some good
pre-release feedback.  We hoping to see a measurable increase in user
list activity post release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

Highlights:
OpenJPA continues to work toward its first release as a TLP, to be called
OpenJPA 1.0.0. A few release candidates have been built and the release
is imminent.

There are no board issues at the moment.

Community:
A public face-to-face meeting was held August 6 and 7, hosted by
BEA in San Jose. The meeting was advertised on the Apache party alias
in addition to the openjpa dev alias. The gathering was well-
attended, with 12 OpenJPA folks physically together, another
4 dialing in via conference call, and one invited outside speaker.
The results of the meeting were posted to the OpenJPA wiki at
http://openjpa.apache.org/openjpa-up-close-and-personal.html
Many discussion topics resulted in action items to be taken to the
dev and user aliases for community consensus.

Governance:
The PMC has voted to grant commit privileges to Catalina Wei (fancy@a.o).
The PMC continues to track contributors with an eye toward making them
committers.

Releases:
OpenJPA 1.0.0 is being prepared for release.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Perl Project

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since the last report.


--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

No new Apache-Test releases since the last report.


--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

We have not yet released Apache-Reload.


-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be an active and healthy development community - 
bugs are found, bugs are fixed, development moves forward as usual.


-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is, as always, thriving.  nothing noteworthy
has happened since the last report.


-- PMC --

the PMC tossed around the idea of adding a new committer to the
project, but decided to wait just a bit longer and work with him
so he understands a bit more about how the project moves and what
committership means.

there has also been some conversation with Allison Randal about
the upcoming mod_perl 2.0 book to be published by Onyx Neon.  she
had questions regarding licensing the mod_perl 2.0 documentation
and giving back editorial changes to the online documentation.
Cliff Schmidt was included in the conversation but remained silent,
but as far as I can tell everything Allison is doing seems to
be in line with the ASF license (and she's more aware of what the
license means than I am) so, short of official ASF legal counsel
guidance, I think she's fine to, in essence, put in hard-copy
the documentation anyone can find online.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache POI Project

Releases
--------

There have been no new releases in the last month. We are provisionally
planning on another relase towards the end of the year.

Community
---------

No new committers or PMC members in the period.

General
-------

There have been a good number of patches sent in over the last month.
Several committers have also been contributing bug fixes and enhancements,
especially to HSSF. The change list since the last release is growing
quite nicely!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Quetzalcoatl Project

There is not much to report. I'm away on vacation this month with very
little computer time and have not done much to advance the set up of the
Quetzalcoatl infrastructure. Mod_python development is nearly dormant
with last Jira issue update on Aug 7th. There are no issues or concerns
to report at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Roller Project

Apache Roller has been making great progress over the past couple of
months in new development. In addition to announcing our graduation
with a brand new release of Roller 3.1 we have also done a tremendous
amount of development for the Roller 4.0 release. Much of the new work
involved use of other Apache projects, for example we migrated from
Struts 1 to Struts 2, we upgraded to Velocity 1.5 and we completely
replaced Hibernate with OpenJPA. We also upgraded from JDK 1.4.2 to
Java SE 1.5.


Some post graduation work still TBD
===================================
Apache Roller graduated back in March and announced graduation and the
Apache Roller 3.1 release on April 23, 2007. However, we've still got
some work to do. We're still waiting for our JIRA instance to be setup
(see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-813). We also need to
change our downloads page
(http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ROLLER/Roller+Downloads)
to make use of Apache Mirrors. We need volunteers to help with these
tasks.


Apache Roller 3.1 completed, 3.1.1 RC2 ready for testing
========================================================
We shipped 3.1 on April 23, 2007. A number of significant problems
(including an XSS bug) were found and fixed. We are now testing a fix
release known as 3.1.1 RC2, made available August 12, 2007
(announcement here: http://tinyurl.com/34dq3l).


Apache Roller 4.0 RC1 available for testing
===========================================
Made available August 11, 2007 (announcement here:
http://tinyurl.com/22wq7y). Major new release that upgrades Roller to
Jave SE 5, Struts 2, Velocity 1.5 and OpenJPA. This is will be the
first release that does not require Hibernate or any other LGPL code
to run.


Community health
================
There are two very active committers at this time who are very busy
with new development, which is good. But we've been having some
problems getting new releases tested and voted out the door and
getting some of our other tasks done (e.g. getting setup to use the
mirrors properly) so we still need to work on community development
and growth.

New contributors are appearing on the mailing list, submitting patches
and detailed bug reports. Hopefully, some of these will show sustained
interest and we'll see some committer nominations.

Dave Johnson presented on *Roller and blogs as a web development
platform* at Apachecon EU in May and will   present the same talk (but
updated for Roller 4.0) at Apachecon US in November (see also
http://us.apachecon.com/us2007/program/talk/2023).

Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

Another very quiet quarter in the Santuario project.  The Java library
has worked through a number of bugfixes and issues on the list.  The
C++ library has been very quiet with almost no activity.

The Apache JuiCE podling has also been put into a dormant state due to
the lack of bandwidth from committers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Shale Project

Progress has been made this month in preparation for a 1.0.5 release.
We have resolved several bug items and incorporated the recent Jakarta
to Commons namespace changes.

The recently donation, shale-clay-plugin-for-eclipse has been pulled
into the sandbox.  We still need to consider how to best incorporate
this plugin into the nightly builds since there is a dependency with
the eclipse IDE.

With any luck, we will be able to pull together the resources to
assemble a new release within the next month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Turbine Project

(NOTE: this report authored by Siegfried Goeschl)

Development activity has been very low this month.

The ECCN issue regarding Turbine's cryptographic capabilities
is still open - we are posting the question to
legal-discuss@apache.org since no developers is confident
enough to address this topic.

We have no board-level issues at this time.

Community changes
=================
No new committers were voted in since the last board report.

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

Turbine core project
====================
No major activity this month.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

Fulcrum component project
=========================
The release candidate of fulcrum-yaafi-1.0.5 is slightly broken due to
incompatible changes of the JAMon library (used for intercepting the Avalon
services calls to measure the execution times). The main problem is the
tight coupling between the Avalon container and the various interceptor
services which is also the driving force for refactoring. The target of the
refactoring is to have a package with the interceptor logic which can be
released/updated independent from the container.

META project
============
No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project

STATUS
The Velocity project has had a quiet summer, with activity centered 
around Google Summer of Code, Velocity Tools, and Velocity DVSL.

The Velocity project has no board-level issues at this time.

COMMUNITY CHANGES
No new committers were voted in since the last board report. No new PMC
members were voted in since the last board report.

VELOCITY ENGINE PROJECT
Work continues towards a Velocity 1.6 release.

A Google Summer of Code student, Supun Kamburugamuva, successfully 
completed a series of enhancements to the macro processing features of
Velocity, which were immediately committed into the development trunk.
We are grateful to Google for supporting this program, Ross and Jukka
for administering the Apache organizational efforts and Supun for doing
such quality work.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

VELOCITY TOOLS PROJECT
The Velocity Tools team released version 2-alpha1 on July 2.  Things 
are going well and we anticipate a new alpha release soon.  There have
been some significant bugs fixed since 1.3, and the team plans to 
release a 1.3.1 or 1.4 version, though this has been delayed due to 
efforts on the 2.x branch.

VELOCITY DVSL PROJECT
DVSL version 1.0 was released on August 14.  

DVSL (Declarative Velocity Style Language) is a tool modeled after XSLT 
and is intended for general XML transformations using the Velocity 
Template Language as the templating language for the transformations.

Before releasing DVSL 1.0, the DVSL team fixed an incompatibility 
between DVSL 0.x and Velocity 1.5 and completed some minor clean up and
refactoring.  It is not a drop in replacement of DVSL 0.45 since the 
main package has changed from org.apache.tools.dvsl to org.apache.dvsl. 
This is the first binary release of DVSL though the code base has been 
around for some time, 

VELOCITY DOCBOOK PROJECT
There were no changes in the DocBook code base. No DocBook development 
happened in the last quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic,
component oriented web applications, and was established as an Apache
project in June 2007.

Summary:
Our 1.3 release is coming along, albeit at a slower pace than
expected, and our user community keeps growing. There are no issues
requiring board attention at this time.

Community:
The migration of the user mailing list from SourceForge is going well
and users are migrating without problems. User involvement is good,
both when it comes to answering questions and in willingness to submit
detailed bug reports and patches.

No new committers this month

Migration to TLP:
Wicket has been established as a top level project. Many thanks to
Apache's Infrastructure team for their help in migrating us across
from incubation.

The new user mailing list has been created and we have started telling
our users on the SourceForge mailing list to migrate to the new list.
There will be a short transition period where both lists are active,
and we have set up headers, etc. to actively encourage our users to
migrate. There are 223 subscribers to the Apache users list, where
there are 673 to the SourceForge list which shows that about 1/3rd of
users have migrated.

Software:
We are working on fixing issues for the third beta of 1.3. This is
taking longer than expected because issues keep arising, though at a
slower pace than earlier. This will position us well for a full
release candidate.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

Xalan-C
=======
Nothing to report since July 16.

Xalan-J
=======
Since July 16 a new candidate release for Xalan-J 2.7.1 was created
with additional issues fixed. The Xalan PMC voted on the release
and approved it.  Regression testing is still required and
should be done shortly.  After that the release will be posted.

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache XML Project

** General:
Things are quiet as always in XML-land, with no issues requiring board
attention. Migration of AxKit to perl.apache.org is still due.

** Xindice
Xindice development is increasing. After our last quarter release, we
added a new commiter (Natalia Shilenkova) and there has been some
development activity going on, with patches and new features planned.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

General Comments:
No project-level issues at the moment.

XML Graphics Commons:
XML Graphics Commons 1.2 has been released in July. Traffic on the
mailing list is still low but there have been a few bug reports/patches.

Batik:
No releases this quarter. Not much development lately, the committers
have been busy. We've had two Google Summer of Code students working on
Batik, though: Ivan Andjelkovic, who worked on improving the DOM Viewer
window, and Jasleen Singh, who worked on an error console window and an
animation timeline viewer window. The coding period for GSoC has now
finished, and the two students are working on fixing some remaining bugs
and cleaning the code up so that it can be committed to the repository.

FOP:
FOP 0.94 has been released on August 24, 2007. Business as usual
including the preparation for the release. There was some discussion to
bring in a wanted feature (auto table layout) via a "bounty system"
which has generated some interest but no action has been taken yet.
