 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Greg]

       Greg had nothing to report.

    B. President [Sander]

       ApacheCon EU Amsterdam was a good event, a bit exhausting with
       'Koninginnedag' right before.  The first day of the conference
       I was amazed at how many turned up for the opening planery at
       9:00AM.  Attendance was reasonable, with a good number of people
       walking in, and signing up for the final day of the conference.
       The Fast Feather track was interesting to get to know about
       incubating projects.

       Delivery of the Sun hardware was committed to today, but nothing
       arrived.  Tomorrow is a national holiday in .nl, will follow up
       with the supplier on Friday.
       As we missed the window in which Justin was in .nl to do the set
       up we are looking into alternatives (other volunteers) to help
       out with the setup, as to ensure we will get the hardware in
       production as soon as possible after arrival.

    C. Treasurer [Justin]
    
       The balances below reflect our purchase of the Sun equipment
       for the NL co-lo as well as the just-received 1Q/2Q sponsorship
       payments from HP.  The HP payment apparently got mauled by the
       USPS on its way to Jim's.
       
       3Q invoices will be issued to HP soon, as well as (really!)
       the next invoice to Google for their sponsorship.
       
       As the '06-'07 fiscal year is now over, work will start shortly
       on drafting the annual report - with a goal of preliminary
       numbers to report for the members meeting on June 5th.
       
       I am still on the lookout for good candidates to serve as
       Treasurer for the upcoming year.
       
       Current balances (as of 5/15/2007):

        Paypal             $  1,271.80 (+$    158.40)
        Checking           $ 38,037.52 (+$ 21,712.45)
        Savings            $153,771.53 (-$ 49,546.09)
        Total              $193,080.85 (-$ 27,675.24)
        
    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]

       The big news is that the ASF Members Meeting was announced for
       June 5, 2007 @ 16:00 UTC, to be held via IRC. An Email
       call for new member nominations  as well as new board
       member nominations was sent out. We are seeing a steady
       incoming list of nominees for both. The membership was
       reminded about the importance of keeping members.txt
       up-to-date since the Emails used for the ssh-based voter
       tool uses those Emails to send out ballots. I will be
       sending a "test issue" out later this week to hopefully
       see how well Emails are synced (and to allow people to adjust
       their SPAM filters, etc).

       We have received no correspondence that requires board attention.

       See Attachment B

       Approved by General Consent.

    C. Apache Forrest Project [David Crossley / Cliff]

       See Attachment C

       Justin asked about the holdup in process referred to in the
       new committer. David replied that the delay is in the
       recording of his iCLA (sent by postal mail 12 days ago). David
       is  keeping him updated so that enthusiasm doesn't wane. David
       also encouraged him to send a copy via fax, but not heard back
       from him yet. David was reminded that Email sent to secretary@
       and legal-archive@ of the scanned documenent is also acceptable.

       Approved by General Consent.

    D. Apache HiveMind Project [James Carman / Ken]

       See Attachment D

       The board discussed the issue of a "Call for new chair"
       returning NULL from the committers. It was agreed that if
       there are no candidates for the chair, and the current
       chair steps down, there is no real alternative but to close down
       the PMC, the chair being the most visible part of the PMC -- at
       least from a board perspective. The board will find out how
       long ago the call went out.

       Approved by General Consent.

    E. Apache HTTP Server Project [Roy T. Fielding / Sander]

       See Attachment E

       Sander expressed some question on what it meant  to adopt the
       mod_wombat codebase prior to it's adoption? Roy answered that
       the codebase was accepted but it is currently being discussed
       how best to utilize it.

       Approved by General Consent.

    F. Apache Lenya Project [Gregor J. Rothfuss / Jim]

       See Attachment F

       The board expressed question and concern over Lenya's mention
       of a large number of "emeritus" PMC members. It was noted that
       the board (and bylaws) do not recognize the concept of an emeritus
       PMC member. However, if this is simply internal bookkeeping that
       allows the PMC to honor past contributions while keeping the PMC to
       active members, the board had no concern.
       
       There was concern over the large number, and the board was
       curious on what could be happening to cause so many PMC members
       to "leave" the PMC. Sander was to investigate.

       Approved by General Consent.

    G. Apache Logging Project [Curt Arnold / Henri]

       See Attachment G

       Approved by General Consent.

    H. Apache Perl Project [Geoffrey Young / Greg]

    J. Apache Santuario Project [Berin Lautenbach / Dirk]

       See Attachment J

       Approved by General Consent.

    K. Apache Velocity Project [Henning Schmiedehausen / Cliff]

       See Attachment K

       The board discussed the PR-related issues mentioned in
       the report. Jim indicated that the timeline mention in
       the report was not quite correct, since the 1st draft
       differed from the 2nd quite a bit, so it was "unfair"
       to suggest that the approval process was as long as
       implied. Jim was to follow up with Henning.

       Approved by General Consent.

    L. Apache Xalan Project [Brian Minchau / Justin]

       See Attachment L

       No report.

    M. Apache Xerces Project [Gareth Reakes / Greg]

       See Attachment M

       There was again discussion over with the overall concept of
       Labs is shared and common with all projects and people. Justin
       noted that there is still some confusion about what goes there.
       He suggested sending an email to all committers introducing
       Apache Labs. Henri indicated that the codebase in question,
       NekoHTML is a  product released in a ~login by one committer. 
       Greg reminded the board that users aren't allowed to do a release
       from ~login, but only from dist. Releases must be covered by one
       of our TLPs.

       Approved by General Consent.

    N. Apache XML Project [Gianugo Rabellino / Sam]

       See Attachment N

       It was noted that the "maximum of two committers" in the
       XMP PMC Bylaws seems a significant deviation from standard
       ASF methods. The board will strongly recommend that those
       bylaws be amended.

       Approved by General Consent.

    O. Apache XML Graphics Project [Jeremias Maerki / Henri]

       See Attachment O

       Approved by General Consent.

    P. Apache Felix Project [Richard Hall / Ken]

       See Attachment P

       Approved by General Consent.

    Q. Apache Incubator Project [Noel J. Bergman / Jim]

       See Attachment Q

       Henri noted that the board received some good questions from Jukka
       regarding StdCxx, although this is an issue that the Incubator should
       be addressing. Justin to follow up on this.
       
       It was also noted that some podling reports still are not providing
       requested information such as "Steps required for graduation"
       (Abdera and others). Also, many are providing their reports in
       Wiki markup (cut-paste) instead of formatted for text. The Incubator
       will be contacted to fix these issues.
       
       The main discussion was regarding the Tuscany community split
       (Fabric3). The board agreed that it was potentially worrisome,
       and would watch this issue.

       Approved by General Consent.

    R. Apache Portals Project [Santiago Gala / Henri]

       See Attachment R

       Justin provided insight regarding the Gmail/Apache issue mentioned
       in the report.  Gmail does not forge the envelope - so the person's
       @gmail.com address needs to be in the allow list in ezmlm. Justin
       suggested that perhaps the moderators for that list have not been
       active. Henri also suggested that the moderator is unable to do 
       their moderate operations.

       Approved by General Consent.

    S. Apache ActiveMQ Project [Brian McCallister / Greg]

       See Attachment S

       Approved by General Consent.

    T. Apache XMLBeans Project [Cezar Andrei / Cliff]

       See Attachment T

       Greg asked if the xmlbeansc++ subproject was closed or not.
       Cliff to follow up.

       Approved by General Consent.

    U. Apache Maven Project [Jason van Zyl / Ken]

       See Attachment U

       Henri noted that Maven training has been quite active lately,
       with user training at ApacheCon (via a tutorial/training) and
       user/mngr training at JavaOne.

       Approved by General Consent.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of JCP

The Apache Software Foundation was selected by the JCP as the 
JCP "Member of the Year".  We received the award at the annual 
JCP awards ceremony held at the JavaOne conference on May 9.  
This is the second time in three years that we have won, and 
reflects the community's recognition of our broad and deep 
participation in the expert groups, our multiple implementations 
of specifications in opens source, as well as our drive at the 
EC level to continually push the JCP towards more openness and 
transparency.

In other news, Sun did not respond in any material way to our 
open letter of April 10, 2007.  There was one official blog 
response, but it didn't touch any of the issues raised in the 
letter, but simply appeared to be talking around the issue and 
pointing to unrelated things, like the their own open source 
Java SE project OpenJDK.  

We now must decide what to do for our next steps.  We are now 
shining light on a every big bug in the JCP, and the big question 
for us - as this bug shows that the JCP is incompatible with 
open source - is if the JCP is able to solve the problem, and 
if not, what should we do as a participant.  I think these are 
two questions that can be discussed in parallel, but will resolve 
sequentially.  To that end, I'd like to now ask for formal help 
from members of the EC in solving this problem, and see what 
rapid progress can be made.

Attachment 3: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

In April, Mark Thomas continued his audit of security issues fixed in
Tomcat but not documented with CVE names.  Mark Thomas and Joe Orton
were added to the Security Team Project.  There continues to be a
steady stream of reports of various kinds arriving at
security@apache.org. These continue to be dealt with promptly by the
security team.  For April 2007 we had 13 non-SPAM requests:

  46% ( 6) Actual report of a vulnerability (both valid and invalid)
  38% ( 5) User asks support question
   8% ( 1) Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
   8% ( 1) Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report

Attachment 4: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

The Travel Assistance Committee is awaiting the release and
announcement of Speakers and Sessions for the ApacheCon US 2007
conference before announcing the Call For Nominees for the
assistance program.

Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Audit Project

The Audit committee are currently inactive. The outstanding issue is
to find an external auditor for the ASF accounts, but this is not
actively being worked on.

It's assumed that we'll be offering Justin our time in the third
quarter to help on the tax return, including doing a final walkthrough
of the return before it is sent in.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Public Relations Project

The PRC was informed on April 29, 2007 that the maven.org domain
will be "shutting down" over the next month or so. It is expected
that the domain will cease to exist around June 1, 2007. Thus, the
trademark issue regarding the usage of "Maven" will be moot.

The PRC make a request to Infrastructure for a Vhost/redirect
record for 'sponsor.apache.org'. Sponsor logos are ready to
be provided to current sponsors and the Thanks Page is currently
designed but not yet committed.

There are 3 news releases in process: A Covalent PR which the
PRC was asked to review and "approve" and 2 actual ASF releases:
Synapse 1.0.0 release and Axis2/C 1.0.0 release. These are
currently being reviewed by the PRC and Sally.

The PRC (and others) received a request from Information Week
for "photos" and other material (such as code screen shots)
to support an article by Charlie Babcock where he selected
Apache HTTP Server as the "greatest web software ever written."

It was noted on the PRC list that "we" do a terrible job manning
conference booths. It was noted that there are several reasons why
this is the case:

 1. The ASF doesn't pay for people to attend these conferences, so when
    we do man the booths, it's because we are there anyway. But we are
    there anyway because either:

       a. Our companies are there, so we have booth time
          with that booth
       b. We are attending because we want to see presentations;
       c. We are attending because we're presenting.

    All of these imply limited time to man a booth.

 2. We have no marketing collateral.

 3. For whatever reason, manning a booth is not deemed a "priority".

Certainly the PRC should help with #2.

Finally, there was a trademark issue that was not handled by the PRC
directly, but under the Tomcat PMC. In summary: Filip Hanik spotted a
site that was vaguely using the Tomcat logo and name.  Mark Thomas asked
that site to "change its ways" on behalf of the Tomcat PMC.  The site
owner complied quickly and fully.

Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

RELEASES / ONGOING WORK
- Cocoon 2.2 core can be considered as "feature complete" now.
- Most of the work for a relaunch of our website has been done.
- Although planned there have been no releases in the last 3 months.
  The release of Cocoon 2.2RC1 is planned for May though.

COMMUNITY
- new committers and PMC members: Grzegorz Kossakowski,
  Jeroen Reijn, Felix Knecht
- emeritus PMC members: Guido Casper, Matthew Langham
- Jeroen Reijn and Andrew Savory, both Cocoon committers, held talks
  about Cocoon at the ApacheCon in Amsterdam.

LEGAL
- no issues

Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Issues needing board attention
------------------------------
None

Changes in the PMC membership
-----------------------------
We elected one new committer and PMC member Brian Dube <bdube>.
Brian accepted, but the process is still happening.

General status
--------------
Progress has been generally slow this quarter. Most devs seem busy with other
stuff.

We have two "Google Summer of Code" students this year.

Issues still to be dealt with by the Forrest PMC
------------------------------------------------
Just the usual continue to develop project guidelines doc.

Progress of the project
-----------------------
At the end of April we gathered some steam and released Forrest-0.8 version.
Locationmaps define the mapping from requests to locations, which enables
content and resources to be located at various different sources.

Attachment D: Status report for the Apache HiveMind Project

NEWS

- A HiveMind-2.0-apha-1 release was cut.
- I have requested that someone else take over the reigns as chair of the 
  HiveMind project.  My work schedule has left me with little time.  As of 
  yet, none of the committers has taken me up on the offer.  They all 
  seem to be just as busy as me.

SVN ACTIVITY (02/14/2007 - 03/15/2007)

HiveMind2: There were 236 commits with the last one occurring on 02/19.  
           Achim performed all commits.

HiveMind1: There were no commits.


NOTES

The HiveMind development community struggles to maintain itself.  All of 
our active committers are busy with other endeavors (work, other projects 
like Tapestry5, etc.).  What happens to a top-level project if its 
development community dwindles away?


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

The Apache HTTP server project has coasted through much of the quarter
without any significant issues.  We have no board-level issues at this
time.

We have added three new committers: Guenter Knauf and Eric Covener
(pending account creation) for httpd, and Brian McCallister for
mod_wombat.

We have not done any releases for httpd, libapreq, mod_python,
mod_ftp, mod_smtp, mod_wombat, or flood.  The next httpd build is
on hold until the next release of APR, though progress is being made
on the large number of open bugzilla issues in the mean time.  The
libapreq team has been testing release candidates for libapreq 1.34,
which will hopefully result in a real release vote some time soon.

mod_ftp has enjoyed new participation by several committers and
commentators since it's graduation, and is working towards an initial
ASF release (apart from the core httpd server distribution).  The
remaining showstopper is the addition of IPv6-necessary features
(EPRT and EPSV).

No progress has been made in moving mod_python to its own TLP,
but the conversation has been restarted on the python-dev mailing
list and hopefully will result in a resolution for next month.

We have completed adoption of the mod_wombat code base and are
making progress in understanding what that means.

No progress has been made on the next generation of httpd,
code-named amsterdam, though more people have begun to add to
the suggestion lists.  We were hoping to have some discussion
during the hackathon at ApacheCon EU 2007, but several key people
were not able to come and the rest were busy planning the conference
or working on poorly-timed coincidental releases for their employers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Lenya Project

LEGAL
- no issues

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Logging Project

PMC membership:

Ron Grabowski was elected to PMC after several years of contributions
to the log4net project.

PMC actions:

A vote on a log4j 1.2.15 release candidate failed to reach quorum in
late February and early March with only one PMC member voting.  The
lack of response from PMC members was disappointing.  However with
the recent addition of Ron and the increased activity related to
log4j 1.3 and Chainsaw should allow a second attempt to muster enough
votes to reach quorum.

log4j:

There has been substantial increase in activity in log4j in April.
The lack of process towards a log4j 1.3 release was discussed in
http://marc.info/?l=log4j-dev&m=117577748713465&w=2.   log4j 1.3
development has now effectively abandoned in favor of back-porting
log4j 1.3 features for use by log4j 1.2 users and development of
log4j 2.0 designed for JDK 1.5 and later.  A substantial part of the
new features in log4j 1.3 has been packaged in a series of companion
products for log4j 1.2.  Several of the companions will work with
established log4j 1.2.x releases, while a few will only work with
log4j 1.2.15 and later.  log4j 2.0 design experimental was started by
refactoring the pattern-layout component.  All the new companions are
built using Maven 2 and work on converting log4j to use Maven 2 for
documentation and release packaging is underway.  The intent is to
have a mass vote on log4j 1.2.15, the associated companions and a
reworked Logging Services site when all the pieces are complete.

Chainsaw:

Chainsaw has been able to break its dependency on log4j 1.3 with a
combination of the prospective log4j 1.2.15 and several of the log4j
companions.  A vote on a Chainsaw release is expected in conjunction
with the log4j 1.2.15 release.

log4cxx:

Little development activity on log4cxx during this period.  A log4cxx
release is expected to follow the push toward the log4j 1.2.15 release.

log4net:

log4net graduated from the incubator at the start of the quarter.
Little development activity during the period.  A log4net release is
anticipated in the near future.

log4php:

log4php was retired from incubation.  The SVN repository was moved to
repos/asf/incubator/log4php.

Other:

Rony Flatscher (rony@apache.org) inquired about bringing into Logging
Services an log4j-like framework for Open Object Rexx that he has
been developing.  Since he is already an Apache committer, Apache
Labs might be the appropriate venue for further development with a
potential trip through the incubator if the project gains momentum.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Perl Project

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

It was an exciting quarter for mod_perl 1.x, as the first and only
official security vulnerability for mod_perl was reported.

 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1349

The mod_perl 1.x svn repository was patched within hours of the
initial report, with a full release available in under a week.
All in all, things were handled very well, and the initial
impressions of the severity of the vulnerability turned out to
be far beyond the actual severity once things were properly analyzed.

Recent releases:

 1.30 - March 29, 2007


--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

No new Apache-Test releases since the last report.


--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Recent releases:

 0.91 - March 29, 2007


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Matt Sergeant completed the Inucbator software grant process as
best we could all understand it, and Apache-Reload was imported
into ASF repositories on April 23, 2007.

We have not yet released Apache-Reload.


-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be an active and healthy development community -
bugs are found, bugs are fixed, development moves forward as usual.


-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is, as always, thriving.  nothing noteworthy
has happened since the last report.


-- PMC --

the PMC invited long-time developer Steve Hay to join the project
as a full committer.  Steve accepted and was granted full karma
to all mod_perl repositories at the ASF.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Roller Project

We made our graduation announcement and released Apache Roller 3.1, but
this month we're still working on multiple upcoming releases. The
community is active and getting along well. Here are the details.

Graduation announcement and Roller 3.1 release

We postponed our graduation announcement until the Roller 3.1 release
was ready and made a simultaneous 3.1 and graduation announcement just
in time for ApacheCon EU and JavaOne 2007. Here's the announcement:
http://tinyurl.com/2ns42y

Upcoming Releases: Roller 4.0

The original plan for Roller 4.0 was to make "infrastructure" changes
including upgrades to Java SE 5, new non-Hibernate back-end, Struts2,
Velocity 1.5 and XMLRPC 3.0. Now the plans are expanding to include some
more features to be implemented by Sun and IBM, full Struts2 migration
(and possible a new installer).

Last month we reported that consensus seems to point to a May release
for 4.0, because we still have work to do on testing our new back-end
and because we've decided to do a complete Struts2 migration instead of
simply migrating a couple of key pages. Allen Gilliland has made
tremendous progress on the Struts2 works and has written an excellent
migration guide to help others pitch in.
[http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ROLLER/Struts2+Migration]

Upcoming bug fix release: Roller 3.1.1

A number of serious but easy to fix bugs have been found in the Roller
3.1 release, so we've proposed a Roller 3.1.1 release with a first RC
before the end of May 2007.
[http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ROLLER/Proposal+Roller+3.1.1+Release]

Upcoming XSS security fix releases: Roller 2.3.1 and 3.0.1

A number of XSS security vulnerabilities were reported in Roller 2.3 and
3.0. We worked with the reporter to detail and fix the problems and
prepared "patch" releases 2.3.1 and 3.0.1. We have release candidates
ready for those releases, *we're still having problems finding time to
test them*.

Post graduation work

Still need to move the JIRA issue tracker over to Apache infrastructure.

Community

The community is getting along fine with lots of discussion on the topic
of new features. Mailing list traffic seems to have picked up a bit
since the graduation/Roller 3.1 announcement. Dave Johnson spoke at
ApacheCon EU 2007 on Roller and blogs as a web development platform and
submitted several Roller related talks for ApacheCon US 2007 (November).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

The java xml-security team have just released version 1.4.1 incorporating
a number of bug fixes.

On the C++ side, Scott Cantor was voted in as a new committer. Otherwise
quiet for the C++ library.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project

General information
===================

The Apache Velocity project had an exciting first quarter of 2007 with
the long anticipated release of the Velocity engine.

We have no board-level issues at this time.

Our various releases since the beginning of 2007 sent a clear message
out to the Java world that the Velocity project was never dormant and
is picking up speed. The number of messages on the develpment and user
lists reflect this nicely. The Velocity Engine 1.5 release was covered
in depth on various Java related web sites (e.g. theserverside.com).

The Velocity project tried to organize a formal press release for the
Velocity engine release and even postponed the official release date
to get possible better coverage. Will Glass-Husain worked as our
liaison with the PRC.

Unfortunately, this press release did not work out. While we tried to
work in a timely manner (we started six weeks before the actual
release date collecting quotes from Velocity users for the release and
circulated drafts to the PRC), Will reported that the PRC did not
respond at times and seemed to be dormant and he had to ping the chair
directly. Various objections came up only hours before the intended
release date even though we tried to give ample time for the PRC to
review drafts. In the end, the Velocity PMC decided to withdraw the
press release draft.

The experience working with the PRC was interesting, though not
entirely good. We hope that the PRC and other PMCs can learn from our
experience and we streamline the review/feedback process for the next
time.

The Velocity project created three new sub projects in Q1:

  - Velocity Anakia, formerly a part of the Velocity Engine

  - Velocity Texen, formerly a part of the Velocity Engine

  - Velocity DocBook Framework, intended to generate high-quality
    documentation suitable for on-line viewing and printing

The Velocity project has discussed to sponsor the incubation of the
Click Framework, which is based on Velocity. The Click community has
already reached consensus that they want to be incubated to become an
Apache project; discussion is still open whether this will be a
sub-project of Velocity or a TLP in its own right. We expect to see a
formal incubation proposal in Q2.


Community changes
=================

Claude Brisson was voted to become a member of the Velocity PMC on
April, 3rd. He accepted his nomination.

No new committers were added to the Velocity project in Q1.


Google Summer of Code
=====================

The Velocity community is proud that a proposal to the Google Summer
of Code 2007 was accepted:

Supun Madhushanka Kamburugamuva will work to improve the Velocity
Macro capabilities (see:
http://code.google.com/soc/asf/appinfo.html?csaid=75DF2BC1378C84A5 ),
Will Glass-Husain, Velocity PMC member will mentor him.


Velocity Engine project
=======================

The Velocity Engine team released Apache Velocity 1.5 on March 13th. 

Work on Velocity 1.x continues at the usual pace.


Velocity Tools project
======================

Velocity Tools currently works towards a 2.0 release. No release have
been made in Q1.


Velocity DVSL project
=====================

Since the inception of the Velocity TLP, the DVSL code base was not
changed and there seems to be no interest in it from users and
developers. We will discuss mothballing it in Q2.


Velocity Anakia
===============

Anakia is an old/new tool that used to be part of the Velocity engine.
It was spun out of the engine after the 1.5 release to allow different
release cycles.

Velocity Anakia 1.0, which is just a repackaged version, was released
on April 28th.


Velocity Texen
===============

Texen is an old/new tool that used to be part of the Velocity
engine. It was spun out of the engine after the 1.5 release to allow
different release cycles.

Velocity Texen 1.0, which is just a repackaged version, was released
on April 28th.


Velocity DocBook Framework
==========================

The DocBook Framework is intended to help everyone that wants to write
documentation in an industry-wide accepted format that is suitable for
printing and on-line viewing.

For the time being (and because it is used to generate the Velocity
documentation), this stays as part of the Velocity project. If it fits
better into another TLP in the future, it is expected to leave
Velocity).

Velocity DocBook Framework 1.0 was released on April 9th.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J

Xerces-J was fortunate to be awarded one Google Summer of Code project
this year. Starting later this month Wei Duan (the new student) will be
working on the XMLStreamReader for the StAX implementation which has been
under development on a branch in SVN.

In April, there was a bit of discussion on the possible donation of
NekoHTML to Xerces-J. Given the past experience with the HTML DOM and WML
DOM there's been some apprehension about accepting code into the project
which is not likely to have an active maintainer. Apache Labs was
suggested as a possible home for NekoHTML but it appears that it is more
suited for new research experiments. Also in April, we were given a
heads-up by a developer who is doing a  port of Xerces-J to Actionscript 3
(AS3): an EcmaScript 4 implementation, currently used in Adobe Flash
Player 9. He might be interested in donating this code to Apache at some
point in the future.

On the development front, there have been many fixes applied to the XML
Schema and DOM implementations for bugs exposed by the W3C test suites. No
releases so far this year.

Xerces-C

Its been quiet over the last 3 months. The most significant development
over has been the integration of XInclude support into Xerces-C. There has
not been enough work on testing new build system to feel comfortable
releasing it. Hopefully that will change this quarter.

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. Just a few posts to the mailing list. No
development activity.

XML Commons

Aside from a couple bug fixes applied to the JAXP 1.3 API code and a few
questions from users, there's been little project activity so far this
year. The xml-commons-external-1.2.06 (JAXP 1.2) release is still pending.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache XML Project

The XML PMC has been quiet as usual, and possibly more. It's
definitely time to get our act together and start shaping the future
(whatever that means).

The good news is the long-awaited release of Xindice 1.1, which
started some nice discussion and activity on the xindice-dev list:
looks like the project isn't quite dead, and it's worth pursuing more
development on that side of the pond. The bad news is that it's been
hard to get the required PMC vote to release the software, as the very
few members that hang around don't seem to be active anymore. We
needed a somewhat "liberal" interpretation of what is a +1 to actually
have the green light and get the release out of the door. Given there
were many contributions recently (since 2006/11) from one user -
patches to existing bug reports, as well as new bug fixes and
enhancements - we might want to take a note and possibly add another
committer in the future.

It would also help a lot if we can add a third Xindice committer to
the PMC - this would resolve our inability to do releases due to
overall low activity of XML PMC. Currently, the XML PMC bylaws allow a
maximum of two committers per project, but this is clearly something
that needs to be changed.

This said, the move of AxKit is definitely planned for the next
quarter, after having being delayed way too much, while it might be
worth considering what to do with Xindice given the recent activity
burst.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

General Comments

No project-level issues at the moment.

XML Graphics Commons

Not much activity here during the last three months. Only a new
component in the PostScript area was added.

Batik

Batik has released version 1.7beta1 after a longer period with no
releases.
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/xmlgraphics-batik-users/200703.mbox/%3c20070330045338.GE5371@arc.mcc.id.au%3e

Otherwise, bugs are being fixed. Especially the newly added animation
part is improved.

Cameron McCormack will be mentoring two Google Summer of Code students.

FOP

No releases this quarter. We've had quite a few patches from new
contributors. Not all have been processed, yet, as everyone is quite
busy. Otherwise, we see the usual improvements/bugfixes happening. The
most important additions this quarter were support for exact positioning
of link destinations and for the collapsing border model.

Three team members, Vincent, Simon and Jeremias, met at ApacheCon Europe. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Felix Project

Community

   * Several Felix community members attended and met at ApacheCon EU.
   * Conducted a Feathercast interview about Felix which is pending
     publication.
   * Lots of mentions of OSGi technology at various JavaOne sessions,
     including some that explicitly included mentions of Apache Felix.
     Session on JSR 291 included a demo of Apache Felix running on
     Apache Harmony.

Migration to TLP

   * Created a web page to monitor the progress of the TLP migration
     tasks
     (http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FELIX/TLP+Task+List).
   * Mailing lists have been migrated.
   * Subversion repository has been migrated.
   * Removed incubator disclaimer from all NOTICE files.
   * Web site (felix.apache.org) is now redirected to our generated
     static wiki pages.

Software

   * Various smallish commits.

Licensing and other issues

   * None.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

We are revising the web site documentation to help better describe the
processes, policies and procedures.  No substantive policy changes, just
improved clarity.

All in all, things seem to be going fairly well.  Nothing major on a general
level to report during the short interval between the April and May reports.
Lokahi got a lot of exposure at ApacheCon EU in Amsterdam, and hopefully can
build on that in the coming months.

TSIK, which failed to report this month, is being marked as dormant at the
request of the WS PMC, which had sponsored it.  Yoko, however, is active,
and simply failed to provide a report on time.

Projects that fail to report will be asked if they are to be moved to a
dormant status.  In the case of projects that are active and fail to provide
a report, they will be barred from performing releases until they have
cleared up their reporting responsibilities.

----

Abdera

Abdera is an implementation of the Atom Publishing Protocol and Atom
Syndication Format.

Incubating since: 2006-06-05

Abdera has continued work on version 0.3.0, and is waiting for the Atom
Publication Protocol to be completed by the Atom WG so that we can finalize
support for it.

Additionally, there was some discussion of the best way to handle vendor
specific extensions in Abdera.  The consensus seems to be that there was no
objection to having them as long as the extension was clearly defined in a
public spec that was available under reasonable licensing terms.

We continue to see questions from new community members, which indicates
that the code is being used, and when possible we've been trying to
encourage them to contribute back to the project.  Hopefully that will
result in some new committers in the reasonably near future.

----

Lokahi

Lokahi is a configuration and management console for Apache httpd, tomcat
and other web server infrastructure.

Incubating since:  2006-01-07

Several members of the Lokahi community attended Apachecon EU in an effort
to grow the community.  A FastFeather track on what Lokahi does and what it
currently supports (slides are available
here:http://people.apache.org/~toback/presentations/Lokahi-fast-feather-05-0
4-2007.pdf ).  Specific outreach was made to the Geronimo community to help
us get a sense of what it would take to have Lokahi control the Geronimo
stack.  A significant number of committers from other projects have
subscribed to lokahi-dev over ApacheCon after discovering how this project
could solve their own infrastructure headaches or how it could be enhanced
to support their project's configuration and management. An initial roadmap
of features has been planned, and development will be moving in the
direction of the new roadmap.  An initial draft of Lokahi's data model for
the proposed switch to a Jackrabbit back-end was worked out with input from
Jackrabbit community.

The conversion to JCR takes first priority because it will mitigate existing
difficulties that hinder community-growing, namely:

(a) Oracle as db requirement, which reduces the potential user "market";
(b) inability to run Lokahi on a standalone machine, due to (a);
(c) complicated build process, partially due to (a);

JCR will provide the following benefits:
(a) database independence (run Lokahi with a file system backend to
try it out, or use a more robust storage platform for production) + embedded
Derby db
(b) lower barrier to contribution, see (a)
(c) versioned objects -- the basis for storing versioned configuration files
& foundation for a future "undo" feature requested by users.  Great for
real-world use in regulated environments which require detailed audit trails
of who-changed-what-and-when.

Obstacles to graduation:

 * community - now includes authors outside of the original dev community,
but additional committers are sought.  Recent distractions reinforced the
fact that a larger committer base is needed to graduate.

 * licensing - oracle-only backend is now 90% of the way to an alternate
MySQL backend, and soon to be enhanced with license agnostic interfaces

NMaven

NMaven develops plugins and integration for Maven to make building and using
.NET languages a first-class citizen in Maven.

Incubating since: 2006-11-17

Items to resolve before graduation
 * More active committer involvement. This involves getting a group of
developers familiar with the NMaven internals (both .NET and Java), as well
as growing a larger community of developers who are creating Maven plugins
in .NET.
 * Engage other ASF projects (Lucene.NET, log4net) to see if NMaven can meet
any of their needs
 * Need a fair amount of work in getting the features in place so that we
can automate releases of the .NET assemblies and projects. Getting on a
regular schedule of releases, should help grow the community.

Status:
 * Active involvement from the community has been a little slow; but has
picked up recently, as seen by the recent increase of discussions on the
mailing list and community interest in submitting patches for features.
 * Published 6-month Road Map on Wiki
 * The latest features of writing Maven plugins directly in .NET and of IDE
integration between Maven and Visual Studio are both targeted directly
toward .NET developers. These features are expected to increase developer
interest from the .NET community, particularly among those who may not have
had previous experience with Java or Maven.
 * Fast feather talk on NMaven at ApacheCon in effort to increase community
interest in project

Plans:
 * Work on getting the site documentation up-to-date with the latest
features
 * Work on improving IDE features
 * Preparing for a release

RCF

RCF is a rich component set for JSF. Incubation has started a couple of
weeks ago. The SVN, mailing lists and JIRA need to be set up. We are now
waiting for an import of a current code drop into the repository.

Incubating since: May 2007

----

ServiceMix

ServiceMix is an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) built on Java Business
Integration (JBI, aka JSR 208).  The project has been in incubation since
18.11.2005.

Since the last board report, three new committers have been voted in (Alex
Boisvert, Thomas Termin and Gert Vanthienen), which brings the total number
of committers to 30.

The team started the process to release a bug fix version of ServiceMix
(3.1.1).  In the meanwhile, development efforts continue towards a new major
release, with new features, version updates of core libraries (ActiveMQ,
XBean, Geronimo, ...) and improved ease of development for the end users
(Maven Archetypes).  Also, additional quality assurance tools are being
integrated into the project build cycle to improve the existing codebase.

Since there appear to be no more outstanding issues for graduation, the
discussion about this has recently started on the mailing lists.  The
majority of the community agrees that a top-level project would be more
suitable, considering the size of the project and the community supporting
it.

   under the Apache license version 2.

''iPMC Comments:''
 * jukka: I'm qurious about http://incubator.apache.org/stdcxx/#committers.
Why some people are following CTR and others RTC? Also, the comment
"committers in italics do not have a signed Contributor License Agreement on
file" doesn't make sense. You can't be a committer without a CLA on file.

Tika

Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text
content from various documents using existing parser libraries.

Incubating since: March 22nd, 2007.

__Community__

We had a good project bootstrap meeting as a part of the text analysis BOF
at the ApacheCon EU in Amsterdam. The resulting ideas were summarized on the
project mailing list, and the first design threads have started.

__Development__

We've started discussing the design of the Tika toolkit. It seems like we
will select one of the existing codebases listed in the project proposal as
the basis of an early 0.1 release, and start refactoring the code into a
more generic toolkit. The Tika svn tree is still empty, but I expect us to
see the first code commits before the next report.

__Infrastructure__

All the initial infrastructure is now in place. There is still some activity
on the temporary Tika wiki on the Google Project hosting service, so we may
end up requesting a Tika wiki to be set up on the ASF infrastructure.

__Issues before graduation__

The Tika project is still at an early stage of incubation. The most
important tasks before graduation are to develop and release the Tika
codebase and to grow a diverse and sustainable project community.

TSIK

TSIK will be moved to dormant status, after a successful PMC vote to do so.

Tuscany

Tuscany provides infrastructure for developing service-oriented applications
based on Service Component Architecture (SCA) specification and Service Data
Objects (SDO) specifications. These specifications were submitted to OASIS
in March 2007 by OSOA (www.osoa.org)

Incubating since: 2006-11-30

Top issue? Need to get back on track with agreed project goals, provide a
stable codebase/SPIs, and follow up with regular releases. This should
create an environment that will attract a growing and diverse community of
users and developers. We are working towards this.

Community aspects:

   * Voted in Adriano Crestani, an individual contributor, as a committer
for his contributions to DAS project.
   * Voted in Andy Grove from RogueWave as a committer for his lengthy list
of contributions to the SDO project.
   * Have been receiving many good user questions and have received good
feedback on quality of responses that were provided.
   * Enhanced Tuscany website to improve information sharing. We are
working on user and architecture guides for contributors or users of
Tuscany.
   * Integration with Apache projects
         o Working with Apache Directory to provide DAS LDAP.
         o Integrated with BSF and Axis2.
   * Fractal is working on integration with Tuscany SCA Java
   * 3 of the commmitters (Jeremy Boynes, Jim Marino and Meeraj)chose to
start a new open source project called Fabric3 in March 2007.

Code:

   * Released M3 incubator release of Native SCA and SDO C++ in early May.
   * Formed Community Test Suite for SDO which has been receiving many
contributions, over 300 tests.
   * In the process of releasing Java SDO Beta1 incubator release. It has
community approval and is going through IPMC approval.
   * In the process of releasing SCA Java. This release is focused on
improved usability, stability (stable SPIs) and modularity. Stable and
simple SPIs and modularity enhance extensibility of SCA for integration with
other open source projects.

Note: OSOA is a collaboration group where the first version of SCA and SDO
spec were developed, see: http://www.osoa.org


----

Woden

Woden is a Java class library for reading, validating, manipulating,
creating and writing WSDL documents, initially to support WSDL 2.0 and with
the longer term aim of supporting past, present and future versions of WSDL.

Incubating since: 2005

In April, we released Milestone 7a to support the Axis2 1.2 release. This
was a minor update to M7 released in February.

The M8 release is now under development. This will add full support for
WSDL2 assertions (the non-schema validation rules) and will improve Woden's
WSDL extensions API.  M8 will likely be ready around late June / early July,
around the time the spec could be moving to a full W3C Recommendation. With
M8, the project should achieve it's first primary goal which was to support
the W3C WSDL2 working group's efforts by providing a compliant
implementation of the spec.

Post-M8 goals are to exit incubation and to review and stabilize the API so
that we can ship a 1.0 release. Other functional requirements include WSDL
serialization and support for WSDL 1.1.

The team has been addressing the following issues regarding exiting
incubation:
 * building our public key presence on the Apache web of trust
 * adding developer documentation to the web site (to do)
 * attempting to grow the developer community (3 potential contributors
unrelated to existing committers. 2 have submitted code already. The 3rd was
a Google Summer of Code prospect whose GSoC proposal (Woden serialization)
was rejected, but he's still keen to contribute this function.)

----

WSRP4J

The WSRP4J Project is an implementation of WSRP 1.0 Producer. WSRP is an
OASIS specification that describes a protocol which allows portlets to be
accessed remotely using Web Services.

Incubating since: 2003

The project is very silent, there are nearly no user questions and nearly
zero developer activity. Although there seems to be a medium to high
interest in wsrp over the past years, no community could be built around
wsrp4j. There is still an open patent issue. The portals PMC is aware of
these problems and will address them asap.

''iPMC Comments:''
 * jukka: Good that someone is looking into this.

----

XAP

XAP is an XML-based Ajax application framework that supports application
development via declaritive XML pages backed by Javascript event handlers.

Incubating since: Summer 2006

Code/Release Status:
 *The first release was performed shortly after the last board report.

Recent Actvity:
 *Dojo widget libray upgraded to 0.4
 *Changed the way certain layout managers function to work better together
and cover more cases.
 *Various window behavior improvements and bug fixes, better styling of
titlebar, icons, etc.
 *Better support for imbedding HTML in XML and vice-versa.
 *Various misc. widget improvments - more control over table styling,
support for low-level mouse events (mouse move, mouse over, etc), cursor
support, background image support, etc.

To Resolve Before Graduation:
 *More diverse community.
 *More community discussion on various development issues.
 *More complex use cases / sample applications

Community Issues:
 *Recently voted to add 2 new committers. (Vote results not yet tallied)

Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Portals Project

The quest for a new Chair is taking longer than expected, as we
implemented the decision to invite all active committers to the Portals
PMC, so that they could take part in the vote for a new chair. 

We have progressed in the sense that people has been invited, and a
substantial part accepted. But getting everybody subscribed to the
private@ list, and attending a roll call there, in a world were our
server is no longer accepting @apache.org addresses forwarded via gmail
is taking forever.

The new chair election is pending that we complete a roll call in
private@, so that we know all voters are listening before we start the
vote.

Other than this, pluto release 1.1.3 has been voted, and some fresh
activity around wsrp4j has been started after face to face meetings in
ApacheCON Europe.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache ActiveMQ Project

ActiveMQ has made two releases in the past month:

* The ActiveMQ C++ Client (ActiveMQ CPP) has released version 2.0.1,
a bugfix release.

* The ActiveMQ CMS API 1.0 has been released. CMS is an
implementation-independent API for messaging for C++, analogous to
JMS for Java. The ActiveMQ CPP client implements this API for ActiveMQ.

In addition to these releases, the Camel component, used for routing
messages, has been moved out of the primary ActiveMQ server code tree
into its own sub-project as it looks like it will have a release
cycle independent of the the ActiveMQ server.

The user and development lists remain very active, and things are
going well.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

Development increased to the end of the quarter in order to push for a new 
release. The preparations for the new release influenced traffic on both 
dev and user lists, but weve also seen an increased traffic from user 
community unrelated to the release.

There were no new committers or PMC changes.

A new release is in the process, there has been already 2 RC-s, and the 
third is in the making to include a change request to remove the QName 
and NamespaceContext classes from the xmlbeans jar.

xmlbeansc++ subproject: XMLBeans PMC and subproject mentor Cliff Schmidt 
recommended in the last board report to close the subproject due to lack 
of interest from committers and community.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Maven Project

Goings on
---------------------------

There were meetups at both ApacheCon EU and JavaOne. At JavaOne we
primarily did planning for Maven 2.1. At ApacheCon we did ...

There is a reworking of Maven Archetype which is our prototyping
mechanism and is being carried out by Raphael Pieroni.

A new project is being prototyped in the sandbox to create a new
Maven distribution for the Enterprise. Aptly named Maven Enterprise.
The majority of the work done here by Andrew Williams.

Two new projects were donated to our sister Eclipse project at
Codehaus for dealing with OSGi/Eclipse plugin builds. One donated by
AGFA and one by Princeton Softech.

The .net Maven work is still being worked on by Shane Isbell in the
Incubator under the name NMaven.

Reworking of the TestNG support is happening in the Maven sandbox
Jesse Kuhnert and Alex Popescu.

We had user training at ApacheCon. We also had user training and
manager training at JavaOne.

We had presentations at ApacheCon and JavaOne. Brett presented for me
as I was grounded at the airport and wasn't allowed to fly.

Worked has progressed on all the IDE integration. All integration
projects are now using the same strain of code and we now have
mediocre to decent support in Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ. A most
pleasant surprise has been IntelliJ putting one of their employees on
the integration work. Vladislav who is one of their best developers.

We have two SoC students who are working with us. Both graphing
related. I'm mentoring one and Carlos is mentoring the other.

The maven.org proposal has been withdrawn and we are just going to
continue doing what we are doing with Contegix for Maven's central
repository. According to OSU OSL there is no space to house the Maven
repository so it's just easier to continue with what works well for
us. So pretty much the status quo aside from removing the violation
of the trademark pointed out by Jim on the PRC.

New Projects
---------------------------

No new projects.

New PMC Members
---------------------------

Brian Fox

New Committers
---------------------------

Ralph Goers and Patrick Schneider as part of the heavy refactoring in
the artifact resolution mechanism to help stabilize it. The infamous
MNG-1577.
