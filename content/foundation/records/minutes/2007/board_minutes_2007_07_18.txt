 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Jim]

       The board is currently making the expected adjustments required
       to get back "into the grove" and smoothly operate after the
       changeover of almost half of its directors. Also in transition
       is the full roster of executive officers themselves, something
       unique in the history of the ASF. Activities on the board@ and
       jcp-open@ list indicate that we still have some ways to go,
       but are making these transitions surprisingly well.

       A special board meeting was called for July 09, 2007 to focus
       on the current ASF/JCP issues being discussed on the board@ and
       jcp-open@ lists. A general consensus was achieved and some
       action items were created to write-up that consensus and
       share that with the membership and, eventually, the JCP itself.
       More information can be obtained from the minutes of that
       meeting. Status updates of those action items will be discussed
       today.

       In general, the ASF is handling the transition well, and continues
       to grow and prosper.


    B. President [Justin]

       Most of the last month has been focused on bringing our recent
       hardware acquisitions up.  Currently, we are integrating four
       new machines into our service cluster.  At this time, only one
       is operational (odin - running VMWare Server); but the machine
       it is intended to replace has not yet been decomissioned. The
       machines in the Netherlands are still not operational due to a
       cascade of software faults - but the machines are racked and
       powered.

       We are currently dealing with substantial downtimes of our
       people.apache.org server and are implementing plans to acquire
       a replacement as quickly as possible.  This machine was already
       scheduled for replacement, but it decided to escalate matters
       on its own.
       
       I have had some informal discussions with external
       organizations about open-sourcing their code and possibly
       bringing it to the ASF via the Incubator.

    C. Treasurer [J Aaron]

       Justin has been getting me up to speed on Treasurer duties.  I
       now have access to Well Fargo Online and email updates are
       being sent to me.

       While I'm in LA for OS Summit Asia planning Aug 10-12, Justin
       and I will attempt to finish much of the handover and work on
       the upcoming IRS returns.  The goal is to have a first draft
       for Aug 10th, followed by a two week review, and then
       submission around August 29th.


    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Sam]

       The most important task of the secretary is keeper of records.  I'm in
       the rather uncomfortable position of not being either in possession of,
       or even in the work-flow (past or present tense) of these records.  That
       being said, I had a phone discussion with Jim, and we agreed that the
       contract with Jon was working well and we would not be well served by
       disrupting it.  Longer term (possibly over the course of years) we
       would like to move to everything being electronic, but over the short
       term we will only make changes should an issue arise; and in such
       circumstances, we will do so either in the direction the long term goal
       or towards me taking over that task, based on the urgency of the issue.

       I'm also concerned that we have never taken a careful enumeration of
       all the tasks that Jim has simply taken care of for the foundation, nor
       have we identified which of those tasks Jim operated as secretary or
       as a volunteer director.  In any case, it is my intent to offload the
       new chairman of the board as much as it makes sense.  As a concrete
       example, Jim is handing off to me the handling of the renewal of the
       D&O policy.

       I did take roll call and minutes at my first board meeting as
       secretary.  Over time, I'm confident that that will become smoother.

       Over time, I also will make this role my own.  A first example is
       increased tracking of, and focus on, action items.

       We have received no correspondence that requires board attention.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. A request by the newborn Quetzalcoatl project to use the simplified
       subdomain python.apache.org raised the question of using external
       names.  This is similar to concerns about java.apache.org by the
       Jakarta project (unacceptable due to Sun's trademark concerns), or
       perl.apache.org for the modperl project.  A request to the PSF
       provided the appropriate permissions, so the project has requested
       that they might use this subdomain name, but there are apparently
       concerns by some directors yet to be resolved.

    Beyond the guidelines discussed in the review of the Quetzalcoatl,
    the board requests that further discussions should be between the project
    and Justin.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    This will continue on the board@apache.org mailing list due to time
    constraints.  We discussed scheduling another JCP board meeting in two
    weeks, and decided to continue that discussion on board@apache.org.

    Geir: update http://www.apache.org/jcp/ with:
     * A constructive summary of what discussions and progress we have
       had with Sun
     * A mention of the long term plans to remove the requirement for TCK
       NDAs.
     * A pointer to where the next steps will be developed (namely jcp-open@)
     * an authoritative statement on what TCK aspects can be discussed in
       public based on the TCK NDAs.

    Bill: coordinate with Geir, and see if we can engage our lawyers to
       assist us with the JCK/FOU contract dispute.

    Geir: draft schedule for the next two to three months outlining options
       and strategies by the next board meeting.

    Sam: Copyright/license of .dtd/.xsd files and other Reference Material
       Review (and possibly update) <http://www.apache.org/legal/3party.html>.

============
ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Legal Affairs

As mentioned in last month's report, I wish to resign as VP of Legal
Affairs.  The Legal Affairs Committee has discussed possible 
replacements over the last month and have reached consensus on Sam
Ruby, who is not currently on the committee.  Therefore, I have 
prepared two resolutions for the board to vote on: one to add Sam to
the committee (being a board/executive committee) and one to have him
replace me as VP.

There are no other issues requring board attention this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of JCP
 
The ASF has adopted the policy of voting "no" on any JSR for which Sun 
is the spec lead, starting with the Java EE 6 JSR. This is the only 
logical position for the ASF to take regarding this matter - we believe
that Sun is in breach of the JSPA and public promises, and therefore
shouldn't be allowed to start new JSRs in the JCP until the matter 
is resolved.

The board should consider if the ASF should support or otherwise allow
official Apache representation in any such JSRs.

The JCP section of the ASF website has been updated with a short summary of 
our the current status and effects of the open letter.  While we have not
received an official response from Sun, we do believe that the open letter
has alerted the community to the problem.  The most visible manifestation 
of this is how EC members are using a commitment for a FOU-free TCK license
as a gating factor in voting decisions.  See the recent Java EE 6 vote
(http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=4306)

Internally, the board recently met to discuss a handful of issues related to 
our JCP participation, as well as next steps in our Java SE TCK dispute 
with Sun.  The  board has been advised of and is discussing the "going forward"
plan.

Further, after much community and internal discussion, the JCP program at the
ASF will be working to remove the TCK NDA requirement.  The current time
horizon for this is 2010, with the intention of the ASF engaging w/ the JCP and 
the spec leads to find the smoothest and least disruptive path to this goal
for our communities.

Finally, it's become clear that the current distribution mode of TCK materials
isn't meeting demand, and this problem will be resolved through systemic 
changes and broader community assistance by the next board meeting. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds arriving
at security@apache.org. These continue to be dealt with promptly by the
security team.  For Jun 2007 we had 10 non-SPAM requests:

5       Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
5       Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
4       Vulnerability report

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

There has been no real change since last month; the ATA committee is
awaiting final and official notice of the speakers and sessions for
ApacheCon US (as well as the website being updated) before we put out
a call for Requests For Assistance. It seems premature to do so until
people know who is speaking and what sessions are available.

Jim did send an Email to the team indicating his desire to step
down from the chair position, due to his appointment as chair.
To date, there has been no comments at all about this. This
is causing Jim some concern.

Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

(Received from Noirin Plunkett)

Please forgive me emailing this without a formal signoff from Ken/the
concom PMC - Ken's been out of action a bit lately because of his
back, and the deadline was looming a bit.

J Aaron is working with Charel & Frazier on our websites. He's done a
great job on www.ossummit.com, and is being very diligent in his
hat-swapping. The new website for us.apachecon.com is pretty much
ready to go.  At the moment the hold up is upgrading Stone
Circle's Media Temple account to a dedicated virtual server (the
current account can't handle more than one Rails app at a time).  Once
the new virtual server is available, he'll get the site deployed so we
can open up registration.

With two conferences now being our annual minimum, concom has decided
to split into 'teams' per event - the team for ACUS07 includes Ken,
Noel, and Lars; Rich is heading up this group. OS Summit Asia has a
slightly smaller ASF team, since it's being run in conjunction with
Eclipse - J Aaron, Justin and Noirin are keeping things going there.

Talks for ACUS07 have been selected and scheduled, and speaker
notifications have been sent. Speaker agreements/contracts haven't
gone out yet.
The new website will include timetable and registration information,
as soon as it goes up.

The CFP for OS Summit Asia is officially closed; although there were
one or two last minute reports of issues with the submission forms, it
looks like there won't be a need to extend it. The Eclipse team will
select their talks over the next couple of weeks - the ASF planners
will be meeting in LA the weekend of August 11th/12th for session
selection. This means a slight delay in notifications, but
unfortunately it wasn't possible to get everyone together before that.

ACEU is over for another year, and despite an attempted drowning,
there were no major mishaps.

Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Audit Project

We're in touch with Justin and Aaron with regards to when the tax return 
will be ready for review, and when we need to review it by. The plan is 
that we will review the return over a 2 week period in August.

Apart from that there has been no other activity.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Public Relations Project

Status since last board meeting:

  o The PRC confirmed its approval to KernelConcepts to sell
    an "Apache Feather Pin" in addition to their current T-shirt
    offerings. As with the the shirts, the ASF will receive a
    percentage of any sale revenues.

  o HP requested a change in the URL link on the sponsors page
    (from their corporate site to their "open source community"
    site). The site was updated with the new link.

  o Looking into releasing ASF PR about new board, officers
    and Sponsorship Program. Sally has been working this issue
    and it will likely be a more comprehensive "state of the ASF"
    PR in addition to the above notices. This makes the PR more
    news-worthy and time-appropriate.

  o Jim floated the idea of dropping/destroying the CMO position
    from the PRC. As of this date, there have been no "vetos" of
    this idea, even from the current CMO. It is expected that
    this will be formally requested at next months board meeting
    (since the office was created by Board Resolution on July 28, 2005).

Attachment A: Status report for the Apache ActiveMQ Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Beehive Project

Overall
======
Status quo in the Hive -- it's been another generally quiet quarter.
There was some more small incremental bug fixing, but there isn't much
new being built right now.  There were no new releases, committers, or
PMC members.

Community
=========
There were a handful of questions / comments on user@ that are
responded to appropriately.  Some of these are newbies exploring the
project, which is encouraging.  There was an odd flurry of traffic
from otherwise inactive folks that closed longstanding bugs, a handful
of which did reopen.  The project isn't building momentum toward a
v.next release and feels somewhat mature.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache DB Project

Apache DB quarterly report - July 2007

Committers / PMC Members:
No new committers or PMC members were added.

DdlUtils released 1.0 in June -- its first! Congratulations!

Derby is working energetically on its 10.3 release.

JDO is busy implementing the JSR-243 API and TCK in the open,
corresponding to the changes to the JCP-approved JDO 2.1
specification, also being done in the open. No release date
is planned yet.

Torque uses Village, a Java API that uses JDBC to simplify
SQL access to databases. The author of Village announced his
intent to stop hosting the CVS/SVN tree and offered the code
to Torque. He faxed in the software grant and Torque is waiting
for it to be recorded.

Issues:
Regarding the contribution of Village code to Torque, some feel
that the bureaucracy associated with code contributions is
unnecessarily weighty. In particular, some feel that a software
grant should not have been necessary in this case because the
Village author is himself an ASF member.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Directory Project

After more than 2 years being the Chairman of this project, Alex
decided to ask the PMCs to elect a new Chairman, and proposed me for
this task, which was accepted and voted by the PMCs. I would like to
thank the PMCs for their confidence and trust, and I will do my best
to contribute as much as I can to be a decent Chairman, helping the
project to grow and trying to let contributors to feel at home when
working on it. I would also mention that this project would simply not
exist without Alex hard work, and I'm very pleased that Alex is not
willing to quit the project, but just want someone else to cope with
administrative tasks.

Releases
========

As we have now three sub projects (Apache Directory Server, AKA ADS,
Apache Directory Studio AKA ADStudio and TripleSec) we also have three
different status :

ADS 1.5.x : no release in the past three months, since we released
1.5.0 in march. We are working on a 1.5.1 to be released by end of
July.

ADS 1.0.x : 1.0.2 has been released on may. It's a bug fix.

ADStudio : The 0.8.1 released has just been voted those last days, and
it's simply a version which support 64 bits procs. We are expecting a
1.0 bySseptember, hopefully.

Triplesec : A full rewrite has been initiated lately. No release
expected in the next three months.

Community
=========

The community is still growing with one new committer, Martin
Alderson, who has pushed some very valuable fixes on Mitosis, the
replication feature we have added to the server. He knows it more than
the current committers because he has used it. It was a great addition
to the team as we now have more than one people working on each major
part of the server.

We have voted two committers to become PMCs, Stefan Seelmann, who was
a major contributor to Apache Directory Studio, and Christine Koppelt,
who has recently moved from working solely on documentation to an
active contribution to code, which is a really god news. Both of them
has done a real great job on the past six months, not only being
active committers, but also trying to make the project working better,
helping other committers and users. They will for sure be very good
PMCs members !

Chris Custine has been very active since he has been granted Karma,
and this is really great, as he is a very experimented developer, and
as he dedicated a lot of time on parts where we were weak : packaging.
He is also very valuable in helping users and new commers.

The Kerberos server is being improved (speed, tests, documentation),
and we are doing our best to exit from a situation where this is a one
man show. As this will be a major component used by TripleSec, this is
absolutely mandatory to have 2 or 3 committers able to fix bugs and to
help users. We are working hard on that.

Apache Directory Studio is also gaining a lot of traction, not only
from our users (more than 5000 downloads since the first announcement
!), but also within the committers. It's not only Pierre-Arnaud and
Stefan baby, as Christine and Stefan (Zorner) are now deeply involved.

Some discussion relative to DNS protocol have started last month,
about moving DNS to MINA. We don't have a clear position about it, as
this is a dormant project in Directory. From some perspective, it
would be better to have an active DNS project supported on MINA than a
dormant project within Directory.

No clear decision has been stated yet.

We have submitted some proposals for LdapCon, the first LDAP dedicated
conference, for the beginning of September in Köln (Germany). We
expect to meet a lot of Directory committers there, but more
important, we will expose the server and the associated projects to a
LDAP dedicated community.

Features
========

The last three months were just about working on bug fixes, and also
improving the server performances. We have now a much faster server
(up from 1500 search requests per second to 4500 on my laptop), but we
didn't caught OpenLdap level yet.

Thanks to Matt Hogstrom, we will be able to conduct wider tests on a
huge server, and we will build a more complex and more realistic set
of performance tests. What we want is to be able to have a clear grid
of tests to compare ADS with other OSS LDAP servers.

The Schema Editor in ADStudio is under heavy work, as we want the GUI
to directly access the schema loaded into ADS. It's almost done. A lot
of bugs have been fixed in the browser too. ADStudio is really moving
fast in the good direction, and we expect to be able to follow the
"release fast, release often" moto.

Issues
======

We have a huge number of issues open, mainly Improvements and Tasks,
which need more man power to address. This is not very simple to cope
with all of them, but things are under control, as we are focusing on
bugs first. We can't expect the server to be bullet-proof, but we
can't also expect to have no bug report as more and more people are
using ADS. The number of bugs we have is surprisingly low, but on the
opposite side, people are often complaining about usability (Schema
handling, packaging for embedded servers, server configuration). We
have to work more on those issues.

Documentation for 1.0 version has stabilized, and 1.5 version still
needs some more work. Things are going much better, but as it's a
never ended story ... Thanks to our 'wunderbar' german team, we have a
usable documentation.

Some of our users are asking for a PDF version of this documentation,
this seems a good idea, but I don't know if it's something we can
provide out of confluence.

Conclusion/Summary
==================

Working on this project is a very pleasant experience. We have new
committers, and they are very efficients, users are now growing by
numbers, and we can see it on the users mailing list graph generated
by Ken Coar (http://people.apache.org/~coar/mlists.html#directory.apache.org)

We don't have specific issues, I would say that the only problem we
are focusing on at the moment is how to grow without loosing our
current harmony. This is really a very pleasant situation !

Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Geronimo Project

Apache Geronimo Board Report for July 2007

The Apache Geronimo Project has completed a certified Java EE 5.0
compliant stack in release 2.0-M6-rc1. This is not the official 2.0
release but demonstrates that we have an implementation that passes the
grueling demands of the Java EE 5.0 platform TCK. Sun has placed Apache
Geronimo on their certification page:
http://java.sun.com/javaee/overview/compatibility.jsp

Collaboration with several other projects at Apache is going on which
include ActiveMQ, Axis 2, CXF, MyFaces, OpenEJB, OpenJPA, Tomcat and
Yoko. Releases

  * Geronimo
    2.0-M5 and 2.0-M6 were released in April and June
    respectively.

  * Geronimo Javamail
    geronimo-javamail_1.4_spec-1.0, geronimo-javamail_1.4_mail-1.0,
    and geronimo-javamail_1.4_proverider-1.0 were released in June.

  * Geronimo Specs
    geronimo-javaee-deployment_1.1MR3_spec-1.0,
    geronimo-activation_1.1_spec-1.0, geronimo-ws-metadata_2.0_spec-1.1.1,
    geronimo-stax-api_1.0_spec-1.0

Devtools

  * Work continues on the JBoss to Geronimo (J2G) conversion tool currently
    in sandbox

Xbean

3.0 and 3.0.1 (a minor build configuration bugfix) were released in April
and June respectively JUGs and Conferences

  * Following sessions were presented at ApacheCon Europe 2007, May 1-4,
    Amsterdam:
      o Apache Geronimo 2.0 - Java EE 5.0 Status and Positioning
      o J2EE Application Development on Apache Geronimo Simplified using
        Eclipse

Policy Changes

  * TCK Access
    Access to the Geronimo TCK was given to the following
    non-Geronimo committers: Bruno Aranda, Dan Diephouse, Dan Kulp, Darren
    Middlehouse.

Subprojects

  * DayTrader
    Using the benchmark to flush out oddities and bugs. 2.0 will
    be updated and released soon after Geronimo 2.0 is made available.

  * DevTools
  * XBean
    We've fixed a number of bugs found during geronimo tck
    work and extended the xbean-spring functionality slightly.
  * Samples
    Contains a gallery of small samples that show how Geronimo's plan can be
    written and used. They can be created from a template to give a
    consistent look and feel.

Community

New Committers:

  * Jay McHugh
  * Lin Sun
  * Tim McConnell

PMC Additions:

Other Issues:

  * TCK Issues
    We have encountered significant delays in obtaining TCKs and
    related materials such as exclusion lists. Delays have been taking
    between 2 and 3 weeks from request to obtaining product.  These issues
    are on the Apache side and not Sun as Sun has been very responsive in our
    requests. We need to improve our access to the TCKs and exclusion lists.
    There are several people on Apache Geronimo that are interested in
    helping out in this area if needed.

    In addition, we need a better way to coordinate TCK activities by
    multiple projects it might be prudent to have a place for various
    projects to coordinate their TCK test activities. During the Geronimo
    testing it was discovered that CXF (that helped with the testing) was
    unaware of some challenges that had already been raised by Geronimo
    testers. We're not sure if there is sufficient overlap to justify more
    central coordination but wanted to note the issue.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache James Project

James project report:

* Released JAMES server 2.3.1 final.
* Released mime4j 0.3 final.
* Mailet API code was spun out as a subproject.... (had been a separate
  mailing list for a while).
* Some changes to the jspf subproject but cannot release because we need a
  change and release in a dependent external project that we cannot fork.
* No new committers.
* Robert Burrell Donkin added to the James PMC.

After Justin helped with our project guidelines and some community issues
earlier in the year, he's recently unsubscribed.  Thank you very much for
his help!

There are still some deep set personality disagreements that remain in the
PMC. They are not flaring up right now but several are not contributing
because of these disagreements.  Having the project guidelines should give
us a method to resolve these disagreements going forward, but it cannot
change the feelings people have about the past, and I'm not sure what it
will take for those to regain faith in the team.

Robert is helping push the code forward on much needed refactoring, all
with the ultimate goal of supporting IMAP.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Maven Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache MINA Project

Releases
========
We didn't release a new version yet while we are fixing reported bugs
as soon as possible.  Hopefully the new releases will be introduced at
the end of July.

Community
=========
Mark Webb, enthusiastic document contributor, has been added to our
committer list.  He also showed his will to learn the MINA internals
by writing documents and start to contribute the code eventually.  So
far, he's doing very well.  We are also discussing about adding
Maarten Bosteels.  He has been an active answerer for many questions
and a patch provider.  The vote will start soon.

People keep asking about the release schedule of the version 2.0, but
we are not able to give any specific date because the project is fully
volunteer-based.  We are currently focusing on fixing issues in 1.x
versions.

Community contributors are keep posting patches such as blocking I/O
support and FTP implementation example.  Once reviewed, they will be
selectively included to the mainstream.  The patches for bugs are
applied as soon as possible.

To address very frequent questions about the performance of MINA, a
web page dedicated to performance test reports has been created.  As
its first content, Trustin Lee added performance test report for HTTP
server implementation, which shows an impressive result.

There was a serious discussion about starting a new DNS library
project.  The authors of dnsjava and dnsjnio project showed interest.
Currently the discussion is somewhat stalled because we are not sure
if MINA has to host the project, because the Incubator or Labs is the
more suitable place.

Features
========
Julien Vermillard added serial port communication to MINA.  This means
any MINA application can communicate via a serial port with minimal
(or no) code modification.  He also started to work on APR transport
for MINA, which might yield better performance to existing MINA-based
applications with minimal (or no) code modification.

Trustin Lee added an extension that eases the development of
request-response style client application.

Mark Webb added an extension that throttles the number of connection
attempts within a certain amount time.

Issues
======
Niklas Therning wrote a nice state machine library called 'MINA-SM'.
Strictly speaking, it doesn't depend on MINA although it is designed
to work very well with MINA and protocol implementation.  We didn't
discuss about where this project should be hosted yet.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache MyFaces Project

Summary
=======
 * Active community, some additions
 * JSF 1.2 branch of MyFaces passed TCK tests and was successfully
integrated in Geronimo

   Adam Winer, Gabrielle Crawford, Jeanne Waldman, Simon Lessard, Udo
Schnurpfeil, Cagatay Civici

MyFaces Core (JSF 1.2 branch)
=======================
 * JSF 1.2 (JSR-252) development branch has reached it's most
important milestone: all TCK tests where successfully passed. A first
official release is scheduled.
 * MyFaces 1.2 is also delivered with Geronimo which passed Java EE
5.0 TCK on June 4, 2007.

MyFaces Core (JSF 1.1)
==================
 * No new release.

MyFaces Tomahawk
================
 * An important XSS (cross-site scripting) security fix version
(1.1.6) was released on June 12, 2007.

MyFaces Tobago
=============
 * Latest MyFaces Tobago sub project (JSF component library) release
1.0.11 was published on June 3, 2007.

MyFaces Trinidad
=============
 * MyFaces Trinidad (fka ADF Faces) has successfully left the
Incubator and is now an official sub-project under the MyFaces
umbrella.
 * Latest MyFaces Trinidad sub project (JSF component library) release
1.2.1 was published on July 5, 2007.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

CURRENT FOCUS

Primary activities in the project are around polishing up features,
user-facing code, reducing dependencies, documentation, and taking care 
of legal in preparation for the coming 3.0 release.  No real issues stand
in the way at this point, builds and voting should start soon.

CONTRIBUTIONS

More wonderful documentation contributions have been made by contributor
Karan Malhi who is actively scraping our list archives and creating
documentation from old emails.

EXTERNAL INVOLVEMENT

Contributed managed connection support to commons-dbcp. This will eliminate
our custom database pooling code, and adds an important new feature to DBCP.
This feature should be useful to anyone using DBCP in a managed environment
such at Tomcat. Also, OpenEJB has a large set of data base test case, and
we have already found a few bugs to fix in DBCP for which we are working
on fixes.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

Highlights

OpenJPA continues to work toward its first release as a TLP, to be
called OpenJPA 1.0.0. There are currently 46 open issues that have been
identified as "close before 1.0.0".

Community

The users@openjpa.apache.org mailing list was started upon graduation
and already has over 100 posts, from 16 unique non-committer posters.

A public face-to-face meeting is being discussed for sometime this
summer in the bay area.  We're hoping that the planning date is far enough
out that many interested folks can join. We've invited Bill Pugh (FindBugs)
to give us a presentation.

Governance

Release naming policy for the first release has been resolved.

David Ezzio was voted as a new committer (and new to Apache).

The PMC continues to track contributors with an eye toward making them
committers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Shale Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

Things have been running smoothly this last quarter, with little of
note for the board at this time.

We have had one GA release, of Struts 2.0.8, and a test build of
Struts 1.3.9 is up for a quality vote at this time. Both Struts
2.1 and Struts 1.4 are under active development.

Prompted by a user trying to report a security vulnerability in
Struts, we have requested a security@s.a.o alias, which we hope will
be set up shortly. (We believe the reported vulnerability had already
been resolved.)

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Tapestry Project

Organization

The Tapestry PMC has voted in several new committers to the project:
Dan Gredler, Marcus Schulte and Ben Dotte.

Of course, Ben Dotte is unable to contribute since his CLA has not been
recorded, despite repeated snail-mail and FAX copies being sent. This has
dragged on for nearly two months. This is completely unacceptable and has
fueled discussions about pulling out of Apache.

Tapestry 4.1

Jesse has pulled together the optimized OGNL, and following a vote, release
4.1.2 has been unleashed.

Tapestry 5

Progress has slowed slightly on Tapestry 5, but new features continue to be
added. A vote to release a new preview, Tapestry 5.0.5, ran succesfully.
Ajax features for T5 are just around the corner. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Tcl Project

In short, nothing much is happening in Tcl land, although we do
continue to track anything that comes up, respond to mailing list
questions, and so on.  We added a new committer, Massimo Manghi, on
the Rivet codebase (or are in the process of doing so, at least).  He
plans to work on the documentation initially.  We re-added Damon
Courtney to the PMC mailing list, as he'd been (seemingly) silently
dropped due to mail problems.

There are no new issues, although the specter of two few active people
is ever present.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache POI Project

Releases
--------

We have recently released 3.0.1 Final. This includes various changes
relating to our TLP move. It also includes a few bug fixes, a few bits
of new HSSF (excel) functionality, and the new HSGF (visio) read-only
support.

Community
---------

No new committers or PMC members in the period.

General
-------

We have added two new components in the last month. HDGF provides a
low-level, read-only interface to Visio files. HSMF currently provides
a read-only interface to Outlook MSG files. We are expecting to add
quite a bit more HSMF functionality over the coming months.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Turbine Project

TLP migration is mostly done.  The largest outstanding issue is to
migrate our download pages over from Jakarta.  Other than this
development activity has been very low this month.

The most immediate challenge we have is addressing the requirement
to register Turbine's cryptographic capabilities as per
http://apache.org/dev/crypto (ECCN codes).  This was mentioned on
last month's report, but a query via the dev list has put pressure
on us to action this.

We have no board-level issues at this time.

=== Community changes ===

No new committers were voted in since the last board report.

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

=== Turbine core project ===

No major activity this month.  A minor problem relating to DTD
references being redirected from jakarta to turbine was
identified and fixed.  Further work on localization is being
discussed and the ECCN code issue mentioned above came up.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

=== Fulcrum component project ===

No major activity this month.  A minor build problem relating to
the redirection from jakarta to turbine was identified and fixed.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

=== META project ===

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Quetzalcoatl Project

Mod_python
==========

* No new releases, things are quiet at the moment

Community
=========

* No new commiters or PMC members

Issues
==========

* Let it be officially known that the whole thread about the Quetzalcoatl 
TLP (the resolution for which was officially approved by the board) domain 
name on the board list was rather unhelpful and completely unproductive.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic,
component oriented web applications, and was established as an Apache
project in June 2007. This is our first status report to the board.

Community

The Wicket community celebrates the graduation announcement and is
very happy with Wicket's graduation, as evidenced by the user
submitted story on TSS
(http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=45880). We
have received confirmation that the Apache brand works wonders for
adoption of an open source product by big businesses.

The mailing lists of Apache Wicket still remain the second most active
project(ServiceMix in the incubator is even more active) according to
nabble.

Migration to TLP

We are waiting on Infrastructure to start migration of the
infrastructure (on hold awaiting TLP creation tickets from
Quetzalcoatl and Commons). In the mean time we already established a
distribution location for the Wicket project in the official Apache
download area, to release our second beta release of Wicket 1.3 (our
first release outside the Incubator). We are confident that the
migration will be complete when the board meets.

One issue is migrating the last lists from sourceforge.net to Apache.
This will require a re-subscription of all our users. It was pointed
out that migrating all subscribers from sourceforge to Apache would be
illegal in some states or countries. This is going to be a nice party
for our 660+ subscribers.

Software

Since our last report to the Incubator PMC we have added integration
with Google's Guice (ASL2 licensed), which has been received quite
well. We also released the second beta for our 1.3 release to the
general public. It was the first release outside the incubator and it
was not hard to find the right places to put the distribution in (with
a couple of pointers by Infra). The code base continues to stabilize
for a final 1.3 release, but is about a month behind the original
schedule.

Summary

The Wicket project is still settling in its position as a TLP. Our 1.3
release is coming along, albeit at a slower pace than expected, and
our user community keeps growing.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

Summary
=======

   We are still waiting for the infrastructure part to happen to  
finish the
   TLP move. Other than that business as usual.

Releases
========

   o 08 July Commons CLI 1.1
   o 02 July Commons IO 1.3.2
   o 25 June Commons Modeler 2.0.1
   o 18 June Commons JCI 1.0

Infrastructure
==============
   o Still work to be done for TLP https://issues.apache.org/jira/ 
browse/INFRA-1283

Community
=========
   o We agreed to only migrate commit rights of committers that did a
     commit in the past 2 years. Of course any previous committer just has  
     to ask to get his rights back at any time. See the jira issue for the  
     initial list of committers
   o No new committers
   o New PMC members
     - Simon Kitching
     - Rahul Akolkar


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

Xalan-C
=======

The next Xalan-C release is waiting for the next Xerces-C release (3.0).

Only 7 new JIRA issues were reported in the last 13 weeks; two of those are
closed and two in progress.

Three of the seven were reported by non-committers, so defect activity is
light.


Xalan-J
=======

Only 11 new JIRA issues were reported in the last 13 weeks and two of those
are no longer open.

The number of defects currently open isn't much different than a year ago.

The mailing lists xalan-j-users and xalan-dev continue to be actively
monitored with questions answered.

The Xalan-J 2.7.1 release is stalled on the committers being busy with
non-Apache work.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

Issues requiring the Board's attention: none.

Infrastructure
--------------
We have no outstanding infrastructure issues.

Development
-----------
Along with the continuous work of bug fixing and enhancements across all
aspects of the codebase, the project accepted several new contributions
of code from Intel Corp.  These were voted upon on the project dev list
and have been incorporated into the project codebase, or are in the
process of being incorporated :

1) Various character set encoders/decoders
2) A font library
3) Java Management Extensions (JMX) APIs and associated tests
4) JMSMP and HTTP connections for Java Management Extensions (JMX)
5) An alternative bytecode verifier
6) JVM function test suite comprising 4400 tests
7) A further 1500 runtime tests
8) Stress testing suite

A branch was created in SVN for those wanting to start work on the Java
6 SE class library specification.  Some developers have started
submitting patches to the Java 6 branch but it is still in very early
days of development.

This work is supported by additional effort in the supporting build and
test infrastructure code which now contains thousands of functional
tests, adapters to run system/integration tests, and more recently some
performance tests.

At the end of June 2007 the project published a Milestone build.  The
entire development team collaborated in producing a stable, well-tested,
snapshot that we called Apache Harmony 5.0M2.  This Milestone has been
tested with a number of open source applications, and the Harmony
community have expressed an interest in producing downloads of
standalone applications, such as Apache Tomcat and Apache Geronimo,
based on the Harmony runtime.

Security
--------
There were no reported security issues.

Community
---------
The community continues to operate in a very healthy manner with
discussions and decisions being made on the project mailing list.
Several developers have published material about Apache Harmony in
various places (linked from the project website), or spoken about the
project at developer conferences.  We collaborated with the Eclipse
Foundation in their venture to produce an "In Harmony with Eclipse" CD
for JavaOne 2007, containing the Eclipse IDE running on an Apache
Harmony runtime.

We're continue to watch the OpenJDK project for opportunities to
collaborate, but so far, there has been little activity there since our
last update.

We have voted in seven new committers, bringing the total to 27 (of
which 22 were active in the last 2 months).  Our new committers are:

   Alexey A Ivanov (Intel)
   Andrew Zhang (Independent)
   Egor Pasko (Independent)
   Leo Li (IBM)
   Mikhail Fursov (Intel)
   Tony Wu (IBM)
   Vladimir Ivanov  (Intel)

Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project

WS PMC needs overhaul. We are talking on general@ws on how to increase 
our oversight and reporting. Also on the plate is a plan to prune the
pmc to turn inactive pmc members to emeritus and to draw in new pmc 
members from the folks who are actually working on things. We started
an incubator style sign up sheet for volunteering for the board report
and are adopting a similar format for information about each individual
project as well. We already archived several projects for inactivity
including Addressing/EWS/Mirae/PubScribe/SOAP/WSRF. Two more projects
JAXME and XMLRPC are on the chopping block Next. At this point, i 
recommend that WS PMC should file montly reports till all the volunteers
fully get into the rhythm and can provide active oversight as there are a
few projects that have not submitted a report yet. Please do 
let us know if we are missing something or if we can do something better
. Please see detailed reports on each project below:

Apache Axis
-----------
Apache Axis is a web services framework implementing the W3C SOAP 
standard. Axis has been in stasis for some time with the release of 
Axis2, but there has been some movement toward a new 1.5 release. A 
release plan for Axis 1.5 was presented by Bjorn Townsend in April 
2007. The Axis developer community was receptive to the plan, and 
several members of the community agreed to work toward the release as 
time permits. There has also been some commits on the project from 
Doug Davis, Glen Daniels, Jarek Gawor and Tom Jordahl, fixing bugs and 
resolving some issues with the interop tests now that 
soapinterop.java.sun.com has gone away. While Axis has been in stasis, 
there is still a decent amount of activity in the Axis JIRA. 45 new 
issues have been created since March 2007, an average of about three 
per week. This lends credence to the need for a maintenance release at 
some point in the future.

Apache Axis2
------------
Apache Axis2 is the third generation Web service framework. That is 
built on module architecture to be a more flexible , more extensible 
Web service engine. Axis2 has support for Ws-Addressing , WS-RM and 
WS-Security. Last June we had a hackathon event at Indiana University 
to improve the code quality and stabilize the functionality. We are 
planing to do Axis2 1.3 on end of this month and we have already cut 
a 1.3 RC1 on 7th June 2007

Apache Axis2/C
--------------
Apache Axis2/C is an effort to implement Axis2 architecture in C. Apache 
Axis2/C can be used to provide and consume Web Services. We completed 
WS-Policy implementation (Neethi/C) for Axis2/C. And its security policy 
implementation for Rampart/C. WS-Eventing implementation (Savan/C) is 
improved a lot in last month. With improvements in Guththila parser 
Axis2/C engine able to operate two times faster than its earlier speed.
Developers agreed to adopt apr versioning guidelines to Axis2/C also.
Apache Axis2/C project got well accepted by users and got new momentum 
after its 1.0.0 release in 06th May 2007. We are getting  good user 
interactions in mailing lists and getting new contributions. Two GSoc 
projects undergoing for Axis2/C. Namely Mail Transport Implementation 
for Axis2/C and JSON implementation for Axis2/C.We are going to release 
Axis2/C 1.1.0 near future, didn't start release process yet.

Apache WS Commons
-----------------
Volunteer has not yet submitted a report.

Apache JAXME
------------
No Volunteers. On track for archival because of lack of activity.

Apache jUDDI
------------
jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the 
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) specification 
for Web Services. jUDDI has seen a renewed interest. Besides some bug 
fixes it can now run in embedded mode (see also the status on Scout) 
and we moved to use Axis2. The build has been converted to maven2 and 
we regenerated the website using it. No releases. Ramping up for a 
2.0 release. The idea is go straight to a 2.0 release, since it 
implements the UDDIv2 specification. We're looking to ramp up 
development to add UDDI v3 support. We're looking to add a web-based 
GUI. After 2.0 is released we'd start work on 3.0 which would support 
the UDDI v3 specification.

Apache Kandula
--------------
Apache Kandula is an implementation of Web Services Coordination, 
Atomic Transaction and Business Activity protocols. The project provides 
implementations for both Apache Axis (kandula-1 branch) and Apache Axis2 
(kandula-2 branch) platforms. In June Hannes Erven and Georg Hicker 
contributed the WS-BusinessActivity protocol implementation of kandula-1. 
The contributors also published their work at IEEE Int'l. Conference on 
Web Services 2007. Hannes Erven and Georg Hicker were voted in as 
ws-committers for the Kandula project.

Apache Muse
-----------
Volunteer has not yet submitted a report.

Apache Rampart
--------------
Rampart provides the WS-Security and WS-SecureConversation support for 
Apache Axis2 using Apache WSS4J as the base. The configuration model 
uses the WS-Policy framework and supports WS-SecurityPolicy 
specification. "Rahas" module in Rampart implements the WS-Trust 
specification with a security token service implementation and a client 
API to carryout token exchanges with the security token service. Hans G 
Knudsen was voted in as a Rampart committer. Next release will be Apache 
Rampart 1.3 to complement next Apache Axis2 (1.3)

Apache Sandesha
---------------
Volunteer has not yet submitted a report.

Apache Savan
------------
Volunteer has not yet submitted a report.

Apache Scout
------------
Apache Scout is an implementation of the JSR 93 (JAXR), which is a java 
API to XML registries such as jUDDI. Recently Scout has been included 
in JBossESB and Geronimo. We have added an in-JVM transport to jUDDI, 
to enable the scout-jUDDI combo being embedded into standalone Java 
applications. We converted to maven2 and now run the unit-test suite 
using embedded jUDDI and embedded DerbyDB. Also there is no more code 
dependency on the juddi.jar (other than it being the UDDI provider). The 
team is ramping up for a 1.0 release, after which we plan to add UDDIv3 
support.

Apache Synapse
--------------
Apache Synapse is a easy-to-use and lightweight XML and Web Services 
management and integration broker that can form the basis of a Service 
Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). The Apache 
Synapse team released the 1.0 version on the 11th of June. It was well 
accepted by the users and gained good press coverage. The site was 
updated as well to reflect the new release, and the release included 
many samples and bundled documentation to help the users get started. 
The team is currently evaluating enhancements and fixes for the next 
release and the timelines

Code Releases - 1.0 release - 11th June 2007

Apache Woden (incubator)
----------------------
Woden is an open source Java implementation of the W3C WSDL 2.0 
specification. WSDL 2.0 became a W3C Recommendation on 26th June. The
Woden WSDL 2.0 implementation has helped the spec working group verify 
and improve the spec during the CR and PR phases leading up to 
Recommendation. We are attempting to verify with ASF and IBM whether 
the appropriate documentation exists that assigns the rights of the 
initial WSDL4J code contribution to ASF. This is an oustanding item 
from the project status file. A license issue has arisen concerning 
StAX, which Woden uses with its AXIOM implementation. The 
stax-api-1.0.1.jar file does not contain a license file and the 
stax.codehaus.org website refers to Apache ASL 2.1 which does not exist. 
The AXIOM project uses ASL 2.0 in its stax-api-LICENSE.txt file, but 
without knowing the original license it's not clear to us if this jar 
file can be redistributed under ASL 2.0. We are still investigating.
Milestone release M8 is planned for end of July and will complete WSDL 
2.0 compliance by fully supporting WSDL2 assertions. We are close to 
proposing that Woden exits incubation, with just 3 remaining items on 
the project status file to attend to. After M8 we plan to review and 
finalize the Woden API for a 1.0 release in September. Dan Harvey, a 
summer intern student from Durham University in UK, has recently joined 
the team and is working on M8 JIRAs. We expect he will also contribute 
WSDL2 serialization for the 1.0 release.

Apache WSIF
-----------
Apache Web Services Invocation Framework (WSIF) is a simple Java API 
for invoking Web services, no matter how or where the services are 
provided as long as it is described in WSDL. We would like to have a 
release soon to capture all changes done in last years that are in SVN 
but available only as release candidates.

Apache WSS4J
------------
Apache WSS4J is the home for implementations of OASIS Web Services  
Security: SOAP Message Security 1.0/1.1 and WS-SecureConversation 
specifications' core components and is the base for enabling web 
services security support on many popular SOAP frameworks such as Apache 
Axis2. WSS4J also includes support for Apache Axis 1.x. Next release 
will be Apache WSS4J 1.5.3 of to support the next release of Apache 
Rampart.

Apache XMLRPC
-------------
No Volunteers. On track for archival because of lack of activity.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Project graduation continues, with Ode, ServiceMix, STDCXX and QPID looking
to receive TLP status now or shortly.  We also have new proposals, such as
the Java Resource Simulator.

By the same token, we're actively putting projects into a dormant status
when they are, in fact, dormant.  JuICE is likely the next such project,
with the vote is currently pending.  On the flip side, we've been asked to
bring log4php out of its dormant status, as there is a new community wanting
to work on it.

CXF and Tuscany have been doing releases.  CXF should probably be starting
to push for graduation, too, except for diversity being a concern (Tuscany
seems to have the same issue).

Work continues steadily on improving Incubator Documentation.  Craig Russell
and Robert Burrell Donkin deserve much credit for shepherding the issues.

-------------- PROJECTS -------------------

Apache CXF

Description - SOA enabling framework, web services toolkit

Date of entry - August, 2006

Top three items to resolve
 1. Diversity - Active commiters are mostly IONA people(and IONA aquiring
LogicBlaze didn't help).  However, we do have more than three indepentent
organizations represented.
 2. Growth of community - related to diversity.  The traffic on both the
users and dev lists is growing with new people jumping in.   The 2.0 release
has started to generate much more traffic.   With a full "none RC" release,
we've started getting traffic from people migrating from other products.
The CXF community is excited to see this and hope we can rise to the
challenge of supporting these new users.
 3. Mentor status - recent discussion on general@i.a.o suggested we really
need three active  mentors.   We currently only have 2 active mentors (Jim
and James).   That said, we successfully released 2.0 and voted in new
committers with votes from those two and others on the IPMC.   Thanks to the
other IPMC folks for taking the time.

Community aspects:
  * Voted in Jeff Genender as a committer due to his excellent work on
    JAX-WS compliancy fixes.
  * Voted in Tomasz Sztelak from XFire community.  He's been contributing to
    a Maven archetype as well as some docs and other XFire migration things.
  * Released 2.0-incubator
  * Apache Geronimo has been certified J2EE compliant using CXF as their
    JAX-WS and JWS implementation.
  * A lot of documentation has been added to our Wiki specifically
    targetting users and people migrating from XFire.   We hope this helps
    attract more users (and thus a create a larger community)

Code aspects:
  * Released 2.0-incubator - this release is JAX-WS Compliant and passed the
    TCK which was a major milestone for the project.
  * Working on bug fixes for a 2.0.1 hopefully to be released in a few more
    weeks to address issues found in 2.0.
  * Also planning features for 2.1 including JAX-WS 2.1

-------------------------------------------

FtpServer

Description - Java based FtpServer

Date of entry - March, 2003

Progress since last report
 * Voted in a new commiter, Clint Foster. He is currently in progress of
   setting up his account and get going with the practical details.
 * Code and documentation improvments has been continously ongoing. Code is
   mature enough for a milestone release but we're still missing a group of
   active commiters.
 * Activity on the mailing list has increased, more and more people seems to
   be using FtpServer.

Top three items to resolve
 1. Growth of community - we need more active commiters.
 2. Mentor status - FtpServer mentors are no longer active in the project,
    we should be looking for new.
 3. Getting a build server in place so that we can generate snapshots, they
    have been requested by several people.

-------------------------------------------

Ivy

Description - Ivy is a dependencies management tool mostly used in
combination with Apache Ant

Date of entry - October 23rd, 2006

Remaining item to resolve:
   1. Trademark checking - it's still difficult to know if Apache Ivy is a
good name according to trademark rules

The top three items to resolve in last report have seen very good progress:
   1. Growth of commiters - We are now 3 commiters from 3 different
companies and background
   2. Release - We have made our first release approved by the incubator
PMC, and are currently preparing a second one
   3. Growth of community - The Ivy community is growing, we see more and
more contributions in many forms: feedback on the mailing lists,
documentation and code patches, articles, ...

Community aspects:
    * Gilles Scokart has join the team of commiters
    * Xavier gave talk at ApacheConEU, which was a good opportunity to
discuss with several Apache commiters and members, including especially
people from Ant and Maven
    * Ivy is seen in the press more often (see
http://wiki.apache.org/ivy/IvyArticles)
    * We have had discussion on our dev mailing list about our road map for
upcoming releases
    * Discussion about remaining steps before graduation, one of the last
remaining points seems to be trademark checking, which we have started
investigating, including by asking questions to the general@i.a.o and
legal-discuss@a.o lists.
    * We have agreed on targetting Ant subproject for graduation
    * We have reviewed our site to make it indexable by google (our previous
version was making use of a lot of javascript preventing web crawlers to
work as expected), checked and fixed all broken links, and isolated site
from documentation to be able to provide online documentation history

Code aspects:
    * First release done, a second one is currently in preparation
    * Our development efforts focus on the integration with maven
repository, and bug fixing
    * We have agreed to use Sun standard Java coding style, and have started
to clean the code base to adhere to this coding style consistent with other
Apache projects like Apache Ant

-------------------------------------------

RCF

RCF is a rich component set (ajax-style) for JSF. A JIRA instance has been
requested (created INFRA-1291). Also sent mail to root@ to create the
accounts of the three RCF committers, that don't have an Apache account yet.
Created patch to include RCF on the Incubator page (INCUBATOR-68) and added
the first raw version of the status file, of this project (also inside of
INCUBATOR-68). We are waiting for an import of a current code drop into the
repository.

Incubating since: May 2007

-------------------------------------------

Lucene.Net

Description - Lucene.Net is a source code, class-per-class, API-per-API and
algorithmatic port of the Java Lucene search engine to the C# and .NET
platform utilizing Microsoft .NET Framework.

Date of entry - April, 2006

Top item(s) to resolve - Increase the development community and
participation.  Since the incubation of Lucene.Net, there has been only one
active committer, George Aroush, who has done 99% of the port work.  This
has slowed the port effort such that we are now over 3 months behind with
out 2.1 release.  Currently, I have tried to re-energies this effort and
emphasized that without developers, Lucene.Net will suffer and never
graduate.  I have gotten several mails offering to help, I will work on
those and try to build the development community.

Community aspects - There is a good followers, with good user base.  A lot
of questions get asked and answered on the user list.

Code aspects - Released version 2.0 "final" on April 2007.  Released version
2.1 "alpha" on May 2007

-------------------------------------------

Qpid

The Apache Qpid Project provides an open and interoperable, multiple
language implementations of the Advanced Messaged Queuing Protocol (AMQP)
specification

Date of entry to the Incubator : 2006-09

Top three items to resolve before graduation

None at present, however the project is going to complete the release of M2
before seeking / evaluating graduation readiness


Resolved:

1. Understanding the details between JCP and announce compliance...
	Resolution: We don't believe that there is going to be any outcome soon on
this issue given the ongoing issues with Apache / JCP. As we pass all the
tests in the TCK, the project has concluded to just state that we pass all
the tests but not claim compliance until JCP / Apache issues have been
resolved.

2. Our STATUS file needs to be updated wrt this report and the addition of
our new committers.
	Resolution: Done.

3. Making sure we are comfortable with the working relationship between Qpid
and the AMQP Working Group.
	Resolution: A discussion thread has been had on the Qpid dev list to
identify any concerns. Some issues where identified with accessing some of
the pages of the Working group, no issues where raised about obtaining
information / interacting with the WG. These resources incorrectly posted
where highlighted to the working group and have been fixed or are being
fixed. We the Qpid project will re-check for concerns on the dev list, and
make sure all resources required are accessible by all qpid committers on a
periodic basis.

* Any legal, cross-project or personal issues that still need to be
addressed?

The whole project has not gone through release review and the license files
and notices need to be checked for all languages and components.
	This is being done as post of M2, and should be complete in the next few
days, M2 took longer than expected to close. The following comments thus
carried from last board report
<--->
 * Brett: is it 'has now gone through release review', or 'has not' as
stated? How was M1 released if license files and notices have not been
checked, or has that only been done for Java?
 * Response by Martin(Qpid PPMC): The M1 release only included the Java code
base as a result only the license/notice files for Java were checked. The
other language variants are being checked to ensure the correct files are in
place for when they are ready to release.
<--->

* Latest developments.

 * Since entering into incubation we have had one release of the java code
base (M1).
 * We have stabilized our M2 release, and will be closing that shortly
 * We have migrated our java build system from ant to maven.
 * Development has been moving forward. with improvements in memory
footprint management passing the JMS TCK in with the java broker.
 * Addition of .NET client
 * Successfully voted to give 7+ new committers access rights
 * Successfully voted to give a new member contributor rights to cwiki.
 * The creation of the Web site
 * General progress on all code bases
 * Created python test suite
 * Added Ruby language support

* Plans and expectations for the next period?

During the next period we plan on improving the stability of all language
variants. Clustering, DTX, 0-10 AMQP for C++, and 0-8 & 0-10 AMQP client
support for Java will most likely be the focus of the next period.

-------------------------------------------

Tika

Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text
content from various document formats using existing parser
libraries. Tika entered incubation on March 22nd, 2007.

Community:
  * The Tika mailing list has seen increased activity in the last weeks,
with some new people showing interest for Tika's goals.
  * Grant Ingersoll brought the Aperture framework to our attention
(http://aperture.sourceforge.net/), which has similar goals to Tika. We will
look at possible synergies.

Development:
  * No code has been committed since our last report, but some initial code
is ready in JIRA and should be committed soon.

Issues before graduation:
  * No changes since our last report: the Tika project is still at an early
stage of incubation. We need to continue bringing in the initial codebases
and probably target for an initial incubating release later this year. We
also need to work on growing the community and figuring out how to best
interact with external parser projects.

-------------------------------------------

UIMA

UIMA is a component framework for the analysis of unstructured content
such as text, audio and video.  UIMA entered incubation on October 3, 2006.


Some recent activity:

  * Some new features were added to UIMA enabling the framework to support
components running with different Java class paths
  * A new release (2.2) is being prepared and should be out within a month
  * The C++ version of the framework is in the final testing stages and
should be out within a month


Items to complete before graduation:
  * Attract new committers

Community:
  * Traffic on the uima-user list has started to pick up since our release.
We hope to be able to eventually attract some Apache UIMA users to become
committers.
  * uima-dev list has a good amount of traffic, mostly from the original
committers, but now starting to get some activity from users around the
globe.
  * Jörn Kottman continues to work on the tool he contributed, with a fair
amount of activity after a few quiet weeks.
  * The Documentation preparation system, based on the Apache Velocity
project Docbook system, was considerably upgraded, and now is using Apache
FOP 0.93 release for producing printable PDF files.

A workshop on UIMA took place at the GLDV 2007 spring conference in
Tübingen/Germany, April 11-13, 2007. It was the first workshop of its kind
and drew a large and diverse audience from across Europe. Information about
this workshop with links to some of the papers was posted on the Apache UIMA
website
( http://incubator.apache.org/uima/gldv07.html ).

An announcement of funding for work on UIMA related projects and activities
for University Faculty was announced on the Apache Community mailing list.
This announcement drew both some criticism (of the form: is this an
appropriate use of that mailing list), as well as support (yes, it is an
appropriate use of that mailing list).


------------------------------------------------------
End of minutes for the June 27, 2007 board meeting.
