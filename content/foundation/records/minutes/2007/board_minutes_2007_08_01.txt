 8. Discussion Items

    A. New ASF/JCP Policy, including action/reaction schedules and timeframes.
       The intent is to come up with a clear policy, standards by which the
       ASF will continue to participate in the JCP, changes required for that
       participation and our course of action if such changes are not
       implemented.

    Outcome:

      1) We will vote "NO" on any vote for a JSR led by a spec lead we feel
         is out of compliance with the JSPA

      2) We will vote "NO" on any vote for a JSR where the spec lead won't
         commit to a FOU-free TCK licenses (for that JSR)

      3) We will vote "NO" for any final vote where the presented TCK
         license terms aren't FOU-free (for that JSR)

      4) We will move that the ECs adopt the following statement:

         "TCK licenses must not be used to discriminate against or
         restrict compatible implementations of Java specifications
         by including field of use restrictions on the tested
         implementations or otherwise.  Licenses containing such
         limitations do not meet the requirements of the JSPA, the
         agreement under which the JCP operates, and violate the
         expectations of the Java community that JCP specs can be
         openly implemented."

      5) We agree that additional publicity at this time would hamper
         efforts towards a successful resolution.

 9. Review Outstanding Action Items

    Geir: update http://www.apache.org/jcp/ with:
     * an authoritative statement on what TCK aspects can be discussed in
       public based on the TCK NDAs.

       Status: Deferred

    Bill: coordinate with Geir, and see if we can engage our lawyers to
       assist us with the JCK/FOU contract dispute.

       Status: Complete

    Geir: draft schedule for the next two to three months outlining options
       and strategies by the next board meeting.

       Status: Complete 

    Sam: Copyright/license of .dtd/.xsd files and other Reference Material
