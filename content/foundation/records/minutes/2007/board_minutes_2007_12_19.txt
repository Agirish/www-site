 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Jim]

       The month since the last board meeting has been a busy one for
       the ASF. First, of course, was the success (both critical and
       financial) of the ApacheCon US 2007 show in Atlanta. Secondly,
       an ASF special members meeting was held, via irc, on December 11th
       through the 13th. The main item of business was the election
       of new members into the ASF ranks. There were 40 candidates
       nominated, 32 of which were elected in. Invitation letters to
       those elected in have been sent, and we have received acceptance
       from a large number already. Turn out on the meeting was
       acceptable, with over 85 members attending the meeting (as
       applied to quorum requirements) and with around 99 members
       casting ballots. Due to scheduling mistakes, 2 executive
       officers were not present during the 1st half of the meeting
       but attended and reported during the 2nd half.

       As expected, the meeting and election process re-kicked off
       discussion regarding what makes a good member, what are the
       responsibilities of membership, whether there should be some
       sort of automatic emeritus status mechanism in place and the pros
       and cons of the ssh-based voter tool. Whether these discussions
       will actually lead to any concrete and actionable proposals
       remains to be seen.

       A more formal Year In Review report will be presented at the
       January 2008 meeting, but in general, we have seen healthly
       activity at the PMC level with good progress within the
       Incubator and good graduation-to-TLP with the Incubator and
       Jakarta projects, with initial efforts of the WS project to
       also promote subprojects to TLP status. Even with all this,
       from an oversight point-of-view, I see no potential problems
       with us scaling to handle this growth.

       Discussion: a request was made that the chair posts meeting
       attendance information from previous members meetings.  Jim
       agreed to pursue.

    B. President [Justin]

       As mentioned in the last report, the infrastructure team has met
       and discussed a variety of items over the past month.  For the
       time being, we continue to stay afloat through the work of our
       contracted sysadmin augmented by many volunteers.  In the past
       few weeks, a number of folks (some who have helped out in the
       past) have expressed a desire to help with some tasks and access
       has been granted accordingly.  I'm hopeful that we continue to
       see volunteers bridge the gap between our available resources and
       our needs.

       Longer-term, the infrastructure team has devised an acquisition
       strategy for the next eighteen months that will oversee the
       replacement of critical servers (including Subversion, mailing
       lists, and issue trackers) and expanding the range of services we
       can provide to our projects (build farms, staging servers, etc.).
       The plan, submitted as Attachment 8, calls for staggered hardware
       expenditure totalling almost $60,000 for the next eighteen
       months.

       Please note that these costs may get offset as or when vendors
       offer to donate equivalent hardware.  We have had discussions
       with some sponsors about donations - we expect some but not all
       of these plans to come to fruition.  Therefore, we expect to
       cover the balance of the plan through our own funds.  So,
       consider the $60,000 as the high-end if no donations come
       through.

       Also note that other expenditures may come up for maintenance
       of existing machines - this plan only covers upgrading existing
       machines but not maintenance.

       Discussion:
         * a question was asked about the hardware and our colo requirements.
           Justin responded that this was all covered by the plan.
         * a second question was asked about whether the existing sysadmin
           support was sufficient, or would additional hiring be required?
           Justin indicated that he thought we were OK for now, but this
           would likely need revisiting in 18 months.

       None of the directors were opposed to the proposal.

    C. Treasurer [J Aaron]

       Google and HP have provided the remainder of their sponsorship
       donations.  Otherwise, very little activity.

       We had a series of $0.01 paypal donations from a single
       individual.  I'm following-up to determine what the donor's
       intentions are.

       Paypal                         $  3,917.93  ($+ 1,137.52)
       Checking                       $136,421.93  ($- 3,061.80)
       Savings                        $155,934.44  ($+   530.88)
       Total			      $296,274.30  ($- 1,393.40)       

       Discussion:
        * There was a request for more details.  In particular, "significant"
          contributions and expenditures should be itemized.  As well as
          a budget.  And a published tax return.  (Justin took last item as a
          todo).

       See Attachment 2

       A question was asked reguarding the cost of joining SPEC.  Geir
       indicated that the goal was free.  Justin noted that previous
       attempts to join this organization faltered on this issue.

       OSSummit is still postponed: a new target date should be established
       in 4-6 weeks.  The new date is still expected to be in 2008.

       The report was modified to indicate that the contract with SCP is
       *through* 2010 instead of merely being *until* 2010.

       We discussed limiting archive access initially to just the concom
       members and the board -- this received quite a bit of opposition.
       Henri to draft an email for Joe to automate sending periodically
       (suggestion: monthly) to leakage sensitive lists like this one and
       legal-internal.  Beyond that, the main concern is to limit the 
       number of posters, not the number of readers.

       confirmed that he was in the loop and that this hardware is
       shared by multiple projects, despite how the wording of this
       report may lead one to think otherwise.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Legal Affairs


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of JCP

Things were generally quiet, with some activity around NDAs
and TCK access.

The highlight of this month was the quarterly JCP EC F2F meeting
held in Marlborough, a frigid suburb of Boston.  Held in a barn
heated by a woodstove in the corner, the closest seats to which
where appropriated and viciously defended by the repectable
gentlemen from IBM and the ASF, the meeting was very well attended
(probably the best F2F attendence in literally years) and has 
been noted publicly elsewhere, the meeting concentrated on the
"future of the JCP".  Led by Doug Lea, it really was a refreshing
and open discussion.

Due to the letter and spirit of the confidentiality restrictions 
of the event, I cannot report publicly any details other than what
I did, but will file a note to the members list later on this week.

As part of the discussion, I noted that for whatever reason, Sun
has not offered a JSR for Java SE 7, despite publicly talking about
such a version, and creating a project at OpenJDK to work on the
RI for the same.  Given that it has been 12 months since the 
release of Java SE 6, it clearly was time to move with Java SE 7
in order to prevent Java from falling even further behind other
computing platforms.  I asked that Sun, as the spec lead for Java
SE 6, to please bring forth a JSR for Java SE 7 for vote by the
EC, and be sure that such JSR made it clear that there would be
no FOU or other restrictions that could prevent any independent
implementation from being distributed under the terms of choice
by the implementor.  Failing that, I noted that the ASF was 
ready to lead or co-lead such a JSR, and if vetoed by Sun due to 
their special rights under the JSPA, we'd lead JSRs to add
new features and extensions to Java SE 6 as non-platform JSRs.

More will be in the report to the membership, but I will report
there that I'm cautiously optimistic that things are moving in 
the right direction.  I believe that while the JCP hasn't
"turned the corner", it's clear that it's recognized that 
there's a corner to turn around, and there is clear activity
and movement to figure out if we can.

Note : while not directly related to the office of VP, JCP, I'd like
to approach SPEC to attempt to secure benchmark suites for Apache
Harmony (and other projects). If there are any objections or
suggestions, please let me know

Attachment 3: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

This month saw the completion of some vulnerabilities in the HTTPD
project reported via JPCERT although the co-ordination process took a
lot of effort considering the low severity of the issues.

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds arriving
at security@apache.org. These continue to be dealt with promptly by the
security team.  For Nov 2007:

4       Support question
1       Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
4       Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
3       Vulnerability report

Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

  General News
  ------------

  * New Committee Member

    The conference committee has voted to add Martin van den Bemt as new
    member. Martin received 6 +1 votes (and no other votes). The change
    was acknowledged by the board (Henning Schmiedehausen) on November
    16, 2007.

  * Renewal of SCP Contract

    The ApacheCon contract with SCP has an evergreen clause, and the
    conference committee has voted to renew the contract. This extends
    the contract with SCP through 2010.

  * Meet the Producer

    A "Meet the Producer" session was held at ApacheCon US 2007, November
    13 to discuss ApacheCon. Fewer ASF members than expected attended the
    meeting, but the feedback and discussions have been very
    constructive, and ConCom will be - as far as possible - trying to
    address the issues or future conferences.

  * New concom-site Mailing List

    A new mailing list (concom-site at apache.org) has been created with
    the purpose of discussing and developing a new Conference Management
    System.

Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Audit Project

  No activity this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Public Relations Project

Justin and Jim met with HALO while at ApacheCon to discuss some very
preliminary ideas regarding pure marketing and community outreach. A HALO
contact was added to the PRC mailing list.

The big news is that we have a new Platinum  Sponsor, Yahoo!. This was
"announced" at ApacheCon during the State Of The Feather, but Y! just
released their PR a week ago.

There was some discussion regarding re-adding a "hardware section" to our
Thanks page, with 2 main categories: Hosting Providers and Equipment
Providers. The latter would be a simple plain-text notice.

Jason van Zyl requested the approval for the use of the name MavenForge,
designed to be a site that provides infrastructure for groups developing
Maven-related tools and applications. Both the PRC and the Maven PMC are
mulling over if this is a good idea or not.

A Terracotta PR was forwarded to the PRC for approval; it had
a very tight turnaround time, with the result that 2 semi-conflicting
messages were relayed to Terracotta. Nonetheless, they worked with us
to incorporate the changes. This is something that we will really
need HALO to help with - making our processes and procedures for
handling external PR requests (and feedback) clear and defined both
internally and externally.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Infrastructure Machine Plan

Acquisition strategy through May 2009; bottom line figure is $58,900.

Key features:
 - Replace our aging IBM x345s which are currently the cornerstone of
   our infrastructure - they are nearing 4 years old.
 - Stagger replacements so as not to do it all in one go
 - Gets a SVN mirror in EU
 - Equip a respectable build farm
 - Equip for CMS 'thing-ma-bob' with staging + 2 prod servers

The specifics of the machines may change, but this is an overall plan.

Acquisition strategy:

- OSL: Stay relatively power-neutral for next 4-6 mos; expand after then
- SARA: Expand to 20U 'early next year' (pushing for Feb.)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache APR Project

  Activity has picked up since the previous board report.  For the period
  Sept through Nov, we had some 365 commits to the core apr, apr-util and
  apr-iconv trunks by 19 active committers, many maintenance commits on
  the legacy branches, and some 15 APR and 8 APR-util bugs were resolved
  this period, with some 24 open bugs remaining.  There were new 1.2 
  maintenance releases of all three libraries, and an 0.9 apr maintenance
  release in this period.

  No significant pressure has occurred to push to the next 1.3 or 2.0 
  release, although several new API issues were raised and several patches
  have been committed and others are under consideration at this time.  

  No new committers were added this past quarter.

  Twelve individuals who had committed in the past 12 months were nominated
  and invited to participate in the PMC.  Of these, eight accepted and were
  added to the committee roster.  They are Davi Arnaut, Jean-Frederic Clere,
  Max Bowsher, Martin Kraemer, Mladen Turk, Rüdiger Pluem, Guenter Knauf
  and Bojan Smojver.

  Chuck Murco left the committee as emeritus, while Ben Laurie, Jim Blandy,
  and Ralf Engelschall were removed from the roster after no response to
  requests confirming their ongoing participation in the PMC.  This had no
  impact on their commit status; the request had the additional benefit of
  identifying one lost PMC member who since rejoined the pmc list, while
  Ralf has begun committing again, reaffirming the idea that it never hurts
  to just ask.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Cayenne Project

Development
-----------

    * Active development of Cayenne 3.0.
    * Posted 3.0M2 development milestone release
    * Posted 2.0.4 stable release
    * Switched Cayenne 3.0 development to Java 1.5 from a mixed Java 1.4/1.5
      setup after a poll on the user list revealed overwhelming community
      acceptance of requiring Java 1.5 for Cayenne 3.0.
    * Sun donated a server to ASF to be used for Cayenne test environment.
      Infra set it up for us. Cayenne developers took over from there, and now
      we are installing databases and CI software needed for Cayenne testing.

Community
---------

    * Restored commit rights of a committer emeritus Andriy Shapochka
    * Activity on the user list is about average, on dev list is above average.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

General
=======

 o The process of electing PMC members and committers has been fixed in writing

https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/pmc/commons/templates/new-pmc-workflow.txt

  This brought up the question what should happen first: Ask whether the person
  wants to join the PMC before asking for the board's ack ...or first checking
  with the board so that a rejection is a more private affair and does not harm
  any feeling of the potential candidate. The general consensus was to check 
  with the board first.

  If there any thoughts we are happy get some further feedback on this.

 o JDK compatibility has always been a strong contract at Commons.

  Support for older java version has always been very important. There still 
  is not a single Commons component that made the move to java 5. It has been 
  raised that this might become a problem in the future if we don't move 
  forward on this. More and more users expect us to also provide them with 
  libraries that make use of the features of new java platforms.
  This seems especially crucial for Commons Collections and Lang.

  The exact steps have not been decided yet but it seems like a separate
  package name and keeping the older libraries on a maintenance branch is
  a viable option.

 o Based on http://markmail.org/ user activity is slowly declining while 
   developer discussions have picked up a bit.

 o Quick news for some of the components:

  o Question has come up whether commons codec is thread safe
      - request for better documentation
  o More activity on commons jexl
      - discussion for a roadmap towards 2.0
  o Discussion about moving commons jci fam (file alteration monitor) 
    component from jci to io
      - overlap with commons vfs fam
      - no agreement how to move forward yet
      - options
        - keep in jci (already own jar)
        - own component (a bit small)
        - move into io (increases the size of io)
  o Again the question have been brought up about the status of commons 
    cli 2.0
      - working but no release
      - little activity
      - cli 1.1 introduced some showstoppers
      - other projects (like groovy) might look into other libraries instead
  o Concerns have been raised related to the retirement of Jakarta Slide. 
    It was suggested that VFS could include an implementation of a webdav 
    client.  This has been rejected as out of scope.

Releases
========

  o Released
    - commons configuration 1.5
    - commons logging 1.1.1
    - commons parent pom 5
    - commons skin 2

  o Upcoming
    - commons SCXML 0.7

Infrastructure
==============

  o The maven based release process has been discussed and improved.

  o Created a pmc area in subversion with
    - board reports
    - tsu report
    - process templates (new committer/new pmc member)

Community
=========

  o New committers
    - Jukka Zitting
  o New PMC member
    - James Carman
    - Ben Speakmon


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Excalibur Project

Highlights:

    * 1 new PMC members: Thomas Vandahl


This quarter was a very quiet one - nearly zero activity, neither in the
mailing lists nor in subversion, and no releases. By adding new
committers and PMC members from the projects that are using Excalibur we
now hopefully have established a solid base to maintain our users in the
future.

There are no known issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Felix Project

Community

   * Added Felix Meschberger to the PMC.
   * Presented at ApacheCon in Atlanta; see writeup at InfoQ^
     <http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/12/felix-osgi-container>.
   * Discussion was raised on the mailing lists about defining a road
     map for officially releasing more subprojects. The general
     consensus is that we really need to start working on releases of
     all reasonably stable subprojects. Hopefully, this will start to
     happen over the next month or two.
   * Peter Kriens announced his desire to donate his FileInstall
     bundle; the paperwork has been started, but an official vote is
     needed.
   * Karl Pauls announced that he was able to get Felix working on
     Google's Android, see his blog^
     <http://blog.luminis.nl/luminis/entry/osgi_on_google_android_using>;
     we need to determine if we can incorporate his changes into the trunk.

Software

   * Released 1.0.1 version of core Felix sub-projects (i.e., framework
     and main). This release fixed mostly minor bugs discovered since
     the prior release, although there were a few minor new features
     added as well.
   * Preparing 1.0.2 release of core Felix sub-projects (i.e.,
     framework and main); changes to include:
         o Refinements to specification interpretation and/or
           compliance. (FELIX-383)
         o Additional improvements to make the framework easier to
           embed in other projects. (FELIX-359, FELIX-380, FELIX-388,
           FELIX-393, FELIX-414, FELIX-428)
         o Various small bug fixes. (FELIX-371, FELIX-381, FELIX-394,
           FELIX-416)
   * Updates to numerous subprojects, including iPOJO, Bundle Plugin,
     and SCR Plugin.
   * Clement Escoffier introduced the Maven OBR plugin, which makes it
     possible for us to generate bundle repository files for deploying
     bundles, which has been integrated with the Bundle Plugin.

Licensing and other issues

   * The paperwork for Peter Kriens' grant was incorrectly recorded
     (his name, the company name, and the donated code were all
     misspelled), so we are trying to get that fixed.
   * Need to finalize OSGi TCK access by getting OSGi Alliance TCK
     license executed by the board, I would assume.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Infrastructure:

    * no news is good news.

Technical:

    * the Maven 2 experiments on the Solaris zone have been
      encouraging but limited because many projects either don't build
      on Java6 or depend on projects that don't.  Stefan plans to
      merge the experimental stuff into the main Gump line of
      development during the next quarter.

    * We've turned off the Kaffee build.  We never got far due to
      various Kaffee internal problems and right now no Gump
      contributor has spare cycles to spend on keeping the build
      going.

Other:

    * still all Apache committers have access to metadata in svn.

    * no releases.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project

Summary
=======
Apache Harmony is making good progress towards releasing a full
Java SE implementation, and the community is working well.  We
are still looking to the Board to help resolve the JCK license
issue. 

Development
===========
The development team have been very busy since our last report. We
declared Milestone build 5.0M3 on Oct 9, 2007, and since then have been
working towards Milestone 4 which is scheduled for the week of Dec 17.
The team is settling into a rhythm of delivering stable, well-tested,
development drivers approximately every eight weeks.

Besides the steady and continuous work of bug fixing and enhancements
across all aspects of the codebase (over 570 JIRAs resolved/closed, and
over 1000 commits since our last Board report), there has been
noteworthy advancements in the following areas:

 * build-test infrastructure : regular testing of nightlies with more
     applications and scenarios.
 * code coverage : additional tests have improved functional coverage.
 * JIT : lots of new optimizations such as operator strength reduction,
     loop versioning, array/string search and comparison optimizations,
     and stack alignment when using SSE instructions; and new features
     such as bytecode-based edge profiling.
 * awt : printer job implementation.
 * nio : improvements in selector code, including epoll support.
 * pack200 : good progress on implementing this complex spec.
 * sql : implementing SQL rowset.
 * ldap : we now have a working ldap provider.
 * JVMTI : ported to x86_64 platforms (both Linux and Windows).
 * java 6 class library : steady progression towards Java 6 APIs.
 * platform support : support for full hardware addressability on
     64 bit platforms, work on z/OS support.

We also received a contribution of JVMTI Extension: Native Code Access
Interface (NCAI) implementation by Intel which allows seamless debugging
of Java and native code across the JNI boundary.

At infra's request our stable milestone builds are being mirrored to
reduce the pressure on ASF servers. However, we are keeping a number of
snapshot builds and test results on-line to enable simpler regression
analysis, and these can be quite large.

Releases
========
We continue to look to the Board for a successful resolution to the JCK
license impasse so that we can go for Java SE certification.

After consultation with the Board and legal-internal, the Harmony PMC
plan to make an end-user release available once we complete our best
effort to demonstrate compliance with the specifications.  We are 99%
API complete for Java 5, and achieving a reasonable set of providers.

Security
========
There were no reported security issues this period.

Community
=========
The community continues to operate in a healthy manner with a vibrant
developer list.

To facilitate broader community involvement we are in the process of
translating some webpages, and now accept bug reports, in Russian and
Chinese. A number of PMC members are fluent in these languages so can
provide due oversight. The bug reports are translated into English by
native speakers upon receipt.

We are fortunate to have developers from EIOffice (a large Java office
suite) contributing to Harmony's development effort, and have been
encouraged to see the uptake of Harmony code in highly visible releases
such as Google Android and IBM Java SDK.

The PMC elected three new committers this period, Andrey A. Pavlenko,
(Jimmy) Jing Lv, and Mikhail Markov; and one new PMC member,
Xiao-Feng Li. There are currently 30 committers, ~21 of whom were active
this period. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache HttpComponents Project

-- Status --

There are no items needing immediate attention of the board though it is
worth to note that we had two releases in the meantime and that the move
to TLP is nearly done. See below for more details.

-- Releases --

This list includes all releases since our last report as a Jakarta
sub-project in September 2007.

  9 October 2007 - HttpComponents HttpCore 4.0 alpha 6
  7 November 2007 - HttpComponents HttpClient 4.0 alpha 2

-- Community --

No new committers, the PMC still has the same composition as of the date
of TLP approval:

  erikabele, antelder, asankha, olegk, oglueck, pzf, rolandw, sebb

It is also worth to note that currently all active committers are also on
the PMC.

-- Migration --

We are nearly done moving out of Jakarta to our own dedicated TLP; there
are still some minor things to be done but the PMC is actively working on
getting everything in shape until end of the year.

Items done:

    - Updated foundation records (internal & public)
    - Updated ASF Site (links, records, ...)
    - Created / moved mailing lists
      dev@/commits@/httpclient-users@/private@ hc.a.o
    - Created new TLP SVN tree and private pmc-specific SVN tree
      https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/
      https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpcomponents/
    - Created DNS, Unix group and website space
      http://hc.apache.org/
      http://httpcomponents.apache.org/ (redirects to hc.a.o)
    - Created dist location and archive location
      http://www.apache.org/dist/httpcomponents/
      http://archive.apache.org/dist/httpcomponents/
    - Added raw mail archives, merged out of the old lists
      http://hc.apache.org/mail/
    - Updated Jira components, links and mailing list notifications
    - Requested changes of mod_mbox archives as well as move of the wiki

Items still in work:

    - Move of SVN contents
    - Move of wiki, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-1442
    - Move of website when moved in SVN
    - Updating website with the new mailing lists, locations of svn,
      dist and wiki locations
    - Adding redirects for the old site/svn as soon as moved
    - Adding project-specific DOAP info (projects.apache.org)
    - Updating Gump integration
    - Creating the bylaws, currently we're still operating under the
      previous Jakarta-specific bylaws

-- Development --

After the HttpCore 4.0 alpha6 release, the Java version requirement
question was raised once more by a contributor. We held a poll on the user
list which showed zero interest in JDK 1.4 compatibility. We therefore
upgraded the required Java version to 5.0 for everything but HttpCore-main.
HttpCore-main remains compatible with Java 1.3 to facilitate a port to J2ME,
if anyone wants to do that.

HttpCore alpha6 was the last alpha, but we still made significant API
improvements for the upcoming beta. The parsing API was changed to use
cursors, and new iterators for header values were introduced. After the
upgrade of the Java requirements, module HttpNIOSSL was merged into HttpNIO.
HttpNIO now makes use of generics, and has also seen some improvements and
extensions of its API.

HttpClient 4.0 alpha2 was functionally mostly complete. Remaining gaps to
3.1 functionality are NTLM authentication and multipart request entities.
NTLM authentication will be provided in a separate module. We still have to
figure out whether we can host that module on Apache, since it will depend
on L-GPL licensed jCIFS. None of the developers wants to maintain the NTLMv1
code from HttpClient 3.1. A multipart request entity is used for file
uploads, and for extendend protocols like WebDAV. Since we currently focus
our efforts on HTTP, multipart is somewhat out of scope. Other projects
provide multipart parsing functionality, but not the formatting we would
need. It seems most likely that multipart formatting code will end up in
some contrib package, which is officially unsupported but will work. The
alpha3 release is still a long way to go. We've upgraded the code to make
use of Java 5 generics. Other Java 5 features will be used too, for example
in connection management. The thread-safe connection manager still needs
some internal refactoring. Improvements to the client API can be expected
all over the place.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache iBATIS Project

Since our August 2007 report, the Apache iBATIS project continues to provide 
routine user support. The codebase is stable, and some preliminary coding 
has begun as to the iBATIS 3.0 whiteboard. No community issues to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Shindig, a "SocialContainer" is entering Incubation.  PDFBox and Bennu
(based on the old m0n0wall project) have been proposed to the Incubator.
RAT is in the Incubator, and will need to start reporting.

Woden has graduated to the WS Project.  FTPServer is in the process of
moving to MINA.  Yoko (CORBA ORB) is being split up, with parts going to
Geronimo and CXF.

UIMA, QPid, CXF did releases.

A number of new committers and PMC members added.

Community diversity is an area that was discussed, especially with Tuscany
failing to graduate over concerns related to community diversity.

========================

=== Buildr ===

Description - Buildr is a build system for Java applications written in
Ruby.

Date of Entry - Nov. 2007

Community
---------
The buildr community is transitioning from its older infrastructure to the
Apache one. The code has been imported and committers work on the Apache SVN
now. The migration of users from buildr-talk at google groups to buildr-user
is also happening progressively.

Development
-----------
Mostly bug fixes and small improvements. There's also work on JRuby support
for which patches are submitted regularly from (for now) external
contributors.

Issues before graduation
------------------------
First we need to fix the IP issues surrounding the Ruby license and our Ruby
licensed dependencies before any release can be made. A thread has been
started on general@i.a.o and another one is still running on
legal-discuss@a.o but we've had few answers so far. We'll probably send a
proposition and see if that's acceptable.


=== River ===

River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology
core infrastructure. Jini technology is a service oriented architecture that
defines a programming model which both exploits and extends Java technology
to enable the construction of secure, distributed systems which are adaptive
to change.

The crypto issue mentioned in last report seems to be resolved without doing
anything special as it seems to be not necessary based on the (limited)
feedback in the legal mailing list.

The River community decided to start with a CTR policy although we urge
people to consult others before actually committing for all but the trivial
cases.

We decided we want to use Hudson as our continuous integration engine, but
we have to wait a while for a server becomes available to deploy it on,
hopefully somewhere in December/January.

Work on the first release moved steady as a glacier (global warming seems to
have no effect here :-) ) and didn't require much participation of
committers due to the set goals. Currently there is no outstanding work for
that first release.

We are picking and scheduling fixes and features for the next release and
are discussing a branching strategy for SVN before we can finally release
the trunk to a stampede of hungry people that will crash into the codebase
to make it better.

Incubating since: December 2006


=== Imperius ===

Imperius has been incubating since November 2007.

Imperius is a rule-based infrastructure management tool

Infrastructure has been partly set up. Mailing lists for dev, commits,
private, and user are operational. The repository has been set up.

Community

Two of the original committers have had accounts created. We are waiting
for the arrival of ICLAs for the others.


=== JSPWiki ===

JSPWiki has been incubating since September 2007.

JSPWiki is a JSP-based wiki program.

The final JSPWiki LGPL release has been postponed due to a large
number of security vulnerabilities that were disclosed to us
right before the release, so unfortunately that has also delayed
the move of the codebase under ASF's infrastructure.

The JSPWiki user community is in the process of transition from
outside Apache. There are close to 100 subscribers to the user list.
The developer list has meanwhile continued growing, and new people
have come forward with patches and expressions of interest on
working on the code.


=== Sanselan ===

Sanselan has been in incubation since September 2007.

Sanselan is a pure-java image library for reading and writing
a variety of image formats.

The community is still small, with a few more members now compared
to the beginning.

The code base has been imported and the package names have been
changed to org.apache.sanselan.

A release is being prepared.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  Apache Jackrabbit 1.3.3 was released in October.

  We are currently working on the 1.4 release. Jackrabbit 2.0, with
  JCR 2.0 support, will likely be released next year.

o Community

  Martijn Hendriks and Ard Schrijvers were added as a committers and
  PMC members.

  The recent decision by the Apache Jakarta PMC to close the Slide project
  has brought a number of people interested in WebDAV to the Jackrabbit
  mailing lists. Most notably there is interest in extending and further
  developing the WebDAV client library in Jackrabbit. We may well end up
  working together with the new Apache HttpComponents project on this
  front.

o Development

  The main development focus at the moment it on the 1.4 release, but
  there's already some work towards implementing the new JCR 2.0 features
  being specified by Jsr 283.

  Once the 1.4 release is out we will need to decide when and how to
  split Jackrabbit into separate JCR 2.0 development and JCR 1.0
  maintenance branches.

  A sandbox project was started for prototyping the Jackrabbit Next
  Generation Persistence proposal that tries to address some long term
  architectural issues in Jackrabbit.

o Infrastructure

  We have acquired a Confluence wiki space for managing our project web
  site but we have yet to migrate the web site contents.

Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Jakarta Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache JAMES Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Labs Project

All it's quiet in Apache Labs.

Some of the labs have some more or less steady activity and a few have
more than one people working on it, but nothing that has yet reached the
point of requiring action on the evolution of the lab.

                               - o -

One interesting lab that somewhat differs from all the others is Roy's
Webarch (http://labs.apache.org/webarch/) which is now being used as
input for the work of the HTTP next-gen IETF working group.

I was, in fact, very positively surprised to see a reference to
labs.apache.org from various blog posts on the future of HTTP and I like
the fact that such links give credibility to labs.

I feel the need to outline, though, that the "no release" rule for labs
was created to avoid people from using labs as a way to route around the
incubator, yet 'code-less' labs are able, in fact, to 'release' their
own documentation artifacts, without oversight or the need for a
community around the effort.

That said, I'm only outlining the existence of such issue but I do not
think this is currently creating a problem: the Webarch pages reflect
the labs.apache.org style and in doing so clearly mark the work as
'experimental' or 'researchy', which is very similar than people
publishing stuff on their people.apache.org/~user/ pages and creates a
level of distance between any official apache position and the pages,
even if they are served off of *.apache.org domains.

Let me repeat: I think that Webarch and code-less labs are a *good
thing* and should be encouraged in any way possible, as long as the
product of their effort is clearly marked as coming from a lab (which is
the case for Webarch) and not used as a way to abuse the apache branding
to give resonance to an individual committer's effort.

I'm just mentioning this so that both labs@ and board@ consider this
food for thought and in no way I want such food for thought endanger the
ability to use labs in the way Roy has done... but it's my duty, as PMC
chair, to report changes in the project evolution that might require, in
the future, board attention that this is the closest thing to that (even
if, right now, does not require any action from any part and it's
unlikely that it will require any in the future either).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

TLP

The top-level project added one new PMC member, Michael McCandless. Lucene
and it's sub-projects were well represented at ApacheCon US 2007, including
highly attended trainings and sessions by project members Grant Ingersoll,
Chris Hostetter, and Michael Busch and contributor Ken Krugler.

The Hadoop subproject has proposed becoming a top-level project.  In
initial discussions there have been few objections, and we expect to put a
resolution before the board in January.  Hadoop's community is largely
distinct from other Lucene subprojects.

LUCENE JAVA

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit.  Development has been very active
and there have been many core improvements, especially in the area of
indexing performance.  We are preparing for a feature freeze before a 2.3
release early in 2008.

HADOOP

Hadoop is a scalable distributed computing platform.  Development has
continued to be very active.  Release 0.15.1 was published in November.
Five new committers were added this quarter, Raghu Angadi, Hairong Kuang,
Konstantin Shvachko, Runping Qi, and Chris Douglas.

SOLR

Solr is a full text search server.  We continue to see strong adoption and
community interest.  Development has been active with many new core
features being added.

NUTCH

Nutch is a web-search engine: crawler, indexer and search runtime.
Development has slowed somewhat this quarter, but the project is still
reasonably active.

LUCY

Lucy will develop a shared C-based core for ports of Lucene to other
languages, such as Perl, Python and Ruby.  Little progress has been made
this quarter.

LUCENE.NET (incubating)

Lucene.Net is an port of Lucene to C# on the .NET platform.  Development
continues, but is still primarily a one-developer project.

TIKA (incubating)

Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured text
content from various documents using existing parser libraries. Development
has been active and one new committer was added, Keith Bennett.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Maven Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache OFBiz Project

This report, for December 2007, is the third quarterly report (following the
initial 3 monthly reports) for OFBiz (Open For Business) as a top level
project.

The Open For Business Project (Apache OFBiz) is an open source enterprise
automation software project. By enterprise automation we mean: ERP, CRM,
E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Community:

- two new PMC members have been voted in and are now listed in the
committee-info.txt file: Anil Patel and Adrian Crum; both have been involved
with OFBiz for quite a while and have contributed significantly and their
experience and continued help is of great value to the project

- five new committers have been invited to join in based on their
contributions and continued participation: Ashish Vijaywargiya, Bilgin
Ibryam, Christian Geisert (an ASF member and committer on other Apache
projects used in OFBiz), Marco Risaliti, and Vikas Mayur; all new committers
are now setup except for Vikas Mayur as his iCLA just barely made it through

- the community and activity in the community are growing well; with new
committers on the project and various contributors increasing their activity
the project is seeing around twice the commit and mailing list activity as
this time last year, and around half again as much from just the last quarter

Project:

- a number of stability issues have been fixed, and general database and
transaction stability has been improved by moving from the old Minerva
connection pool to using Apache DBCP

- enhancements and improvements, smaller iterative development, is going on
throughout the project; this is one area where increased community size and
involvement is having an impact

- the other areas that are seeing major improvement and new development from
new contributors and people who have been contributing (and committing) for
years are the accounting and project management component; with this new
development OFBiz is able to more completely meet the needs of industries
where the project is already strong and help the project apply to new
industries that have previously not been well addressed

-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Portals Project

No new releases
No new committers

Jetspeed 2.1.3 and Bridges 1.0.4 releases have been delayed
A RC is expected this week. A final release by January 2008

Pluto is continuing working towards the Portlet 2.0 specification reference
implementation.

JSR-286 implementation is coming along at Pluto, and we plan to integrate
with it in Jetspeed in the 1st Quarter 2008. At ApacheCon, all Portals
committers agreed in principal to starting the Portals Applications
subproject at Apache Portals.

The WSRP4J project is still problematic. I am trying to learn more about
the licensing problems, and why this issue prohibits moving WSRP4J out of
incubator Any help from legal is much appreciated as we have been stuck
here for a long time now


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Quetzalcoatl Project

Finally just recently the mailing lists and other infrastructural things
for the Quetz TLP have been done and so the TLP transition is nearly
complete.

Aside from this, not much activity, mod_python development activity is
mostly dormant, no new releases in the pipeline.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache ServiceMix Project

This report for December is the third monthly report since ServiceMix
graduation.

ServiceMix resources have been completely moved out of the Incubator area. 
We have reorganized the svn subtree so that both ServiceMix 3.x and 4.x
versions can coexist.

We have released ServiceMix 3.2.1 on December the 2nd. Work is continuing
on ServiceMix 4.0: a subproject Apache ServiceMix Runtime has been 
extracted and should be released this month.

On the community side, Freeman Fang has accepted the proposed PMC
membership (the vote was being held at the time the previous board
meeting took place).  Kristian's account has been created.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

Nothing much has happened in the past 3 months.

We've moved our backend stuff to use gaea and vmsa as the core hosts for
rule update generation. Unfortunately, external time limitations are
getting in the way, I think, so progress is slow.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

Releases

The Tiles PMC applied the "GA" quality tag to release 2.0.5. This is
the first production-quality release of the Standalone Tiles project
and has been over two years in the making.

Incubator

Antonio Petrelli, a Tiles PMC member, would like to incubate a
Sourceforge project he's worked on called Dimensions
(http://mutidimensions.sourceforge.net/ ). In his words "Dimensions is
an extension of Tiles (Tiles 2 version is developed but not released)
that allows to configure different Tiles definitions for different
"dimensions" (currently they are the user role and the calling
device)." A draft proposal can be found here:

    http://cwiki.apache.org/TILES/dimensionsincubationproposal.html

Our understanding is that incubation requires an Apache member to
champion the project. The Tiles PMC has voiced approval of the
incubation but we've been unable to find a champion. If the board
knows of anyone interested in championing this incubation we would
appreciate the help.

Community

Activity remains steady on the Tiles user mailing list. However,
developer support is not as strong as it could be. At any given time
there's only been one or two committers who are doing the work,
although the active commiter(s) have been different people at
different times. I believe the reasoning is that, for some of us,
Tiles is not part of our daily work, and our interest is more of a
hobby .Therefore, our contribution time is limited and sporadic. Those
who are using the software on a daily basis are involved in the Users
mailing list, but very few have contributed to the project so far.
IOW, we haven't added committers because no one has really stepped up
to the task. I don't currently see a huge cause for concern. Now that
we've released a GA version, maybe more people will start contributing
over time. Or, perhaps, there's a feeling that Tiles largely works and
doesn't need a great deal of enhancement. I felt the board should be
aware that activity has been slow. We welcome suggestions if the board
feels we should do more to promote the project.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

Summary
--------------
The project continues to be active on a number of fronts.  There are
no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Releases
-------------
There were no releases this month.
However we are pretty close to releasing Tomcat 6.0.15 and mod_jk 1.2.26

Security
------------
We had less security related issues, so it seems most of them
has been fixed for forthcoming releases.

Development
-------------------
Lots of development took place, mostly related to bug
fixing the reasons 6.0.15 failed the release.

The Tomcat PMC is participating in the Google Highly Open
Participation (GHOP) project, an effort to involve high school
students in open-source software development.  We submitted five tasks
to the project: three have been completed, and two are in progress:
- The Tomcat FAQ was migrated from a static document set accessible
only to committers to a public wiki,
- New documentation in the areas of Tomcat internal dependencies, and
guides on programming Tomcat Valves and Realms
- Improved XSLT / CSS handling for the printer-friendly version of
tomcat.apache.org pages

The Tomcat PMC hopes to continue its involvement with these types of
projects, and maybe pick up a couple of new contributors in the
process.


Community
-----------------
There were no changes the committership nor PMC membership
this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project

* Notable Happenings

Newly elected committers included Bjorn Townsend, Upul Godage, Sanjaya
Karunasen, Selvaratnam Uthaiyashankar.

New PMC members - Sanka Samaranayake, Nandika Jayawardane, Chathura Herath.

Woden graduation!

* Subproject News

The following are the specifics for each project that has had significant
activity during this quarter. If a project is not mentioned below, there's
nothing to report.

Axis2

We have a list of desired 1.4 features on the wiki, and are hoping to start
moving towards a release early in 2008.  Some bug fixing and slow but
steady development happening.

Axis2/C

We are preparing for the 1.2.0 release. The release is expected to happen
before the end of December.

Axis

Started slowly moving towards a 1.5 release, with new committer Bjorn
taking the reins.

jUDDI

Released version 2.0rc5 on Dec 11. Work on UDDI v3 should start soon after
we can get a final release for 2.0. The Voting process seems to be hard as
there are not many active PMC members it seems.

Scout

Marching toward a final 1.0 release. Apart from a few bug fixes not much
happened in the last quarter.

Synapse

Since graduation in January, Synapse has done a 1.0 release, followed by a
1.1 release in November. Committers have presented on Synapse at ApacheCon
Europe, the Grails Exchange as well as running a tutorial at ApacheCon
Atlanta. Synapse has proposed a resolution to the board proposing a move to
become a Top Level Project.

Woden

On Dec. 8, 2007, Woden graduated from the Incubator into Web Services.
Woden is now focused on migrating the project infrastructure to the Web
services project and completing the Milestone 8 release, which is planned
for December 28th.

Sandesha2/C

We are preparing for the 0.92 release. It is expected to be happened after
the Axis2/C 1.2.0 release.

Rampart/C

Getting ready for the Rampart/C 1.1 release, which is scheduled to be
released after the Axis2/C. Now we are testing our scenarios with the
latest Axis2/C. You may find new features for this release here:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/webservices/rampart/trunk/c/NEWS

XML-RPC

Apart from the XML-RPC 3.1 release there were no notable happenings.

JaxMe2

No notable happenings.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Wicket Project

Apache Wicket is a Java framework for creating highly dynamic, component
oriented web applications, and was established as an Apache project in June
2007. This is the first report conforming to the three month reporting
schedule.

Summary

A surprisingly big community event in Amsterdam. Two release candidates
released since the last report. 13 tasks have been submitted to the GHOP,
and one task has been completed. No changes in the project membership.
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Community

The community is blossoming. We had a Dutch Wicket Community meeting on
november 30th in Amsterdam. The meeting was visited by 80+ people coming
from Belgium, Germany and mostly the Netherlands. The meeting was a great
success and we want to organize this event again next year.

More community events are being organized around the world: Rio, San
Francisco, Stockholm, Copenhagen and London have had or are organizing
events.

There were no new project members elected.

Software

We have released two release candidates for our 1.3 release. The number of
open issues is decreasing. We hope to release 1.3 final before the end of
the year.

Our team has switched release manager: previously Martijn Dashorst was the
release manager (since Wicket's inception as an open source project). The
last couple of releases have been created by Frank Bille without any
problems.

Google Highly Open Participation

Wicket is participating in Google's GHOP (Google Highly Open Participation)
initiative and initially submitted 13 tasks for students to complete. So
far, three tasks have been completed and 2 more tasks are either claimed or
in review phase.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

The project continues to be active. The development continues mostly
with bug fixes. The traffic on mailing lists continues to be high. There
are many user questions but many show XMLBeans as part of complex
applications.

There are no new releases this time. 
There were no PMC changes. Jacob Danner was added as a new committer to
the project.

Also we found out that the latest release of IntelliJ Idea (7.0.1)
includes out of the box integration with XMLBeans.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Status report for the Apache stdcxx Project

This is the first stdcxx Board report since graduating on 11/15.

       http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-1421

Future plans:

  Currently working toward a maintenance release for 4.2.0 expected
  in the February to March 2008 timeframe. This will be the first
  release to formally follow the new release process and version
  policy, a document that's currently being finalized on stdcxx-dev.
  Development of a large number of new features specified by the
  upcoming C++ 0x standard (expected to be ratified by the end of
  the decade) is being planned for 4.3 (compatible enhancements)
  and 5.0 (breaking changes), and is expected to commence shortly.
