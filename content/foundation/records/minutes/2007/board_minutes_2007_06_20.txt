 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Greg]

       Greg reported that there was no new information to report
       since what was reported at the members meeting.

    B. President [Sander]

       The reseller we ordered our Sun hardware with went out of
       business.  As a result we have been dealing directly with
       Sun.  Sun did come through; at the day of the members meeting,
       the hardware showed up unannounced.

       Tomorrow Colm and I will visit the colo, and will try to get
       as far as possible with the setup.  If tomorrow is not sufficient
       to finish up, next Tuesday will be another oportunity for myself.

       Furthermore discussion around build systems has picked up a bit
       again on infrastructure@.  It would be advisable to have someone
       with cycles to investigate what we can do there.  We've talked
       about facilitating projects more by providing build infrastructure,
       but we never really got beyond that point.

    C. Treasurer [Justin]

       The balances below reflects the already paid 3Q invoice from
       Google (yay). HP's next installment still needs to be submitted
       into their arcane processing system.

       A preliminary P&L report for last fiscal year was submitted at
       the members meeting. The next step will be to create a draft
       990 filing for review by the Audit Committee.  The final filing
       will be due to the IRS on September 15.

       It is expected that with the appointment of a new Treasurer at
       this meeting that the coming month will be spent transitioning
       preliminary access to all of the accounts and transitioning the
       books and such.

       Current balances (as of 6/19/2007):

        Paypal             $    206.72 (-$ 1,065.08)
        Checking           $ 63,315.17 (+$25,277.65)
        Savings            $154,135.35 (+$   363.82)
        Total              $217,657.24 (+$24,576.39)

    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]

       The big news, of course, is that the annual ASF Members Meeting
       was held, via IRC, on June 5th through the 7th. Elections
       were held for new members and a new board, with the following
       results:
       
        New Board:

          Justin Erenkrantz, J Aaron Farr, Jim Jagielski
          Geir Magnusson Jr, William A Rowe Jr, Sam Ruby
          Henning Schmiedehausen, Greg Stein, Henri Yandell

        New Members:

          Curt Arnold, David Blevins, Nathan Bubna
          Danese Cooper, Ate Douma, Graham Dumpleton
          Ant Elder, Ruchith Fernando, Rony Flatscher
          Jeff Genender, Ralph Goers, Richard Hall
          Niclas Hedhman, Matt Hogstrom, Chris Hostetter
          Deepal Jayasinghe, Simon Kitching, Emmanuel Lecharney
          Trustin Lee, Noirin Plunkett, Craig Russell
          Andrew Savory, Yonik Seeley, Mark Thomas

       It should be noted that we have not yet received
       acceptance from all new members, so the above list
       is still ASF private.

       The meeting went well, with over half of the membership attending
       (including proxies) and about half voting. A slight change to
       the voter tool was implemented to make the 'vote' line a
       single line rather than 2 lines, to make it easier for script
       junkies to "automate" their voting.

       We have received no correspondence that requires board attention.

       Jim mentioned that a summer project will be to replace the
       current FAX machine with a FAX-Email gateway, likely by
       using an old iMac he has available.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Legal Affairs

On May 31st, the FSF released its "last call draft" of the 
GPLv3.  In this draft and its associated press releases, the
FSF prominently states that there is no longer a concern 
about the Apache License being "incompatible" with the GPLv3.
The compatibility issue is describing whether they see a 
problem with an Apache-Licensed component being included 
within a larger GPLv3-licensed work.  This is what they no 
longer see a problem with.  Of course, there would still be 
much concern and debate about the licensing restrictions of a
larger Apache-Licensed work that included a GPLv3-licensed
component.

The only other issue to report is that the legal affairs 
committee has been up and running for well over a month.  In
fact, I coordinated approval of the FSF's proposed GPLv3 
wording with the committee (although sadly didn't plan far
enough advance to coordinate this report).  I will soon be
asking the committee for nominations and an election of a 
new VP of Legal Affairs, with a proposed resolution before
the Board by next month's meeting.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds arriving
at security@apache.org. These continue to be dealt with promptly by the
security team.  For May 2007 we had 10 non-SPAM requests:

3       Support question
2       User was hacked, but it wasn't ASF software at fault
2       Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
3       Vulnerability report

One of the vulnerability reports was in fact first reported in May 2006,
but was never responded to as the issues were not deemed important.
Whilst we are very responsive for issues of critical severity and issues
that are not vulnerability reports, issues with no or low security impact
have sometimes get lost: we're looking at ways to prevent this.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Status report for the Apache Travel Assistance Committee

There has been no change since last month. The ATA committee is awaiting
final and official notice of the speakers and sessions for ApacheCon US
(as well as the website being updated) before we put out a call
for Requests For Assistance. It seems premature to do so until
people know who is speaking and what sessions are available.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Audit Project

The Audit committee are still inactive. The outstanding issue is
to find an external auditor for the ASF accounts, but this is not
actively being worked on.

We need to get in touch with Justin concerning the return and what 
we can do to help.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Public Relations Project

Status since last board meeting:

  o The ASF Sponsorship and Thanks Pages are complete
    and live. All sponsors have rec'd their official
    "ASF Sponsor" logos

  o Axis2/C 1.0.0 Press Release done (PR Newswire)

  o Synapse 1.0 Press Release done (PR Newswire)

  o Review of external non-ASF specific PRs
    (WSO2, Luminus). These are not "joint" PRs
    in any way, but the people releasing them wanted
    us to look over the drafts to ensure there was nothing
    in them that we would have trouble or issues with.

  o OpenJPA PR in process; a rough draft has been received
    and preliminary feedback has been provided.

  o Rec'd emailed questions from Ed Burnette (SAS.com and
    Zdnet) regarding AL 2.0 and GPLv3 compatibility. Justin
    handled this request.

  o Looking into releasing ASF PR about new board, officers
    and Sponsorship Program.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache APR Project

  Activity has been slow/steady since the previous board report.  For the
  period March through May, we had some 75 commits to trunk (the future 1.3
  or 2.0 version) by 11 active committers, many maintenance commits on the
  legacy branches, and some 25 APR, 3 APR-iconv and 10 APR-util bugs were
  resolved this period, with some 37 open bugs remaining.  There were no new
  releases in that period.  (Three packages were tagged in June for release
  votes - still ongoing.)

  No significant interest/pressure has occurred to push to the next 1.3 or
  2.0 release.  By APR versioning rules, 2.0 occurs once there is action
  to fix broken ABI or naming convention issues which render the libraries
  incompatible, and this isn't foreseen at this time.  It's very possible
  that either httpd or another consuming project will be the driving factor
  for development of, and for shipping the next version.  Prior to releasing
  1.3 or 2.0, the md4/md5 code license issue raised by the BSD project is
  the only apparent showstopper (RSA license grant).  The project welcomes
  appropriate patches to resolve that.

  Three committers were added, fuankg, davi and rpluem.  There were no new
  PMC members added, and this is a yellow-flag that the project should now
  be considering PMC nominations.  Garrett, as mentioned in March, did step
  down from the Chair of the APR project, and the project members thank him
  for his service and dedication as Chairman.

  As an incoming project chair, I was able to take advantage of Sally's
  Media Training in Amsterdam, and strongly encourage the board to convince
  her to repeat this, and find the funding to make it happen, at future
  ApacheCon events for our PRC members, project chairman, as well as other
  ASF contributors as space permits.  I believe it's a win for our projects
  to gain some of her insight into communicating with the technical press.

Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Cayenne Project

APACHE CAYENNE PROJECT STATUS - June 2007

Development
-----------

     * Posted 2.0.3 release from the stable branch.
     * Active discussion of the new ORM inheritance features is going  
on the dev list.

Community
---------

     * Kevin Menard was added to Cayenne PMC.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Excalibur Project

  Excalibur Quarterly Report for June 2007

  Highlights:

   1 new PMC member: Jorg Heymans
   2 releases

  Excalibur has been a little less sleepy this last quarter by adding
  a new PMC member and making two releases (one major release, one
  minor release). No new committers and no other major activity to
  speak of.

  Most Excalibur activity is driven by Cocoon development which has me
  wondering if the Excalibur community is really strong enough to
  warrant a TLP. This is something I think the Excalibur developers
  need to address over the next quarter.

  best regards,

  J Aaron Farr on behalf of the Excalibur PMC


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Felix Project

Community

    * Feathercast Felix podcast released.
    * Presentations at OSGi Community Event on June 26/27.
    * Added Clement Escoffier as a new committer.
    * Added Niclas Hedhman as a new committer/PMC member.
    * Continued work on web pages (e.g., new tutorials).
    * Proposed slightly revised community roles/process document that
      takes into account our TLP move and explicitly resolves an issue
      that came up on the private mailing list regarding the nomination
      process for committers/PMC members.

Migration to TLP

    * Verified committer access to new web site.
    * Deleted incubator web site content.
    * Removed incubator disclaimers from SVN and updated SVN artifacts
      to no longer mention the incubator or the old incubator web site
      or mailing lists; the only remaining incubator references are in
      our version numbers, which will be removed when we make our first
      non-incubator release.
    * Still some minor incubator status page clean up remaining.

Software

    * Some good commits in the area of specification compliance (one in
      the area of require-bundle functionality and another fix for a
      long standing issue for dynamic package imports) and in the area
      of performance (by adding package indexing to the framework resolver).
    * Added experimental features to Felix to flesh out some potential
      ideas for next OSGi specification; these features are trying to
      deal with scenarios such as byte code injection in modules.
    * Other various smallish improvement and minor bug fix commits.

Licensing and other issues

    * None.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

Infrastructure:

    * vmgump is in serious disk space trouble by now.  Since we've
      started building Maven2 projects the number of things that get
      built successfully has become large enough to cause problems.
      On some days we can't finish the Gump run because we run out of
      disk.  We need to hope a project with many dependencies fails
      every now and then 8-).

Technical:

    * we've decided to become pragmatic WRT Maven2 and build non-leaf
      projects that use Maven2 against the repository jars instead of
      the latest builds.  This at least allows the upstream
      dependencies of said project to build against the latest code.
      There are ideas how to make Maven2 support complete, but not
      enough time/people to see it implemented.

Other:

    * Stefano left the Gump PMC for personal reasons.  We want to
      thank him for his support and time in the past.

    * still all Apache committers have access to metadata in svn.

    * no releases.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Harmony Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache iBATIS Project

Since our March 2007 report, the Apache iBATIS project has promoted
iBATIS.NET DataMapper 1.61 and DataAccess 1.9.1 to GA. Work continues
on an iBATIS 3.x whiteboard. Key topics for 3.x include test driven
development, Code cleanliness over performance, Simple design over
flexible design, Single binary, No required 3rd party dependencies,
and Better plug-in support. Very recently, new discussions have begun
as to enhancing our support for Ajax/JavaScript. No community issues
to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Apache Incubator Project Monthly Report

The PMC recommends that Wicket is ready to graduate as a top level
project.

Progress has been made on clarifying policy and on improving the guidance
documentation. The main focus has been on the graduation guide.  It has been
good to see the involvement of committers on projects under incubation in
this process. Martijn Dashorst in particular has made important
contributions which was recognized by the PMC though the grant of site
karma.

The major area of process controversy since the last report has been in the
area of election of committers. Clarification of policy in this area is
still ongoing.

The area of ensuring quality reports is still an area of concern and is
awaiting resolution.

In the past, activity levels of mentors has been an area of concern. Day to
day oversight for incubating projects is delegated to mentors so it is
important that mentors are active. The PMC has appointed additional mentors
for NMaven and ODE. Debates about the appropriate process for this should
hopefully lead to a clearer and more efficient process in future. The
question of how the PMC can know when a mentor becomes inactive is still
unresolved.

William A. Rowe, Jr. asked a number of questions at the ApacheConEU2007 BOF
and raised them again on the general list.  More work will be required to
address them.

A solution has been found to the Heraldry problem. Details in the report
below, but the gist is that we've retired the project at the behest of the
community.

----

ODE

Apache ODE is an implementation of the BPEL4WS and WS-BPEL
specifications for web services orchestration. ODE entered incubation in
March 2006.

Beside regular development, the principal improvement in ODE for these 3
past months is our first incubator release. We've been able to come up
with a valid release after several release candidates reviewed by the
ODE committers and got voted by the IPMC. We've also received a very
nice contribution from Kelly Thompson for our website with good looking
graphics.

A steady stream of patches is also coming in (see [1], [2] and [3] for
example) and we have a few leads to bring in more committers (Tammo Van
Lessen and Jim Alateras) after a couple more patch contributions.

We've raised some concerns about the absence of a real PPMC for ODE to
the IPMC, result of the lack of activity of some of our mentors. We'd
been handling all decisions as a community with all active committers
before but our PPMC didn't reflect it. As a result, Niclas Hedhman has
volunteered to become a mentor for ODE, Dims and Paul being both active
mentors and the PPMC is elected now.  Many new PPMC members have now been
voted in, and we're ready to move on.

As a community, once the PPMC issue settles down, we believe we're ready
for graduation.

----

Wicket

Web development framework focusing on pure OO coding, making the
creation of new components very easy. Wicket entered the incubator in
October 2006.

Top two items to resolve
 * Graduate
 * Release Apache Wicket 1.3.0 final

Community aspects:
 * Community is very active and participating on wicket-dev@
 * Community building effort on wicket-user
 * Voted Martijn Dashorst to become Chair after graduation
 * Voted Jean-Baptiste Quenot to become PPMC member
 * Community had a positive graduation vote
 * Had a blast at ApacheCon, integrated, mingled and socialized with the
Apache community

Code aspects:
 * Released Wicket 1.3.0-beta1-incubating
 * Started process for finalizing 1.3.0: feature freeze, plans for release
candidates
 * Development on Wicket 2.0 has been discontinued after a community vote.
   The benefits of this version did not outweigh the burden of maintaining
   2 code bases, and the API breakage would create a rift in the community.
 * Adopted wicket-velocity integration sub project into Wicket.
 * Ate Douma has started major new work to support Wicket-based Portlets,
and is soliciting collaborators.

Licensing:
 * Licensing issues have been resolved
 * Acquired ICLA for component/code contributions for James McLaughlin.
 * Wicket Velocity has been checked out and found to be issue free (license
wise)

Infrastructure:
 * Caught a couple of spammers on the confluence Wiki
 * gmail keeps being a pest for moderation of Wicket's lists

----

River

River is aimed at the development and advancement of the Jini technology
core infrastructure. River entered incubation on Dec 26, 2006, but has
really only *just* gotten going.

The River community is starting some real work. The initial code
submission for the Jini Technology Starter Kit (JTSK) and the ServiceUI
API have been filed at the ASF secretary, voted in and landed in SVN,
the committers account are in place and the PPMC is set up. No more
excuses, now it's time for coding & community!

The discussion is now moving to technical issues and code evolution,
which is a very good sign. There has been a discussion about package
naming, as the code in SVN is under a non org.apache.* namespace: given
the sheer amount of issues with backward compatibility and supporting
existing users, there has been a general consensus on getting our feet
wet with the current code base, integrate a few patches that have been
held off while the code was to be migrated to the ASF infrastructure,
and devise a roadmap ( possibly with assistance from general/pmc@IAO)
for migration to the ASF namespace: this is high priority and
the community realizes how it might be important to have a decision as
soon as possible, even more if River is to publish incubating releases.

----

Tika

Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured
text content from various documents using existing parser libraries.
Tika entered incubation on March 22nd, 2007.

Community

The Tika mailing lists have been relatively quiet lately, probably
because with little code we don't yet have many concrete issues to talk
about.

Development

We saw the first piece of Tika code when Chris A. Mattmann ported the
Nutch metadata framework to Tika. Rida Benjelloun has created a version
of the Lius codebase to be included in Tika, and the code is currently
in the issue tracker.

Issues before graduation

The Tika project is still at an early stage of incubation. We need to
continue bringing in the initial codebases and probably target for an
initial incubating release later this year. We also need to work on
growing the community and figuring out how to best interact with
external parser projects.

----

RCF

RCF is a rich component set for JSF. The SVN, mailing lists are set up.
JIRA needs to be set up. Also three committers, that are part of the RCF
team don't have an Apache account yet. We are waiting for an import of a
current code drop into the repository.

Incubating since: May 2007

iPMC questions / comments:
 * rdonkin - no code drop as yet
 * mvdb - code drop is being worked on, but takes time.


----

Yoko

iPMC Reviewers: jukka, rdonkin, mvdb

The Yoko project is a robust and high performance CORBA server which is
usable from inside any JVM.

Incubating since: 2006-01-31

Since our last report, the majority of the development work in Yoko has
focused on:
 * Adding new type support to the binding runtime.
 * Improving performance of the runtime binding in terms of marshaling
and unmarshaling data.
 * Adding new type support to the IDLToWSDL and WSDLToIDL tools.
 * Fixing minor issues in the ORB core code.
 * Started development of an IDL preprocessor for the tools module.
 * Prepared and completed a Milestone 2 release

Yoko has also become a key component of the soon to ship Geronimo 2.0
release, which has just passed certification tests.

Future plans:

We are currently working to stabilize and finalize type support in the
binding runtime and tools in preparation for a release which would like
to put out shortly.

We are also planning to improving the documentation for Yoko, with the
goal of provide more in depth information to users of the Yoko project
and to assist any future committers in understanding the existing code
and functionality.

-----

Heraldry

The Heraldry podling has been terminated by consensus of the remaining
committers and by vote by the Incubator PMC. Essentially, the community
was never able to reboot after the earlier breakdown. The committers are
currently discussing what code will be forked to RubyForge, Google Code
or other repositories. All in all, the decision to terminate was not
controversial and came from the committers themselves. The mentors and
PMC will finalize the closure of the project resources within the next
month.

-----

TripleSoup

TripleSoup is the simplest thing that you can do to turn your apache web
server into a SPARQL endpoint.

Nothing to report that requires IPMC or board attention at this time.

There has been very little progress on TripleSoup since the last report.
All immediately relevant process/infrastructure/legal stuff has been
taken care of, and now we have to dive into the technical core, which
hasn't happened yet.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Jackrabbit Project

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR, specified in JSR 170).

The Apache Jackrabbit project is in good shape. We have no board-level
issues at this time.

o Releases

  Apache Jackrabbit 1.3 was released in April.

  We are currently working on the 1.3.1 release, and initial planning
  for a 1.4 release later this year and 2.0 next year has begun.

o Community

  Christophe Lombart was added as a committer and PMC member.

  An object-content mapping tool was successfully moved from the
  incubating Graffito project into a Jackrabbit subproject.

  Jackrabbit received lots of attention in ApacheCon EU where we
  had one tutorial and one normal session on Jackrabbit and JCR.
  A Jackrabbit BOF session also took place, although it ended up
  being quite unstructured.

  We have two Google Summer of Code projects in progress this summer.
  Both projects have been relatively quiet so far, but hopefully we'll
  get them up to speed soon.

  Jacco van Weert has announced a nice JCR Controller tool on the user
  mailing list and is interested in bringing it to Jackrabbit through
  the Apache Incubator.

o Development

  Jackrabbit is being actively developed on a number of fronts. Increasing
  numbers of good patches are coming in, and various technical and
  architectural issues are being actively debated on the mailing lists.

  The public draft of the upcoming JCR 2.0 specification will probably
  be soon released by JSR 283. We are planning to use the public draft
  as the main requirements document when implementing the changes and
  new features required to make Jackrabbit 2.0 the reference
  implementation of JSR 283.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Jakarta Project

== June 2007 Jakarta Board Report ==

=== Status ===

Another 2 projects have left Jakarta to live on their own : POI and Turbine
and both of almost (or completely) finished the move. I like to wish the
projects the best and a very good and long lasting future. In a seperate
mail there is a TLP proposal for commons, which on acceptance will mean
that the biggest part of the Jakarta community have no direct ties anymore
with Jakarta. The focus after commons will be on the projects left at
Jakarta and see if there is possibility for them to go TLP or when
that is not viable or possible, find a suitable solution for those projects.
My explicit wish is that there will be no deadline for projects to move so
there will be enough time to find the best solution, instead of the quickest
solution. We owe that to all the people in those projects who invest a lot
of time and energy in those projects.
One of the big discussions that took place was about the future of Jakarta
and the thing we in majority agreed on (at least the people who spoke up)
is that it is worth to "save" the Jakarta brand. Since I prefer to spend
the energy and time I have in the projects that are left at Jakarta, I
decided not to invest time on what will happen to the Jakarta brand at this
time, simply because they deserve my time and energy and out of respect for
the projects that still currently have their existance at Jakarta.
If the board decides to not esablish the commons TLP, we need to go back
to the drawing table.

All in all : a lot is happening and a lot is going to happen in the months
to come. If there is reason to do so, I will provide extra board reports
besides the quarterly schedule.

Reports prefixed with MvdB are written by me.

=== Releases ===

  * 30 March 2007 - !HttpComponents !HttpCore 4.0 alpha 4 released
  * 4 April 2007 - Commons DBCP 1.2.2
  * 8 April 2007 - Commons Configuration 1.4
  * 18 May 2007 - POI 3.0 Final released
  * 6 June 2007 - JCS 1.3 released

=== Community changes ===

New committers, pmc persons, asf members and departures.

  * New Committers
    * Ben Speakmon was voted in as a Commons Committer
    * Alf Hogemark was voted in as a JMeter Committer
    * Asankha C. Perera was voted in as a !HttpComponents Committer
    * M. Johnson (although not new, his account was created just now,
      because of CLA problems). (POI)

  * PMC Members
    * Thomas Vandahl was voted on to the PMC
    * Danny Angus was persuaded to come back on the PMC.
    * Ant Elder was voted on the PMC.

Fixed the bookkeeping on the addition of Nick Burch to the Jakarta PMC (that
was reported in the December 2006 report.

=== Infrastructure news ===

The only things currently happening is the move of infrastructure for the
Turbine and POI TLP projects.

=== General project news ===

The Jakarta PMC has started to review all Jakarta projects whether they
contain or rely on cryptographic software and if they must be marked as
described on http://apache.org/dev/crypto. This is an ongoing process and
we expect some corner cases where we will need legal advice.

=== Subproject news ===


==== BCEL ====

No activity.

==== BSF ====

MvdB : A talk for Apachecon US was accepted (Rony Flatcher), which will
hopefully increase the user base (observation : since the user list is also
pretty quiet it can mean that BSF is bug free or it needs more users)
Community : The release of beta 1 of BSF 3.0 fell was done on 2007-04-16.
This is the version that brings JSR-223 (a.k.a. "Java 6 scripting framework")
to the Apache table: it allows de/employing the Java scripting framework
starting with Java 1.4 (the Sun implementation is only available starting with
Java 1.6/6, foregoing the entire pre-Java-6 installed base). ant has been
trying to get word on receiving the appropriate Sun TCK from Geir, but so far
no news can be reported here....

==== Cactus ====

MvdB:
The ip clearance finally passed, so Petar is now able to (re)integrate
his code into the cactus codebase.

==== Commons ====

A commons TLP resolution was sent to the Board at the same time of this board
report.

31 March 2007 - vote passed to promote the JCI (Java Compiler Interface) to a
proper component (from the Sandbox).

''Chain''
  * Ready for a 1.2 bugfix release.

''CLI''
  * Gearing up for a 1.1 release.

''Configuration''
  * 8 April 2007 - Configuration 1.4 released

''DBCP''
  * 1 April 2007 DBCP 1.2.2 released

''IO''
  * Gearing up for a 1.3.2 bugfix release.

''JCI''
  * Gearing up for a first 1.0 release.

''JXPath''
  * Gearing up for a 1.3 release.

''Logging''
  * Needs someone to do a 1.1.1 bugfix release.

''Math''
  * Gearing up for a 1.2 release.

''SCXML''
 * Working towards a 0.7 release.

==== ECS ====

Nothing happened on the ECS front.

==== HttpComponents ====

Work on the first alpha of !HttpClient 4.0 has made good progress. We expect
to
release client-alpha1 and the matching core-alpha5 shortly.

There is currently no release manager for a potential !HttpClient 3.1 final
release. Since the RC1 was released only in March, this is not an immediate
problem. Bug reports are still dripping in, and bugs keep getting fixed. But
we'll need to find a volunteer eventually.

Various options to spin off !HttpComponents from Jakarta are being discussed.
This could improve the focus of the active members of the !HttpComponents
(sub-)community.


==== JCS ====
JCS 1.3 has been released. Thomas Vandahl acted as the release manager.

==== JMeter ====

Very active (as always) and gained a new committer recently.

==== ORO ====

Mature and therefor no activity needed.

==== POI ====
Released 3.0 Final.

Following a vote and board approved, became a TLP. Please see the POI board
report for more information on the move.

==== Regexp ====

Mature and therefor no activity needed.

==== Slide ====
MvdB (since I am considering myself Slide committer, this report is done
from that "position")
Codebase wise not much happening at this stage. Searching for future options
for Slide outside of Jakarta and one of the options is to merge the Slide
and HttpComponents communities. Setting up a proposal for the community to
discuss and vote on will soon follow. Goal is to not split up the Slide
server and client codebase and have the client build on top of the new
HttpComponents version. We suffer from lack of cycles to spare (meaning the 
committers).

==== Taglibs ====
The possibility of consolidating all of the existing taglibs such that we
end up with three active taglib release units (Standard, RDC, "unstandard"
-- name TBD) was discussed, and there seems agreement (amongst the 5
developers who expressed any opinion) that this is a reasonable way to
proceed.

==== Turbine ====
Turbine is in the process of going Top-Level. Site and mailing lists are
already in place. SVN and other stuff still needs to be moved. For the latest
update on Turbine I refer to the Turbine board report.



-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Labs Project

In a nutshell: very low activity around the Apache Labs and nothing that
concerns board attention.

On the positive side, the diversity of ideas and technologies used in
the labs is much broader than on the foundation in general (ranging from
a OWL reasoner written in Mercury to an XMPP server, from a fast json
serializer to an atom optimizer).

The current number of labs is 14 and growing slowly. You can see the
list and the timeline of labs creation at the labs web site
(http://labs.apache.org)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Lucene Project

TLP

The Lucene top-level project added three new PMC members: Nigel Daley,
Chris Hostetter, Owen O'Malley and Tom White.

LUCENE JAVA

Lucene Java is a search-engine toolkit.  Development was active, and
committers are preparing to release version 2.2.

NUTCH

Nutch is a web-search engine: crawler, indexer and search runtime.
Nutch 0.9 was released on 2007-04-02. Dogacan Güney accepted
invitation to join project as a committer.

HADOOP

Hadoop is a scalable distributed computing platform.  We've reduced
the release rate from monthly to once every two months.  After
extensive testing and bugfixing, the 0.13 release was released in
early June.  Performance and scalability on core benchmarks has
doubled.  One new committer was added this quarter, Jim Kellerman.

SOLR

Solr is a full text search server.  Development was active and a new
release was made, version 1.2, the first since leaving the Incubator.
Ryan McKinley was added as a new committer.

LUCY

Lucy will develop a shared C-based core for ports of Lucene to other
languages, such as Perl, Python and Ruby.  Only minor, sporadic
progress has been made again this quarter.

LUCENE.NET (incubating)

Lucene.Net is a port of Lucene to C# on the .NET platform.  It made a
release through the incubator this quarter, but is still primarily a
one-developer project.

TIKA (incubating)

Tika is a toolkit for detecting and extracting metadata and structured
text content from various documents using existing parser libraries.
Tika entered incubation on March 22nd, 2007.

We saw the first piece of Tika code when Chris A. Mattmann ported the
Nutch metadata framework to Tika. Rida Benjelloun is currently working
on bringing Lius code into Tika but the initial commits on that front
have not yet happened.

Attachment M: Status report for the Apache OFBiz Project

This report, for June 2007, is the first quarterly report (following
the initial 3 monthly reports) for OFBiz (Open For Business) as a top
level project.

The Open For Business Project (Apache OFBiz) is an open source
enterprise automation software project. By enterprise automation we
mean: ERP, CRM, E-Business / E-Commerce, MRP, SCM, CMMS/EAM, and so
on.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Community:

- two new PMC members have been voted in and are now listed in the
  committee-info.txt file: Jacquest Le Roux and Scott Gray; I believe
  we followed all procedure on this, though we never heard anything
  back from the board (which from what was described in the PMC guide
  seems fine, ie there were no objections)

- one PMC member (Si Chen) has resigned, but he is remaining involved
  with the project and is still a committer; the reasons for this are
  not totally clear but it appears to stem from a conflict of interest
  between his involvement in management of OFBiz and his running a
  dual licensed (Honest Public License (HPL, GPL-like non-OSI license)
  and commercial) package called Opentaps that is a derivative work of
  OFBiz; this appears to have been peacefully resolved and while Si
  has not been very vocal about his thoughts on it, the situation
  doesn't seem to be affecting the development or progress of the
  project or development of the community and polite collaboration

- we have discussed aligning the PMC more with those most active in
  the project, mainly because many votes only had participation of the
  3 PMC members; it was discussed a lot but for now we have decided
  not to ask the less active PMC members to make any changes; so far
  the only action taken has been to add the two new PMC members
  mentioned above, both of whom are very active in the project; as
  other committers show more activity we will make other adjustments
  and vote in additional PMC members

- three new committers (Anil Patel, Joe Eckard, and Adrian Crum) have
  been voted in and have SVN commit access, Jira access, and so on
  setup

- we may add more new committers in the near future, but the emphasis
  right now is on helping the new committers get up to speed and
  become more involved

Project:

- a vote for a release branch for OFBiz 4.0 passed on April 23rd and
  the branch was created soon after; the release plan for OFBiz is
  available here: http://docs.ofbiz.org/x/1wE; according to this plan
  it will stabilize for probably another month and then we will create
  the first binary release for the 4.0 branch


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Portals Project

May 18

Pluto 1.1.3 was released.  http://portals.apache.org/pluto/news.html

The quest for a new Chair has ended. We invited all active committers
to the Portals PMC, so that they could take part in the vote for a new
chair. Two candidates were nominated on May 18:

* David Sean Taylor
* Carsten Ziegeler

We agreed to have a secret vote, where all the people in the PMC sent
their vote to Santiago Gala (outgoing chair). Henri Yandell
participated as a "trusted third party" too.

June 6

The vote was officially closed.

June 7

David Sean Taylor was chosen as Chair of the Apache Portals project.

June 15

The Portals Graffito project (still in incubator) was voted to be
"retired"
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-graffito-dev/200706.mbox/browser

The source code will be redistributed to the Apache Jackrabbit project
and possibly Jetspeed-2 project.  Committers of Grafitto were invited
to become committers at the Apache Jackrabbit project.

June 18

Torsten Dettborn was voted in as a committer

Other activities include further interest brewing in WSRP4J. We
believe this project can still make it out of incubator.  Jetspeed
2.1.1 and Bridges 1.0.2 are scheduled for release by the end of June,
a bug fix release but also including new Bridges support for Wicket
and Groovy portlets.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

- SpamAssassin 3.2.0, a new major release, hit www.apache.org/dist at the
  start of May.  hooray!

- SpamAssassin 3.2.1 and 3.1.9 were released last week, in response to the
  discovery of a local-user symlink-attack DoS security issue in a
  little-used feature of "spamd" (CVE-2007-2873). doh.

- we adopted a new PMC policy, whereby virtually all active committers are
  on the PMC, based on their activity level.   This resulted in the
  addition of Doc Schneider, Matt Kettler, and Kevin A. McGrail to the
  PMC.

- We have a couple of Google Summer of Code projects underway:
  'Implementing "Dobly" Noise Reduction for SpamAssassin', by Jianyong
  Dai, and 'The Persistent Database Connection Plugin' by Zhang Shunchang,
  both mentored by Michael Parker.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Tiles Project

Releases
The Tiles community has released Tiles 2.0.4 Beta, moving us one step
closer to a GA-quality release.

Antonio Petrelli drafted a logo for the project and we all liked it
enough to put it up on the site. You can see it on our home page.

Community
Mailing list traffic has seen a slow increase. Many of the PMC are
subscribed to other projects' lists, such as Struts, Shale, and
Velocity, where Tiles questions are asked. We redirect most
Tiles-related questions to our lists. We are seeing more questions
regarding Tiles 2 coming to our own lists now, but traffic is still
pretty slow. It remains to be seen how much adoption this "next
generation" version of Tiles will see. It has been slow so far, but we
feel a lot of that is because the project has been unstable. We have
addressed the stability issue by releasing the beta. The next step is
to integrate the beta into our sister projects like Struts 2 and
Shale. Then we expect to see a higher adoption rate. There has also
been some discussion of providing a migration path for Struts-Tiles
users which may encourage more adoption as well.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

Summary
--------------
The project continues to be active on a number of fronts.  There are
no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Releases
-------------
We cut a number of releases incorporating all our active branches.

Tomcat 5.5.22 was out a couple of months ago, 5.5.23 last month, and
5.5.24 is coming out later this month.

Tomcat 4.1.35 was out a couple of months ago, shortly followed by
4.1.36, both primarily bug fix and security fix releases.

Tomcat 6, the current production branch, had three releases this past
quarter: 6.0.11, 6.0.12, and 6.0.13, which is the latest stable Tomcat
at this time.

Finally, the Tomcat connectors, mainly mod_jk, has a couple of
releases as well: 1.2.22 and 1.2.23.

Security
------------
The Tomcat security site (http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html) has
been getting more love and attention.  It now contains the vast
majority of known issues and fixes for all Tomcat branches.

We've been working closely with security issue reports and the Apache
Security committee on quickly replying to issues, resolving them, and
coordinating public disclosures.

There exist one or two open security issues at the moment.  The fixes
are already in SVN, the issues are not major, and we're working to
coordinate public disclosure with the reporters.

Development
-------------------
We've moved Tomcat 6.0.x into its own SVN branch, continuing work on
new and experimental features in the trunk.  We also have a sandbox
area for really experimental stuff.

Tomcat release artifacts, once approved by a PMC vote, are now
published on the standard / main Maven repositories.

We continue to work with downstream integrators and re-packagers of
Tomcat, such as the Gentoo Linux project, on improving our release
process and artifacts for their consumption.

ApacheCon
-----------------
Tomcat has a nice presence at this past ApacheCon (in Amsterdam), with
a full day of presentations and talks about the project.  There were
presentations from several Tomcat committers as well as other users
and contributors.  From what I understand, the talks were
well-attended and well-received.

Community
-----------------
After last quarter's new committers and PMC members, there were no
changes the committership nor PMC membership this time.  The PMC Chair
is likely to change next month, continuing the voluntary Tomcat
tradition of one year terms.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Web Services Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache XMLBeans Project

Activity on XMLBeans increased in the last months, there was more
traffic on the mailing list and there were more commits than usual in
preparation for a new release. After four release candidates, XMLBeans
v2.3.0 was released on June 1st.

Few of the improvements in this release, for a more complete list of
changes see CHANGES.txt.
* Added options to handle serialization of CDATA sections
* Improved XQuery support by updating support of SaxonB-8.8
* Numerous bug fixes

There were no new committers or PMC changes this last quarter.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache OpenEJB Project

All Incubator Infrastructure has been migrated over to TLP as well as
removal of any miscellaneous Incubator related disclaimers in code and
the website.

The project is excited to have implementation of EJB 3.0 complete and
to see our sister project, Geronimo, announced JavaEE 5 Certification.
Community short term goals are a release of OpenEJB 3.0 along with
regular published snapshots.

Early development discussions are underway on clustering, application
validation as well as general items for code clean up.  List activity
post JavaEE 5 Certification is back up to normal.  We still gain more
contribution interests from new people like Karan Malhi who is
interested in fixing some issues with OpenEJB 3.0 assembly build
process.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache OpenJPA Project

Highlights

In its first month following graduation from the incubator,
OpenJPA has begun work on its first official release, 1.0.0.

Community

Email traffic on the lists continues to grow as more people
discover that the Java EE 5 specification really does allow
pluggable persistence implementations.

Governance

The TLP migration of the svn repository, mail lists, unix 
aliases, and openjpa web site have been completed. The 
incubator web site has been updated to indicate that openjpa
is no longer in incubation.

Release naming policy is being discussed and resolution is 
expected prior to the first release as a TLP.

Michael Dick was added to the OpenJPA PMC.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache POI Project


Releases
--------

We had our first release in quite some time, 3.0 Final, just before the
TLP move was approved. This included several key new features, and was the
first full release to include hslf, our powerpoint library. We are
currently voting on 3.0.1, in which the main changes relate to the TLP
move.

Community
---------

No new committers or PMC members in the period.

We have selected Yegor Kozlov to be the release manager for the 3.1
series, with Nick Burch remaining the release manager for 3.0.x

General
-------

Since the TLP move, there has been slightly more activity on the dev list.
We have also had some interest in developing an outlook .msg component,
but no code had been contributed for this yet.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache Turbine Project

Status
------

The new Turbine TLP is progressing well. The new site has been set up
and the mailing lists and associated archives have been migrated. There
are still a number of tasks outstanding in order to complete the
migration from Jakarta and these are progressing at a steady pace with
the assistance of Infrastructure.

Other than this:
  * The source headers have been updated in all sub-projects likely
    to see a release in the near future.
  * Migration of the build system from Maven 1 to Maven 2 is being
    considered.
  * Issues concerning the possible requirement to register Turbine's
    cryptographic capabilities as per http://apache.org/dev/crypto
    now falls to the new Turbine PMC, we will try and address this
    once the TLP migration is complete.

We have no board-level issues at this time.

Community changes
-----------------

No new committers originating from within the Turbine community
have been voted in in the recent past.

No new PMC members originating from within the Turbine community
have been voted in in the recent past.

Turbine core project
--------------------

No beta or final releases have been made in the recent past however
a fixes and enhancements to the 2.3 branch of the project are
continuing at a steady pace. Planning for a 2.3.3 release is
underway, but will most likely be held off until version 3.3 of
DB Torque is released.

The source headers for the turbine-2 trunk are yet to be updated
(this includes META).

Fulcrum component project
-------------------------

  * the source headers have been updated for the whole Fulcrum
    project.
  * all build issues were fixed (can we name that "build
    wrestling"?!).
  * a up-to-date Fulcrum site was uploaded to
    http://turbine.apache.org/fulcrum/
  * the dependency convergence report looks okayish - need to release
    fulcrum-security and fulcrum-upload to fix it completely.
  * release of fulcrum-yaafi-1.0.5 is currently prepared.

META project
------------

No beta or final releases have been produced in the recent past.

Attachment X: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Status report for the Apache Ant Project


o Current Releases

Core
----
Ant 1.7 was released on December 19, 2006.

There has been some discussion lately, regarding a 1.7.1 release to
address bugs but there are no formal release plans at this stage.

Antlibs
-------
.NET Ant Library 1.0 released November 6, 2006
AntUnit 1.0 released on January 8, 2007

o Development Activities

Development activity continues apace although there were no milestone
achievements to note in the quarter. We have agreed to drop support for
Java 1.2 in Ant 1.7.1 and beyond.

o Community

There was a rash of BugZilla spam and nuisance operations. With the help
of infrastructure and follow-up efforts by committers, the issue has
been resolved. A vote to move to JIRA did not pass for now.

No other issues.
