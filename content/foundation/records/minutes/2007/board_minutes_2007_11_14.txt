 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Jim]

       Over the last month we've managed to set and announce the
       dates for the Members Meeting (Dec. 11 - 13); as with previous
       years it will be held via IRC. In general, PMCs seem to be doing
       well; I'm pretty impressed that PMCs and the chairs were able to
       coordinate their reports as quickly as they did, due to the
       issue with Marvin forgetting to send out the reminders (itself
       due to a missing library from the people.apache.org server
       upgrade). This is a good sign.
       
    B. President [Justin]
    
       Earlier this week, we had a "virtual" infrastructure meeting
       with some participants being here in Atlanta for ApacheCon US.
       Due to time constraints, we had to table some agenda items and
       will reconvene later this week.  A complete report will be
       included in next month's report.  The agenda items were:
       
		- Review of current status
		- Atlassian support
		- JIRA: consolidating and migrating
		- Yahoo! machines
		- Build farms
		- Large-scale project artifact storage
		- Java services (blogs, etc.)
		- maven.org
		- Subversion setup
		- Short/medium-term tasks [TABLED]
		- Acquisition strategy for next 18 months [TABLED]

       Other than these items, we are dealing with the 'normal' outages,
       replacements, and upgrades.  We are also looking into
       retrofitting some of our machines; but we are first examining
       whether we can secure the necessary vendor parts.
       
    C. Treasurer [J Aaron]

       We received 5,000 euros from Lufthansa Airplus for their
       Bronze sponsorship on October 23rd.

       Other contributions over the last month include money from the
       car program, cirque systems from seattle, justgive.org, and one
       personal donor.

       We have one check that I believe was sent to us in error.

       Paypal                         $  3,000.23  ($+   219.82)
       Checking                       $141,839.07  ($+ 2,355.34)
       Savings                        $155,686.01  ($+   282.45)
       Total			      $300,525.31  ($+ 2,857.61)   

       A question came up regarding sponsor invoices.  Aaron took todo.

       Aaron also took an action item to find out the status of the
       secretary's signature/credit-card.

    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Sam]

       Confusion between new secretary and contractor seems to be behind
       us.  We discussed who should have access to the secretary mailing
       list.  Justin took an action item to make it open to all members.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Legal Affairs


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of JCP

Oct/Nov was a very quiet period.  No progress can be reported on the 
TCK issue.

I'm preparing for the upcoming F2F EC meeting in December, in which 
this issue, and the implications about the present and future JCP
will be featured topics of discussion.

The Apache Harmony project asked on legal-internal about what they could
and could not do, in our opinion, with respect to releasing software and 
using licensed TCKs for testing appropriate projects on top of the Apache
Harmony runtime.  The project was advised to release as they chose (as long
as they represented spec completeness factually), and further they could 
use TCKs to test projects on the Harmony runtime.

Additionally, I'm happy to report that the Eclipse Foundation has been elected
to a seat on the JCP EC.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds arriving
at security@apache.org. These continue to be dealt with promptly by the
security team.  For Oct 2007:

5      Support question
1      Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
5      Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
4      Vulnerability report

General News
------------

* Meet the Producer

  Every ASF member is invited to a "Meet the Producer" session to be held
  at ApacheCon US 2007, Tuesday, November 13. The purpose of the session

  ConCom decided to install a blog/planet (Roller) on the ApacheCon
  server. The plan is to aggregrate ApacheCon per-event blogs, and to
  have general ConCom/ApacheCon blog.

* ConCom Web Team

  A Web site sub-committee has been created to rework and revise the
  contents of general (non-event specific) ConCom and ApacheCon Web
  pages on www.apache.org and www.apachecon.com. Initial volunteers are
  J Aaron Farr, Noel Bergmann, and Lars Eilebrecht.

ApacheCon US 2007 News
----------------------

At the time os this report, ApacheCon US 2007 and the Hackathon
are being held in Atlanta. The total number of registrations for
the conference is about 350 (incl. 70 training registrations).


ApacheCon Europe 2008 News
--------------------------

The planning meeting for the conference was held 10-11 November in
Atlanta. ApacheCon Europe 2008 will be again, a 5-day conference with
2 days of trainings (7 tracks) and a 3-day main conference (3 tracks).
In addition to regular presentations it is planned to add a 2- or
3-day Fast Feather Track. Out of about 270 proposals, 68 presentations
and trainings have been selected. Speaker notifications will be sent
by the end of November.


OSSummit Asia 2007 News
-----------------------

The event planned for November 2007 in Hong Kong has been postponed
until 2008. The reason for this was the unacceptable low number of
registrations (less than 30 non-speakers) and the low number of
sponsors. The decision was made on Tuesday by OSSummit LLC
(Charel Moris), November 6, and announced on a planners conference
call.  The sponsors and speakers were notified on November 6 and 7,
and the members of the ASF and Eclipse Foundation on November 8.
Please see the corresponding email posted to the members list for
further information. Charel Morris expects to have a new date by
November 16 (it is planned to move the conference to either late
May or early September).

Two months in a row - there's been no activity on the Audit list.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Public Relations Project


In the last month we have signed a retainer agreement with HALO Worldwide
for PR and Marketing support. They have already jumped in and helped
with a few open issues already, including 2 draft PRs.

The Bronze sponsorship level had previously been changed to add 'nofollow'
to the sponsor's links (Silver and above are not affected). This is just
applicable to any new Bronze sponsors.

LEGAL
- no issues 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Issues needing board attention
------------------------------
None

Changes in the PMC membership
-----------------------------
None

General status
--------------
Progress has been generally slow this quarter. Most devs seem busy with other
stuff.

Most issues on the user mail list are being attended to by various developers.
That list is also quiet.

Issues still to be dealt with by the Forrest PMC
------------------------------------------------
Just the usual continue to develop project guidelines doc.

Progress of the project
-----------------------
Some enhancements to the FOAF plugin.

One committer started a new effort in the whiteboard to package some important
Forrest components as Apache Cocoon "blocks". Perhaps this will also lead to the
important job of getting Forrest's use of Cocoon up-to-date.

No releases since 0.8 on 2007-04-18.

Last quarter we reported discussion commenced with Apache Maven project about a
section of code in the Forrest SVN (codename "forrestdoc") which was rescued
long ago from the defunct Apache Jakarta Alexandria project. It has never been
actually used by Forrest. This is now smoothly handed over to Maven.
Issue FOR-820.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache HiveMind Project


The HiveMind project has remained quite inactive during the past three
months.  Howard removed his name from the HiveMind JIRA issues
assigned to him.  A few new JIRA issues have been entered, but no work
has been done on them, since we really have no active developers.
There has been some interest from Tapestry users in some of the
HiveMind-based libraries (hibernate, acegi, etc.) that I've written in
the past.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

There is very little to report on the Apache HTTP Server Project
for this quarter.  We have no board issues at this time.

The only significant development is that the IETF has chartered the
HTTPbis working group to update RFC 2616 and (perhaps) related specs,
for which Roy has submitted a set of drafts to partition the
specification into eight parts.  The WG will meet Dec 3 and 4 in
Vancouver.

Roy expects there to be more interesting things to report over the
next month, so we will report again next month rather than waste
bits on speculation at this point. 

-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Composer (a component container project), RAT (project analysis for
conformance with licensing and similar requirements) and buildr (a build
tool) have entered Incubation.  STDCXX is proposed for Graduation.

Tuscany did not graduate due to concerns over community diversity.  There
has been continued discussion on general@i.a.o about the need for diversity.
Tuscany is actively focused on building diversity now, with plans to
re-apply for graduation.

A number of projects are failing to build any community (and to report).  An
e-mail has been sent to general@i.a.o to discuss their future.  NMaven
reported late.  Wendy Smoak has volunteered to help Mentor the project.

Perhaps the biggest issue for the Incubator PMC is the long-standing issue
of redundant and not infrequently inaccurate project meta-data.  There are
plans to discuss the issue at ApacheCon, but as is often the case, support
tools receive little interest and effort from the community, whether for the
Incubator, Infrastructure, the Board or the Foundation as a whole.

========================

Abdera

Abdera is an implementation of the Atom feed format and publishing protocol.

 * Release 0.3.0-incubating was released with many new features and fixes.
 * Dan Diephouse joined the project as a committer and has been working on
significant improvements to the Abdera server code
 * Documentation for the project has been greatly improved.
 * There are ongoing performance improvements
 * The project is working towards graduation, with the primary remaining
goal being diversity of committers.

=== Buildr ===

Description - Buildr is a build system for Java applications written in
Ruby.

Date of Entry - Nov. 2007

Buildr is a brand new project (see the proposal at [1]), it's just been
accepted in the Incubator this month. Most of the project infrastructure has
been setup: status page, svn, jira, mailing lists. The code grant has been
submitted (and ack'ed), the buildr community has been notified of the
migration and the code import will probably be done during ApacheCon in
Atlanta.

[1] http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/BuildrProposal

----

JSPWiki

JSPWiki infrastructure has been moved over to Apache: the issue trackers and
the mailing lists are now fully operational.  We've also started the process
of getting ICLAs and Software Grants from all the previous contributors who
still hold copyright over the code.

All committers identified in the original proposal plus the mentors have
commit access and are on the private mailing list.

The dev alias has attracted a couple dozen outside members.

The final LGPL-licensed JSPWiki release is almost ready, after which we will
start moving code into the Apache SVN.  This is to minimize having to
maintain two separate branches, one LGPL and one Apache -licensed.

The questions on how jspwiki.org domain and the jspwiki.org websites should
be transferred to Apache have not yet been discussed.

----

Lokahi

Lokahi is a configuration and management console for Apache httpd, tomcat
and other web server infrastructure.

Incubating since: 2006-01-07

Significant contributions have been made towards finishing the MySQL port
that was begun earlier this year.  A Fast Feather presentation on Lokahi has
been scheduled for Apachecon in Atlanta.


Obstacles to graduation:
   * community - now includes authors outside of the original dev community,
but additional committers are sought. Recent distractions, and the
temperature of discussions taking place across projects on general@i.a.o
reinforced the fact that a larger committer base is needed to graduate.
   * licensing - oracle-only backend is now 95% of the way to an alternate
MySQL backend, and soon to be enhanced with license agnostic interfaces

----

NMaven

NMaven develops plugins and integration for Maven to make building and using
.NET languages a first-class citizen in Maven.

Incubating since: 2006-11-17

Items to resolve before graduation
 * More active committer involvement. This involves getting a group of
developers familiar with the NMaven internals (both .NET and Java), as well
as growing a larger community of developers who are creating Maven plugins
in .NET.
 * Closer interaction with the Maven team.

Status:
 * Movement toward a release. Updating all the license files, changing the
artifact names to include "incubating", etc. This is the highest priority
for the project.
 * There had been some concern among committers that the code was changing
too rapidly making it difficult to attract new committers/patches. We've
slowed the pace of new features and have focused on bug fixes.
 * Mailing list activity has been slow recently, but steady increase of
mailing list subscribers over this period (from 27 to 35).

Plans:
 * Preparing for a release
 * Bringing NMaven in closer line with Maven architecture and behavior.

----

Sanselan

The Sanselan Project is a pure-java image library for reading and writing a
variety of image formats.

The autoexport from confluence to our site has been set up (see
http://incubator.apache.org/sanselan/) so documenation can be added soon.

We are looking for images (with no copyright restrictions) that can be used
for unit testing. Existing (private) unit tests rely on copyrighted images
that cannot be used.

----

Sling

Sling is a framework to develop content centric web applications based on
the idea of modularizing the rendering of HTTP resources.

Sling entered incubation on September 5th, 2007.

Community

   * We had a very active month with adding microsling and based on this
project developping and voting the new Sling API replacing the form
Component API. Currently we are migrating the project sources to the new
API.
   * Sling present at ApacheCon US 07 with a FeatherTalk and a BOF

Software

   * microsling added to Sling as simple entry level framework exhibiting
the mechanisms of Sling. microsling was also used as a proof of concept for
the new Sling API and greatly influenced its evolution.
   * Two contributions of the community added to microsling and Sling:
Freemarker support by Padraic Hannon and Ruby integration by Shawn Anderson.

Issues before graduation

   * Make an incubating Sling release
   * Grow a more diverse community (so far only commits from Day employees)

Licensing and other issues

   * none

=== Tuscany ===

Tuscany simplifies the development, deployment and management of distributed
applications built as compositions of service components. These components
may be implemented with a range of technologies and connected using a
variety of communication protocols. Tuscany implements relevant open
standards including, but not limited to, the SCA and SDO standards defined
by the OASIS OpenCSA member section.

Incubating since: 2005-11-30

Top issues?

    * Is Tuscany diverse enough ?

Community aspects:

    * A proposal was put forward to graduate as a TLP but the IPMC raised
concerns about the level of diversity so the proposal was withdrawn while
these are addressed
          o It should be noted that Tuscany does currently more than meet
the Incubator minimum diversity requirements for graduation
    * Dims stepped down as a mentor, Paul Fremantle and Matthieu Riou took
his place
    * Voted Brady Johnson, Simon Nash, Amita Vadhavkar, Mark Combellack as
new committers
    * Good community involvement - users are answering mailing list
questions, providing patches, and being voted in as committers
          o Over seven hundred posts on the tuscany-user list in the last
three months, up over 300% since a year ago

Releases since last report:

    * Significant milestones were achieved with the 1.0 releases of Java SCA
and SDO which implement the v1.0 of the SCA specifications and v2.1 of the
SDO specification respectively
    * An 0.99 release of Java SCA was also done prior to the 1.0 release
    * Java DAS beta1 and beta2 released

Ongoing work:

    * A Java SCA 1.0.1 maintenance release is currently being voted on
    * A Native SCA, SDO and DAS release is in progress
    * The Java SCA 1.1 release contents are being discussed
    * Links with other Apache projects continue to be forged and lots of
exciting new features are being worked on!

Woden

Woden is a Java class library for reading, validating, manipulating,
creating and writing WSDL documents, initially to support WSDL 2.0 and with
the longer term aim of supporting past, present and future versions of WSDL.

Development towards Woden milestone M8 has progressed slowly over the past
few months. There are a still a few high priority items that must be
completed for M8.

In the past few months Woden has received significant contributions from Dan
Harvey (an IBM summer intern) in the form of many bug fixes and enhancements
including refactoring the Woden build, Sagara Gunathunga who is working on
serialization of Woden models, and most recently Tomi Vanek, who has
contributed his WSDL viewer to Woden (currently attached to a Jira awaiting
review).

Woden has also made excellent progress towards completing the items
necessary for graduation and a vote will likely be called shortly.

----

WSRP4J

No report.  Part of the "Projects in Trouble" e-mail to discuss future
status.

----

XAP

No report.  Part of the "Projects in Trouble" e-mail to discuss future
status.

----

Yoko

The Yoko community has decided that it's probably best to split the project
in two and submit them to be housed as sub-projects of CeltixFire and
Geronimo.  The WS bindings, and the requisite support tools, of Yoko would
move on to CeltixFire with everything else, e.g. ORB and RMI, moving on to
Geronimo.  A committer roll call was performed and a list of developers
still interested with either/both of the two bodies of code.  Proposals will
be submitted to both the CeltixFire and Geronimo PMCs this month.

Attachment G: Status report for the Apache James Project


Highlights

* jSPF 0.9.5 released after the dependency issue was resolved.
* Jochen Wiedmann is a new committer
* No new PMC members
* MarkMail Powered by Apache James!
* I'm resigning as PMC chair

Details

The project is moving slowly, but fast in a relative sense. :)
Progress is being made on IMAP (led by Robert Burrell Donkin) and
refactorings that allow James to optionally start using the Spring
framework (led by Bernd Fondermann).  With progress comes an
opportunity to rebuild trust, and so far so good.

A jSPF release had been held up by a needed change in a dependent
library whose code we couldn't fork.  Stefano Bagnara helped to
convince them to apply this contentious patch, and with that in place,
then we could release jSPF.

You heard the news about what MarkMail is, and Jason Hunter dropped
the project an email to let us know and thank us for Apache James as
it is core to their email processing system.

I announced my intent to resign as PMC chair several weeks back, and
there's been a healthy discussion of who will take over these duties
and what qualities we'd want in that person and that role.  I had
hoped we'd have a resolution ready for this board meeting, but not
quite ready yet.  Should be ready for the December board meeting.

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

No new Apache-Test releases since the last report.


--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

We have not yet released Apache-Reload.


-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be an active and healthy development community - 
bugs are found, bugs are fixed, development moves forward as usual.


-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is, as always, thriving.  nothing noteworthy
has happened since the last report.


-- PMC --

as a recent email required, we have added links to asf foundation,
sponsorship, and thanks to our main page at http://perl.apache.org/

-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache POI Project

Code
----

We've done a lot of bug fixes this quarter, and pleasingly many of the
bug reports are coming through with patches. Most of the new features
relate to Excel formula parsing and text extraction.

Community
---------

No new committers or pmc members this quarter. We have identified a
few possible new committers, and are working with them to improve
their code (mostly in the area of tests) before offering them commit.

Releases
--------

We are aiming to do a beta release in the coming weeks, then release
3.0.2 in late December or early January.

Future
------

There has been some discussions on supporting the new Office Open XML
(ooxml) file format, which was introduced with Office 2007. We believe
our high level code will work just fine, but we'll need to redo all
the record code to support XML as well as OLE2 serialisation, which is
quite a lot of work. In the absence of new developers or sponsorship
of existing ones, this is unlikely to progress much.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Roller Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project

Most of the activity on the mailing lists has been around some bugs in
the libraries and helping people with various applications that use
them.

On the C++ front, version 1.4.0 was released with some bug fixes and
an update to the package building process.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache ServiceMix Project


This report for November is the second report since ServiceMix
graduation.

ServiceMix  resources  have not been completely moved yet.  The web site
has moved to its final location (http://servicemix.apache.org) but the
mailing lists and svn have not been touched.

We have released ServiceMix 3.2 on November 7th. Work is continuing on
ServiceMix 4.0 and we aim for a milestone release before the end of the
year.

A new PMC member has just been voted in.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Tomcat Project

Summary
--------------
The project continues to be active on a number of fronts.  There are
no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Releases
-------------
There was no releases this month.

Security
------------

Development
-------------------
We have voted the new commit policy caused by serious
dispute among two leading Tomcat core developers with
different views on development process and some personal
dislike.
Here is the VOTE synopsis:
   o Existence of release and development branches
     in parallel with each other (dev are odd numbered,
     release are even numbered).
   o Development branches are CTR. If code or patches
     to this branch change the API, advanced warning
     is required even before the commit. It may be
     open to a vote if there is debate. Larger patches,
     as well as far-reaching patches should also be
     community gauged before implemented.
   o Release branches are RTC, with patches obtained
     from the development tree. Thus, backports refer
     to the SVN revision on the development tree which
     adds that feature.
   o Both branches have a STATUS file. For the release
     branch, STATUS is also used to note backport
     proposals.
   o Reviews are *always* appropriate. One can call
     for a formal review of a patch at any time.
   o Voting is via normal ASF rules.
   o Regarding large and/or API changing patches, use of
     a sandbox is recommended to allow for SVN history to
     be maintain, to encourage outside interest and
     involvement ("Hey, I'm working on Foo. Here is the
     SVN url. Come and help or at least follow along").
     This also allows for more complete understanding of
     the impacts before it reaches the dev branch.

The vote was passed with majority of votes from PMC members
including Jim, Yoav, Tim, Remy, Costin, Filip, Mark, Mladen,
Jean-Frederic, Rainer, Peter and Henri and without any -1.

This caused the creation of STATUS files and all significant
patches are now first put for a majority vote and review
inside:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/tc6.0.x/trunk/STATUS?view=markup
and
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/tomcat/current/tc5.5.x/STATUS?view=markup

The Apache Tomcat 6.0.15 release was stopped because of few
minor TCK issues, so the plan is to tag and release 6.0.16 in
the following week.

Mod_jk is on the way for a 1.2.26 release with number of bug
fixes from 1.2.25 release.

Community
-----------------
There were no changes the committership nor PMC membership
this time.

So far for the last couple of moths we are able to continue
the active development with newly adopted commit rules.



-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Turbine Project

Status
======

There has been some progress on the ECCN issue - the fulcrum
components are now in good shape, but some recent changes there need
to be back-ported to turbine core and a release made before we send
the ECCN notification.

We have no board-level issues at this time.

Community changes
=================

No new committers were voted in since the last board report.

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

Turbine core project
====================

No major activity this quarter, but the changes made in the pending
fulcrum-crypto-1.0.6 release need to be back-ported to the components
currently integrated in turbine core (head and maintenance branches).

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

Fulcrum component project
=========================

Work was put into eliminating dependencies with the potential to
complicate tidying up the ECCN compliance.

Releases since the last board report:
* fulcrum-yaafi-1.0.5 was released on 2007-10-03.
* fulcrum-crypto-1.0.6 has been cut and the release vote passed on
2007-11-06 - final deployment is pending.

META project
============

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project


STATUS
Velocity remains a mature product with spurts of developer activity.
Developers and power users remain present on the mailing lists.  The
user list averages 1-2 questions a day from new users, of which almost
all are answered immediately.

We've been struggling a little with Gump issues in the past month.
Commons Lang subtly changed the spec for an API call (
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-363 ) which caused one of
the unit tests in Velocity to fail.  The lack of debuggability of the
gump run led to some very inelegant print statements scattered
throughout the unit test until the specific failure was isolated.
Very old-style coding.  (change a line, wait a day for gump, change a
line, wait a day).  We still have a Texen gump failure, though hoping
to get that straightened out soon.

The Velocity project currently has no board-level issues at this time.

COMMUNITY CHANGES
No new committers were voted in since the last board report. No new
PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

VELOCITY ENGINE
There's been some minor activity improving various syntax issues (i.e.
adding variable arguments) and fixing user-reported bugs.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

VELOCITY TOOLS
Velocity Tools is currently the most active project, with development
focused on the new 2.0 branch.  This is in alpha and moving towards
beta.  We had a brief discussion on the dev lists whether to continue
supporting the 1.x branch (currently on version 1.3), or urge users to
adopt 2.0 when it is released.  The consensus was to release a 1.3.1
version with minor updates and fixes, then retire that branch.
(Seemed the practical direction given the straight-forward upgrade
path from 1.3 to 2 and the interests of our small developer
community).  We hope to release both 2.0-beta1 and 1.3.1 by January.

VELOCITY DOCBOOK
We committed our first user-submitted patch (DBF-1).  Otherwise this
product remains stable.  It appears to be primarily used internally
though there are occasional queries and comments about it on the user
list.

VELOCITY ANAKIA
No development activity this past quarter.

VELOCITY DVSL
No development activity this past quarter.

VELOCITY TEXEN
There was a small amount of activity fixing bugs and adding user-
submitted patches from JIRA.  If enough patches and updates get
submitted we will release a version 1.1 by the next quarter.

Texen currently has an unresolved Gump issue (see above).

Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J

In September we released Xerces-J 2.9.1. This release fixes several
bugs which were present in Xerces-J 2.9.0. It also includes a few
minor enhancements and performance improvements.

Back on August 30th the W3C published a last call working draft of XML
Schema 1.1 Part 1: Structures. Partial support for earlier drafts of
XML Schema 1.1 has been available in Xerces-J for several years though
only recently has the working group made enough progress on the
specification to consider doing a full implementation. We've been
soliciting feedback from the community on which features they're most
interested in seeing in Xerces-J.


Xerces-C

Some good discussion on the mailing list with regards to what the
minimum set of platforms would be acceptable to support with the new
build system before we can release. In addition there has been
interest in updating the online docs to forest. Disucssion is still
underway as to whether this should be for 3.0 or for all previous
releases. Boris is release manager for 3.0. Committers have
volunteered time around the end of December to finish off the 3.0
release and we are hopeful this will happen in January.

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. No development activity.  XML Commons

Several fixes for typographical errors were applied to the JAXP 1.2
and 1.3 Javadocs. The xml-commons-external-1.2.06 (JAXP 1.2) release
is still pending. No other activity to report.



-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache XML Project


General business:
==============

Things are quiet in the XML project, with no issues requiring board
attention. Migration of AxKit->perl PMC and Xindice->DB PMC did not
take place yet.

Xindice
======
Works is going on on next (1.2) release. There are plans to produce
1.2 milestone release in coming weeks. Traffic on user list is low but
all questions are answered.

AxKit
=====
Didn't submit a report. Need to figure out if Matt Sergeant is still
around and, if not, get a new representative.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

General Comments

Jeremias initiated a survey for users of XML Graphics Commons, Batik and
FOP to determine the level of desire to change the minimum required Java
version from 1.3. From the results of that, and discussions between the
developers, it was decided that subsequent project releases from XML
Graphics will require Java 1.4. (Batik's 1.7 release will be the final
one to require Java 1.3.)

XML Graphics Commons

No big changes in the last 3 months. Some work to complete the XMP
metadata functionality is expected for the next reporting period.

Batik

Batik's two Google Summer of Code students finished their projects
successfully, although they did not have as much interaction with the
developer community (such as it is) as much as I would've liked. Ivan
has recently finished ironing out the bugs in his DOM Viewer window
enhancements and will be committed to the repository soon. Jasleen's
project needs a bit more work before it can be committed.

A bunch of bugs were fixed recently, and after fixing a couple more,
committing Ivan's code, and running through the regression test suite
again we'll be ready for the final 1.7 release.

FOP

FOP sees the usual bugfixing. We've been able to process some of the
open patches, but there's still some more to be done in this area. A few
new features have also been added: some improvements on general XSL-FO
compliance, preparations for PDF-in-PDF support, SVGZ support, improved
SVG text painting for PDF output, improvements for PCL and AFP etc. A
number of exciting things are in the works: improved layouting which
should bring down memory consumption, Java2D support for AFP output,
improvements in font handling and tables, a new image package...

We have two new committers: Adrian Cumiskey and Max Berger. 


------------------------------------------------------
End of minutes for the November 14, 2007 board meeting.
