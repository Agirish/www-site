 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       Kudos to the conference organizers for another excellent ApacheCon EU
       in Berlin.

       I had the honor of giving a keynote speech at the first Tencent Tech
       Echo (Techo) conference in Beijing. I also gave a presentation at
       Tsinghua University to an audience consisting mostly of undergraduate
       students. Special thanks to Sally Khudairi for her invaluable help in
       preparing these presentations.

       While in Beijing, I met with several people about how to make Apache
       projects more accessible to Chinese community members, including
       users, contributors, and committers. One result of these meetings is
       continuation of dialog to implement a bot to facilitate communications
       among e.g. mail lists, WeChat groups, Slack, Dingding, and issue
       tracking systems like GitHub and JIRA. The group is currently deciding
       on next steps.

    B. President [Sam]

       Regarding finances, "we are on pace to meet our budget".  This is a
       quite notable change from previous months.  Not a cause for concern,
       but definitely something to watch.

       Highlights from various areas:
       * Brand management is essentially treating direct to TLP projects the
         same as podlings for the purposes of name searches at this point.
       * Fundraising has modified its link policy to include rel="sponsored"
         on all links going forward.
       * Marketing and Publicity helped drive the Petri faq.
       * M&P published the Q1 report for FY2020 https://s.apache.org/a6s40
       * ApacheCon NA 2020 is tentatively the last week in September in New
         Orleans.  Four (and possibly more) roadshows are in various stages
         of planning.
       * Conferences has also assumed responsibility for small event
         planning.
       * A new photos.apachecon.com site is live.
       * New Expected time for a full report on Equity, Diversity, and
         Inclusion analysis is May. Comms plan for D&I committee is on hold
         due to bandwidth to work on it and the survey. Focusing on the
         survey first.

    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Operating Cash on October 31st, 2019 was $1,701K, which is down
       $659.9K from last month’s ending balance (Sept 19) of $2,360.9K. 
       Total Cash as of October 31st, 2019 is $3,124.9K (includes the
       Pineapple, Restricted Donation as well as the Tides Restricted
       Donations) as compared to $3,564.4K on Sept. 30th, 2018, (a decrease
       of $439.5K year over year). The October 2019 ending Operating cash
       balance of $1,701K represents an Operating cash reserve of 7.3 months
       based on the FY20 Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $233.7K/month.  The ASF actual Operating reserve of 7.3 months at the
       end of October 2019 is bit behind the budgeted 7.7 month’s reserve for
       YTD through October 2019.  The estimated YE Operating reserve of 8.1
       months is ahead of the Budgeted YE reserve of 7.6 month.  The ASF
       Operating reserve is above the ASAE standard average of 6 months of
       reserve for Non Profits.



       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is behind budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $322.2K. ACNA19 Sponsorship exceeded the
       budget, however ACNA 19 Registration is below budget.  Public
       Donations are a bit behind as is Foundation sponsorship due to some
       timing of payments ( The open Accounts Receivable is very healthy at
       $945K). As compared to FY19, YTD revenue is behind by $107.8K
       primarily due to timing of some Sponsor payments.



       YTD expenses through October 31st, 2019 are under budget by $79.1K. 
       Most departments are under budget, however due to the finalization of
       the amount owed to Leaseweb Infra is slightly over budget, again a
       timing issue as compared to the budget .  Conferences expenses at this
       point are over budget, as the ANCA19 Hotel bill was paid in October.  
       As noted in last month’s narrative the budgeted loss for ACNA19 is
       $55K and we were estimating it to be in the $110K-$120K loss range. 
       At this point the Loss for ACNA19 stands at $110.5K.  For ACEU19 as
       noted in last month’s narrative, estimated loss could be 107K Euros,
       however as ACEU19 took place in October 2019, it will be a month or
       two before we have a preliminary P&L.



       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$712.9K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$469.7K> NI or $243.2K behind
       Budgeted NI for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of Conference payments, Timing of TAC, Timing
       of the Leaseweb payment as well as timing of Sponsor payments vs the
       FY20 Budget.  The cash forecast has been updated and at this point
       halfway through the Fiscal year, we are on pace to meet our budget.  I
       would ask that all dept heads review the Cash forecast and let us know
       if there is anything that could change in the estimates for the
       remaining six months of FY2020.   With regard to FY19, we are behind
       in revenue, by $107.8K as noted above, but we are also ahead on
       expenses by $691.2K (due to ACNA19 and the Leaseweb payment which
       should have taken place in FY19, but did not); thus, year over year NI
       for FY20 is behind FY19 by $799K.  It is estimated that this will even
       out as the second six months of FY 20 progresses.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In October, we received 64 ICLAs, 5 CCLAs, and 6 software grants.

    E. Executive Vice President [David]

       I attended ACEU and gave the SoTF.

       ACEU was well produced and attended.

       Travel Assistance
       =================

       TAC had a few last minute challenges around payment, but executed
       well. Kudos to Christopher Dutz for leading the TAC efforts in Europe.
       The TAC folks took advantage of being co-located at ACEU and spent
       some time planning for the rest of the Fiscal Year. See the Travel
       Assistance report for more details.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Infrastructure is largely operating normally. Of note, infrastructure
       has re-enabled per-project web statistics and is evaluating a new l10n
       platform.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Convenience Binaries

       Official Apache releases are source code. But we have allowed
       "convenience binaries" to be created and even hosted on Apache
       infrastructure. Further, we have allowed projects to vote on, approve,
       and publish these artifacts as if they were official releases. And
       some of these artifacts are signed by Apache infrastructure tools. And
       some of these artifacts contain Category X components.

       I'd like to revisit the topic of convenience binaries and establish
       some ground rules for PMCs to follow.

       @Myrle: work with Roman to lead discussion on this

                  To summarize, it sounds like some major chunk of code is being
                  developed inside NASA, and then they're going to come back to
                  the community with it. While this doesn't sound ideal to me,
                  it at least explains what the statement in that report meant,
                  all those months ago.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues operating smoothly. We are in the process of renewing
additional sponsors --3 Platinum, 3 Gold, 1 Silver, and 1 Bronze-level
Sponsors. Payment has been received by 1x Platinum, 1x Gold, and 1x Silver.
We look forward to announcing a new Sponsor at the Silver level after
identifying some issues with email (China firewall?) that caused a few weeks'
delay.

We continue working on two new Targeted Sponsorships: one to benefit the
Apache Cordova project, and the other for ASF Infrastructure. The
Infrastructure-supporting sponsor is being onboarded and is working with ASF
Marketing & Publicity on messaging and related communications.

We are beginning to support sponsorship planning for ASF Conferences in 2020,
including Roadshows in North America and Europe, as well as ApacheCon North
America. We are continuing to help Virtual/Accounting on remaining sponsor
payments for 2019 ApacheCons in North America and Europe

Campaign preparations for Individual Giving season, which includes Corporate
Giving, has begun. These will launch in the next few weeks.

We received about $1,185 from individual donors via Hopsie.

We have modified our link policy for the "thanks page". Going forward, all
new Sponsor links will be added with the rel="sponsored" tag. See
http://www.apache.org/foundation/sponsorship.html#Links. Existing links will
be converted upon renewal or opt-in by the Sponsor. Site, policy, form, and
agreement documentation has been updated.

We were delighted to say hello to and thank several of our sponsors in person
at COSCon in Shanghai Nov 2 and 3. Attending the event from the Fundraising
team was Daniel Ruggeri (VP Fundraising) and Ted Liu (Sponsor Ambassador,
COSCon organizer).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — November 2019

I. Budget: we are on budget as planned, with no outstanding payments due at
this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising by securing 15 sponsorship renewals to date (7 Platinum, 5 Gold, 3
Silver), and is working with Virtual/ASF Accounting on settling a small
handful of overdue sponsor payments. She is working with ASF Sponsor
Ambassadors Bob Paulin and Craig Russell (Bronze sponsors) and Ted Liu
(Chinese sponsors) on renewals as well as new candidate sponsors at the Silver
 and Bronze level. In addition, we are onboarding a new Targeted Sponsor. We
 are also preparing Individual Giving & Corporate Contribution campaigns that
 will be launching in the coming weeks. Additional support continues at the
 Foundation/executive-level, along with ASF Conferences, ComDev, Brand
 Management, and Diversity & Inclusion as needed. We published the Q1FY2020
 Foundation Operations Summary (quarterly report) https://s.apache.org/a6s40 ,
 and are working on a Sponsor case study/profile (similar to
 https://s.apache.org/jKNc ) with support from Central Services/Editorial.
 Principal photography on "Trillions and Trillions Served" (the documentary on
 the ASF) resumed during ApacheCon Berlin
 https://blogs.apache.org/press/entry/trillions-and-trillions-served-a ; we
 have wrapped filming and are now entering post-production.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe.

 - 4 November 2019: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® SINGA™ as
   a Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: 6 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 279 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 54 items to 55.3K followers on
Twitter, and posted 23 items on LinkedIn that garnered more than 91.1K organic
impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 1 announcement is in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, “Have You Met?”
highlights, and “Project Perspectives” profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 5 media queries. The ASF received 1,313
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,006. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 2,260 press hits vs. last month's 2,240. ApacheCon received
15 press hits. We had done an exhaustive amount of work with local press in
support of a Board-level keynote and overall ASF presence at a national
developer conference, but the outcome was highly disconnected for myriad
reasons: we are trying to see how it can be salvaged, if at all. This also
impacted another event in the same country, with the same publisher, but with
different Board members, who canceled their media activities as a result.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 1 analyst query. Apache was mentioned in 3
reports by Gartner; 4 reports by Forrester; 2 reports by 451 Research; and 7
reports by IDC. We are also working with a global top 5 FinServ on a research
project.

VIII. Central Services: Kenneth Paskett attended ApacheCon Berlin on behalf of
ASF Marketing & Publicity/Central Services and met with the Open Source Design
community to explore ways we can engage on future Apache-related projects. The
timing is favorable, as a small handful of projects are seeking our assistance
with various creative and UX/site-related projects. We are also finalizing the
list of Central Services/Editorial projects through 2019.

IX. Events liaison: we will be supporting the Apache community with signage,
stickers, and swag for the ASF booths at Devnexus and FOSDEM in February 2020.
Per usual, we are standing by to assist ASF Conferences with planning,
advisory, and oversight for 2020 Roadshows and ApacheCon as needed.

X. Newswire accounts: our pre-paid press release package with GlobeNewswire
expires in 2021, but we will likely need to renew before then.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
We are engaging a third-party to assist us with translations. This
should provide projects with a translation/crowdsource tool for their
translations. We're currently evaluating, with optimism.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Ensure stable backups after several disk failures/swaps.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Finalize a service for our projects' translations needs.
- Move qmail off our archaic fbsd servers to a new Ubuntu/Puppet install.

General Activity
================
- Migrated/upgrade our Subversion service to a new server.
- New features in the ".asf.yaml" service; several provided by Bryan
  Ellis (an infra volunteer).
- Our translation service/VM has been incredibly difficult to upgrade.
  We are testing a new, outsourced service for performing translations.
  Apache OpenOffice is the primary user, so we are working with them
  on testing and evaluation.
- A couple disks failed on our backup server, but thankfully not at
  the same time. Our service provider is *very* fast with disk
  replacements (about 15 minutes), but then it took several days each
  time to "resilver" the RAID array. We are stable now, and will
  monitor the system over the next few weeks. During this process, we
  took a few extra steps at our cloud providers to create snapshots
  and replications "just in case". We'll unwind those additional
  precautions once we see our needed stability in the RAID array.
- Working with a potential service on our CI/CD. A new Jenkins Master
  has been stood up, and testing is progressing.
- Working on moving many qmail/ezmlm configuration files into svn for
  recovery/audit purposes.
- Nearing turn-down of our local Sonar analysis install, after moving
  many projects to the hosted SonarCloud service. Several new projects
  have signed up for the service.
- Implemented a new frontend component of our centralized blocking
  service (blocky) that explains bans to affected users and guides
  them through the unban process, should they request such. We hope
  this new process will lessen the communication load when people find
  themselves blocked on Apache services.
- Improved the infra-provided website statistics[1] available to all
  projects, including adding a human-readable YAML version of the
  various sheets of statistics.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

VP Conferences took about a month "sabbatical" after ApacheCon North America,
which resulted in rather slower response to issues for that period. He is back
on the job now, and activity on the various event-related mailing lists has
picked back up.

ApacheCon Europe was held in Berlin, in October. While it was smaller than its
cousin in Las Vegas, the event itself was great, with truly amazing keynotes,
and a very engaged group of attendees.

At ApacheCon Europe we announced tentative dates for ApacheCon North America
2020, which will (again, tentatively - nothing is signed yet) be held in New
Orleans in the last week of September.

Due to the closeness of ACNA and ACEU in 2019, we intend to skip ACEU in 2020
in order to get back onto a six-month gap between events. However, it is also
being considered to alternate North America and Europe years, in order to have
a broader range of date options. This has not yet been determined, and there
are strong arguments on both sides.

In addition to ApacheCon, we are building out or 2020 calendar of events, and
they are listed on events.apache.org  The list is currently:

* Apache Roadshow Chicago (Proposed) - 2020-05-27 to 2020-05-30
* Apache Roadshow, Seattle - 2020-06-10 to 2020-06-13
* ApacheCon North America, New Orleans - 2020-09-28 to 2020-10-03
* Apache Roadshow China (Proposed) - 2020-10-24 to 2020-10-26

An event has also been proposed in DC in May, but it is unclear at this time
whether this is a Roadshow or something else.

A call for volunteers to manage Small Events was sent to the members list.
Isaac Goldstand has stepped forward to manage that process, but other
volunteers are still welcome to assist in that. We intend for it to be a very
lightweight process. The goal is to encourage small events such as meetups,
focused on Apache technologies. A budget was approved for this for the past
several years, but we have not, to date, spent any of that budget.

A discussion is ongoing on the planners list regarding policy around approving
events that conflict with other Apache official events. This begins with
defining what a conflict is. Member input into that is welcomed on that list
(planners@apachecon.com).

You should expect to see more calls for volunteers around 2020 and 2021 events
in the coming weeks, as we try to be more aggressive about announcing our
event schedule further in advance. This makes sponsor acquisition easier, and
also helps avoid conflicts with other conferences in our ecosystem.

A new photo site has been launched at photos.apachecon.com in order to have
our event photographs all in one place, which we control and back up. This was
largely spurred by the recent changes to the Flickr limits, which resulted in
many of our historic photographs disappearing. If you have photographs from
past events, please contact the planners list for information on how to share
them with the community.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Travel Assistance Report (November 2019)
========================================

ApacheCon EU 2019 Berlin
=====================

TAC had 14 people attend Berlin after a couple of late withdrawals and one
visa denial.

We had a TAC 'Lunch' on the Monday comprising the 14 attendees and some
invited long time ASF folks. As usual, this was received very well by the
attendees and they got a lot out of the lunch.

Right after lunch we had a meeting to go through what is expected of the
attendees for the week and went through what sessions they would be hosting.
Having some of this pre-filled before arrival meant that this went pretty
smoothly.

During the week, the attendees all performed their duties well and the
organisers were happy with the level of assistance given.

Post event surveys are yet to be sent out.

Congrats from the entire TAC Committee go to Chris Dutz as Lead TAC organiser
for this event, for a well prepared and well executed Conference from the TAC
side of things. Hard work from the beginning through to the event itself
ensured a smooth process and a successful ACEU from the TAC standpoint.

TAC Meeting
==========

committer supported / small events
-----------------------------------------------

A few members of the TAC Committee had a face to face meeting in Berlin which
lasted just over 2 hours. Present at the meeting were Gavin McDonald, Daniel
Gruno, Chris Dutz and Nick Burch.

A number of items were discussed, raw notes of which were posted to the main
travel-assistance mailing list. Follow up and further discussions of some of
those have continued on list. Some of these are mentioned below.

TAC has approved funding for committers; and funds for smaller/non ApacheCon
events. We are trialing use of the new committer funding by supporting taking
a group of committers to Fosdem 2020 at the beginning of February. Gavin is
Lead for this event. The application process for this and other
smaller/committer events will be revamped and simpler. Note that at the time
of writing, the approval of Stands/Booths has not been released.

There is a list of other suggested non ApacheCon events to support, the next
one after Fosdem is likely to be Berlin Buzzwords.

Projects should note that TAC has funds to support travel/hotel for project
organised meetups/hackathons. An email to all PMCs will start to be sent
quarterly reminding/informing them of this.

Travel Arrangements
----------------------------

A major topic and one that has been under scrutiny quite recently. Making
Travel arrangements for successful applicants is quite a time consuming
process. Liaising with a Travel Agent by email and by phone (and recently even
in person!), getting many quotes to approve, sending them to the applicant for
approval, then back to the TA. Travel Insurance, Visa support letters, Hotel
room booking dates to be timed with flight arrival/departures etc. This was
hard enough for 10 to 20 people. Now, we also have increased budget to have at
least another 20+ people (per event) on top of that, more than doubling the
work effort.
(In a one year period, our budget could allow us to take around 100 people)

Add into the mix recently for ACNA there was a poor experience with a Travel
Agent, often taking days to  respond, adds pressure.

Therefore, during our TAC Committee meeting , we agreed to ask about the
possibility of getting paid help in this area, a part time contract possibly,
where that person gathers all the information needed and performs all the
booking tasks, from quote, to visas, support letters, to ticketing and
ensuring payment. Keeping the TAC committee in the loop at each stage, but
taking away all that work that volunteers currently do, allowing them to
concentrate on other important aspects. TAC has asked EVP about this and are
awaiting a reply.

Payment Methods
-------------------------

Another important topic discussed was that of payment methods. Payments to
Travel Agents, Hotels etc.

Payments to Travel Agents involve lump sum amounts sent via international wire
transfer, usually needing a final top up via the TAC credit card. Payments to
Hotels for TAC recipients rooms sometimes also require a wire transfer - as
was the case for Berlin. This was not without its own issues either - the
Hotel received the wire transfer into their account on the Monday afternoon,
our TAC attendees arrived the day before, so payment was asked for by Credit
Card monday morning. Therefore the Hotel actually received 2 x payments. They
have refunded the duplicate amount to the event organisers, who are
calculating what we owe them and refunding the rest back to us. A messy
process that might have been avoided if TAC had something like Transferwise -
international payments made instantly and at mid-market rates and small fixed
fee. This would make things much easier in the future. TAC has asked EVP to
inquire about this and are awaiting a reply.

TAC Credit Card
----------------------

The TAC card, in addition to a relatively small maximum allowed balance, also
has a maximum daily withdrawal limit. Although since having a TAC card, which
has been extremely invaluable, there has been instances on occasion where the
daily limit was exceeded and so had to borrow from another staffer until the
next day when it could be paid back. The maximum limit may also soon become an
issue , with an increased budget, comes increased TAC attendees, comes
increased on site expenditures. TAC Chair has a todo to ask the Treasurer for
an increase in both the daily limit and the overall maximum balance.

Committee Membership
==================

TAC is a working Committee, and likes to align its membership with active
members every couple of years. Inactive members are always welcome to re-join
should they find themselves with time to become active again. Inactive members
were notified on list last month. TAC Chair will make the changes known to the
President in the next few days. There are also some additions to the committee
to announce at the same time.

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

October 2019 Report
## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape
  in the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:

Two points that are not really issues, but more resetting expectations:

The feedback and decision making process to launch the survey has pushed the
entire project by 2 months since the holidays get on the way of new
deadlines. New Expected time for a full report on EDI analysis is May.

Comms plan for D&I committee is on hold due to bandwidth to work on it and
the survey. Focusing on the survey first.


## Activity:

*** Project:  Survey revamp***

We're in the final review for V1.0 for the survey (see final deck here [1]
There is a vote to finalize best way to send survey [2], current plans are:

1. Use LimeSurvey as the platform for the EDI Survey and share visibly a link
   to their data privacy policy.
2. Upload a list of all apache.org email addresses to LimeSurvey and send
   direct emails to individuals
3. Use a re-usable token for a universal link that we'll use to promote the
   survey in social media

I re-opened the vote and intent to close it on Friday, will assume lazy
consensus.

*** Project: UX Research on new contributors ***

Nothing has happened yet since this part is pending some initial results from
the survey. As soon as we get the survey published, we'll start working on
the questions for the interviews.



*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***

We are working on the migration of previous meeting notes to Confluence to
create a report that includes all action items, to make the process more
transparent.

The contributions period started on Oct. 1t and ended on Nov. 5th. Two
projects out of three got contributions recorded. 5 contributions recorded in
total. [3]

We encounter some problem while attracting applicants to record
contributions. We think that there could be two reasons for this: the skill
level required in the project is too high, the wording of the project is a
bit intimidating due to the technical language or unclear goals and/or high
system requirements. In order to address this issue, we took the following
action:

setup cheat sheet + more guided or explained tasks. Include this sheet in the
project submission to guide applicants in their initial contributions. we've
seen sometimes there is no time to address all queries/questions from
applicants, therefore we could include this sheet to help them guide
themselves. We opened a conversation to create a "Tooling training for ASF
projects" [4].

we need a more easy-to-start development environment. regarding applicants
with less experience. In this case, it is hard to find a solution other than
committing enough mentor time, which is hard to find. We opened a discussion.

The period for the selection of interns start on Nov. 6th and ended on Nov.
14th. After rating contributions, one intern has been selected. [5] Friction
log: we started working with the coordinators of the friction log of the
Survey Design & Contributor Experience Research project. First draft of the
friction log template has been shared on the mailing list dev@ [6].


*** Operations ***

First payment to Bitergia was approved on the 15th. This payment is for
Milestone 1, total amount $30,000 out of the total $75,000 for the project.



*** Community Highlights ***

New contributors have been collaborating in the EDI projects: Laura Zanella
Arianne Navarro


## Health report:

Mailing list continues to be active with regular emails from the working
groups. A few new members have joined and participated. Some people have been
sharing interesting articles and started good discussions.



## Committee members changes:

None

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're dow 2 to 20, unresolved
issues this month.

Sadly, there has been no progress with Eclipse foundation mainly because lack
of time on our end with key volunteers (Roman and Mark Struberg) we will try
to do better next month.

Two noteworthy discussions are around LEGAL-488 and LEGAL-489 where we are
trying to figure out how to help NetBeans community in particular (and anyone
in business of build end-to-end end-user facing project at ASF be able to
ship their binaries based on modularization framework available in modern
JREs).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Materne]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Ant is the creation and maintenance of the Ant build 
system and related software components. 
It consists of 3 main projects:
 - Ant - core and libraries (AntLibs)
 - Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
 - IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
Additionally Ant provides several extensions to Ant (antlibs).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Ant was founded 2002-11-18 (17 years ago)
There are currently 29 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.

## Community Health:
For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done. But
basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development.

For IvyDE we lack the knowledge of building Eclipse plugins on actual Eclipse
versions. We hope to get the build running again so we could update that.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:
BookKeeper is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage
service optimized for append-only workloads. It has been used as
a fundamental service to build high available and replicated services
in companies like Twitter, Yahoo and Salesforce. It is also the log
segment store for Apache DistributedLog and message store for Apache Pulsar.

Apache DistributedLog is a high-level API and service layer for
Apache BookKeeper, providing easier access to the BookKeeper
primitives. It is a subproject of Apache BookKeeper.

to get this organised.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
- We have released 1.5.8 in July. We haven't had any activity since.
   
## Health report: 
 - We still have a small PMC presence of 3 active members still able
to vote releases.

## Releases:    
 - Last release was 1.5.8 on July 14th 2019


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
No issues to report at this time. 

## Membership Data:
Apache Cassandra was founded 2010-02-17 (10 years ago)
There are currently 54 committers and 33 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Chris Lohfink was added to the PMC on 2019-10-01
- No new committers this quarter. 

## Project Activity:
This quarter has been active. We have had a very successful ApacheCon with 2
well attended tracks over three days. Of the vendors there, five of them had
Cassandra product offerings while two were focused exclusively on Cassandra.
We have already begun talking a similar sized effort for ApacheCon NA 2020.

We have begun migrating our site off of SVN as that has been a barrier to
entry in accepting documentation patches in a timely manner.

We have released two alphas of the upcoming 4.0 and received helpful feedback
and bug reports from the community. All other active versions were released as
well. A list of releases follows:

- 2.2.15 was released on 2019-10-29.
- 3.0.19 was released on 2019-10-29.
- 3.11.5 was released on 2019-10-29.
- 4.0-alpha2 was released on 2019-10-29.
- 2.2.15 was released on 2019-10-29.

## Community Health:
Interesting statistics from community health:
- dev@cassandra.apache.org had a 163% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (329 emails compared to 125)
- 44 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (69% increase)
- 20 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (53% increase)
- 124 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-21% decrease)
- 52 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-40% decrease)

We think this reduction of new and closed issues in JIRA in conjunction with
the rate of PRs addressed is indicative of the community efforts focused on
the alpha releases of 4.0. Dev list traffic is up as a result of some good
discussions regarding development processes (soon to be published), releases
and documentation.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

## Description:
The mission of Community Development is to help, support and create resources
for people to become involved with Apache projects

## Issues:
- No issues require board attention at the moment

## Membership Data:
Apache Community Development was founded 2009-11-01 (10 years ago)
There are currently 33 committers and 31 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:8.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Christofer Dutz on 2019-06-21.
- No new committers. Last addition was Christofer Dutz on 2019-06-21.

## Project Activity:

Redbubble 
Projects have continued to request setup for the Redbubble store and
we now have nearly 50 different logos available. Some training has been done
so that we have additional administrators to help setup new logos when
requested.

ApacheCon 
In preparation for both ApacheCon NA and ApacheCon EU we asked
projects to let us know if they wanted stickers ordered for the event. We
especially let incubating projects know they too could be included. In total
approx 50,000 stickers were ordered and the Apache booth at booth was
completely covered. Feedback from attendees was extremely positive and for
some projects this was the first time that they had their stickers available

New Reporter Tool 
One of the tools provided for projects to use, is a reporter
tool for preparing their quarterly reports to the ASF Board. This tool has
been updated and now includes a new interface, additional community statistics
and is integrated into the Board agenda itself.The new version was trialled
and has now been adopted.

Apache Local Community 
One of the discussions this quarter was around setting
up local groups of Apache and open source contributors that would be
responsible for organising meetings and events.A new organisational structure
has been proposed  and it is still unclear if these will form part the general
ASF initiative around Apache Small events, or if it will be managed as part of
ComDev.Two events (24th August & 28th September) have already been held, both
in Indore, India

Events 
Members from the community participated in events such as All Things
Open, where we had a booth and CCOSS 19 in Guadalajara, Mexico. There was an
Apache track with talks ranging from Getting Started to Governance and Open
Source Licences. This was a great opportunity to connect with potential new
contributors to open source. We have applied for a booth at FOSDEM and are
awaiting the result. We are still receiving requests to participate at events
and have recently offered a booth at Devnexus in Atlanta in March 2020.

## Community Health:
Mailing list traffic has decreased significantly this quarter. This could be
as a result of the holiday season and also that both ApacheCon NA and
ApacheCon EU took place this during this period.

dev@community.apache.org had a 46% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
(292 emails compared to 531):

  a detailed explanation)

## Community Health:
In the past quarter we’ve been in chugging-along mode mostly on all
official channels. The unofficial CouchDB Slack instance is seeing a continuous
uptick in activity, which might explain the decrease in user@ traffic.

A lot of work is happening in PRs as opposed to merges to master at the 
moment, which explains the relative shift in numbers there.

dev@couchdb.apache.org had a 2% decrease in traffic in the past
quarter (153 emails compared to 156)
user@couchdb.apache.org had a 75% decrease in traffic in the past
quarter (36 emails compared to 140)
318 commits in the past quarter (-19% decrease)
32 code contributors in the past quarter (28% increase)
147 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (59% increase)
135 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (62% increase)
113 issues opened on GitHub, past quarter (43% increase)
70 issues closed on GitHub, past quarter (79% increase)

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.


Status
------ 

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk
of the project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing
lack of progress.

If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.


Community
--------- 

This month we are proposing to rotate the PMC chair from Brian Fox
to Phil Ottlinger. See associated agenda item.

In July, Sebb stepped down from the PMC In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise
was elected to join the PMC




Releases
--------

Apache Rat 0.13 was released Nov 5th, 2018 Apache Rat 0.12 was released in
June 2016 Apache Rat 0.11 was released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was
released in September, 2013

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Rainer Döbele]

## Description:
The mission of Empire-db is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Relational Data Persistence

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Empire-db was founded 2012-01-24 (8 years ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:10.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jan Glaubitz on 2016-07-10.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jan Glaubitz on 2015-10-05.

## Project Activity:
During the past three months considerable work has been done on the project:
17 issues have been opened in JIRA. 51 commits have been performed by 3
contributors. As soon as the issues have all been resolved and features are
complete a new release will be published.

## Community Health:
Attracting new committers has not been easy and remains difficult. This may be
due to serveral reasons like e.g. relational database access is a rather old
subject that is not the most trendy among young developers. Also there is not
a lot of change in the underlying relational database systems either. However
we acknowledge that especially our website needs more attention and updates.
This will probably be done with or after the upcoming release.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Dionysios Logothetis on 2018-04-22.
- No new committers. Last addition was Dionysios Logothetis on 2018-04-23.

## Project Activity:
- Mechanism for maintaining counters depends on the underlying resource
  management (e.g. Hadoop, Yarn). Made a change that allows the use of
  counters independently from the resource management system.
- Made the thrift client configurable. This ensures users with different
  requirements with respect to the thrift services can plug their own client
  (e.g. the may require security-related configuration).
- Currently working on upgrading the Netty dependency. This is a core
  dependency that hasn't been updated for many years. It requires a lot of
  experimentation to ensure there are no regressions. This will be committed
  in the next couple of months.

## Community Health:
- Even though it did not come from new contributors, due to the development of
  the features mentioned above, there was increased activity this last
  quarter.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Hama Project  [Chia-Hung Lin]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP
standards.

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") was launched in 1995 and it has been the most
popular web server on the Internet since April 1996. It is celebrating its
25th birthday as a project in February 2020.

## Issues:
There are currently no issues for the board.

## Membership Data:
Apache HTTP Server was founded 1995-02-27 (25 years ago) There are currently
122 committers and 53 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio
is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Stefan Sperling on 2019-01-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Sebb on 2018-07-14.

## Project Activity:
- There were no new releases since the last report. Last release was 2.4.41 on
  2019-08-14.

- Discussions have kicked off about the next httpd (2.6 or 3.0)[1], and while
  still not at the end of the discussion (which is of course going to take
  time), there is traction towards getting this done, with most of the current
  discussions hovering around the more technical aspects of how to create the
  split/fork from trunk.

- Another hot topic is integration testing on docker and/or travis[2], with
  Luca Toscano and Joe Orton generally being on point for this and handling it
  well, with the usual hiccups that happen when you try new approaches. A
  proof-of-concept build is already working[0], and I am confident we'll get
  this further set up and running smoothly within the month.

- The discussion surrounding migrating from subversion to git seems to have
  stalled a bit[3]. That is not in itself a bad thing, rather I see it as
  indicative that the inherent benefits are not viewed by the larger populace
  of the PMC as a must, but rather something that comes second to the larger
  discussion about the next version of httpd. Priorities :)

- A sizeable httpd crowd was present at both ApacheCon North America and
  ApacheCon Europe, giving presentations and participating in press events.

- Other topics of heavy interest this quarter were, among others: SSL/TLS
  protocol inheritance and defaults[4] (based on users@ inquiries[5]), HTTP/3
  specs and adoption thoughts[6], as well as subjects on race conditions in
  cleanups and maintainer mode builds.

(with httpd chiefly written in C, I thought I'd start the footnotes at index 0)

[0] https://travis-ci.org/apache/httpd
[1] https://s.apache.org/hyn24 : Time for httpd 2.6.x?
[2] https://s.apache.org/jinvq : Integration tests on docker
[3] https://s.apache.org/vivhy : Migrate to git?
[4] https://s.apache.org/gykrv : Opt in(/out?) for TLS protocol per vhost
[5] https://s.apache.org/bpioq : [..]possible to have in Apache 2.4[..]
[6] https://s.apache.org/jdgt3 : [..]Google Chrome, and Firefox Add HTTP/3[..]

## Community Health:
While the commit rate has dropped slightly this quarter, owing to a very busy
end of the previous quarter, the development process has actually picked up
steam, with a significant (+120%) increase in traffic to the dev list. As laid
out in the above paragraph, much of the discussion and work has been done
around improving continuous integration and unit testing, as well as the
2.6/3.0 discussions and standards and defaults going forward.

Our users list has also seen a significant (+30%) increase in traffic, which
is a nice thing to see. Questions and suggestions from our user-base are
actively being turned into improvements in our software.

There is ample oversight on the PMC (I counted at least 12 PMC members
actively participating in discussions this past quarter) and a good, diverse
distribution of active developers in both the code and documentation
department (in fact, a lot of documentation work has been done in the past
quarter, rocketing docs commits up by 420%). We saw a slightly increase (+2)
in the diversity of committers actively pushing code/docs this quarter.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache HttpComponents Project  [Asankha Chamath Perera]

## Description:
The mission of HttpComponents is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to Java toolset of low level HTTP components

## Issues:
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  - There is a steady stream of small contributions in the projects in the form 
    of pull requests at Github but so far there is no one meriting a 
    consideration for project committership.

## Membership Data:
Apache HttpComponents was founded 2007-11-14 (12 years ago)
There are currently 19 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Ryan Schmitt was added to the PMC on 2019-08-28
- No new committers. Last addition was Ryan Schmitt on 2018-11-13.

## Project Activity:
 We are preparing to release GA version 5.0 of our core and client component 
 libraries which would mark a formal completion of a 4 year long development 
 cycle. We are about start a discussion about directions and the scope of 
 future development efforts. 
## Community Health:
- The project remains low-profile but overall healthy.
- We are seeing more and more project related questions posted to StackOverflow
  rater than our user list. 
- There is a decrease in the number of emails on the dev and users lists
  as well as some drop in the number of PRs. We expect the overall activity to 
  pick up once 5.0 GA versions have been released.

There are currently 48 committers and 29 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ilya Kasnacheev on 2019-08-05.
- Maxim Muzafarov was added as committer on 2019-08-27

The community nominated Dmitry Pavlov as the next Ignite PMC Chair and waits 
for the board approval.

## Project Activity:
- 2.7.5 was released on 2019-06-04
- 2.8 is in development and should be released in the next few months. This
  release incorporates a lot of improvements that were added to the project
  thoughout the last year.

## Community Health:
Both user and dev communities are active with a constant traffic increase and 
bigger interest in the technology. Several new contributors joined the community
and experienced community members have been mentoring them to help with 
contributions.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Impala Project  [Jim Apple]

## Description:
Apache Impala is a high-performance distributed SQL engine.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Impala was founded 2017-11-14 (2 years ago)
There are currently 50 committers and 32 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - No new PMC members. Last addition was Fredy Wijaya on 2019-07-27.
 - No new committers. Last addition was Laszlo Gaal on 2019-06-19.

## Project Activity:
Notable activity in the last quarter includes:

 - Version 3.3.0 was released on August 22
 - A number of correctness and functional-parity fixes for
   transactional tables and their tests. Transactional tables are
   relatively new in Impala
 - A number of minor improvements to the webui
 - Improves memory estimation for clusters with dedicated coordinators
   (i.e. nodes that are not acting as executors)
 - Continued support for the new catalog version in the pre-merge
   tests
 - A JSON formatting of the query profile. For years, the query
   profile has been unstable, in that the developers reserved the
   right to change it or its formatting at any time. This is a first
   step in the direction of stability, which could increase usability
   and allow tooling built on top of the profile to be more reliable.
 - Support for .DEFLATE text data files in tables
 - By default, limits SQL statements to 16 million characters or fewer
 - A variety of improvements to compatibility with other Apache
   projects, including Knox, Tez, Derby, Kudu, Ranger, and Hive
 - The publication of CVE-2019-10084
 - Support for cookie-based authentication
 - Numerous improvements to the end-stages of query lifespans,
   including some enhancements in resource deallocation
 - A large number of commits about spooling, which had zero presence
   in the commit log before July of 2019
 - Some support for ZORDER
 - The addition of DATE support for Avro files; the removal of DATE
   support for the year 0
 - Support for distributable impala-shell. It can be installed
   from pypi

## Community Health:
While the number of commits labeled a "fix" has held steady over the
last three quarters at 58, 54, and 59, this last quarter the number of
non-"fix" commits dropped to 196 from 252 and 247 the previous
quarters. Impala has not had this few commits (of any flavor) in an
August-September-October timeframe before (although the repository
contains an anomaly in which almost all pre-2014 commits landed in a
single moment in January 2014).

Overall activity is a mixed bag, but mostly down, with a decrease in
email traffic, JIRA activity, and number of distinct patch authors, in
addition to the commit number mentioned above. Furthermore, there is
usually a lull in activity during our November-December-January
reporting quarter due to US holidays.

While this is a slowdown, development activity is still high in the
context of open-source projects, with dozens of patch authors and
activity on hundreds of JIRAs.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for November 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here: 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/November2019

There are presently 48 podlings incubating. In October, podlings executed 
13 distinct releases. We added one new IPMC members and no IPMC members 
retired. There were 5 IP clearances. There were some discussions about the 
IP clearance process.

We have two new podlings this month Apisix and TubeMQ. StreamPipes will 
soon to be added. Other project Sparklyr was discussed but decided not to 
enter incubation due to a large number of GPL licensed dependencies it had. 
SINGA graduated last month. The Amaterasu project was retired after the 
PPMC failed to respond to queries about its status. Edgent also retired. 
Omid and Tephra have decided to "graduate" and become sub-projects of the 
Phoenix project. A couple of podlings are heading towards graduation in the 
next few months.

BatchEE has now failed to report twice in a row. Looking at the low 
activity in the project, it may be time to considering retirement.
It seem there was an attempt to transfer the project to Geronimo but
It's unknown if that was completed. All other projects reported.

Graduation of Weex was discussed but was withdrawn after the project 
realised it needed to do some more work around branding and community 
growth.

Further ongoing work was done on cleaning up the incubator web site, but 
there are still a number of pages that need to be reviewed and updated.

Podlings have continued to use the new disclaimer policy, and this has 
reduced the friction in making releases. Extra votes from the wider IPMC 
community are needed to get the 3 +1 votes, with not all mentors voting on 
releases.

A new straight to top level project has been proposed called Petri as 
another way of educating external projects and the Apache Way with the 
option of them bypassing the Incubator and going straight to being a top 
level project. It's still under consideration by the board. A FAQ is being 
worked on, but it currently unknown what impact this might have on the 
Incubator in the short or long term.

At ApacheCon Europe there was a Podling's Shark Tank, a talk on incubating 
process and talks involving several incubating projects.

The podling reporting groups have been rearranged so that there is an 
evener distribution of projects reporting each month.

A couple of mentors were added and removed from projects.

## Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and
humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Release initial versions (should happen this week!)
  2. Increase activity from current committers and community.
  3. Demonstrate good governance through voting and learning the Incubator 
  process (some more).

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community activity was quiet. However, code is underway for a first 
  release to be ready in the coming week(s) which we hope will increase
  interest and activity.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code for a first release is hoped to be available in the coming days with 
  more community members participating in review and critique. 
  Additionally, work in the W3C's ARIA (accessibility) Working Group and on
  various browser vendor repositories has highlighted new annotation related
  activity and opportunity for this project. Sadly, we've mostly failed at
  raising awareness on the list, so the communities "radar" looks quieter
  than it should...

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: Please provide the dates that you last voted in committers
  and PPMC members even ion this hasn't happen in the last reporting period.
  The project has been 3 years in incubator why has it taken so long to
  made a release? Can we expect faster progress in the future?

--------------------
## APISIX

APISIX is a cloud-native microservices API gateway, delivering the ultimate 
performance, security, open source and scalable platform for all your APIs 
and microservices.

APISIX is based on Nginx and etcd. Compared with traditional API gateways, 
APISIX has dynamic routing and plug-in hot loading, which is especially 
suitable for API management under micro-service system.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating

  1. Make an Apache release
  2. More committers and PPMC members
  3. Branding issues in the documentation, code, website, etc.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Learning Apache way and its value behind rules, working in Apache way.
  - Our Apache website is constructed.
  - We have 12 committers and 35 contributors (including 12 committers) 
  contributing to Apache APISIX.
  - Over 13 company users have announced that they are using APISIX and 
  more than 50% of them also submitted code or fixed the documentation for 
  APISIX : https://github.com/apache/incubator-apisix/issues/487

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has been quite health, with ~50 pull requests being merged in 
  October. These pull requests are authored by a diverse set of 
  contributors(~30 authors last month).

  Some highlights of recent developments:
  - APISIX support etcd V3.
  - Supported cluster limit-req and limit-conn.

  We are planning to have a 0.9.0 release in November.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences.
Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream
and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to
computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than
traditional, exact methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Finish the transfer and bring-up of our website to 
     github.com/apache/...  This is now in process.
  2. __Team Interactions:__ We want to have our exchanges on the ASF 
     Slack DataSketches-dev channel posted to our dev@datasketches.a.o 
     list on a daily basis for improved visibility and searchability. 
     We have an open INFRA ticket on this issue. 
     We are searching for a solution to provide more open access to 
     our video conference sessions when we have them. We are in the
     process of moving more of our interactions into the slack 
     DS-dev channel and dev@ list. This is a culture change for us 
     and will take some getting used to. We clearly want open 
     access to our team discussions.
  3. We would like to see a few more folks 
     join our contributors list.  We have several folks that
     have come forward and offered help because they are interested
     in the project.  This is great.  It is our hope that they will
     grow into active contributors.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  * We have added 1 new Mentor, Dave Fisher (thank you!) to our project
    and we have been approached by another Apache member 
    who would also like to be a mentor, and eventually a contributor 
    as well. This is very positive!  

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  * We have now managed 7 releases,  6 Java releases and 1 C++ release.
    We have one more C++ release pending.  These are across 6 different
    components of the DataSketches library.  With the last pending C++
    release, all of the code components targeted for release will 
    be complete.

--------------------
## Doris

Doris is a MPP-based interactive SQL data warehousing for reporting and
analysis.

Doris has been incubating since 2018-07-18.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Continue to build our community. It is glad to see that more 
  developers joined us and became contributors. But we still need more 
  leading developers to join the community who can participate in the 
  discussion of Doris' road map, not just start-up members. 
  2. Improve the documents and website as well. Currently, most of 
  documents are in Chinese and most of English docs are translated by 
  machine. We are working on it.
  3. The discussion on dev mail list is still very few. Most of discussion 
  and decisions are still make in private or in GitHub issues. We should 
  improve the utilization of mailing lists and discuss more public.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Now we have 58 contributors, 1 more committers, and 1 committer became 
  PPMC member.
  2. 3 more other companies are cooperating with us on developing Doris and 
  try to make Doris as part of their data infrastructure.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. We released one new version: 0.11.0.
  2. And the website (http://doris.incubator.apache.org) is built with more 
  docs, both in Chinese and English version.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: It would seem you could solve the first issue listed in
  the three issues before graduation, by working on the other 2 issues 
  listed?

--------------------
## ECharts

ECharts is a charting and data visualization library written in JavaScript.

ECharts has been incubating since 2018-01-18.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Solve CDN issue and redirect echarts.baidu.com to echarts.apache.org.
  2. Vote for more PPMC and bring diversity to it.
  3. Check tutorials and other documents to make sure users can find what 
  they need, and the information is up-to-date. Keep the content of Chinese
  version and English version to be the same.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  We are still working on the Website speed problem before we can transfer 
  it to Apache server.
  We are trying the CDN as suggested by Dave and York Shen. It may take 
  several days before we can get conclusion. If this works, we will ask the
  infra for help with this CDN, if not, we should find other solutions.
  Currently, we put a banner stating "Apache ECharts is an effort 
  undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored
  by the Apache Incubator.We are working on redirecting this Website to
  https://echarts.apache.org. You may visit our new official Website now.". 
  Hopefully, this can help with the branding before we do the redirection.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. We got more contributors from the community. Last month alone, there 
  are more than 10 non-committer contributors whose pull requests were merged
  in incubator-echarts project or doc project.
  2. The mailing list has been much more active these months. We are 
  publicly discussing issues,monthly release plans, future plans and so on.
  And more people asked for help and have their problem solved from the
  mailing list.
  3. We are using social medias like YouTube, Twitter and Medium to help 
  promote our project internationally and grow the community.
  4. We used labels to state the difficulty of fixing to make it easier for 
  contributors to find bugs that are supposed to be fixed by beginners. 

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have released 2 versions since the last report and we are working on 
  the vote of the third one these days. We have formed a monthly release 
  procedure and made the process public.

  We made an automatic visual test framework, so that the testing job can 
  be made more easily and more bugs can be found during pull request or
  testing stage before release.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## MesaTEE

MesaTEE is the next-gen solution to enable general computing service for 
security-critical scenarios. It will allow even the most sensitive data to 
be securely processed to enable offshore businesses without leakage.

MesaTEE has been incubating since 2019-08-19.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Finish the initial setup for MesaTEE and its sub-repos.
  2. Choose a suitable name for MesaTEE and rename the repos.
  3. Make the access control mechanism and RPC framework more scalable and 
  ergonomic.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Regarding to the CI system, we do have some problem with migrating the
  webhooks. Currently the CI system is managed using drone, an open-sourced
  CI infrastructure. It requires R+W access to the Github organization to
  set up the webhooks. However, the INFRA team does not grant W access to
  3rd party infrastructure. Should we migrate to Github Action, or try to
  get a way to keep using drone? We started a discussion in dev mailing 
  list, but the answer from mentor differs from the answer from INFRA team.

  The bootstrapping process seems slow due to the above problem. If we
  cannot find a way to properly set up the CI system, we cannot merge any
  codes after the repo transfer completed. To this end, we are doing our
  best on fitting into Github Action.

  Lack of communication in dev mailing list. We, the PPMC members, realized
  that we cannot only talk offline. So we are starting to use the dev
  mailing list for discussion and issue tracking, and we received lots of
  comments and feedbacks from mentors. Next time I think we will do better
  on the collaboration and be more interactive with the lovely mentors.

  Since Baidu does not donate the brand name "MesaTEE" to ASF, we need a
  new brand name. To solve this, PODLINGNAMESEARCH issue 169 is initiated
  one month ago. And recently the discussion on new name seems come to an
  conclusion in dev mailing list. The next step is to do the rename as
  discussed.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Now we have 12 contributors for MesaTEE main repo, and 16 contributors 
  for MesaTEE-SGX. Since the first day of incubation, MesaTEE merged 3 PRs
  from the community, and MesaTEE-SGX merged 7 PRs from the community.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the MesaTEE project joined incubator, we improved its build system, 
  SDK, CLI, and fit it to the latest Intel SGX SDK v2.6. MesaTEE-SGX and 
  its ecosystem has been periodically updated so as to eliminate 
  bugs/vulnerabilities from 3rd party libraries.

  We just finished repo transfer for MesaTEE-SGX, and we are still working 
  on repo transfer for MesaTEE main repo.

  It is worth mention that the comprehensive tests of MesaTEE and 
  MesaTEE-SGX helped finding bugs in their dependencies, and we managed to fix
  them in upstream libraries. One case is the "official" numeric library family
  of Rust ecosystem: rust-num. It's build script did not work well with 
  MesaTEE's build system and we filed [num-traits issue 
  139](https://github.com/rust-num/num-traits/issues/139). Then we fixed in 
  [PR 140](https://github.com/rust-num/num-traits/pull/140). More fixes in 
  this family are pending to merge. Another case is in the official Intel 
  SGX SDK. MesaTEE-SGX's CI reported failure after migrating to Intel SGX SDK 
  v2.7 release. We created [linux-sgx issue 
  457](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/issues/457) and Intel resolved it 
  a week later in [PR 461](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/pull/461).

  Luciano helped us a lot. He helped with catching up the schedule and the 
  SGA. We learned a lot from him and started managing MesaTEE in Apache's 
  style.

  Zhijie Shen helped us a lot with the initial setup, such as signing the 
  iCLA, account creation, mailing lists.

  Justin Mclean helped us a lot on this report. We received a lot of
  feedbacks from him and we updated this report according to these
  comments. These comments are really helpful and make us realize how to
  work in the Apache way. Thanks Justin!

  We appreciate the help from the mentor group. Mentors are really 
  professional and helpful!

## PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to
help make the web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce
latency and bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Produce first release
  2. Grow the number of active developers
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  We need more IPMC votes on a proposed release candidate which has passed our
  own PMC review.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  User-activity is healthy as always. Developer activity is still limited
  to the original contributor group, plus recently a new committer (lofesa@).

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  - There is a release staged in review with some good fixes & features.
  - Work on modernizing the project's build system has progressed well.
  - Also, there is a PoC for running PageSpeed via Envoy, which opens a great 
  path towards materializing a 2.0 version.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Dave Fisher - I see the start of a VOTE for a committer on private@
  There has been no response from other PPMC members. That is disappointing.
  This could be because most of the PPMC members are not subscribed to
  private@. This includes one of the Mentors who signed off on the report.
  
  Justin Mclean: The items listed under community development seem more
  about project development. How has the community developed?
  I'd also like to see answer to all questions, it make it hard to
  judge process and for us to help if information is not supplied.

     Daewon, Do Yung and
     Hwansung - over lunch, chatting informally face-to-face for the first time 
     about how to grow our community. There has not been much project / 
     community activity for last 1 year, but they were passionate to stay in the 
     community and started reorganizing their work/time, trying to improve 
     developer's experience and accessibility, considering to support Java 
     Client or even Spring Boot for new people, by which they believe they can 
     help grow the community. There's no specific decision made yet but we 
     agreed to continue discussion in the mailinglist. It was great for me as a 
     mentor too to understand each other. See [1] for detail.

        Does the community plan to do another release? It's been nearly a
        year since the last. With a "slow, but steady stream of issues and
        PRs" I suspect that some of those contributors would like to get a
        released version with their contributions. For this community, it
        may be a good idea to consider time-based releases to ensure that
        contributors get to use their contributions in an official release.

- No new committers. Last addition was Rafael Weingärtner on 2017-12-09.

## Project Activity:

We had another very quiet quarter, with the dev list almost entirely silent.

There were only a handful of commits, once again all coming from one person.
It is hoped that we are able to make connections at CHAOSSCon which will
parlay into more active developers.

## Community Health:

Daniel Gruno presented on Kibble at the recent ApacheCon North America in 
Las Vegas. https://www.apachecon.com/acna19/s/#/scheduledEvent/1099

Kibble hopes to participate in the upcoming CHAOSSCon at FOSDEM, on Friday,
January 31st in Brussels.

Sharan Foga reports that the Gnome Foundation is interested in using Kibble to
generate statistics on their projects.

The ASF Board Report Wizard, which is powered by Kibble, has seen an uptick in 
usage over the past quarter.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

## Description:
The mission of Knox is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Simplify and normalize the deployment and implementation of secure Hadoop 
clusters

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Knox was founded 2014-02-18 (6 years ago)
There are currently 21 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Kevin Risden on 2018-04-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Kevin Risden on 2018-04-03.
- We have an active VOTE for a new committer and PMC member now which
 we expect to pass.

## Project Activity:
- Planning for the Apache Knox 1.4.0 release has begun and
continues with the approach of using KIPs to communicate larger
design and feature changes and goals.
- We plan to concentrate on the client library and shell for 
interacting with remote Knox instances/Hadoop clusters and 
Cloudera Manager based service discovery.
- 1.3.0 was released on 2019-07-23.
- 1.2.0 was released on 2018-12-18.

## Community Health:
There does seem to be an uptick in use of Apache Knox in Hadoop
and other big data deployments across the industry. We have
received contributions from new contributors with varying sizes
and level of impact. Pull requests are a relatively new mechanism 
for the Knox community which explains the large increase over 
previous quarters.

The large increase in email traffic on the dev list is likely a
result of additional traffic from github PR activity and commits.

- dev@knox.apache.org had a 72% increase in traffic in the 
past quarter (2117 emails compared to 1229)
- user@knox.apache.org had a 125% increase in traffic in the
 past quarter (36 emails compared to 16)
- 135 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (8% increase)
- 141 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (22% increase)
- 147 commits in the past quarter (24% increase)
- 22 code contributors in the past quarter (22% increase)
- 62 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (44% increase)
- 61 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (52% increase)

## Project Activity:
3.0.0-beta was released on 2019-10-24.
2.6.4 was released on 2019-10-12.
3.0.0-alpha2 was released on 2019-07-30.

Apache Kylin Meetup @OLX, Berlin, Germany; 7:00PM - 8:30PM, Thursday, 2019-10-24
Apache Kylin Meetup @Shenzhen, China; 12:30PM - 17:00PM, Saturday, 2019-09-07


## Community Health:
The discussions in mailing list has a small drop (10%) compared with previous
quarter. One reason we think is that the stable branch 2.6.x has less change
and the v2.6.4 release is more stable than before, so less problem and issue
be reported. The 3.0 release is in beta now, most of the users haven't
upgraded to it yet.

dev@kylin.apache.org had a 10% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (303
emails compared to 333) 113 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-11%
decrease)
129 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (48% increase)
209 commits in the past quarter (-16% decrease)
39 code contributors in the past quarter (-4% decrease)

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Matt Sicker]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Logging Services project is to create and maintain of 
software for managing the logging of application behavior, and for related 
software components.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Logging Services was founded 2003-12-16 (16 years ago)
There are currently 35 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carter Kozak on 2018-07-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Andrei Ivanov on 2019-04-18.

## Project Activity:
- No new releases since the last report (Log4j 2.12.1 in August).
- Ongoing discussions and experiments on plugin system overhauls
  continues with inspiration from projects like OpenWebBeans and
  Guice.
- Work done to update our CI configurations is ongoing, though we
  seem to have stabilized our Jenkins builds for now. Travis builds
  are still questionable due to our use of multiple versions of the
  JDK during build time.
- A new feature in JDK 14 involving NVMe storage looks promising to
  improve our memory-mapped log file appenders to allow for maximum
  performance in persisting log data.

## Community Health:
We had a bit of a traffic decrease since last quarter.
However, there has been some new interest in the log4php, log4net, and
log4cxx components which is promising.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.14 release on October
3, 2019.  The next major release is due on December 31, 2019.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Cihad Guzel as committer on 8/16/2019. We nominated
and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did not sign up
any new PMC members this quarter.  We continue to be on the lookout for new
PMC members and committers.

This quarter saw the development of a replacement connector for the
discontinued OpenText LiveLink LAPI connector originally developed before
ManifoldCF became an Apache project.  This development included much effort by
committers old and new who had access to a more modern LiveLink installation. 
Despite significant frustrations, we were able to finally succeed, but it did
take many months, and we had communications and skill-set difficulties of all
kinds in the process.  Other connectors that will be requiring this level of
work in the near future include the SharePoint connector.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been fairly active this quarter.  Requests for
connector development continue to be significant.

I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

## Description:
Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data. Apache Marmotta was founded
in December 2012, and has graduated from the Incubator in November 2013.

## Issues:
There are no major issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
A very quiet quarter again, no recent activities to report on.

## Health report:
The project was considered feature-complete since 3.3.0 and has recently
published version 3.4.0. Currently there are no active development activities.

## PMC changes:
- Currently 11 PMC members.
- Last PMC addition was Mark A. Matienzo on Thu Aug 18 2016

## Committer base changes:
- Currently 13 committers.
- Xavier Sumba was added as a committer on Mon Mar 27 2017

## Releases:
- Last release was 3.4.0 on Tue Jun 12 2018

## Mailing list activity:
- users@marmotta.apache.org:
 - 2 emails sent to list (24 in previous report)
- dev@marmotta.apache.org:

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache MetaModel Project  [Kasper Sørensen]

## Description:
Providing a common interface for discovery, exploration of metadata and
querying of different types of data sources.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache MetaModel was founded 2014-11-19 (5 years ago)
There are currently 13 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Arjan Seijkens was added to the PMC on 2019-08-29
- No new committers. Last addition was Jörg Unbehauen on 2018-05-03.

## Project Activity:
MetaModel 5.3.1 was released on 2019-09-13.

A fairly big change/PR (#229) was just recently merged, upgrading to newer
versions of ElasticSearch. This will break some existing behaviour due
to upstream changes in ElasticSearch itself.

Another sizeable change/PR (#230) is pending more review and agreement. It
attempts to autodetect data types in our MS Excel module.

## Community Health:
The MetaModel 5.3.1 release was the first release in a long time done by a
new release engineer: Arjan Seijkens. This was a good exercise to go through
to ensure that someone else than myself could perform the release.

Other than that, most if not all communication recently has been about specific
changes/PRs.

- No new committers. Last addition was Andras Salamon on 2019-02-14.

## Project Activity:
- 5.2.0 release is on it's way, rc0 has been build already by Andras Salamon
who is the Release Manager. 
- Development is slow, but steady with minor bug fixes and security-related
library upgrades

## Community Health:
Community activity is down, but we do see new contributors from time to time.
The community is prioritizing patches from new contributors in reviews and
commits.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Huikyo Lee]

## Description:
The mission of Open Climate Workbench is the creation and maintenance of 
software related to Climate model evaluation

## Issues:
The PMC needs to have a conversation on whether retirement is the best 
next move. Project activity is extremely low and mailing list activity is
the same.

## Membership Data:
Apache Open Climate Workbench was founded 2014-02-18 (6 years ago)
There are currently 30 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ibrahim Jarif on 2016-04-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Christopher Douglas on 2016-04-26.

## Project Activity:
Extremely low. Contributions are not being reviewed or closed out
and the project is therefore not doing a good job at attracting
new quality contributors.

## Community Health:
The community could be said to be unhealthy. It is time to discuss
possible retirement of OCW.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
The mission of OpenJPA is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
OpenJPA: Object Relational Mapping for Java

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenJPA was founded 2007-05-16 (13 years ago)
There are currently 35 committers and 19 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Maxim Solodovnik on 2019-04-13.
- No new committers. Last addition was Matt Pavlovich on 2019-05-22.

## Project Activity:
Project activity was really low the last month. I hope we'll get this up
again and continue working on improving JPA-2.2 compatibility. Otoh there
are enough people still active to not worry about activity IF something
very urgent pops up.

## Community Health:
Yes, we should somehow attract more people. But the codebase is old and stable.
And due to the JavaEE/JakartaEE pause right now there is not much action 
in sight which might attract new developers.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache OpenWhisk Project  [Dave Grove]

## Description:
The mission of Apache OpenWhisk is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a platform for building serverless applications with functions

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

In feedback from last month's board report, DF asked us to verify that "the
Redis included in Composer is still an acceptable Open Source Software
license." OpenWhisk Composer depends/uses only Redis Core which continues to
be made available under a BSD 3-Clause license.  The apigateway component of
OpenWhisk also uses the same Redis Core functionality.

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenWhisk was founded 2019-07-16 (4 months ago)
There are currently 42 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Rob Allen on 2019-07-16.
- Justin Halsall was added as committer on 2019-08-22

## Project Activity:
Recent releases: openwhisk-runtime-go-1.14.0 was released on 2019-10-10.

With the merging of the last of the "playground ui" PRs on November 1, we
should finally be feature-complete for the standalone configuration of
OpenWhisk. We are now working towards making a source release containing this
feature. We hope to get this release out before the end of 2019.

## Community Health:

Community health is good with plenty of activity on dev list and slack.

Statistically, the decline in all metrics vs. the previous quarter is mainly
due to the compare against the one-time surge of activity associated with
graduating from the incubator.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe Chiasson]

--- mod_perl --

mod_perl 2.0.11 was released on October 5th 2019

This release contains multiple bugfixes and one notable security fix for
CVE-2011-2767

Many thanks to Steve Hay for pushing this release through.

-- Activity --

The activity levels went up a little, seeing many of the PMC members
contribute feedback and test results on the 2.0.11 RCs

Distros were quick at picking it up, as usual.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, as usual.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers.

No new changes to the committer base since last report.

Last Commiter addition was Jan Kaluza in April 2013

-- PMC --

Currently 11 PMC members.

No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Last PMC addition was Steve Hay on Wed Feb 29 2012

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Phoenix Project  [Josh Elser]

## Description:
The mission of Phoenix is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
High performance relational database layer over Apache HBase for low latency 
applications

## Issues:
No issues for the board at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Phoenix was founded 2014-05-20 (5 years ago)
There are currently 44 committers and 31 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Chinmay Kulkarni was added to the PMC on 2019-09-09
- No new committers. Last addition was Kadir Ozdemir on 2019-05-30.

## Project Activity:
Business as usual for the community overall.

We continue to have active development on the 4.x and 5.x release lines. There
was an rc0 for a 4.15.0 release which is the next-up release to be had. The
5.x line still needs an owner to step up and drive a release cadence.

There was a suggestion that the Omid and Tephra podlings graduate into
sub-projects of the Apache Phoenix PMC. This suggestion was made as both Omid
and Tephra have integration into Phoenix and provide some direct, end-user
value. Both podlings were struggling to retain active podling memberships.
The Phoenix community voted in favor of this graduation for both podlings, and
all podling members who request it will be made Apache Phoenix committers.

At this point, the 72hr lazy-consensus/notice on general@incubator to perform
this double-podling subproject graduation has passed. VP-Phoenix and podling
mentors need to sync and make a plan to start combining these resources.

## Community Health:
Developer (dev/issues) mailing list traffic is down slightly, but user mailing
list traffic is actually up over the past quarter. We continue to see an up-tick
in the use of Github pull requests over patches on Jira (which may be related
to the change in dev/issues traffic volume). As a project, continuing to ensure
that Github-based code contributions are being integrated is ever more
important.

In general, we continue to see the same developers participating, with a 
reasonable number of new contributors to keep the committer pipeline active.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Project Activity:
 - We released version 4.1.1 after a security issue was reported to us, this
   release also includs a bunch of other changes, new image handling
   functionality for PowerPoint files and fixes for a regression for memory
   usage of XSSF.

   Testing of JDK 13 was finished and some pre-testing of JDK 14 done as well.

## Health report:
 - There are some ongoing discussions with users about features/behavior which
   indicates that the popularity of Apache POI is still high. Questions via
   email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   Activity from committers was again low, most developers seem to be tied up
   with other stuff right now, we would like to broaden the developer base but
   not many potential committers show up on the mailing lists which has
   historically been our main source of recruitment.

   We sent out one invitation to join as Comitter/PMC and the applicant
   accepted, onboarding is still in-progress.

   Bug-numbers unfortunately increase steadily, some bug influx and some could
   be fixed, but overall the rate of creation is higher than resolving, also
   due to some invalid bugs being entered which need to be analyzed/triaged as
   well.

### XMLBeans
 - Nearly no changes for XMLBeans this quarter, the project is in maintenance
   mode, some discussion about updating required Java to JDK 8, but no changes
   made in that regard yet.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode.

## Membership Data:

Apache POI was founded 2007-05-16 (12 years ago) There are currently 38
committers and 31 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is

 - We've decided to do a minor release this quarter to update the project's
   dependencies.
 - Work continues in the elastic broadcast pull request (600+ comments/fixes).
   There was a delay in this effort due to the principal committer's paternity
   leave; We will resume that work after publishing a minor release of REEF.

   while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at least), to allow
   proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 -  Minimal activity at present, initial work on the modular build structure
    has commenced.  The current monolithic build is complex, with it's own
    build tool classdepandjar, it adds complexity for new developers. In
    recent months I have had work committments that have limited my ability to
    integrate the modular build.  The other committers are waiting for the
    modular build and I have done a lot of work on this locally, this work has
    been a significant undertaking integrating the works of Dennis Reedy, Dan
    Rollo and myself.  This is also a mature codebase, having been in
    development since the late 1990's.

- The monolithic code has been svn moved into modules into an initial maven
  build structure, next step is to move junit tests to each module.

Release roadmap:

River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&   binary release) River 3.2 - Input
validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling& safe ServiceRegistrar 
lookup service.River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - River is a mature codebase with existing deployments, it was primarily
   designed for dynamic discovery of services on private networks.  IPv4 NAT
   limitations historically prevented the use of River on public networks,
   however the use of IPv6 on public networks removes these limitations.  Web
   services evolved with the publish subscribe model of todays internet, River
   has the potential to dynamically discover services on IPv6 networks, peer
   to peer, blurring current destinctions between client and server, it has
   the potential to address many of the security issues currently experienced
   with IoT and avoid any dependency on the proprietary cloud for "things".

- Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required
     prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and Gadget
     attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports IPv4
     multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so authentication can
     occur prior to downloading service proxy's, this addresses a long
     standing security issue with service lookup while significantly improving
     performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal of
     support for insecure cyphers.
   * Secure TLS SocketFactory's for RMI Registry, uses the currently logged in
     Subject for authentication. The RMI Registry still plays a minor role in
     service activation, this allows those who still use the Registry to
     secure it.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses classdepandjar, a
     bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
   * Updating the Jini specifications.

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Santuario was founded 2006-06-27 (13 years ago)
There are currently 17 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:4.

Community changes, past quarter:

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Branko Čibej]

Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Branko Čibej]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library
   built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the
   default client library of Apache Subversion, Apache OpenOffice and
   mod_pagespeed.

## Issues:
   Activity on the project seems to have come to a halt in the last year.

## Activity:
   There has been no move towards getting Serf 1.4.0 released in the last
   twelve months. A release candidate for internal testing was produced,
   but never released. The last Serf release is now 3+ years old.

   The only active user of Serf seems to be Apache Subversion.
   Apache OpenOffice uses a version of Serf that was released before
   Serf became a Apache TLP.

## Health report:
   The last commit in the public repository was made on 11th June, being
   a minor fix to the build scripts. The commit previous to that was
   made in November 2018.

   The feeling amongst PMC members is that Serf is a mature product
   and thus a low level of activity is expected.

## PMC & Committer changes:
   Currently 13 PMC members and 13 committers.

   - No new committers added in the last 3 months.
   - Last new committer added in April 2017 (Evgeny Kotkov).
   - Last new PMC member added in September 2018 (Branko Čibej).

## Releases:
   Apache Serf 1.3.9 was released on Thu Sep 01 2016

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   The last message on the dev@ mailing list is six months old.
   It's a follow-up from a discussion with a user on IRC who had
   trouble building our sources.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:
Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library
for developing geospatial applications. SIS enables better
representation of spatial objects for searching, archiving,
or other relevant spatial needs. The base of the SIS library
is modeled according international standards published jointly
by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO).

## Issues:
No issue to report this month. Previous reports mentioned the very
long delay since last release, but SIS 1.0 has finally been released.

## Membership Data:
Apache SIS was founded 2012-09-19 (7 years ago).
There are currently 22 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johann Sorel on 2017-09-07.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexís Manin on 2019-07-05.

## Project Activity:
Apache SIS 1.0 has been released last September, about 2 years after the
previous release. This long delay was due to the effort required for
integrating a large user contribution (upgrade metadata XML schema to the
latest ISO 19115 standard), followed by compatibility issues with Java 9+
that we had time to resolve only recently. SIS is now compatible with latest
Java release and there is no reason to delay SIS 1.1 as much as SIS 1.0 has
been.

Current development work includes more spatial filters, a query language
(CQL) for applying those filters, and the beginning of a JavaFX application
for those who have JavaFX pre-installed (we do not redistribute it).
The JavaFX work started as a Google Summer of Code 2018 project but required
cleanup, which we have been able to do only now. We hope that a graphical
user application would help to demonstrate SIS capabilities.

Other developments in separated branches are GeoJSON support and
improvements in the use of vector data stored in a spatial database
(e.g. PostGIS, but not limited to).

Number of downloads from Maven central repository fluctuates between 100,000
and 200,000 per month (20,000 ~ 25,000 unique IPs), but I suspect that a lot
of them are side-effects of Apache Tika downloads (through dependency)
rather than users seeking specifically for SIS.

## Community Health:
The number of active contributors is 3, with Johann and Alexis activity on
SIS increasing. Those 3 contributors are from the same company; we do not
yet have a diversity at this level. The busiest topic in September has been
fixes and stabilization before SIS 1.0 release.

The traffics on mailing lists fluctuate a lot (with both increases and
decreases), but this is hardly significant because of the low amount of
emails (between 10 and 35). We have not observed a significant evolution
of this situation for many years, except during Google Summer of Code.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- We made the first preview release for Spark 3.0 on November 6th. This
  release aims to get early feedback on the new APIs and functionality
  targeting Spark 3.0 but does not provide API or stability guarantees. We
  encourage community members to try this release and leave feedback on JIRA.
  More info about what's new and how to report feedback is available at
  https://spark.apache.org/news/spark-3.0.0-preview.html.

- We published Spark 2.4.4. and 2.3.4 as maintenance releases to fix bugs in
  the 2.4 and 2.3 branches.

- We added one new PMC members and six committers to the project in August and
  September, covering data sources, streaming, SQL, ML and other components of
  the project.

Trademarks:

- Nothing new to report since August.

Latest releases:

- Spark 3.0.0-preview was released on Nov 6th, 2019.
- Spark 2.3.4 was released on Sept 9th, 2019.
- Spark 2.4.4 was released on Sept 1st, 2019.

Committers and PMC:

- The latest PMC member was added on Sept 4th, 2019 (Dongjoon Hyun).

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

The Apache Subversion® version control system exists to be universally
recognized and adopted as an open-source, centralized version control solution
characterized by its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the
simplicity of its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of
a wide variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The Subversion development community is fairly quiet these days. A
  small trickle of development is ongoing. The community usually
  responds to bug reports and is willing to help the reporter or any
  other volunteer to develop a fix. However, in many cases there is no
  such volunteer, and those bug reports are filed but often remain
  unresolved. 

  Our user support forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers
  regularly.

  We have added two PMC members since the last report: Nathan Hartman
  (hartmannathan@) and Yasuhito Futatsuki (futatuki@).

* Releases

  Subversion 1.13.0-rc1 and 1.13.0 have been released.  Subversion 1.12.x
  reaches end of life.

  Subversion 1.10 and Subversion 1.9 are still supported.

  Discussions about the frequency of minor releases have taken place on dev@.
  The community is still evaluating the cost and benefits of the time-based
  release schedule which was introduced in 2018.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache SystemML Project  [Jon Deron Eriksson]

## Description:
SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at
flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid
runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to distributed
computations such as Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

## Issues:
There were no commits to the project this quarter. Activity on the project has
largely stopped.

## Membership Data:
Apache SystemML was founded 2017-05-16 (2 years ago)
There are currently 26 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Arvind Surve on 2017-05-16.
- No new committers. Last addition was Guobao Li on 2018-08-28.

## Project Activity:
There has been only 1 commit since May.
No pull requests have been opened or closed since May.
The most recent release was 1.2.0 on Aug 24, 2018.

## Community Health:
The community is unhealthy.
There is little email activity.
Adding significant features to the project in the future will be difficult
without support from existing contributors with a deep knowledge of SystemML,
and these contributors do not appear to be active anymore.

## Answers to Board Questions:

myrle: Thank you for answering my question. Are there any plans to
       add new committers or make the existing committers PMC
       members? It might help with project activity levels and with
       working through your hanging pull requests

Currently there are no plans to add new committers since there is so little
activity on the project. There are only 2 commits from people who are
not already committers in the last year. WRT PMC members, 23 of the 26
committers are already PMC members, and there is no activity in the last year
from 2 of the 3 committers who are not PMC members, and only 3 commits from
the other committer, so my feeling is that making existing committers PMC
members probably would not help jumpstart project activity.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Health

Both the dev@ and user@ mailing lists have seen increased traffic over the
last quarter, with messages numbers up 20% and 100% on the two lists
respectively compared with the previous quarter. The project tends to see
increased activity over the Christmas period with new users and contributors
trying the project out for the first time over the holidays.

## Activity

The community released TomEE 8.0.0 in September, after 3 milestoned
releases. The TomEE 8 branch targets compliance with Jakarta EE 8.  Although
compliance has not yet been achieved with the Web MicroProfile it is deemed
production ready. TomEE 8 runs on both Java SE 8 and Java SE 11.

Work continues to achieve full Jakarta EE 8 Web Profile compliance.

The community is about to release 7.1.2 and 7.0.7 maintenance releases which
provide dependency updates and bug fixes.

The dependency updates mitigate CVE issues in upstream components, including
Jackson-Databind, Commons-Beanutils and Mojarra:

  CVE-2019-17091 (XSS in Mojarra)
  CVE-2019-13990 (XXE in Quartz) 
  CVE-2019-10086 (ability for an attacker to access the classloader 
    via the class property in commons-beanutils)

Additionally, these will include fixes from commons-daemon for JVM crashes
with X86 JVMs on certain X64 Windows servers, and fixes for transaction
handling with JMS2.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Traffic Control Project  [David Neuman]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Traffic Control is the creation and maintenance of 
software related to building, monitoring, configuring, and provisioning large 
scale content delivery networks (CDN)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Traffic Control was founded 2018-05-15 (a year and a half ago)
There are currently 24 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Derek Gelinas on 2019-03-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Brennan Fieck on 2019-07-26.

## Project Activity:
Took part in ApacheCon NA as part of the Content Delivery Track.  This was a
great experience for our community and something we look forward to doing
again.

Release Apache Traffic Control 3.0.2 to address a security issue.

Released Apache Traffic Control 3.1.0

## Community Health:
The community is healthy! We have definitely seen the "post summit bump" where
the community gets re-invested after a conference/summit that has lead us to
having more contributions and activity on the mailing lists.  We are starting
to become more mature as a community by agreeing to get better at how we do
releases and working towards a more consistent cadence.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Turbine Project  [Georg Kallidis]

## Description:
The mission of Turbine is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a Java Servlet Web Application Framework and associated component library.

Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the 
base of many other projects. It allows experienced Java developers to quickly 
build web applications.

## Issues:
- The SVN-GIT Mirror was reactivated again successfully.

## Membership Data:
- Apache Turbine was founded 2007-05-16 (12 years ago)
- There are currently 11 committers and 9 PMC members in this project. The
  Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jeffery Painter on 2017-11-12.
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
- Hackathon took place at Apache Europe  and was attended by two PMC members.
  Focus has been on upstream component Apache Torque 4.1 (version label may be
  changed to 5.0) and finally Turbine 5.
- Java Docker Testcontainer integration in Turbine 5 (and prospectively
  Torque-Test)
- Discussions about Turbine pipeline components
- Last quarters backlog / discussion are still in follow-up work/work in
  process.
- No releases were done this quarter.

## Community Health:
- The Turbine project's quarter activity has been mainly in the dev 
mailing list with ongoing code changes on low/medium level.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Usergrid Project  [Michael Russo]

## Description:
The mission of Usergrid is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
The BaaS Framework you run

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Usergrid was founded 2015-08-18 (4 years ago)
There are currently 28 committers and 25 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mike Dunker on 2016-01-18.
- No new committers. Last addition was Keyur Karnik on 2019-03-18.

## Project Activity:
 - CI setup with ASF Jenkins still in progress. Daily builds are in place but
   configuration needs to be investigated as builds are not green.
 - Various Bugfixes around index querying and maintenance.
 - Improved test stability.
 - Experimentation with using newer versions(5.x) of Elasticsearch vs.
   supported older version (1.7).

## Community Health:
Growth is flat. Some of the historical core contributors are no longer active
with the project. However, there is a new committer and additional interest
for modernizing Usergrid -- upgrading Cassandra to the latest version and
containerizing Usergrid. Getting the project to a healthier state will
continue to be a focus. This includes more discussion on the mailing lists,
better use of JIRA, and planning of a new release -- master branch is
currently stable and contains many stability fixes over the last release in
2016.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Velocity Project  [Nathan Bubna]

## Description:
The mission of Velocity is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
A Java Templating Engine

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Velocity was founded 2006-10-24 (13 years ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2017-07-27.
- No new committers. Last addition was Michael Osipov on 2017-01-30.

## Project Activity:
VelocityTools has seen some light improvements. Our Maven build infrastructure
has gotten a few patches. Velocity Engine 2.2rc1 is out with some nice log,
custom parser, and backwards-compatibility improvements. It has received two
PMC votes for GA release. It is waiting on a third.


## Community Health:
We are getting community input and contributions, but development is still
largely handled by a single PMC member. Dormant PMC members also outnumber
active ones. As the project is extremely stable by intent, the minimal
committer activity is appropriate, but it should not take this long to get
more PMC response on a release candidate quality.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Whimsy is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information 
lookup activities

## Issues:
I (Sam) remain concerned that there are not enough developers on the board
agenda tool.  Current status is that if something is broken, the fix waits
until I am available.  For things that are not broken but merely are feature
requests, I tend to respond with pointers to how/where the fix needs to be
made, and generally that's as far as it goes.  Given how important this
particular tool is to the foundation, this represents a "bus factor" concern.

Tools other than the board agenda tool have multiple people who attend to
problems and suggestions.

## Membership Data:
Apache Whimsy was founded 2015-05-19 (4 years ago)
There are currently 10 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was John D. Ament on 2017-06-11.
- No new committers. Last addition was John D. Ament on 2017-06-08.

## Project Activity:

Notable changes over the last quarter:
* Updates to the MACOSX developer instructions.
* Updates to agenda template and logic to reflect new Zoom and Directors.
* Increased test coverage
* Centralized unsubscribable checks
* Move away from usage of .archives
* Bug fixes: terminate resolution and time zones
* Strengthen non-standard resolution checks
* Allow directors to update the board list in the roster tool
* Update collate minute tool and incubator signoff tool to handle Wiki markup
  in the incubator report

## Community Health:
More than enough oversight, no new committers for over two years.

One tool (as noted above) has a bus factor isssue.

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
Apache Xalan exists to promote the use of XSLT. We view XSLT (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language Transformations) as a compelling paradigm that transforms 
XML documents, thereby facilitating the exchange, transformation, and 
presentation of knowledge. The ability to transform XML documents into usable 
information has great potential to improve the functionality and use of 
information systems. We intend to build freely available XSLT processing 
components in order to engender such improvements.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Xalan was founded 2004-09-30 (15 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 5 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-02-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-03-20.

## Project Activity:
No significant activities to report. No new releases.

## Community Health:
The project is not really active at the moment, there is a desire to create a
release but nothing's happened yet. Low mailing list activity aside from a ton
of SPAM I must reject every day.

Attachment BZ: Report from the Apache Zeppelin Project  [Lee Moon Soo]

## Description:
 -  Apache Zeppelin is a collaborative data analytics and visualization tool
    for general-purpose data processing systems.
## Issues:
 - PMCs are trying to fix and announce security issues that have been
   addressed and released. Most of them are PR ready, waiting for review and
   get merged. We are sorry that we didn't pay much attention on this instead
   of working new features. We would fix them by the end of this year when we
   plan to make the next release 0.9

## Activity:
 - Jetbrain integrate Zeppelin into their IDEA plugin Big data tools, we are
   working closely with Jetbrain on this.
 - There're 2 major frontend rework in community, one is via VUE, another is
   via Angular. These work will improve the frontend user experience of
   Zeppelin much. We expect user can experience these new changes pretty
   soon(maybe next release)
 - And we plan to move the frontend modules into sub projects of Zeppelin, so
   that we can make Zeppelin frontend more pluggable and customizable.
 - Several new interpreters are added, KSQL, Kotlin(in review)

Overall the ecosystem of Zeppelin is pretty healthy in our perspective.
