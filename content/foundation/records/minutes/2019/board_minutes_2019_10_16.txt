 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       We are all looking forward to ApacheCon EU 2019 in Berlin next week
       for the 20th Anniversary celebration.

       We accepted with regret Joan Touzet's resignation from the board of
       directors. We really appreciate her contributions to the board and
       hope to see her in future. We elected Dave Fisher to the board as
       Joan's replacement.

       I'm pleased to see that Diversity and Inclusion is making good
       progress, with approval of budgeted contracts with Bitergia.

       As board chair, I accepted an invitation to speak at the keynote
       session of Tencent Cloud Techo developer conference in Beijing in
       November.

    B. President [Sam]

       Quiet month.  Which is a good thing.

       Financially, we continue to be we ahead of plan, though timing
       considerations may reduce this.  I don't see anything to be concerned
       about, though we continue to monitor this.  See also: EVP report.

       No issues for the board in Brand Management, Fundraising, Marketing
       and Publicity, Travel Assistance, or Finance.  Highlights:

       * Consolidation of an ASF and Targeted Platinum sponsorship has been
         finalized
       * A targeted sponsorship for D&I was received and processed
       * We continue to build our Central Services support team.
       * ApacheCon Europe will be held in Berlin next week.  Sponsorship
         sales remain an issue.
       * There is one roadshow (Seattle) in planning.
       * ACNA 19 Insurance Completed and filed Sales tax exemption.

       No report received from D&I (Gris is offline for two weeks), but as
       Craig noted, a contract was signed with Bitergia.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operating Cash on September 30th, 2019 was $2,360.9K, which is down
       $89.5K from last month’s ending balance (Aug 19) of $2,450.4K.  Total
       Cash as of September 30, 2019 is $3,784.8K (includes the Pineapple,
       Restricted Donation and the Tides Restricted and Unrestricted
       Donations) as compared to $3,489.2K on Sept. 30th, 2018, (an increase
       of $295.6K year over year). The September 2019 ending Operating cash
       balance of $2,360.9K represents an Operating cash reserve of 9.8
       months based on the FY20 Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $241.8K/month.  The ASF actual Operating reserve of 9.8 months at the
       end of September 2019 is ahead of the budgeted 7.3 month’s reserve for
       YTD through September 2019.  The ASF Operating reserve continues to be
       very healthy for an organization of the ASF’s size and Operating
       activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is behind budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $44.7K due to Public Donations and
       Sponsorship Program income being under plan, while Conference income
       is ahead of plan. Breaking down the specifics of Conference income,
       ACNA 19 Sponsorship is ahead of plan which is offset by ACNA 19
       Registration being under plan (there are still some outstanding items
       that will adjust this hopefully next month).  Further offsetting this
       is that for ACEU 19 both its Sponsorship and Registration are also
       behind plan, as of the end of Sept 19, (the event is in Oct 19).  FY20
       YTD Income as compared to FY19 YTD Income, at this point in the fiscal
       year, we are ahead in Income by $93.3K, due primarily to Conference
       income, year over year.

       YTD expenses through September 30, 2019 are under budget by $589.8K. 
       All departments are under budget, which is primarily due to timing of
       payments for the depts.  Conferences expenses at this point are under
       budget due to timing and are expected to normalize as ACNA 19 has
       already taken place and ACEU is set to take place in October. As of
       this date the budgeted loss for ACNA19 was $55K and we are estimating
       it to be in the $110K-$120K range.  For ACEU19 which has yet to
       happen, as of the date of this report the estimated loss could be
       107k€.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$59.4K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$604.5K> NI or $545.1K ahead of
       Budgeted NI for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of Conference payments, Timing of TAC as well
       as underspending in most depts YTD vs the FY20 Budget, again due to
       timing.  At this point in the FY we are doing well, behind the budget
       in Revenue but well under budget in Expenses, per the estimates, even
       taking timing variances into account.  With regard to FY19, we are
       outpacing revenue, by $93.3K as noted above, but we are also ahead on
       expenses by $163.7K; thus, year over year NI for FY20 is behind FY19
       by $70.3K.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In the month of September, the Secretary received 67 ICLAs, 3 CCLAs,
       and 8 software grants.

       Beginning in October, the Secretary will be hosting the monthly board
       meeting via Zoom. The board agenda was updated to reflect the new dial
       in info.

    E. Executive Vice President [David]

       I've instructed Greg to perform a review of the services that we
       offer, in particular paying attention to whether or not our offered
       services are at least on par with the market offerings, and if not,
       what the gap is and how we might close that gap.

       I've asked Tom to prepare a P&L for ACNA, and plan to do so for ACEU.

       Infrastructure
       ============== 
       Largely, Infrastructure is working as expected. There's
       a large one-time expense that was approved related to
       prior FY accrued but heretofore unpaid charges that
       will be realized this year.

       Travel Assistance
       ================= 
       Last minute flight rebooking had to be performed due
       to some airline bankruptcies.

       We're working to make sure that hotel fees are prepaid 
       before the event begins. The TAC hotel is reporting that 
       they haven't received payment, so some last minute 
       scrambling has been performed. 

       Otherwise, things are as expected and in progress for ACEU.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       Served as acting chair for the September board meeting when the
       Chairman was unavailable.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues firing on all cylinders with efficient and effective
work. We are in the process of renewing 3 Platinum, 2 Gold, and 2 Silver-level
Sponsors. 2 Bronze sponsors have renewed, with payment received by one of
them. We are also in conversations with a NEW Silver sponsor.

The previously reported consolidation of an ASF and Targeted Platinum
sponsorship has been finalized. Big thanks to the extended team's work over
the past year+ to make it happen.

A targeted sponsorship for D&I was received and processed per our BAU
procedure. This was the first exercise of the procedure and worked well. We
are also in conversation for a potential targeted cash sponsorship for a
project as well as for Infra. We're also continuing conversations around a
potential crypto-to-fiat donation, and are awaiting next steps from the donor.

We continue to support ApacheCon Europe, having recently completed all
outstanding signatures and agreements. Preliminary discussions have begun
regarding the Seattle Roadshow.

Day-to-day operations are optimized: weekly status calls are ongoing, and
longer-term projects are underway (including fine-tuning Bronze Sponsorships;
promoting Targeted Sponsorships; streamlining Fundraising-related online
assets; and preparing campaigns for Individual Giving season)

We have received ~$1,280 individual donors via Hopsie.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - October 2019

I. Budget: we are on budget as planned, with some payments processing for
expenses incurred during ApacheCon.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising, has secured 7 sponsorship renewals (3 Platinum, 2 Gold, 2 Silver)
and is working with a handful of donations, including Targeted Sponsorships
and cryptocurrency contributions. Additional support with
Foundation/executive-level communications continues per usual, plus ASF
Conferences, ComDev, Brand Management, and the recent addition of outreach
assistance for Diversity & Inclusion. We're involved with the planning for
ApacheCon 2020 and upcoming Roadshow(s), are coordinating participation of
three PMCs with a hackathon at the University of Delhi, and organizing a booth
at All Things Open (turnaround time of less than two business days for both
events). We published the following Success at Apache posts: "Mentor Your
Mentor" https://s.apache.org/orco1 and "Why you'd want to become an Apache
Committer" https://s.apache.org/iflt2 . We are preparing to publish the next
Foundation Operations Summary (quarterly report), are working on a Sponsor
case study/profile (similar to https://s.apache.org/jKNc ), and reviving the
"Have You Met?" series
 https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-asf-asks-have-you to showcase
 various Apache projects. We wrapped the 20th Anniversary promotions for the
"Community Over Code. Code Over Community" photoshoot
 https://blogs.apache.org/press/entry/community-over-code-code-over ;
 principal photography on "Trillions and Trillions Served" (the documentary on
 the ASF) was completed during ApacheCon Las Vegas
 https://blogs.apache.org/press/entry/trillions-and-trillions-served-a ;
 filming will resume at ApacheCon input Berlin.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 24 September 2019: The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Rya™ as
   a Top-Level Project
 - 24 September 2019: The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Program
   Highlights for ApacheCon™ Europe

IV. Informal Announcements: 9 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 274 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 51 items to 55K followers on Twitter,
and posted 14 items on LinkedIn that garnered more than 69.5K organic
impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 1 announcement is in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, "Have You Met?"
highlights, and "Project Perspectives" profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 4 media queries. The ASF received 1,006
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,024. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 2,240 press hits vs. last month's 1,954. ApacheCon received
123 press hits. The introductory course materials for Media & Analyst Training
is available from http://apache.org/foundation/press/ for those wanting to
take the training without having to wait for the next ApacheCon.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 2 analyst queries. Apache was mentioned in
3 reports by Gartner; 3 reports by Forrester; 4 reports by 451 Research; and 1
report by IDC. We are also working with Gartner on an audit of a research
project.

VIII. Central Services: we continue to build our support services team.
Kenneth Paskett has been supporting overall graphics requirements for the ASF
Press Kit http://apache.org/foundation/press/kit/ , as well as providing
signage for presentations, Apache project logo designs/recommendations, and
creative assets for third party events. He will be attending ApacheCon Berlin
on behalf of ASF Marketing & Publicity/Central Services and will be liaising
with the Open Source Design community to explore ways we can engage on future
Apache-related projects. We have added Paul Berschick to the Central
Services/Creative team, and thank him for his "badge generator" using the
ASF's
#LoveApache template
https://aceu19.apachecon.com/enhance-your-social-media-avatar (this will be
part of the ASF's media kit). We have also confirmed new dedicated Central
Services/Editorial team members: Maria Cruz, MJ Foulks, Ruth Holloway, and
Swapnil Mane. Sally is developing a master editorial calendar and workplan for
the team.

IX. Events liaison: with ApacheCon North America wrapped, focus has been on
supporting Berlin with promotions and sponsorships. Sally also coordinated the
ASF's participation at the Cumbre de Contribuidores de Open Source Software
event/Guadalajara 14-15 September, Huawei Direct/Shanghai 18-20 September, and
is currently developing a Foundation-level presentation for the ASF Chairman
keynote at the Tencent Cloud Techo Developer Conference/Beijing 6-7 November.
The ASF will be presenting at All Things Open/Raleigh 13-15 October, and was
also provided a last-minute booth that will be staffed by Rob Tompkins and
Eric Covener. Promotional materials and signage were ordered on a rush basis
(1 business day turnaround).

X. Newswire accounts: our pre-paid press release package with GlobeNewswire is
active and running through 2021.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
Three major source control initiatives:
- The subversion server was upgraded to 18.04/p6 and moved into a new
  data center. The new server is much more responsive, due to faster
  disks and an upgraded svn.
- Restored the service that maps svn projects over to readonly GitHub
  projects. We dropped the unused/obsolete mirrors, and reestablished
  (28) mirrors. The mapped git repositories are no longer published on
  an apache.org server, but remain private on the new svn server.
  Users should access the git mirror/repository from GitHub.
- GitHub commit webhooks are now delivered to AWS SQS, instead of our
  server, for resiliency (eg. when we upgrade the box) and for proper
  ordering (eg. when large payloads processed after smaller, later
  payloads). Gitbox polls the SQS queue, in order, removing payloads
  after processing.

Finances
========
We have a large payment this month that was deferred from FY19, but
due to cash accounting will be marked as FY20. On balance, we were
under budget in FY19, and _may_ be over in FY20. Starting in FY21,
this line item will be zeroed.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- More 14.04 upgrades to 18.04/p6.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Finish deprecation of the CMS, and assisting projects to move to new
  content solutions (including possibly-outsourced solutions such as
  GitHub Pages and/or Wordpress).

General Activity
================
- Jira now uses LDAP for committer sign-in, and non-committers create
  independent accounts.
- Testing an easier 2FA system for Infra's use on VMs.
- Improvements to the new .asf.yaml system, including better Pelican
  support for website building.
- Exploring some new/additional options for more CI/CD. The projects
  have a boundless need, so "more" is always Good.
- Enabled TLS on our inbound MX servers. Work continues on updating
  our entire email infrastructure, from our oldest systems.
- Buildbot 2.0 is up and running, and a few jobs have been moved.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon Europe will be held in Berlin next week.  Current expected
attendance is 250.  In addition to the Open Source Design workshop being held
on the 25th from 10:00 to 14:00, Airflow and OpenOffice are both also planning
off-location hackathon/workshops. We were also approached by Opensource.berlin
about partnership with their planned meetup, although this will be a lower-key
cooperation.  As already noted in the treasurer's report, sponsorship sales
are low.

We have begun discussion of venues and dates for ApacheCon North America 2020.

There is one roadshow (Seattle) in planning. They are considering the first
week of June.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Events
======

ACNA 2019 - Las Vegas

Post Conference Surveys have gone out to out TAC folks, we have had a few
responses. Will follow up with those that have not responded yet. When
complete, will post a summary of the feedback, and add to our Success Stories
that we post to our wiki.

ACEU 19 - Berlin

Not long to go now, everything seems to be in place ready to go. We had to
change two flights due to an airline issue; and will seek refunding of the
original costs.


Statistics of Success since TAC Committee was (re-)formed in 2008

TAC has sponsored *193* attendees for 17 ApacheCon events since 2008 until
now. And also sponsored 8 people for smaller events. Many of those have gone
on to become committers on projects, PMC members on projects, PMC Chairs of
projects, ASF Members, Infra Staff and even Board Members. TAC continues to
provide value to the ASF in its mission to bring in new people into the
foundation.

General Activity
================

Mailing list remains quiet with not much going on.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

"""
Is there a file/page/database/beer mat where we collate the
    information about who is on what committee? 
"""

The W3C managed list isn't publicly accessible.

I sent a current list to the w3c@a.o mailing list.

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're slightly up 2 to 22,
unresolved issues this month.

Our work with Eclipse foundation continues mainly around formalizing our
current relationship, but also discovery of prior ASF participation in JSR
Expert Group. See VP Jakarta report for more details. This month Mark Struberg
indicated that he has been able to commit to coming up with a proposal on next
steps. This is understandable given the volunteer nature of our committee, but
it does make Eclipse Foundation a tad frustrated with ASF. We will keep an eye
on the situation and hopefully will resolve it in the coming month.

We handled two spurious DMCA takedown notices (the originating legal counsel
was confused about relationship between ASF and how its products are used by
3d parties).

We reviewed and approved contract for the D&I committee between ASF and
Bitergia.

We clarified SLA expectations of the Committee over
at https://www.apache.org/legal/#communications


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.

Stats for September 2019:

      13	[license confusion]
      10	[support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 28 (last months: 46, 26, 23, 44, 29)

      4       [site]
      3	      [hadoop]
      2	      [airflow], [arrow], [jspwiki], [openoffice]

              [trafficserver], [zeppelin]

     In total, as of 30th September 2019, we're tracking 81 (last month:
     82) open issues across 38 projects, median age 75 (last month:
     88) days.  40 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     7 (last month: 8) of these issues, across 4 projects, are older
     than 365 days.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 12: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [John Kinsella]

(Apologies for delay in getting this report in. Setting reminder to go off a
 little earlier next month)

October was quieter than intended - got initial wiki page and call for
volunteers out. Intention is doing a "soft launch" to members@, then after a
week or two of hopefully wise Member feedback, opening volunteer call to wider
committers@.

Outside, engaging with privacy/legal contacts with hope of getting them to
contribute in some manner, as well.

As requested in last month's (good) feedback, will list goals for the coming
months for the next quarter or so as momentum is established.

October Goals
* Grow privacy-discuss subscribers
* Gather feedback on initial topics/priorities for Data Privacy to address
* Build out wiki with assistance from others - I can write this, but intent is
  to get community to contribute.

Stats for September 2019:
* 1 still open Jira ticket (Intention is to move LEGAL-383 to PRIVACY)
* 0 closed issues
* Next report will start to report on subscription/discussion stats.

Attachment 13: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations  [Mark Struberg]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Michael Wall]

## Description:

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust, scalable,
high performance data storage system that features cell-based access control
and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on Google's BigTable
design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift.

## Issues:

There was a discussion about a trademark issue at http://www.accumulodata.com
[1]. The owner of the site is a PMC member and has offered to repoint to
https://accumulo.apache.org.

## Membership Data:

Apache Accumulo was founded 2012-03-20 (8 years ago) There are currently 36
committers and 36 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Adam Lerman was added to the PMC on 2019-08-06
- Holly Keebler was added to the PMC on 2019-08-08
- Adam Lerman was added as committer on 2019-08-08
- Holly Keebler was added as committer on 2019-08-09

## Project Activity:

- We have finally released Apache Accumulo 2.0.0 on 2019-08-02 [2].
- We also released the Apache Accumulo2 Maven Plugin on 2019-08-07 [3].
- The monthly "Hack Day" continues in Columbia MD.  There was nothing of note
  posted from the meetings in Jul, Sep or Aug.

## Community Health:

Activity in the community remains pretty constant.  The exception is that the
user list felt like it had a little more activity over the past quarter which
is supported by the metrics showing a 195% increase in emails (59 compared to
20).  Many of those emails were people new to the community asking questions
or getting support.  We have also been attempting to encourage participation
among newcomers by inviting them to subscribe and introduce themselves on the
dev list.

this before the next board report -- end of the calendar year.

## Community Health:
The community is doing well, with no concerns nor exciting growth to report,
we plan to work on lowering the barrier to get started with a goal to attract
more committer.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Christian Schneider]

## Description:

## Membership Data:
Apache Aries was founded 2010-12-15 (9 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 41 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carlos Sierra Andrés on 2018-07-03.
- No new committers. Last addition was Amichai Rothman on 2019-05-23.

## Project Activity:

## Community Health:

- In this period we have rather low activity as the upcoming OSGi specs are
  still in early stage.
- Mainly maintenance releases
- The work on our new Website stalled a bit.
- As planned I asked for nomination for a new PMC chair. Unfortunately no one
  stepped up. So I will remain the chair for now but keep asking for
  volunteers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Arrow is the creation and maintenance of software
related to columnar in-memory processing and data interchange

## Issues:
* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
* Apache Arrow was founded 2016-01-19 (4 years ago)
* There are currently 48 committers and 28 PMC members in this project.
* The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Micah Kornfield was added to the PMC on 2019-08-21
- Sebastien Binet was added to the PMC on 2019-08-21
- Ben Kietzman was added as committer on 2019-09-07
- David Li was added as committer on 2019-08-30
- Kenta Murata was added as committer on 2019-09-05
- Neal Richardson was added as committer on 2019-09-05
- Praveen Kumar was added as committer on 2019-07-14

## Project Activity:

* The project has just made a 0.15.0 release.
* We are discussing ways to make the Arrow libraries as accessible as possible
  to downstream projects for minimal use cases while allowing the development
  of more comprehensive "standard libraries" with larger dependency stacks in
  the project
* We plan to make a 1.0.0 release as our next major release, at which time we
  will declare that the Arrow binary protocol is stable with forward and
  backward compatibility guarantees

## Community Health:

* The community is continuing to grow at a great rate. We see good adoption
  among many other projects and fast growth of key metrics.
* Many contributors are struggling with the slowness of pre-commit CI. Arrow
  has a large number of different platforms and components and a complex build
  matrix. As new commits come in, they frequently take a long time to
  complete. The community is trying several ways to solve this. There is
  bubbling frustration in the community around the GitHub repo rules for using
  third party services. This is especially challenging when there are free
  solutions to relieve the community pressure but the community is unable to
  access these resources. This frustration is greatest among people who work
  on many non-asf OSS projects which don't have such restrictive rules
  around GitHub.  Some examples of ways the community has tried to resolve
  these have included:
  * Try to use CircleCI, rejected in INFRA-15964
  * Try to use Azure Pipelines, rejected in INFRA-17030
  * Try to resolves Issues with Travis CI capacity: INFRA-18533 &
    https://s.apache.org/ci-capacity (no resolution beyond "find donations")
  * The creation of new infrastructure design (in progress but a huge amount of
    thankless work)
* While the community has seen great growth in contribution (more than 300
  unique contributors at this point), the vast majority are casual
  contributors. The daily active committers (the workhorses of the project
  that bear the load committing the constant PRs, more than 5000 closed at
  this point) have been growing slower than adoption. This is despite the fact
  that the community has been very aggressive at being inclusive of new
  committers (with likelihood to have more than 50 in the next week). The
  community is still continuing to try to brainstorm ways to improve this.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Sean Busbey]

## Description:
Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

This report is for the period of Aug 1 2019 through Oct 9 2019.

## Issues:
The project currently has no issues that require board attention.

## Summary:
Apache Avro was founded 2010-04-20 (9 years ago) There are currently 31
committers and 23 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
 - Sean Busbey became PMC Chair
 - Brian Lachniet was added to the PMC on 2019-08-23
 - Nándor Kollár was added to the PMC on 2019-08-29
 - No new committers. Last addition was Tim Perkins on 2018-12-12.

Releases, past quarter:
- Apache Avro 1.9.1 on 2019-09-02

## Activity:
The Avro project slowly is improving on our gains from the last year.

We've gotten a fair bit of feedback on the 1.9.0 release and are working
towards establishing a regular cadence for getting the result of that feedback
into our downstream communities. As noted in the summary, we've gotten the
follow-up 1.9.1 release out after a period of approximately 4 months. (With
our current project versioning "1.9" is a major release line and "1.9.1" is a
minor release.)

We're also working across all of our programming language implementations to
update things for current build tools and third party dependencies.

We had a brief discussion about how our library versioning differs from
practices we see in other places. The discussion had low participation but
consensus among those that did was to both better document our current
practices and change them in the future. We did not come up with any specific
plans to handle implementation. [ref: https://s.apache.org/gxfo0 ]

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

There has been no significant progress since the last report. As there
have been a number of missed reports, the PMC have been contacted by the
board to ensure that there are at least three PMC members providing
oversight for the project. We were able to confirm that this was still
the case with the following PMC members indicating their ongoing interest
in the project:

 * chambej
 * dammina
 * gjm
 * gstein

Given the ongoing lack of progress, the chair is expected to bring some
discussion to the dev list about the possibility of moving the project to
the attic.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Francis Chuang]

## Description:
Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Calcite was founded 2015-10-22 (4 years ago)
There are currently 45 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Stamatis Zampetakis on 2019-04-13.
- Julian Feinauer was added as committer on 2019-09-10
- Mohamed Mohsen was added as committer on 2019-09-18

## Project Activity:
Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and its
Avatica sub-project.

Calcite 1.21.0 was released in the middle of September, including more than
100 resolved issues and maintaining a release cadence of roughly one release
per quarter.

We are also seeing new faces on the mailing list and opening pull requests on
Github. In terms of pull requests, our committers and contributors have made a
lot of progress to provide feedback to open pull requests and filed issues in
a timely manner. This is evidenced by the open pull requests on Github
receiving comments within a couple of days after being opened.

Members of the project also participated in ApacheCon NA last month,
presenting 5 talks about Calcite.

Finally, the Apache Ignite project has decided to adopt Calcite as its SQL
execution engine, replacing H2. This is an exciting development and is a
testament to the sound foundation and community the Calcite project has
developed.

## Community Health:
Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both Calcite and
Avatica with a slight decrease in code contributors and commits (7% and 1%
respectively).

The rates of pull requests being closed and merged on Github has increased by
16%, as we work to clear our backlog and we are also seeing a 7% increase in
opened pull requests.

Since the last report, we have added 2 new committers, Julian Feinauer and
Mohamed Mohsen.

We expect further growth in these numbers as Apache Ignite works to integrate
Calcite into their project, resulting in cross-pollination between the 2
projects.

## Project Activity:
- A TCP pubsub admin and a Websocket pubsub admin donation have been
received and accepted. The authors showed their interest in Celix and 
were invited to become committers. They all accepted.
- Celix migrated from Jira to GitHub issues. This will hopefully lower the
barrier for new contributors to join the project and/or interact with the 
Celix community.
- Celix started using GitHub actions for building and testing.
- Celix is working on a new release. However, a few issues still need to be
resolved before releasing a new version. 

## Community Health:
The health for the project is normal. The development mailing list 
activity increased because of the move to GitHub issues.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification


## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache CXF was founded 2008-04-15 (11 years ago)
There are currently 43 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andy McCright on 2019-02-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alexey Markevich on 2017-12-29.

## Project Activity:
Activity this quarter was mostly around bug fixes.   We did a few release, but
just "patch" releases that were targeting bugs found by users.  However, after
the 3.3.3 patch release in August, we did retarget master branch for more
forward looking changes such as Java 13+ updates, microprofile updates, etc...

Recent releases:
3.2.10 was released on 2019-08-13.
3.3.3 was released on 2019-08-13.
3.2.10 was released on 2019-08-13.

## Community Health:
For the most part, the project is making steady, but not stellar, progress.
Many of the protocols and specs that CXF implements are mature specs and don't
really change much.   Thus, steady progress and regular releases are a good
thing.   We are responding to bug reports and security issues and getting
patch releases out.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Shawn McKinney]

## Description:
The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
- ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
          written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
          compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
          Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
- LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
          replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
          and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
          with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
          servers.
- Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
          used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
          designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
          application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
- Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
          role-based access control, delegated administration and
          password policy services with an LDAP backend.
- Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
          various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
          and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
          interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
          facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
          as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
          and mobile.
- Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
          (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.
- SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification.

## Issues:

The activity level this past quarter was low.  With the exception of Kerby
and Scimple (discussed below) the PMC is unconcerned, as periods of inactivty
are not unusual with this project.  Members become busy with their day jobs
this time of year.

## Activity:

Per sub-project:

- ApacheDS: low activity: 

ApacheDS is still in an intermediary state, due to stability problems with
its underlying database.  This is a longstanding problem.  The goal is to
complete the work on the new database, Mavibot.  The project team is
committed to this important work, but it's a labor of love, and so sits on
the backburner. Other items addressed.  Many tests were added to the test
suite and misc issues are being worked on and resolved.  A review of the
Password Policy subsystem, working on outstanding issues, along with a
necessary change to the Change Password extended operation is underway.  A
release is being planned for 4Q 2019.

- LDAP API: low activity but keeping up with security patches to libraries
  and issues being reported to the community.  A release is being planned for
  4Q to roll the latest fixes out.

- Studio: low activity but this project has many users and is being
  maintained.  No new releases planned at this time.

- Fortress: low activity and also being maintained.  Some work this past
  quarter, add support for Java 11 and other misc feature requests.  Release
  scheduled for 4Q 2019 which will include upgrade to LDAP 2.0 API along with
  rolling out the fixes/enhancements since its last release.

- Kerby: low activity: This project has quite a following.  Over 1.8M
  downloads a month via Maven during the past quarter.  Project activity has
  been dormant, which is a concern.  The PMC is making inquiries into the
  project team, to ensure it's being properly maintained going forward.

- Mavibot: no activity: As stated above, Mavibot is to be the new database
  for ApacheDS.  There is still much work to be done before it's usable. 
  This work is related to adding/improving transaction support and reclaiming
  memory space.  The project team is committed to doing the work.

- SCIMple: no activity: For the second quarter in a row, this project has
  been dormant.  The PMC has made contact with the project members to
  determine viability.  If it's determined to not be active, a vote will be
  held to move into the attic.

## Health report:

Overall the project is healthy and actively being maintained.  The are
releases planned for 4Q for ApacheDS, API and Fortress.

## Description:
Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Fineract was founded 2017-04-18 (2 years ago) There are currently 35
committers and 17 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 9:5.

   - No new PMC members. Last addition was Courage Angeh on 2019-05-13.
   - No new committers. Last addition was Angel Cajas on 2019-04-26.

## Project Activity:

The Fineract community maintains two active projects.

Fineract 1.x - Current generation product which is widely used.


Fineract-CN - Next Generation framework which is still under active
development and has not been officially released


- Fineract 1.x

Shipping of release 1.4 has been delayed.

Over the past quarter, merged changes have been limited mostly to updates to
versions of project dependencies. There is ongoing work around migrating API
documentation to swagger (GSOC project) , fixing flakiness around test cases
and integrating open banking API's which are expected to be merged in the near
future.


- Fineract-CN

Major progress towards resolving pending category X dependencies , namely

   - RDBMS migrated from MySQL to PostgreSQL

   - Hibernate dependencies replaced with EclipseLink (GSOC project)

Further, thanks to Juhan Aasaru , major simplifications have been made with
regards to the containerization and the provisioning process.


## Community Health:

Both projects continue to remain healthy with 494 mails sent to our dev
mailing list. While the traffic was slightly higher in the previous quarter,
the same was attributed to a seasonal spike linked to activity around Google
Summer Of Code.

Activity rates on Jira also remain stable

- Fineract 1.X
   - 21 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (26 in the previous quarter)
   - 18 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months (14 in the previous
     quarter)

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Fluo Project  [Keith Turner]

## Description:
Apache Fluo is a distributed processing system built on Apache Accumulo. Fluo
users can easily setup workflows that execute cross node transactions when
data changes.  These workflows enable users to continuously join new data into
large existing data sets with low latency while avoiding reprocessing all
data.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Fluo was founded 2017-07-18 (2 years ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Kenneth Mcfarland on 2018-03-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Kenneth Mcfarland on 2017-12-07.

## Project Activity:
Fluo has a sub project called Muchos that sets up Accumulo and Fluo in AWS.
Recently, external contributors added support for for Azure. There was a large
amount of effort that went into this resulting in a lot of code.  Also,
support for HA Hadoop was added to Muchos.  On the AWS front, support for
templates were added making composing clusters more expressive.

Fluo uses RTC, we discussed relaxing RTC with a 72 hour lazy consensus
provision.

Work towards the release of Fluo 1.3.0 (which will support Hadoop 3, Accumulo
2, and Java 11) continues.  Recent work was testing and resolving integration
issues found during testing.


## Community Health:

There were 41 commits from 11 non-commiters and 2 commiters. Writing this
board report caused me to research inviting new committers, and I have
identified a few candidates.  A lot of this activity centered around Muchos.

We've started the practice of encouraging contributors on GitHub pull requests
to subscribe to the mailing list and introduce themselves, as a way of
encouraging community growth, and several have accepted the invitation to do
so.

https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/fe68ed3a1c4e54821d48e77a8e69885d1709a82c00ae7b493910fa4e@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E
We also had a round table meeting on the day after the conference, this is the
meeting note:

https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3d5fe9a80fa4876688d4dba96dff63de95cad8c2442873aed38f96ca@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E
There were some discussions about the relationship between HBase and Phoenix.

We revived the discussion about moving the stable pointer to 2.x

https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/81b2917eba3fce2872b96526635a5ba11535c73641cb3d38271ee353@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f9ae2bf212d4d1c48eecf3d1d26edb0dd3d1d3bb8096bf6740839dbe@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E
A lot of works have been done to improve the HBCK2 tool so we think it is time
to move the stable pointer to 2.x. If no other concerns, 2.2.2 or 2.2.3 will
be the next stable version.

We discussed the protobuf version for 3.0.0 release.

https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/abd60a8985a4898bae03b2c3c51d43a6b83d67c00caff82ba9ab2712@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E
We have moved to a shaded 3.x protobuf version for most code but for CECPs we
are still on 2.5.0. This is partly because hadoop is still on 2.5.0. Recently
the hadoop community also started to solve the problem, and we will try to
help them.

There was a discussion on where to place the release scripts:

https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/31d44cfd165ff04bed3a74a46311af3c2e857a3a84f08ae0759f2794@<dev.hbase.apache.org>
We have several repos now and all of them need to follow the Apache protocols
to make releases. We need to find a way to make the release work easier.

## Community Health:
- Mailing list activity:
dev@hbase.apache.org:
1015 subscribers(1007 in the previous quarter)
1339 emails sent to list(1473 in the previous quarter)

user@hbase.apache.org:
2150 subscribers(2171 in the previous quarter)
282 emails sent to list(160 in the previous quarter)

- JIRA activity:
455 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-5% decrease)
350 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-28% decrease)

I think after 2.x gets more stable the numbers will keep decreasing, maybe this
is a sign that we should start the release for 3.0.0.

- GitHub activity:
377 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (41% increase)
380 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (57% increase)

We keep improving the GitHub PR integration and now GitHub PR is the suggested
way to submit and review patches. This is why these numbers increasing
dramatically.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for October 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here: 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/October2019

There are presently 48 podlings incubating. In September, podlings executed 
8 distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members and no IPMC members 
retired.

We have no new podling this month, but there are discussions on several 
projects, including Apisix. A couple of podlings are heading towards 
graduation in the next few months. Rya graduated last month, and SINGA 
should graduate this month.

Several podlings Amaterasu, BatchEE, Omid and Tephra didn't submit a report 
and have been asked to do so next month. Omid and Tephra have now failed to 
report twice in a row. MesaTEE also failed to report but is just starting 
up. Amaterasu's PPMC has failed to respond to Incubator inquiries and failed 
to submit reports for many months and will be shut down. Annotator and SDAP 
failed to get any mentor sign off and have been asked to report next month.

There were 3 IP clearances.

Further work was done on cleaning up the incubator web site.

Several podlings have now used the new disclaimer policy to good effect.

The new mentor guidance document has had some new content added to it, but 
we still need to attract other mentors to work on it.

A new straight to top level project has been proposed called Petri as 
another way of educating external projects and the Apache Way with the 
option of them bypassing the Incubator and going straight to being a top 
level project. It's currently unknown what impact this might have on the 
Incubator short or long term.

At ApacheCon North America there was a Podling's Shark Tank and several 
talks on incubating subjects and projects. There will be some incubator 
related talks at the upcoming ApacheCon EU.

At ApacheCon NA meeting was held with ECharts contributors and a few other 
people from other projects based in China to discuss some of the issues 
they are having. The conversation was positive, and I believe everyone now 
has a better understanding of the difficulties faced by these podlings.

There were discussions in ApacheCon NA and at Huawei Connect on several new 
projects joining the Incubator.

There was a discussion on IP clearance process for Incubating projects 
which a number of people seem confused about, and the Incubator needs to 
provide better clarity around what needs to be done in the case where a 
podling receives a code donation what still in incubation.

A complaint was received (sent to the board) that a podling with the help 
of it's mentors and the incubator is looking into.

## Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and
humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Release initial versions (should happen this week!)
  2. Increase activity from current committers and community.
  3. Demonstrate good governance through voting and learning the Incubator 
  process (some more).

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community activity was quiet. However, code is underway for a first 
  release to be ready in the coming week(s) which we hope will increase
  interest and activity.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code for a first release is hoped to be available in the coming days with 
  more community members participating in review and critique. 
  Additionally, work in the W3C's ARIA (accessibility) Working Group and on
  various browser vendor repositories has highlighted new annotation related
  activity and opportunity for this project. Sadly, we've mostly failed at
  raising awareness on the list, so the communities "radar" looks quieter
  than it should...

## ShardingSphere

Sharding-Sphere is an ecosystem of transparent distributed database 
middleware, 
focusing on data sharding, distributed transaction and database 
orchestration.

ShardingSphere has been incubating since 2018-11-10.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Clear Brand issues with other ecosystem projects.
  2. Further ASF culture and processes.
  3. Make more apache releases.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  1. Have two Apache releases already. There are 4.0.0-RC1 and 4.0.0-RC2.
     All licenses and checklist are fine.
  2. There are other several related project on GitHub org in ShardingSphere
     ecosystem, before or during project joined the ASF incubator, such as
     extension modules, UI, benchmark and acceptance test, they were using 
     ShardingSphere-* prefix in project name, which may cause brand issue.
     We are trying to fix these. All ShardingSphere-* have been renamed to 
     OpenSharding-*, and all old releases with ShardingSphere- are declared 
     for not apache release. 
     We have already transfer benchmark and UI project to apache repo and 
     plan to merge extension modules and acceptance test into Apache repo.
  3. Another brand related issue is ShardingSphere in DockerHub, including 
     some binary releases, which have been moved apache release versions
     to ASF Infra
     - https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/sharding-proxy

     All of these are only including the approved releases.
  
     Right now, the brand issues are under control, so we think board or 
     IPMC may do not need do any actions for now.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  
  1. Yanan Zhao, Haisheng Sun, Guangyuan Wang and Qi Wang have been voted 
  and joined as committer.
  2. There are 74 people to contribute codes to the main repo, it increase 
  pretty quickly.
     More and more people starting to provide pull requests for new 
     features, minor enhancement, bug fix, example, documentation and answer
     questions. We are happy to see the community are growing up.
  3. Over 100 companies have confirmed they are using ShardingSphere 
     through issue report, our powered-by page
     Some companies has already provided some patches to feedback the 
     community.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  
  1. Release 4.0.0-RC2 last month, main feature is data encryption.
  2. Setup benchmark report which can generate data every day to show 
  performance status of ShardingSphere's changes.
  3. Manage contributions for squash merge pull requests, forbidden push 
  dev branch directly and setup code review procedure.
  4. Merge donated Sharding-UI project to dev branch and planning to 
  release it at 4.0.0-RC3.
  5. Process donated auto scale up tool from community, processing 
  dependencies and licenses now.

  1. Grow the community to get more reviews and content. However, at this 
  point, the community might want to consider that it is a stable project 
  that has met its initial functional goals. With multiple public releases 
  under its belt, it might be worth discussing a time to graduate. A 
  substantial increase in community activity in terms of code contribution 
  and related community growth might occur after a new set of 
  functionality/scope is identified for the project. But to date, the 
  existing community and code are following the Apache way.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  The project is just starting up and did not get a report ready this 
  month. 
  The champion need to work on migrating the initial committers and 
  eventually wider developer community to the apache.org mailing lists.

## Milagro

Milagro is core security infrastructure and crypto libraries for
decentralized networks and distributed systems.

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Continue to build relevant and useful crypto libs and applications
  for decentralized networks in order to grow the ecosystem of users and
  contributors to the project.
  2. Continue to improve compliance with the Apache Way
  3. Further releases to both extend the capability of the crypto libraries 
  and D-TA, and to demonstrate improved compliance with the Apache Way

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Please see the comment re: mentors below.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  No new members.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Milagro’s first ASF release, the crypto-c and crypto-js libraries, was 
  successful.
  These are modern cryptographic libraries that focus on Elliptic Curve 
  Cryptography.
  The libraries include support for pairing-based cryptography such as BLS 
  for short signatures and MPIN for multi-factor authentication.

  Issue tracking for individual repos has now been implemented in GitHub
  (Jira may still to be used for high-level planning)
  and redundant GitHub repos have been archived.

  Decentralized Trust Authority (D-TA) server code has been donated by a 
  team lead by Howard Kitto at Qredo  & IP clearance forms completed.
  Milagro’s vision is for the D-TA to be a general-purpose key generation, 
  distribution and storage server with an initial focus on a) generating 
  type-3 pairing/identity-based secrets for MPIN zero-knowledge & multi-factor
  authentication clients and servers, and, b) safeguard shares of secrets 
  such as Bitcoin private keys.

  An attempt to release early alpha version of the D-TA failed the Apache 
  Way but efforts to correct this are underway and we hope to have a 
  successful ASF release shortly followed in quick succession by enhanced
  versions ultimately leading to a production-ready version early next year.

  Website (http://milagro.apache.org/users.html) updated with crypto-c, 
  crypto-js and D-TA documentation

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

## Description:
The mission of Isis is the creation and maintenance of software for rapidly
developing domain-driven applications in Java. Users only write POJOs and
Apache Isis handles the database and UI automatically at runtime.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Isis was founded 2012-10-17 (7 years ago)
There are currently 14 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johan Doornenbal on 2018-04-05.
- No new committers. Last addition was Johan Doornenbal on 2018-03-19.

## Project Activity:
There continues to be substantial development work on v2.0, with the
framework being "re-platformed" to run on top of Spring Boot.The 
documentation is also being reworked to use Antora [1].  Current best 
estimates for this release are the end of the year (2019).

As part of this development, there has been some discussion on the users
mailing list about extending the framework-supported annotations.  It was
decided for v2.0 to support this idea as an optional extension, thereby
providing users of the framework with some flexibility.

 - Last release was 2.0.0-M2 on Tue Jan 22 2019 [2]

## Community Health:
This is a mature project. The framework is generally stable with some
activity taking place for the version 2.0 release.

Mailing lists are somewhat quiet, but we expect this to pick up once we
have v2.0 out of the door.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrea Turli]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

jclouds continues to squash bugs but little feature work. There is a community
interest in a new release that incorporates recent work on Azure. We are
releasing a new major and a bugfix release this week.

We are aiming to support newer Java versions, and many efforts have been put
in upgrading to Java 8. There are several dependencies that still pin the
project to this version of Java, and further upgrading it would require
upgrading those core dependencies. We are trying to find champions in the
community to lead that effort, as the energy and availability of the current
Committers and PMC members are low (see the Community section below).

== Community ==

There have been small contributions from the community and bugfix reports as
in previous quarters. We have seen, however, that the issues that are being
reported recently are more about the core features of the project instead of
the simple features of a specific provider. This is a bit encouraging since
some of those reports had a level of detail that shows that there was interest
in digging down and understanding the most complex parts of the codebase.

There is still a concern around the amount of time being dedicated to the
project since most of the PMC and committers are now "pure" volunteers (with
$dayjob no longer related to jclouds). Another concern keeps being the lack
of traction, requests, and general interest from the community itself.

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Find a champion that helps us upgrade the core dependencies that pin us to old
Java versions. Keep engaging contributors on Slack, and propose them as new
committers as appropriate. Monitor the PMC and ensure we have enough resources
to properly manage the project.

Jena 3.13.0 was released on 2019-10-11.

The 3.13.0 release had some minor issues and the project has corrected these
with 3 .13.1.

## Community Health:

The 3.13.0 release was 4 months after the previous one.  The project aims for 3-4
months so this was at the longer end. The 3-4 month is clock-tick is
aspiration rather than resourced plan.

The project mailing lists are at normal levels, and users@ is getting some
more answers to questions from other users, not just the main developers.
StackOverflow is the main place for basic questions.

## Activity:
- The dual-migration from Subversion to Git and Ant to Gradle has been finished.
- The project has started to release the next version (5.2) with this new
  building system. We are in the RC1 release vote (but probably need to do a
  RC 2 to fix little issues)

and JSR-367

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Johnzon was founded 2016-04-20 (3 years ago)
There are currently 8 committers and 6 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Reinhard Sandtner on 2016-08-30.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jonathan Gallimore on 2018-05-09.

- 1.2.0 was released on 2019-09-24.
- 1.1.12 was released on 2019-05-29.

## Community Health:
The mailing list traffic increased quite a lot anf it is interesting
to associate that to the increase pull-request number on github.
Digging into that we see more external contribution which is a very
important sign for us since it gives us back some name for future
committers - we already created some "watch people" thread on the private list
about that.

Metrics:
dev@johnzon.apache.org had a 418% increase in traffic in the past quarter
(503 emails compared to 97)
- 64 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (357% increase)

## Description:

Apache Joshua is a statistical machine translation toolkit.

## Issues:

 - Activity in the project is very low

## Activity:

 - Since last board meeting we merged a PR and there were occasional
   discussions about implementing language packs for CJK languages, two
   committers plan to work on them in the next weeks


## Health report:

 - The community is essentially the same since graduation. No potential new
   committers / PMC members showed up

 - Mailing lists have low activity

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez]

## Description:

A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

Apache JSPWiki was founded 2013-07-17 (6 years ago)
There are currently 16 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Dave Koelmeyer on 2016-04-06.
- No new committers. Last addition was Dave Koelmeyer on 2016-04-06.

## Project Activity:

2.11.0.M5 was released on 2019-09-18, followeb by five vulnerability
disclosures, fixed on that release. This release included JSPWIKI-1114,
an external contribution noted on previous report.

This quarter we've also had another vulnerability report which has been
rejected.

## Community Health:

Uptick of e-mails at dev@jspwiki.apache.org most probably related to 2.11.0.M5
release. Uptick of e-mails at user@jspwiki.apache.org due to more than usual
amount of questions and follow ups on July.

No questions unanswered on MLs, project remains with enough oversight, with 
usual slow pace of development.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Adar Dembo]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Kudu is the creation and maintenance of software
related to a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache Hadoop
ecosystem.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Kudu was founded 2016-07-19 (3 years ago)
There are currently 25 committers and 25 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- LiFu He was added to the PMC on 2019-08-21
- Yao Xu was added to the PMC on 2019-08-21
- Yao Zhang was added to the PMC on 2019-08-21
- LiFu He was added as committer on 2019-08-22
- Yao Xu was added as committer on 2019-08-22
- Yao Zhang was added as committer on 2019-08-22

## Project Activity:
The community is in the process of preparing the next minor version release,
Apache Kudu 1.11.0.

The previous release was Apache Kudu 1.10.0, on Tue Jul 9 2019.

## Community Health:
- Traffic to the dev mailing list is down by 47%. Most threads are responded
  to in a timely manner, but this decline can be explained by developers'
  preference to instant messaging and face-to-face conversations that get
  eventually distilled and shared with the mailing list.

- Website traffic appears largely flat, with the number of users down 4%,
  sessions down 3%, and average session duration up 4%.

- Developer activity (measured by code reviews, commits, open JIRAs, and
  closed JIRA) is noticeably down (35%, 55%, 41%, 68% respectively). The
  previous quarter saw many large, multi-quarter feature efforts come to a
  close, and so this decline is understandable, with a few larger projects
  beginning their design phases.

- Commits were authored by 24 contributors (-14% since last quarter), 5 of
  which are new to the project.

## Report Feedback
In response to our last report, the board offered this feedback:

druggeri: I can appreciate the comment about using instant messaging
            rather than mailing list. Just to be clear, is the project
            being sure to return all decisions back to the mailing
            list?

We have been congnizant of this and have tried to ensure that once discussed,
important topics are surfaced to the mailing lists with in-depth summaries of
the discussion so far, allowing for further discussion.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

While the project had stalled in the first half of 2019, there has been some
progress in the last quarter:


  *   A new YAML CI configuration was setup on Azure DevOps, which was
      designed so anyone can build and test on their own Azure DevOps account
  *   The test framework APIs were cleaned up and several bugs addressed
  *   Progress is being made on ICU4N, our biggest dependent project
  *   The API doc website is coming along

We also added Shannon Deminick as a new committer on October 9, 2019, which is
our first since September 2016.

There has been very little activity on the user and dev lists in the past
couple of months, and there hasn't been any new bug reports in some time.

We have itemized the remaining issues for both Lucene.NET and ICU4N and have
arrived at the following estimates to production release:

Lucene.NET 4.8.0

Hours Completed: ~3700 Hours Remaining: ~750

ICU4N 60.x

Hours Completed:  ~350 Hours Remaining: ~450 (assuming we don't port any more
of it) Hours Remaining: ~900 (ported to feature completion)

Lucene.NET 8.x Upgrade

Hours Completed: 0 Hours Remaining: ~1700

The primary items left to complete for the 4.8.0 release are the
RandomizedTesting package that the test framework depends on, the API docs,
and ICU4N.


== Releases ==



* Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012

* Working toward 4.8.0 - Currently beta0006, released 2019-08-13

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache MADlib Project  [Aaron Feng]

## Description:

- Apache MADlib is a scalable, big data, SQL-driven machine learning framework
  for data scientists.


## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

- Community is at work on the 1.17 release, which will be the 7th release as
  an Apache TLP project. Main JIRAs include:
* feature improvements for deep learning including training multiple models in
  parallel for parameter selection (hyper-parameter tuning and model
  architecture search), inference on models trained outside of MADlib, and
  performance improvements to mini-batch preprocessor
* performance improvements to correlation/covariance, association rules, and
  weakly connected components graph algorithm
* stopping criteria on LDA using perplexity
* auto selection of number of centroids for K-mean clustering

- After that will be the 2.0 release with JIRAs related to versioning models.

— Nikhil Kak and Nandish Jayaram (MADlib committers and PMC members) presented

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

## Description:
The mission of Maven is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Java project management and comprehension tools

## Issues:
<<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

## Membership Data:
Apache Maven was founded 2003-03-01 (17 years ago)
There are currently 60 committers and 24 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:

  Released projects
 - Core
   - Maven 3.6.2 was released on 2019-09-02.

   - Maven Default Skin 1.3 was released on 2019-07-28.
   - Maven Resolver 1.4.1 was released on 2019-08-18.

## Community Health:
Due to the new cadence of Java we've updated the Java versions for our projects 
and all still look good. We're having the strategy to test with:
- projects minimum (e.g. Java 7)
- Java LTS (Java 8 + Java 11)
- Current Java (Java 13)
- Next Java EA (JAva 14)

Preparations for Maven 3.7.0 have started. There are several ambitious ideas
which would push Maven to a new level. The discussions around these topics
get quite some attention. 

We're still struggling with finding new committers. We see some contributions, 
but we're also struggling to evaluate them, give proper feedback and in the end
merge them. The amount of work is just out of balance compared to the number of
committers. 
Hopefully with the new ideas for Maven 3.7.0 we attract new contributors and 
with some luck we'll see new committers in that group. The level to become
committer might be a little bit high, but that is for good reason: Maven is 
still the worlds leading build tool and we don't want to end up in a situation
like we faced with Maven 3.4.0 (which was never released).

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Vinod Kone]

## Description:
The mission of Mesos is the creation and maintenance of software related to a 
cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across 
distributed applications

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

But, please let us know if we have missed any steps (or places to update)
regarding the PMC rotation.

## Membership Data:
Apache Mesos was founded 2013-06-18 (6 years ago)
There are currently 48 committers and 48 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andrei Budnik on 2019-03-11.
- No new committers. Last addition was Andrei Budnik on 2019-03-06.

## Project Activity:

1.9.0 was released on 2019-09-05.

We have some exciting new features planned for 1.10.0.

## Community Health:
Code contributions and user engagement have seen a downtick due to the
ecosystem movement as mentioned in the last board report, but we anticipate to
see an uptick after the holiday season as we ramp up development effort for
1.10.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Metron Project  [Casey Stella]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Metron is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a security analytics platform for big data use cases.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Metron was founded 2017-04-18 (2 years ago)
There are currently 39 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Justin Leet on 2017-12-03.
- No new committers. Last addition was Shane Ardell on 2018-11-16.

## Project Activity:
A very major focus in the development effort in the last quarter
is the migration to Hadoop 3.x and the associated recent versions
of the ecosystem projects that we depend upon (e.g. ambari, hbase).
The testing and stabilization effort has taken quite some time,
but it feels as though this effort puts us in a good place to
near a 1.0 in the release after this.

## Community Health:
It's clear from our metrics that we have we have an uptick in
code contributions (16%) and some new blood in terms of code
contribution, but our discussions have gone down (a drop of
64% in dev@ and 38% in user@).  This is concerning from a
community contribution perspective, but perhaps somewhat
understandable as the lionshare of the work has been in migrating
dependencies.  Still, we seem to be up and down on contribution
with last quarter being an uptick and this quarter being another
downtick.  It is something worth monitoring.

- 4 code contributors in the past quarter (-42% decrease)
- 14 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (75% increase)
- 13 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-13% decrease)

The main point to consider is that Réda Housni Alaoui came to the dev list
asking to contribute on Vysper which we were considering moving to the attic.
We quickly voted him as a committer and he did a lot on the project during a
few weeks. No other real changes in the other projects, Mina SSHD being still
very active, the others with very low activity.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
The mission of NiFi is the creation and maintenance of software related to
providing an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
distribute data.

Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
Java and C++ implementations.

Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
MiNiFi.

Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
NiFi classloader isolation model.

Apache NiFi Flow Design System is a theme-able set of high quality UI
components and utilities for use across the various Apache NiFi web
applications in order to provide a more consistent user experience.
## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache NiFi was founded 2015-07-14 (4 years ago)
There are currently 44 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Peter Wicks on 2019-05-29.
- Rob Fellows was added as committer on 2019-09-24

## Project Activity:
Released Apache NiFi Registry 0.5.0 providing better proxy permissions,
support for Apache Knox, and the ability to make buckets accessible by
anonymous users.

Apache NiFi 1.10.0 will have a release candidate likely by the time of this
October board report.  It includes more than 330+ JIRAs.  This brings powerful
features such as sourcing extensions from the latest NiFi Registry at runtime,
far better model for paramaterized version controlled flows, Java 11
compatibility, back pressure prediction and more.

The release for MiNiFi CPP 0.7.0 is closing in.  There are nearly 100 closed
JIRAs including many bug fixes and new features such as ensuring all inbound
sockets are TLSv1.2 or newer, cron driven scheduling, support Kerberized
connections to Kafka, support for packages with Python scripts, and ability to
capture individual frames from an RTSP camera stream.
## Community Health:
Community health continues to be a strong point with a healthy committer and
PMC pipeline as well as high activity from current PMC members. We see
numerous release lines across the mentioned parts of the Apache NiFi project
all with very active development across features, bug fixes, and improvements.
Our mailing list continues to be highly active and our slack room is also
super active.

As reported in the previous quarter we had 394 users in our slack room but now
there are 523 and growing.  This is a great sign of the interest in the
community and the engagement level we see across PMC, committer, and pipeline
for future committers.

We continue to see highly active use and commentary related to Apache NiFi in
social media, meetups, blogs, and conferences in various parts of the world. A
NiFi PMC member presented on NiFi at the recent ApacheCon in Vegas. A recent
tweet reads "Work with ApacheNiFi is very fast and productive.  Counting now
+290 processors to build both batch and streaming ETL data pipelines for any
 type of data source and destination you want." Another reads "ApacheNiFi
 thanks for the usual level of nonsensical obfuscated badly described prose on
 your homepage trying to describe your framework/product. As usual obfuscation
 is your the forte of the Apache Foundation..." Fortunately patches are
 welcome.

This quarter we're seeing higher engagement across mailing lists, JIRA
activity both opened and closed, commits, PRs opened and closed.  This is
likely due to the range of release activities for the NiFi Registry as well as
the impending release of Apache NiFi 1.10.0 which is a huge feature, bug fix,
and improvement release representing one of the longer gaps we've ever had
since the previous feature bearing release.

## Project Activity:
The issues with the dependency management (see NUTCH-2669 and linked
issues) disappeared after an upgrade to the latest Tika version.

The releases of 1.16 and 2.4 are in progress, so far the votes have passed
successfully and we wait for the release artifacts to be mirrored.

With the release of 2.4 we will
- retire the development on the 2.x branch as no committer is actively
  working on it. We will advice users to use the 1.x/master branch instead.

The migration of the Nutch Wiki from MoinMoin to Confluence was
finished in July but cleanup and restructuring are still desired.

There have been discussions about getting people attracted via the
Outreachy initiatives resp. the Hacktoberfest event.

## Community Health:
There was a significant increase in code commits and resolved Jira issues.
Also the traffic on the mailing lists went up slightly. Reviews of and votes
for the release candidates have been done by
- (1.16) 6 committers + 1 user

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Peter Kovacs]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## SUMMARY

Latest Release was in September 2019. The community health in general is on a
low level. A major obstacle is the complex code and build system. Therefore it
is not easy for new people to gain a foothold into the code when the first
build is hard to be done. Short- and mid-term there is no view of improvement.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

No issues

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines:

1) 4.2.0 is the next minor release, planned to be released into a beta phase.
We have missed our goal on going into the beta in 2018. We managed only to
solve the biggest blockers. Currently dev test versions are being rolled to be
more widely tested.

2) 4.1.7 was released recently but we are already in the need to discuss about
a 4.1.8 release. The motivation in maintaining the 4.1.x release line is not
very high. Therefore we will shut it down as soon as we have a stable release
of
4.2.x. There is no release date defined yet, however, there are some blockers
to resolve.

## LATEST RELEASE HISTORY

2019-09-21 4.1.7 
2018-11-18 4.1.6 
2017-12-30 4.1.5

## PMC

Roberto Galoppini went Emeritus on the OpenOffice PMC. He stated
that his reasons are strictly pragmatic and not emotional. We thank Roberto
for is long time of service in the OpenOffice PMC and we whish him all the
best.

There are 27 PMC members as of 2019-Sep-24

Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N. McKenna (knmc)

Last committer addition was on 2017-Jan-28 Kay Schenk (kschenk) Last committer
withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)

## ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Community overall health is stable. Our user level support and translation
teams are well working. Documentation team is virtually non existent. We have
issues to bring volunteers on board for development.

We lack resources to build the community up in the area of development and
documentation. We are holding ground with the people we have in development.

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We have initiated the migration from the old Apache CMS to Pelican CMS. We
face the issue that we have 9GB of content to move. A plan has been made.

Our build bots are down for now a half year. The related infra Jira ticket has
been opened in Feb.2019. We try to fix things at the best of our capabilities.

## MARKETING

The booth team has been present at FrOSCon [1] on August, 10 + 11th (Sankt
Augustin, Germany), which will be finalizing the convention tour of our team
in 2019.

We are approved for an Apache OpenOffice developer Room, which we share with
other applicants. We have also applied for a booth at FOSDEM (Brussels,
Belgium). If the Application succeed we will learn on 1. November. We have
informed the Apache Community team on our move and we hope we can improve the
coordination compared to the last years. We will try to kick of some
recruiting, despite of our difficult overall situation. FOSDEM takes part on
February, 01st + 02nd [2].

We are in the process to print new flyers.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for October 2019

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running of our rule update infrastructure
and our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

Our wiki was successfully migrated by Infra in July from the deprecated
MoinMoin host to Confluence.

SpamAssassin 3.4.3 release candidate 4 was released August 31. We will need an
rc5 for a minor change, but are hopeful that will be our final release for
3.4.x and letting us focus on 4.0.

Our GSOC 2019 student, Shreyansh Shrivastava, successfully completed the
project in August. Thanks to Moaz Reyad and Wang Wei, representing Apache
Singa, for joining in to provide guidance and mentoring with regards to
statistical classification models. Shreyansh has been blogging about the
experience:
https://medium.com/@shreyansh25.shrivastava/gsoc19-work-submission-4699662d99f5

Among those representing ASF at WebPros Summit 2019 in September were
SpamAssassin PMC members Sidney Markowitz and Kevin A. McGrail, who helped
staff the ASF booth in "Open Source Alley" and presented some talks about
SpamAssassin and Open Source.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.2 on 16 September 2018

We are close to releasing version 3.4.3 to address some issues that were
deferred, in part so we could quickly release security fixes in 3.4.2. After
we release 3.4.3 we expect to resume development in our main branch for 4.0.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Sqoop Project  [Venkat Ranganathan]

## Description:
Apache Sqoop is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data
between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational
databases. It can be used to import data from external structured
datastores into Hadoop Distributed File System or related systems like
Hive and HBase. Conversely, Sqoop can be used to extract data from
Hadoop and export it to external structured datastores such as
relational databases and enterprise data warehouses

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Sqoop was founded 2012-03-20 (8 years ago)
There are currently 32 committers and 18 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:5.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
The mission of Steve is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Apache's Python based single transferable vote software system

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Steve was founded 2012-07-24 (7 years ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 4 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:4.

## Project Activity:
Not much of note here. We have had a new contributor step up, offering 
assistance on a number of tickets. As time permits, we'll get started on
reviewing the suggestions and patches, with the hopeful goal of gaining 
a new steady contributor. As we get closer to 2020, I expect we'll see 
an uptick in activity on the code-base.

## Community Health:
As per our usual manners, I performed a standard PMC oversight check. I am
happy to report that we still have sufficient (>= 3 people) oversight on the
PMC. There are no pending vulnerabilities or critical bugs that we are aware
of.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Streams Project  [Steve Blackmon]

## Description:
Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online
activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets
accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:
- Keeping the existing community active and growing the community remains a
  challenge.

## Membership Data:
Apache Streams was founded 2017-07-18 (2 years ago)
There are currently 8 committers and 8 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ate Douma on 2017-07-18.
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
- Activity was low again this quarter
- Most development focused on integrating person & company data enrichment
  services.
- Several PMC members will be participating in the upcoming ACEU 2019
  hackathon.

## Community Health:
- Mailing list and commit participation was low again.  Adding committers and
  growing the PMC needs to be a focus.
- Streams is over-due for a release to incorporate new ActivityStreams
  2.0 support and updates to several of our core dependencies.

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made no GA releases in the last quarter.

Within the last quarter we saw steady development activity with 15 closed pull
requests. Preparations are being made for a new Struts 2.5 feature release,
expected for the next quarter.

After announcing this step more than eleven months ago, we officially declared
End-Of-Life for the Struts 2.3 development line (2019-09-12)[1]. Users are
recommended to upgrade to Struts 2.5, since Struts 2.3 will no longer receive
further security updates.

A lot of effort also went into dealing with a massive security report
submitted by the Black Duck Research Team within the Synopsys Cybersecurity
Research Center, claiming that a number of historic Struts Security Bulletins
and related CVE database entries contained incorrect affected release version
ranges.

We worked hard to investigate and cross-check the report as good as possible,
given the volunteer time at hand. The combined efforts led to Struts Security
Bulletin S2-058 [2][3], referencing 15 historic Struts Security Bulletins and
respective CVE entries that have been updated to reflect corrections in
affected GA version ranges as well as minimum GA versions to contain
appropriate fixes for the issues at hand.

The Struts PMC would like to thank (again) the Apache Security Team and Sally
Khudairi for their excellent support while dealing with the report and its
aftermath.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Georgios Petasis]

## Description:
The mission of Tcl is the creation and maintenance of software related to
Dynamic websites using TCL. Apache Tcl is home to the Tcl-Apache integration
efforts. The purpose of our project is to combine the power of the Apache
web server with the capabilities of the mature, robust and flexible Tcl
scripting language. Currently only the Apache Rivet project is actively
maintained.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tcl was founded 2000-07-24 (19 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Brice Hamon De Crevecoer on 2014-11-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Brice B. Hamon on 2014-11-25.

## Project Activity:
This period has been mostly quiet. No new artifacts/releases have been
released.

Regarding comment from previous report:
"It has been 5 years since a committer or PMC member was added.
Is there hope for new blood?"
A quick response would be "difficult to attract new blood". Rivet has been
many years in development (thus is feature rich), and Tcl is not very
popular for web services development. Thus the community around Apache Tcl
is not large, and since user needs are already covered, it is difficult to
attract new committers.

I have to check whether the membership data reflects the current status.

## Community Health:
The community has remained the same for quite some time. There is some
activity  in the mailing lists, mostly seeking advice on how to use Apache
Rivet. No new bugs have been reported.
 - rivet-dev@tcl.apache.org had a 340% increase in traffic in the past
   quarter (22 emails compared to 5)
 - 12 commits in the past quarter (-40% decrease)
 - 1 code contributor in the past quarter (no change)

## Releases:
 - Last release was rivet-3.1.1 on Wed Jan 09 2019

## Project Activity:
We are still in the middle of preparing for the next (0.13.0) release. The
process has been slowed down by a number of tickets that were considered
release blockers, however all except one are solved by now. We are expecting
to have the release ready soon.

## Community Health:
We received and appreciate attention by certain new contributors (actual and
potential ones) in the last weeks, last not least reflected by the number of
JIRA tickets and pull requests. Current main work is the planned release and
keeping pace with the pull requests we continue to receive.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Tim Allison]

## Description:
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from, a
growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognised by IANA and other standards bodies.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tika was founded 2010-04-20 (9 years ago) There are currently 32
committers and 31 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Tilman Hausherr was added to the PMC on 2019-10-02
- Tilman Hausherr was added as committer on 2019-10-02

## Project Activity:
1.22 was released on 2019-08-01

SooMyung Lee (soomyung) and JinSup Kim (ddoleye) contributed a parser for HWP
v5 files.

We added significant improvements in language coverage for the tika-eval
module by collaborating with OpenNLP: we now detect 121 (vs. 75) languages and
have common words lists for 121 (vs. 21) languages. This means we can now
identify potential problems/regressions in content extraction for 121
languages.

## Community Health:
No significant changes in community health. There were decreases in @dev email
traffic and in closed tickets, but we saw a slight increase in contributors
and opened PRs. The team gave two conference presentations on Tika --
ApacheCon NA and Activate -- and we have an upcoming talk at ApacheCon EU.

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
Since our last report, TinkerPop has released versions 3.3.8 and 3.4.3,
both of which included bug fixes and minor improvements. We've had almost a
full year now of two month release cycles and have accomplished the goal of
firming up our last major release of 3.4.0. We are currently considering a
potential slow down in this release rate by releasing every three months for
these branches. We are currently preparing for release of 3.3.9 and 3.4.4
which should be available around the time of this board meeting.

The wider TinkerPop community saw two official release announcements that
expanded Gremlin's footprint in two separate programming language
ecosystems:

* grammes[1] - a strongly typed Gremlin server driver for Go.
* greskell[2] - a Haskell binding for Gremlin graph query language.

There were a number of talks/papers about TinkerPop, Gremlin and related
projects during this reporting period. Here were some by TinkerPop
committers/PMC members:

* Distributed Data Show - What's new in TinkerPop 3.4[3] - Stephen Mallette
* Towards an Integrated Graph Algebra for Graph Pattern Matching
  with Gremlin[4] - Harsh Thakkar
* mm-ADT - A Multi-Model Abstract Datatype[5] - Marko Rodriguez

We are currently in the process of inviting a new committer. We will update
the status of this situation in our next report.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.3.8 (August 5, 2019)
- 3.4.3 (August 5, 2019)

## PMC/Committer:
- Last PMC addition was Jorge Bay-Gondra - October 2018

## Project Activity:
- Our ATS Fall Summit will be held this coming week, 10/8 to 10/10, at the
  Verizon Media Campus in Sunnyvale, CA.  There are currently 71 attendees
  singed up for the event and we are going to to have two guest speakers.

- We made four security releases related to HTTP/2 security issues this
  quarter. We are currently working on our next major release 9.0.0 and it is
  currently being used on a few production servers while we work out some
  issues.

## Community Health:
- Community engagement is down across the board.  I feel this is the biggest
  area of concern for the project.  Overtime the number of subscribers to the
  mailing lists have been declining.

Attachment BY: Report from the Apache VXQuery Project  [Till Westmann]

Description:

Apache VXQuery implements a parallel XML Query processor.

Activity:
- There has been no visible (dev list or git) activity on the project since
  the last report.
- An attempt of a discussion on the retirement or revival of the project on

Attachment BZ: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Web Services was founded 2003-01-22 (17 years ago)
There are currently 224 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2016-05-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alessio Soldano on 2014-09-14.

## Project Activity:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required. However, user
questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed, and there are at
least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project can continue to
produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer
considered state of the art, we don't expect a major uptick in new development
efforts, new committers, etc...

Much of the activity this quarter was around some bugs that users have
reported in WSS4J and doing some optimizations in WSS4J for very large
messages (>2G).  We didn't do any releases this quarter, but are planning on
some patch releases very soon as they will be needed for planned CXF releases.

## Community Health:
As mentioned, SOAP/WebServices is not considered state-of-the-art anymore and
we are getting very little contribution from anyone other than the 2 or 3
"regulars" that are driving features and changes needed for CXF (which is
 being driven by their employers).   Thus, we are not seeing any possibilities
 for future new committers or PMC members.  However, there are plenty of
 people around that can do releases and answer questions and respond to
 security issues.  It's a mature project.

One point of note: Web Services *IS* scheduled to report this month and is on
the agenda.  However, the new "ASF Board Report Wizard" is insisting that we
don't need to report this month and is thus refusing to do the automatic
"Publish" option.  Likely a bug in the wizard or something..
