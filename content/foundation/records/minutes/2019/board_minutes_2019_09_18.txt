    A. Chairman [Craig]

       Kudos to the ApacheCon NA 2019 planning and execution team for a
       well-organized event in Las Vegas.

       A number of board members were able to attend the celebration and had
       many informal chats about how to work better together. No official
       meeting was held.

       Several of the IPMC members met with some of the podlings with a large
       Chinese membership and we discussed some of the challenges of
       integrating The Apache Way into the Chinese culture. Social barriers
       include the preference for synchronous social media communications and
       technical barriers include the sad performance of apache.org web sites
       in China mainland.

       The incubator DISCLAIMER-WIP was informally approved by the board to
       make it easier for podlings to make early releases that are not in
       accordance with a standard Apache release while making it clear to
       downstream users that there are unresolved issues.

       We're looking forward to another great ApacheCon EU next month in
       Berlin.

    B. President [Sam]

       Financially we are ahead on revenue and behind on expenses.  Timing
       considerations may moderate this a bit, but we are doing well.

       The most notable activity this month was ACNA which involved the
       coordination of a number of operational areas.  Otherwise a mostly
       quiet month, where quiet is good.

       No significant issues in Brand Management, Marketing and Publicity,
       Finance, and Diversity and Inclusion.

       Fundraising is exploring changing no-follow policy for bronze sponsors
       in response to a blog entry describing the ASF as selling links for
       SEO purposes.

       Conferences is exploring ways to manage costs for the ACEU.

       @Roman: Update docs around legal FAQ

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operating Cash on August 31st, 2019 was $2,450.4K, which is down
       $22.6K from last month’s ending balance (Jul 19) of $2,473.1K.  Total
       Cash as of August 31st, 2019 is $3,844.3K (includes the Pineapple and
       restricted Donation) as compared to $3,448.1K on August 31st 2018 (an
       increase of $396.2K year over year). The August 2019 ending Operating
       cash balance of $2,450.4K represents an Operating cash reserve of 9.9
       months based on the FY20 Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $246.8K/month.  The ASF actual Operating reserve of 9.9 months at the
       end of August 2019 is ahead of the budgeted 7.1 month’s reserve for
       YTD through August 2019.  The ASF Operating reserve continues to be
       very healthy for an organization of the ASF’s size and Operating
       activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is ahead of budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $138.0K.  As compared to FY19, YTD revenue
       is ahead by $133.2K primarily due to Conference income year over year
       at this point in time.

       YTD expenses through August 31, 2019 are under budget by $530.9K.  All
       departments are either under budget or showing minor variances, which
       is primarily due to timing of payments for depts.  Conferences
       expenses at this point are under budget due to timing and it is
       expected to normalize over the next two months as ACNA and ACEU are
       happening in September and October, respectively.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a positive
       $30.1K NI vs a budgeted negative <$638.8K> NI or $668.9K ahead of
       Budgeted NI for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of Conference payments, Timing of TAC as well
       as underspending in most depts YTD vs the FY20 Budget.  At this point
       in the FY we are doing very well, ahead in Revenue and well under
       budget in Expenses, even taking timing variances into account.  With
       regard to FY19, we are outpacing revenue, by $133.2K as noted above,
       but we are also out pacing ahead on expenses by $104.4K; thus, year
       over year NI for FY20 is ahead of FY19 by $28.8K.

       I would like to inform the board that I am stepping down from the
       office of the Treasurer effective Oct 31st 2019. I ask the board to
       appoint a successor as soon as possible to ensure a smooth and
       orderly handover of duties.

       @Myrle: look for a new assistant treasurer

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In the month of August, we received 75 ICLAs, two CCLAs, one software
       grant. GPG key verification using the recent Whimsy updates continues
       to work rather reliably.

    E. Executive Vice President [David]

       I attended ApacheCon NA and found the conference to be well produced.
       ApacheCon NA allowed me to have a number of good conversations with
       members, committers, contributors, and sponsors.

       As promised in last month's Board report, Tom and I spent time talking
       about a call list and service level expectations for Virtual at
       ApacheCon. We think we have a workable path forward with his key
       deputies identified and a plan for how to cascade down the list. More
       to come on this front, but I am substantially less worried now about
       Tom as a SPoF for our connection to Virtual.

       I've also asked Tom to look into travel insurance to cover employees
       and officers who are traveling on behalf of the Foundation. The
       current situation is that we are covering the employees provided to us
       via Virtual's PEO, but not the contractors or officers. Tom's
       researching this, expect it to land on operations@ after he has a few
       answers.

       TAC
       === 

       TAC executed well at ACNA. ACEU is already lined up and appears to
       be progressing well.

       Infra
       =====

       Infra is overall running well. Infra had a presence at ACNA and had a
       number of conversations with users and moved a number of projects
       forward while in-person.

       Git.a.o suffered an outage which is ongoing. This service translates
       svn to git, and then mirrors that to Github. The outage was caused by
       a service provider catastrophically losing storage that we consumed.
       This was a widespread outage that affected a number of users other
       than us. This service dates back to our earliest experimentation with
       git. With our advent of writable git repos and gitbox/github
       integration a good chunk of the functionality this service provided
       has been obviated. Projects have been asked to tell us if they are
       still making use of the service, and restoring just the portions that
       remained needed and utilized.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues operating smoothly. We secured 3 new Bronze Sponsors
this past month. We are working on two Bronze and one Platinum renewals. We
are also finalizing consolidation of a combined (ASF + Targeted) Platinum
sponsorship.

After another successful ApacheCon North America, we are responding to final
event-closing inquiries and are preparing for 2020 events. We continue
supporting ApacheCon Europe.

During ApacheCon North America, we held a great Sponsor luncheon to spend time
with our ASF family. 22 Sponsor representatives and 13 ASF team members
(Board, Executive, and Sponsor Ambassadors) participated.

An article that scrutinized the ASF Sponsorship program at the Bronze level
was published
https://www.brinzan.com/2019/09/apache-software-foundation-selling-links-for-seo/,
causing some confusion and distress with a small handful of sponsors whose
links may be affected. We are discussing any potential changes needed.

After publishing the ASF FY2019 Annual Report
https://s.apache.org/FY2019AnnualReport Sally, along with ASF Sponsor
Ambassadors Ted Liu, Bob Paulin, and Craig Russell, connected with all
Sponsors to share news of this milestone and extend assistance during
ApacheCon.

We received ~$1,930 from individual donors via Hopsie, with an additional
$2,000 ACH payment pending. $1,105 of the above total donations was raised as
 part of the ”Trillions” documentary campaign https://s.apache.org/trillions

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - September 2019

I. Budget: the majority of our annual budget has been expended in support of
three consecutive events (ApacheCon North America, Huawei Connect, and
ApacheCon Europe); expenses included both promotional items and travel/lodging
for service providers (documentary filmmakers, etc.) as well as select ASF
team members.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: as VP Sponsor Relations, Sally Khudairi is
supporting ASF Fundraising by engaging new sponsors (3 Bronze), securing
sponsorship renewals (2 Bronze), onboarding new sponsors, and liaising on
sponsorships for both ApacheCon North America and Europe.

She organized the ASF Sponsor Luncheon at ApacheCon for 36 attendees, 13 of
whom were ASF Board and Executive team members, plus ASF Sponsor Ambassadors
Ted Liu, Bob Paulin, and Craig Russell. The ASF FY2019 Annual Report was
published at https://s.apache.org/FY2019AnnualReport

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe.

13 August 2019: The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Annual Report for
2019 Fiscal Year

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 269 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 46 items to 54.8K followers on
Twitter, and posted 14 items on LinkedIn that garnered more than 44.7K organic
impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 1 announcement is in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we welcomed 3 journalists and 4 bloggers at ApacheCon,
and we responded to 9 general media queries. The ASF received 1,024 press
clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,919. Media coverage of Apache projects
yielded 1,954 press hits vs. last month's 3,104. ApacheCon received 145 press
hits. We held Intermediate Media & Analyst Training during ApacheCon with four
first-time and three repeat- participants. For those Committers interested in
taking the Beginner session, it is now available from
http://apache.org/foundation/press/ to help offset the year-round demand for
the training without having to wait for the next ApacheCon.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received three analyst queries. Apache was
mentioned in 2 reports by Gartner; 1 report by Forrester; 5 reports by 451
Research; and 3 reports by IDC.

VIII. Central Services: we continue to build our support services for both the
Foundation and PMCs. This is a slow roll-out that began in January 2019
starting with creative projects (ASF 20th Anniversary logos, supporting
graphics in the ASF Press Kit http://apache.org/foundation/press/kit/ , and
signage for ApacheCon and third party events). We have counseled various
Apache projects and their communities on a variety of creative issues
pertaining to Websites and logos for Apache projects and their communities.
Kenneth Paskett has been named Creative Lead, having been involved with the
re-design of the Apache feather logo and Website relaunch in 2016 and for the
ASF’s 20th Anniversary in 2019, as well as the ApacheCon Website relaunch in
2019. Kenneth will be attending ApacheCon Berlin on behalf of ASF Marketing &
Publicity/Central Services and will be liaising with the Open Source Design
community to explore ways we can engage on future Apache-related projects. The
next focus of planning is dedicated editorial support services which will
include standing ASF communications, Sponsor promotional activities, and
special projects, amongst others. For the past 7 weeks, Swapnil Mane has
stepped up to edit and publish the Apache Weekly News Round-ups, and has
committed to publish future newsletters on a weekly basis. Over this past
week, four new contributors (not yet Committers) have expressed interest in
working with Sally in this area. This includes two individuals who offered to
assist after participating in Media & Analyst Training.


IX. Events liaison: ApacheCon North America concluded 48 hours ago. Our
contributions, from the ASF booth to 20th Anniversary promotions to “Trillions
and Trillions Served” documentary filming and “Community Over Code. Code Over
Community” PMC photoshoots, have been successfully executed and well received.
The “Trillions” documentary crew will continue filming their interviews with
ASF co-founders and individual community members at ApacheCon Berlin in 5
weeks. Sally continues to participate in weekly planning calls with ApacheCon
Europe event lead Myrle Krantz and conference producers newthinking/Plain
Schwarz. Additional promotions for the Berlin event are being posted on
Feathercast, with transcripts published on
https://blogs.apache.org/conferences/ . Sally is also coordinating the ASF’s
presence at the Cumbre de Contribuidores de Open Source Software (CCOSS) event
in Guadalajara (14-15 September), and Huawei Direct in Shanghai (18-20
September). Due to scheduling, the training for ASF Sponsors, Members, and
PMCs  on how to host an "Apache@" event at corporate locations will be held at
as a virtual training session at a later date.

X. Newswire accounts: our pre-paid press release package with GlobeNewswire is
active and running through 2021.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
The Infrastructure team met with the community during ApacheCon NA in
Las Vegas. This provided a good chance for the team/community to meet
each other, and to address specific queries from the community.

Launched new .asf.yaml self-service features[1], with some immediate
pickup and all-around happiness.

We lost a disk at one of our data centers, affecting the git.apache.org
service. We have decided to deprecate much of that host's functionality,
and are curretly rebuilding svn-to-github mirrors, with some limits.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Migrate our Ubuntu 14.04 systems up to 18.04 and puppet6.
- Complete the svn-master migration.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Our Ubuntu-based replacement of "hermes" (our primary MTA) is
  looking great. But we still need many months to perform an orderly
  transfer and rebuild of the service. This has been in-process for
  very many years.

General Activity
================
- Stood up haproxy to spread outbound SMTP across several IPs, in
  order to "warm them up". This will assist with future failovers and
  system migrations.
- New backup system has been implemented, as a default for all
  puppetized systems. The several outliers already have backups, and
  others required various levels of maual work. This new work is to
  simplify and ensure future backups-by-default.
- Documentation consolidation, and revamp.
- Continued migration to 18.04/p6. We are focusing on the oldest 1404
  systems for migration, but will upgrade any system once it comes up.
- Major work across the Jenkins nodes, with updates and new packages.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon North America

Last week we held ApacheCon North America in Las Vegas. The final numbers are
not yet ready, but we can report that we had 700+ registered, and, last I
heard, around 640 signed in on-site.

All comments I have heard so far have been overwhelmingly positive, with the
exception of some complaints about the venue itself:

* Rooms were spread very widely, and some of them were hard to get to for
  anyone with reduced mobility

* Session rooms were *very* cold - although this is not unusual for North
  American venues.

Next month's report will have more detailed statistics and financial
information.

Session recordings have been uploaded to https://feathercast.apache.org/ but
have not been publicized yet. Videos have been uploaded to
https://www.youtube.com/TheApacheFoundation but have not yet been published.
We will be publishing, and publicizing, this content, over the coming weeks,
but are now focusing primarily on ACEU promotion.


ApacheCon Europe, Berlin

As ACNA winds down, the decorations and especially the signing feather have
been posted to Berlin.  ACEU is our next big event.

ACEU ticket sales have seen an uptick, that is mainly related to speaker and
sponsor registrations.  We sent out the speaker package with speaker
registration codes this week.

With the hope of continuing to drive ticket sales, we are preparing to reach
out to the PMC's of the projects speakers are mentioning with a description of
the relevant talks.

We continue to search for ways to increase sponsorship levels of ACEU
including face-to-face conversations with existing sponsors at ACNA in Las
Vegas.

We are moving on to the next level of finer detailed planning for audience
movement and volunteer engagement at the venue.  Talk lists have already been
shared with TAC to support the creation of a TAC working plan.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Events
======

ApacheCon NA 2019 (Las Vegas)
-----------------------------

Leading up to the event, flights were finalised, and a top up amount was
provided on the TAC card to the Travel Agent to secure and book the remaining
flights. A successful applicant had their Visa rejected and so the flight was
not booked for this person.

At the event, we had a 'Welcome Dinner' for all TAC attendees and invited ASF
long time experts, Board Members, IPMC etc. As usual, this event went very
well, allowing the TAC folks to mix with the experienced ASFers and gain some
insights as to the inner workings etc. A couple of hours before this dinner
(held on the Sunday before ApacheCon started), we gathered with the TAC
attendees and went through the roles for the week, and divided out the tasks,
before handing out the subsistence monies to those that requested it in their
applications.

During the week TACers were tasked with mainly helping out the organisers by
introducing speakers, ensuring equipment was working and available etc. As we
have less TAC attend than we would have liked, and some days/times had 9 talks
or more at the same time, it made for a busy week for them.

After the event. At time of writing, TAC folks are still making their way
home, so sometime next week we'll be handing out post-ACNA surveys for them to
fill out, a way for us to see how well we did, where we could improve for next
time, how they enjoyed their time, how they handled the work expected of them
etc.

ApacheCon EU 2019 (Berlin)
--------------------------

Next month sees our second ApacheCon in as many months. All paperwork is in
place for our 17 successful applicants and we are ready to go!

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:

None

## Activity:

*** Project:  Survey revamp***

- Scoped final agreement to work with Bitergia
- Submitted contract for review to legal-private@

*** Project: UX Research on new contributors ***

- Scoped final agreement to work with Bitergia
- Submitted contract for review to legal-private@

*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***

Outreachy's goal is to support people from groups underrepresented in the
technology industry. Outreachy interns will work remotely with mentors on
projects ranging from programming, user experience, documentation,
illustration and graphic design, to data science. Outreachy interns will
receive stipends for developing said projects full-time for three months.


- We sent emails calling for mentors. [1]
- We created a blog post announcing Outreachy at ASF and updated it to include
  new information. [2]
- To create a friction log template, we opened a discussion in the dev@
  mailing list and asked the community for their ideas and input regarding
  what a friction log should contain, how could we track these
  characteristics/conditions and their experiences with it. [3]
- We offered a workshop to scope projects and answer questions to potential
  mentors. [4]
- Three projects have been submitted but only two were approved. We are
  waiting for some answers from Outreachy regarding the rejected project. [5]
- Currently we have 4 mentors approved.
- We started to use Confluence meeting notes templates to track our meetings.
  [6]
- We decided to migrate previous meeting minutes to Confluence to create a
  report that includes all action items, to make the process more transparent.

More detailed reports on this work can be found on their update minutes[7].

*** Operations ***

*** Community Highlights ***

1. The V.P. of diversity and inclusion presented the Foundations strategy for
   D&I at ApacheCon during a 50min session at ApacheCon.

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're down 2 to 20, unresolved
issues this month.

Our work with Eclipse foundation continues mainly around formalizing our
current relationship, but also discovery of prior ASF participation in JSR
Expert Group. See VP Jakarta report for more details.

Senior Vice President, Intellectual Property at one of the corporate
contributors to a major ASF project reached out for clarifications on early
(pre 2009) contributions to a few ASF projects and we've provided required
 guidance.

At ApacheCON in Las Vegas we met with a few ASF sponsors during a scheduled
luncheon and answered their questions around IP management and licensing
policies within ASF. We also discussed potential opportunities and
challenges for new projects coming into the incubator.

Attachment 12: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [John Kinsella]

After too long a period of silence (emailed last report April 2019[1] - just
noticed it doesn’t seem to have made it to whimsy), renewing push to get Data
Privacy up and running.

Structure for data-privacy has been set up - mailing lists[2][3], jira
group[4], and wiki[5] created.

Since last board report, have talked with others with previous
experience/thoughts on ASF data privacy topics. Short-term goal is to start
outlining topics to address and areas of help needed on the wiki, then send
call for volunteers to members@a.o.

Goal right now is to start to get volunteers involved, come up with list of
priorities, and start being more useful to requests from projects.

I've been reviewing report formats from others, will be adding a bit more
structure to this in coming months, along with several calendar reminders.
Also planning a chat room for more interactive and regularly scheduled
discussions to continue to drive movement.

Stats for August, 2019:
 * 1 still open Jira ticket (Intention is to move LEGAL-383 to PRIVACY)
 * 0 closed issues

Attachment 13: Report from the VP of Jakarta EE Relations  [Mark Struberg]

This is a report about the current status of the Eclipse JakarteEE relations.

I will reference the following documents in the further reading:

* Eclipse Foundation Specification License (EFSL [1])
* Eclipse Foundation TCK License (EFTL [2])
* Eclipse Foundation Specification Process (EFSP [3])

# Overview

The JakartaEE project hosts various specifications which are derived from
JavaEE JSRs. Each of them consists of 4 different parts.

1.) the APIs (e.g. JPA - Jakarta Persistence API)
2.) the Reference Implementation (RI, e.g. Eclipse EclipseLink)
3.) the TCKs (previously one big monolithic TCK with only a few specs having
their own separated ones)
4.) the spec documentation PDFs


# Ad 1 and 2 - APIs and RIs

The APIs owned by Oracle have been re-licensed to EPLv2 and donated to the
Eclipse Foundation. Other APIs - mostly owned by IBM and RedHat - have been
ALv2 ever since and afaik have also been donated to the EF. Reference
Implementations have to be licensed under an 'Open Source Lincense' as defined
by the EFSP. Which are EPLv2 or ALv2.

Future development of spec APIs will happen under either EPLv2 or ALv2
(based on what each specification decides). This is legally perfectly fine for
 us to both contribute to and consume under (at worst) CatB [4].


# Ad 3 & 4 - TCKs and Specification Documents

Some TCKs are ALv2: JBatch, CDI, Bean Validation. Most others got donated from
Oracle to the Eclipse Foundation and are now licensed under EPLv2. I want to
take this opportunity to say thanks to Oracle for this gracious move!

There is one little complicated detail though. When a final specification gets
ratified it will be published and distributed under the EFSL resp EFTL. This
procedure is defined in the EFSP. Note that neither the EFSL nor EFTL are OSI
licensed and never will be due to not allowing any modifications which makes
them not an OSS license.

The Specification Document for the Final Specification must be distributed as
read-only text under the Eclipse Foundation Specification License. The
Ratified TCK in composite must be distributed under the Eclipse Foundation
Technology Compatibility Kit License.

This could legally be achieved via either sub-licensing or re-licensing. The
Eclipse ECA [5] explicitly talks about sublicensing. That means we would be
fine to contribute to and consume TCKs and Specs _under work_ as well.
The IP flow is that contributions to the TCK and Spec Documents are performed
under ALv2 or EPLv2. And we can also consume those bits. The final versions
though are ratified and bundled under very restrictive non-OSS licenses which
you only get if one passes the TCK and are certified.

There is also an Eclipse Foundation IP Policy [6] to which the EFSP refers to.
It only applies to Specification Reviews. It contains some patent grant
clauses which need to be further evaluated. In a first review they look
roughly equivalent to the patent grant we have in ALv2. But this needs some
more legal review. Interestingly this only becomes effective during the review
and not during contributing. But the review and voting on the specs is only a
small group of people/companies and not all contributors.

# Other business

The Eclipse Foundation reached out to us to help them collect IP for existing
specification documents. Oracle transferred their right to the EF as far as
they did hold them. They of course could only transfer IP they own themselves.
Whether there is anything uncovered is an open question. The EF now reached
out to us to also grant them rights for parts some ASF committers provided 'on
behalf of the ASF'. Our current legal conclusio is that the ASF itself cannot
do this but we will help to identify the individuals in question.

# Summary

* The ASF (or it's individuals) can both consume from and contribute to APIs
  and Reference Implementations.
* The ASF can both consume from and contribute to TCKs and Spec Documents
  _under development_.
* Consuming the final ratified EFSL and EFTCK licensed specs and TCKs are out
  of scope for the ASF without restricting us in any way.
* The patent handling for contributors needs another review.

dev@ mailing list activity saw an increase in the last quarter. 
This did not relate to much in the way of development but 
involved discussion between new community members which is 
great. There are no current epic development tasks planned 
for Any23 so it might be time to kick that conversation off 
on our mailing list.

Planning for next release has begun and we hope to ship version 0.22.0 
before the year ends.

## Community Health:
We have experienced a small surge in activity thanks to new developers
joining. The following metrics corroborate this increase in engagement:

9 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (900% increase)
7 PRs closed of GitHub, past quarter (700% increase)
6 commits in the past quarter (600% increase)
reviews@aurora.apache.org had a 1300% increase in traffic in the
past quarter (70 emails compared to 5)

We hope the project is able to sustain this level of engagement
as well as increasing the number of participants who are helping to maintain
this project.

Outside of a few members, responsiveness on the mailing list has decreased.
We hope to re-engage folks as they see more activity happening on the project.

software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
According to SVN, Apache Axis was created on 2001-01-19 (18 years ago).

There are currently 63 committers and PMC members in this project, a vote in
2010 made all committers automatically PMC members.

## Activity

- Axis2 Java 1.7.9 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Axis2 Java 1.8 (development)

- Axis2 C 1.7 (development)

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained.

Most of our users are using legacy SOAP services so we are lacking new
committers. We expect to grow our community by better docs on Axis2 with JSON
and REST.

The most significant event this past quarter was receiving and applying
patches for both Axis 1.x and Axis2 concerning JDK 11 support. See AXIS-2929
and AXIS2-5935.

Axis2 C PMC member Bill Blough has continued his progress via commits and Jira
issues this past quarter. The communication continues to be good.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.
## Releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

## Description:
Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as
Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Currently, Bahir provides extensions to
multiple distributed analytic platforms, extending their reach with a
diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data sources.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Bahir was founded 2016-05-17 (3 years ago)
There are currently 40 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Prashant Sharma on 2018-10-19.

## Project Activity:
Apache Bahir community continues to see a flow of contributions 
enhancing the existing extensions for both Apache Spark and 
Apache Flink.

The project has produced release candidates for 
Apache Bahir 2.3.4 and 2.4.0 based on respective releases of
Apache Spark.

There is a need to produce a new release of the Flink extensions
and this has been discussed on the project mailing list but the 
community have not started work on it yet.

## Community Health:
Activity levels on mailing lists and GitHub are normal for both Apache Spark
and Apache Flink extensions.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Kenneth Knowles]

## Description:
 - Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming
   data processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed
   execution engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to
   different technologies and user communities.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

Beam Summit NA occurred at ApacheCon NA. About 80 people attending 20 talks in
2 rooms over 2 days, plus a day-long Beam introductory workshop. Good
cross-pollination of talks and audience: 4 Beam related talks on other tracks;
2 non-Beam talks by Beam Summit organizers on community track; Beam Summit
attendees and speakers checked out the other tracks; other ApacheCon attendees
lured into Beam Summit :-)

Many large contributions:
 - A translator from Google's recently open sourced ZetaSQL dialect into
   Apache Calcite's relational algebra. This enables ZetaSQL as a choice of
   dialect for using Beam SQL.
 - An integration with ZetaSketch HyperLogLog algorithm, recently open sourced
   as well.
 - A new sort-merge join algorithm from Spotify. Still under discussion and
   review.

Technically, there is a noticeable trend into schema-aware data processing,
expanding from Beam SQL to other proposals like dataframe-style APIs and
columnar processing using Apache Arrow.

A SQL collaboration: PMC from Flink, Beam, and Calcite, together with
researchers from Oakridge National Lab that sit on the ISO SQL committee,
wrote a proposal for what streaming SQL should look like across their projects
and the industry as a whole, to influence streaming SQL standardization.
Presented to SIGMOD industry track and later at ApacheCon (and other venues).

Other dev list discussions of interest, due to community relevance or
integrations with other Apache projects:
 - A new integration - Ananas Analytics Desktop, a GUI for building pipelines.
   Built without Beam's involvement; a sign of relevance and accessibility.
   [0]
 - How to support users best, across user@, StackOverflow, and Slack: Covered
   tradeoffs between synchronous vs asynchonous, mostly. Did not get into
   ASF-hosted vs third party, nor was licensing of code snippets discussed.
   [1]
 - Which Flink versions to support and how best to support multiple versions.
   [2]
 - One Google Summer of Code project wrapped up, on optimized inserts to
   BigQuery. [3]
 - We have improved issue triage significantly. We added a default Jira status
   of "Needs Triage" to make sure all bugs get some attention from a
   knowledgeable community member. I asked for help triaging, and the
   community collaboratively kept untriaged issues steadily under 100, for the
   first time in a long time. [4]
 - Protocol for managing Beam's social media presence were discussed more, and
   we have a system in place (after long discussion) where the community can
   contribute easily and the PMC can review and approve. [5]
 - Improvements to our release process of vendored artifacts and documentation
   of it. [6]

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Youngwoo Kim]

## Description:
Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Apache 
Hadoop ecosystem. The primary goal of Bigtop is to build a community around the 
packaging and interoperability testing of Hadoop-related projects. This 
includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, runtime, upgrade, 
etc...) developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather 
than individual projects. In short we strive to be for Hadoop what Debian is to 
Linux.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Bigtop was founded 2012-09-19 (7 years ago)
There are currently 37 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jun He on 2018-11-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jun He on 2018-02-23.

## Project Activity:
Software development activity:
 - We released the 1.4.0 version on 2019-06-15.
 - We are discussing to making release 1.x for existing users and reshaping of 
 current project for the future release.

Meetups and Conferences:
 - Community members(including PMC members) will attend ApacheCon NA 2019.
 - Jay Vyas will give a talk on prototype of modern big data and analytics 
 architecture and future direction of Apache Bigtop.

## Community Health:
After 1.4.0 release, activity of development is decreasing but overall 
community health is good. We have been discussing maintenance release and 
future release for the Cloud Native deployments.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matthew Jason Benson]

## Description:
The mission of BVal is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Apache BVal: JSR-303 Bean Validation Implementation and Extensions

## Issues:
No issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache BVal was founded 2012-02-14 (8 years ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:7.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Thomas Andraschko on 2019-05-15.
- No new committers. Last addition was Thomas Andraschko on 2019-05-16.

## Project Activity:
Apache BVal 2.0.3 was released on 2019-08-19. A maintenance release
along the 1.1.x branch of activity is planned for the near future.

## Community Health:
With last quarter's addition of a new volunteer to the PMC and
committer roster, our capacity to keep up with maintenance tasks has
increased. Our mailing list traffic is low; as noted in the past
our usual model is frenzied activity for a spec-compliant release,
then the maintenance cycle, much like the proverbial "periods of
boredom punctuated by periods of terror" commonly attributed to war.
Our JIRA activity also reflects this: two issues opened and closed
with patches provided, accepted, and applied during the quarter.
Another issue opened to request a release of those changes on a
dormant line of development (the aforementioned 1.1.3 release).

Attachment P: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Paul Angus]

## Description:
Apache CloudStack (ACS) is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud
orchestration platform. ACS manages many types of hypervisors, storage and
networking devices.

## Issues:
- Mark Thomas is progressing the renewal of the CloudStack trademark
  registration
- We received notification from ‘Read The Docs’ that they would be adding
  ‘paid for’ advertising to all pages of rendered documentation. Upon
  consultation with the Board, we opted out of this advertising. nb: ASF will
  work to develop a reciprocal relationship with Read The Docs to honourably
  use Read The Docs for ‘free’

## Activity:
- The Apache CloudStack project received a Newsweek award for ‘Best Business
  Tools 2019’ in the category ‘Cloud’
- PMC has discussed a number of committers/contributors for ‘promotion’ to
  committership or PMC, which resulted in 5 new PMC members
- Many of the project’s members have been working to prepare for the
  CloudStack Collaboration Conference within ApacheCon. We had 22
  presentations covering new features in-development or recently completed as
  well as sessions on how to use specific features in CloudStack and features
  at a PoC stage.
- The project has benefited from the very recent ‘announcement’ that Apple
  uses CloudStack to underpin many of its services. We hope that will bring a
  bump in interest in the project, which we will endeavour to convert into
  contributors
- The community discussed dropping IRC as an ‘advertised’ communication
  channel as ‘no one’ hangs out there any more.
- As the community has just released a major version and has just had a large
  conference, it is now ‘getting back to business’.

## Health report:
- Apropos of the activity report; the project is healthy

## PMC changes:
- Currently 51
- PMC members added since the last report:

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Jesse MacFadyen]

## Status report for the Apache Cordova project - September 2019

## Description:

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

cordova-electron@1.1.1 was the only platform release in this quarter.
cordova-android@8.1.0 is being voted on currently, and will be released
shortly. We will also be making some large changes to iOS as Apple has made it
clear that they may soon reject app submissions for apps using deprecated
APIs.  Discussions are happening currently so we can find the best solution
that does not break existing applications/plugins and meets Apple's
requirements.


## Health report:

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green -
failures are usually due to external service issues that do device testing.
Our nightly builds remain extremely stable.

We are still working to resolve all existing issues in JIRA while also
maintaining all the new issues and pull requests in Github.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Olaf Krüger]

## Description:
Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Flex runtimes
The available, free to use Flex runtimes are the Adobe Flash Player and Adobe
AIR. In 2017, Adobe already announced the EOL of the Flash Player for the end
of 2020. Since June 2019, Harman has undertaken AIR platform support and
feature development. Harman provides AIR on a commercial basis, with a free
version available for certain eligible individuals/companies. [1] Users can
subscribe to the Harman mailing list in order to get the latest AIR related
news.

## Activity:
Activity on the mailing lists among the users decreased by about an average of
50% the previous three months. It's obvious that the upcoming EOL of the
FlashPlayer has an impact on Flex and its user base. Some folks migrate to AIR
and stick with Flex, others porting their apps to other technologies.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

## Description:

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and
libraries for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam, Calcite,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

## Issues:

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

## Membership Data:

PMC members added since the last board report:
  - Jincheng Sun joined the PMC on June 24th, 2019
  - Kurt Young joined the PMC on July 23rd, 2019
  - Kostas Kloudas joined the PMC on August 31st, 2019

Committers added since the last board report:
  - Rong Rong was added as committer on July 15th, 2019
  - Becket Qin was added as committer on July 18th, 2019
  - Zhijiang Wang was added as committer on July 22nd, 2019

The newest committer is Zili Chen, joined on September 12th, 2019.

Flink currently has 51 committers and 24 PMC members.

## Releases

The following releases were made since the last board report:

  - 1.8.1 was released on July 7th, 2019.
  - 1.8.2 was released on September 11th, 2019
  - 1.9.0 was released on August 22nd, 2019.
  - shaded-8.0 was released on August 8th, 2019.

## Project Activity:

  - The community is in a strong growth phase. The past quarter saw the
    addition of six new committers and three new PMC members to help support
    the community growth.

  - The Flink community passed its first set of bylaws to more formally define
    how decisions are made for various types of contributions. The community
    felt that with growing size of active committer base and with the
    different backgrounds and experiences of the committers, bylaws will be
    helpful to keep the project organized.

  - Parts of the bylaws discussion resulted also in reinforcing the process
    for new features (FLIPs - Flink Improvement Proposals), which resulted in
    a big number of new proposals and high activity on their discussion
    threads.

  - Also for smaller contributions, the community is pushing more for early
    discussions and checking whether there is capacity among committer to
    shepherd proposed changes.

  - The community is periodically summing up the ongoing development threads
    on the roadmap page: https://flink.apache.org/roadmap.html

  - The community started working on the Flink 1.10 release. The release will
    continue many of the threads started for 1.9, like the Table API, SQL
    engine, integration with Hive, support for Python. Other threads include,
    for example, a new streaming state backend, sources, as well as making
    configuration and resource management simpler.

  - Flink Forward Berlin will be on October 7-9. The program is online:
    https://europe-2019.flink-forward.org/speakers Apache committers can
    contact the organizers for a free pass.

## Community Health:

Mailing lists continue to be very active:
  - user@f.a.o (1767 mails/quarter)
  - user-zh@f.a.o (714 mails/quarter)
  - dev@f.a.o (3543 mails/quarter)

The dev mailing list saw a big increase in activity due to feature and design
discussions for the 1.10 release and the reinforced community processes.

The user-zh mailing list seems to be building momentum as well and more
than doubled in the last quarter.

JIRA continues to be active as well, 1212 JIRA tickets created, 910 JIRA
tickets resolved in the last 3 months.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Guacamole Project  [Mike Jumper]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Guacamole is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to providing performant, browser-based remote access

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Guacamole was founded 2017-11-14 (2 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carl Harris on 2017-11-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Joel Best on 2019-01-30.

## Project Activity:
Project activity is centered around finalizing the outstanding tasks blocking
release of 1.1.0. The main obstacle to releasing 1.1.0 is still GUACAMOLE-249,
as noted in last quarter's report. Significant progress has been made outside
of that issue, as most other issues within 1.1.0 scope have been resolved over
the course of the last quarter.

## Community Health:
The community continues to be involved and healthy. Overall commit activity
has increased, reflecting the accelerating effort to release 1.1.0. The number
of code contributors and pull requests opened/closed has also almost doubled
relative to last quarter.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server. Gump's intention
isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that makes people look
beyond their project's boundaries and helps the projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version control
systems. The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well as non-ASF
projects and their dependencies. It started in the Java part of the foundation
but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and XMLUnit.NET.

# Summary

Some infrastructure activity, but really no changes compared to the last
quarter.

# Releases

Gump has never done any releases. One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the time
following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

# Activity

Our migration to Confluence is complete and we've abandoned our Moin wiki
instance. Around at the same time Mark and the Infra team set up a new VM for
Gump which has become our workhorse by now.

The Tomcat and Forrest communities are still using Gump actively.

# Changes to the Roster

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure the ASF
installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark Thomas join
in November 2014.

2.3.6 was released on 2019-08-22.
2.3.5 was released on 2019-05-14.

## Community Health:
Overall community is healthy. Number of commits went down slightly (!7%) but
number of distinct committers were up (3%). Also activity on github has
increased this quarter. These metrics indicates our contributors and
committers are engaged in community. Also, we saw increase in mailing list
activity in user list this quarter which is encouraging.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for September 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/September2019

There are presently 48 podlings incubating. In August, podlings executed 
9 distinct releases. We added three new IPMC members and no IPMC members 
retired.

We have two new podlings this month DolphinScheduler and MesaTEE. There have
been a couple of ongoing enquires about new projects, and some proposals are
being worked on. A couple of podlings are heading towards graduation in the
next few months. Druid was up for graduation last month but withdrew as
there's a trademark issue with its name.

Several podlings Amaterasu, Tamaya and Tephra didn't submit a report and
have been asked to do so next month. Tamaya has now failed to report twice
in a row.

Amaterasu has failed to report three times in a row. It looks like the 
PPMC is missing and there's little or no activity on the list. One final 
chance will be given to the project to explain what it status it and how it 
hopes to graduate before it is asked to retire.

Omid and ShardingSphere submitted insufficient reports and will be
asked to report next month.

A few mentors have been added and removed in various projects.

There were 3 IP clearances.

The incubator web site menu was reorganized to group similar content 
together, and further work was done on simplifying the language used on the 
incubator policy page. A few other pages were also improved.

The new disclaimer policy accepted by the board last month has received 
good feedback, and we've had a podling already make a release with it. The 
board asked for some updated documentation on the new disclaimer, and that 
was undertaken.

Some podlings are still struggling to get 3 +1 votes on their release by 
mentors and other IPMC votes are needed to make releases. However, those 
votes seem to be happing quite quickly with several IPMC members checking 
releases.
 
A new mentor guidance document is n the process of being created, so far 
not many mentors have contributed to this. Given the many years of 
experience over many mentors, it would be nice to see mentors contribute to 
this.  This document would help future mentors and podling deal with 
everyday situations that come up that they may be unsure of how to deal 
with.

The IPMC consider dropping that ASF member can join just back asking. 
Looking at mentor it more than that mentors join this way go missing, other 
than those who are voted it. Some IPMC member didn't think this was a good 
idea, so the policy stands.

There was a long discussion on the requirement of IPMC vote on podling 
release which included several suggested changes to policy and new ideas. 
Consensus was not able to be reached on any changes, and the discussion has 
stalled. The main issue being that PMC votes are needed on releases and 
some IPMC members want to do away with IPMC votes on releases altogether.
A new  project was suggested as an experiment to try this out (exact details
still to be worked out), but so far that has not happened. It was even
suggested by a couple of IPMC members that a new incubator project be made.

It may be best to wait until we see the impact of the work in progress
disclaimer before revisiting the IPMC vote situation.

There will be a Podling's Shark Tank at the upcoming ApacheCON North 
America and server talks on incubating subjects and projects.

ECharts is showing slow progress and thought they were ready to graduate
when they were not. A face to face meeting with several experienced IPMC
members has been organized at ApacheCon to get them back on the right track.

There was a discussion on the private on some podlings that probably
should be retired.

  1. Come up with a new name for DLab
  2. Extend the amount of committers. The plan here is to participate in
  a number of conferences, starting with ApacheConf in Berlin on October 23,
  EPAM SEC conference in Gansk on SolutionsHub area
  3. After release 2.2 is made, the team will have to do major refactoring
  of the code, updating of product documentation, which might potentially
  slow down the process of releasing version 2.3

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No issues.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  A new committer is added:
  - Adams Disturber (Andrii Dumych)
  Also awaiting for committer Mykola Bodnar, pending account creation. ICLA
  files are signed off and submitted, waiting for Apache ID to be created.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Team is actively working on release 2.2 features.
  There will be many new features and conceptual changes introduced in
  upcoming release. We are introducing the concept of projects within DLab,
  which will allow to control permissions for groups of DLab users,
  improve collaboration capabilities.
  Major improvements will be made in terms of GCP platform deployment.
  GCP will support the majority of the features, currently available in
  DLab for AWS and Azure Clouds.
  One of the conceptual features implemented is the ability to provision
  DLab's self-service noe in k8s and being able to integrate with many
  identity providers, supporting OAuth2 and SAML2.0 via Keycloak.

## IoTDB

  IoTDB is a data store for managing large amounts of time series data such 
  as timestamped data from IoT sensors in industrial applications.

  IoTDB has been incubating since 2018-11-18.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Make the community (both the contributors and committers/PPMCs) 
  more diverse  and learn to discuss things on the mailing list.
  2. More committers should know how to release a version.
  3. Write more documentation to help new contributors. 

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Some new contributors joined the community.  E.g., PR#339 comes 
  from a new contributor and it is really an interesting feature.
  2. Some contributors (who are not committers yet) are more active 
  than before. E.g., Boris Zhu and Jack Tsai.
  3. More users began to report their issues. E.g.,  issue #171, #184 
  and #186.

  As all the above contributions and contributors are not from the 
  institutions/companies where initial committers are, we think it is a 
  good signal that indicates more guys noticing the community.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. IoTDB releases its first Apache version: v0.8.0 !
  2. IoTDB is more stable and the performance is far better than 
  before. However, the version is incompatible with previous version (which 
  are released before IoTDB is denoted to ASF).
  3. In v0.8.0, many issues are resolved (see release notes: 
  http://iotdb.apache.org/#/Materials/Release%20Notes)

## Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together
on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both
Hadoop and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Builds Apache Myriad releases regularly
  2. Attract more users and contributors. Community growing.
  3. Attract new mentors for helping the project towards the Apache Way.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  We need new mentors, we have only one active mentor right now.
  We have to increase the community and we have to increase the number
  of mentors too in order to help us to address the Apache way with solid 
  foundations.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have four active committers (PPMCs) right now. A new committer since 
  the last report.
  This is a small increment from the community growing point of view, but 
  it  helps regarding the minimal amount of PPMCs for achieving a release cycle
  with regularity.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The most important thing is the activity of creating new releases in a
  regular way. The Apache resources (project page, documentation page, …)
  are maintained and enhanced with new content. Taking into account the 
  effort of rebooting the
  project (more than two years orphaned), the project is slowly addressing 
  the right way, and
  we consider the project is successfully rebooted right now. This state 
  allow us working towards
  attract new users and contributors in our humble opinion.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  We have only two mentors right now. One of the is for ever missing, 
  and the other is ready for help when the project needs. So we have only 
  one active mentor. This is an issue to address with the help of IPMC.

  3. Expanding unit tests

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Not much to report, progress is slow-paced as usual. This isn't to say 
  that the project is dormant or in danger of retirement, just that the pace
  is to be considered more casual. There is oversight, and important issues are
  being addressed in a timely manner.

## SDAP

SDAP is an integrated data analytic framework for Big Science problems.

SDAP has been incubating since 2017-10-22.

### Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make official SDAP (Incubating) Release
  2. Improve/create user guide documentation
  3. Improve committer participation

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are continuing to attract new committers.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  SDAP is still working towards its first release. Work towards a 
  repeatable build pipeline has been started.

  New functionality has been added to the Distributed Oceanographic Matchup 
  Service (DOMS) and Extensible Data Gateway Environment (EDGE) components 
  that allow for filtering in situ measurements by a standardized quality 
  flag.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  There are several deployments of SDAP actively being used and interest is 
  high. However, active participation from project members is low. A push 
  is needed to cross the t's and dot the i's in regards to meeting the 
  requirements Apache has for releasing software so that we can claim a 1.0 
  version of SDAP.

  2. Make several candidate releases
  3. Make a GA release to make user API stable

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been growing. We have more contributors during those 3 
  months.
  A UI project has already donate to ShardingSphere. We have finished the 
  second apache release on 24 August.
  The count of GitHub issues are 1800+, the count GitHub pull requests are 
  1000+.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We are merging new UI project to dev branch. The new features data mask 
  and distribute transaction have finished.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  Justin Mclean: The stats show don't mean much to people outside your
  project, please drop them from future reports and include commentary
  on how you project is growing instead.
  Given there lots of activity I would expect this report to have a lot more
  detail.
  A quick look at that stats, without explanation, suggests to me that this
  project is in trouble,. You have a large number of contributors, and
  outstanding pull request, but are not voting committers in.
  Please discuss with your mentors what the committer bar should be and
  what it means to be a committer.

  never submitted.

--------------------
## Spot

Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model
and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Revive community activity (Discussion in mailing lists, increase 
  frequency of commits)
  2. Create a new roadmap and release plan that will improve adoption.
  3. Make it easier to contribute to the project (e.g. documentation, 
  framework).

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Unfortunately there has not been much more community activity. However, 
  we are need of more committers as there are only a couple of active 
  committers at this time. This creates a bottleneck which makes it hard
  for the community to grow in interest.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  There are a series of PRs that have been evaluated for the SPOT-181 epic, 
  and Spot website branch (asf-site) that are in the process of being 
  merged. We  have enough votes to merge, and have put out a request to
  committers to review so they can be auto-merged if possible, otherwise we
  will just manually merge them via cli.  

  Once those are merged, we will work on the plan to merge SPOT-181 into 
  master so that the Open Data Model is consolidated into the main branch 
  of our code. 

  We're also working on re-focusing the project release roadmap. Our first 
  step will be to re-engage with the community to better understand 
  how/where Spot is being used today, what features/enhancements would benefit
  the community best, and which committers (existing and potential) are 
  interested in contributing to the roadmap and releases moving forward.

     Comments: While the project has previously been active, done several 
               releases, and recruited PPMC and committers, it is now very 
               quiet.
               For graduation it only needs a couple of maintenance releases
               of the remaining code-bases (or not include those in 
               graduation).
               I suggest the project use the next reporting period to 
               discuss retiring vs. graduation.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: I'm a little confused if you want to graduate or retire.

--------------------
## Toree

Toree provides applications with a mechanism to interactively and remotely
access Apache Spark.

Toree has been incubating since 2015-12-02.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Active community
  2. Increase active contributors

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Toree will have a talk at ApacheCon Las Vegas where we will
  talk about its overall status and current functionality as 
  well as try to attract more users and in particular contributors.

  After the release of Toree 0.3.0 the community slowed down,
  mostly due to Toree being somewhat stable and running on top
  of Spark, where the public APIs in use are also stable. 

  The community needs to work on a release that supports Apache
  Spark 2.4.x and Scala 2.12.

  Toree might be one of those low activity projects which have enough
  active PPMCs (see last ppmc voting thread), and we might
  start graduation talks based on these facts.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Very little activity on the last few months after the
  Toree 0.3.0 release, mostly around some compatibility
  issues with Spark 2.4.x and Scala 2.12.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Marcel Reutegger]

Apache Jackrabbit: Board Report September 2019
==============================================

## Description:
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming implementation
of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content repository is
 stable, largely feature complete and actively being maintained. Jackrabbit
 Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
 repository as a modern successor to the Apache Jackrabbit content repository.
 It is targeted for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and
 other demanding content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak
 does not implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it
 is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All maintenance
branches and the main development branch are continuously seeing moderate to
high activity.

We made our 8th feature release of Jackrabbit Oak (1.16) end of July.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of the work
going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly driven by
dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

The project stopped supporting Jackrabbit releases from the old
2.10 branch and encouraged users to upgrade to more recent stable versions
(https://s.apache.org/c2a1d).

Four new committers were added to the project and added to the PMC in the last
3 months. There is an increased interest in the filevault components, visible
in higher JIRA activity and mailing list discussions on that topic.

A hackathon planned for August was canceled because very few participants
registered and no proposals were submitted for the hackathon
(https://s.apache.org/i8be9).

## Health report:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all mailing
lists reflecting the activity of the respective component.

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user lists as
well as on the various JIRA issues.

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the JIRA issues
and the desire of the individual contributors to bring features and
improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 56 PMC members.
 - 4 new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Cassandra Targett]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core
- PyLucene is a Python extension for accessing Lucene

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Lucene was founded 2005-01-18 (15 years ago)
There are currently 79 committers and 53 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Kevin Risden was added to the PMC on 2019-06-25
- Munendra S N was added as committer on 2019-06-19
- One committer nomination vote is in progress.

## Project Activity:
We have released Lucene and Solr 8.2 since the last report.

PyLucene 8.1.1 was released on September 11th, 2019.

With 8.2, we added Estonian language support in Lucene and Solr. Lucene added
a monitor subproject (formerly known as Luwak, donated to the project) which
allows monitoring an input stream of documents for matches to a stored query.
Solr also added OpenTracing support for distributed trace performance
monitoring.

On the project maintenance front, we have several changes. First, we migrated
two MoinMoin wikis to Confluence, and are discussing what to do with the old
content (which may be outdated) in the new environment. We also introduced two
new mailing lists to take some traffic from our main development list,
discussed in more detail below.

We are working to change our entire build system, currently based on Ant, to
use Gradle, which we hope to complete soon. This is a herculean effort, but is
making progress.

Two CVEs were announced last period and the project is actively responding to
incoming vulnerability reports.

## Community Health:
Community health is very strong. Our two main user lists, java-user and
solr-user, continue to be widely used.

Due to the very high volume in our main developer-focused list (8920 mails
last quarter), we have instituted two new lists: issues@lucene.a.o for Jira,
Github, and Gitbox notifications and builds@lucene.a.o for Jenkins build
notifications. We hope this will allow developer conversations to not get lost
in the flood of automated notifications.

Our Jira issue activity and code contributions are also very strong. 305
issues were created and 224 were closed, decreases of 14% and 21%
respectively. The project had 1646 commits (+5%) from 76 contributors (+20%)
in the last quarter.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

## Description:
The mission of Mesos is the creation and maintenance of software related to a 
cluster manager that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across 
distributed applications

## Issues:
The current PMC chair (Benjamin Hindman) has stepped down. Vinod Kone
(vinodkone@apache.org) has been nominated as the new PMC chair and received 14
+1 votes (and no -1 or 0 votes) on the private@mesos.apache.org email thread
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/45071dfda2308f916bb15d7f7376e9b88786af16ae56cf400ed8fa36@%3Cprivate.mesos.apache.org%3E
We would request the board to approve the appointment of the new chair.

A PMC roll call was also conducted, per the board feedback, and it garnered
positive response (17 +1 votes) from the PMC.
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/80ecc1c2b72dd17b9c4d9e80f4889f11ec7d08793f6f0501ec843783@%3Cprivate.mesos.apache.org%3E


## Membership Data:
Apache Mesos was founded 2013-06-18 (6 years ago) There are currently 48
committers and 48 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andrei Budnik on 2019-03-11.
- No new committers. Last addition was Andrei Budnik on 2019-03-06.

We have a new potential committer in the pipeline (Andrei Sekretenko) who will
likely be nominated in the next few months.

## Project Activity:
1.9.0 was released on 2019-09-05.
1.10 release is under active development.


## Community Health:
Rephrasing the response from the private email thread for posterity.

Mesosphere which employs significant number of Mesos committers have recently
rebranded itself to D2iQ, but there should be no cause to worry. The company
is still very much invested in the Mesos project as its DCOS platform (based
on Mesos) is still one of its major product lines.

There has been a significant downtick in JIRA and commit activity, but the
majority of it can be likely attributed to summer months and vacation. We
don't foresee such precipitous downtrend in commit activity to continue in the
next few quarters. That said, it is to be noted that with the rise of
kubernetes quite a bit of the developer/user interest has shifted from mesos
to kubernetes which contributes to the downtick.

All that said, there is still healthy development and user activity in the
project and the core committers are still very much active.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    In this period of reporting, 4 of tickets has been created and
    3 resolved, basically, we have corrected an issue of Ubuntu Dockerfile,
    and upgraded PMDK to stable version 1.6 in both Dockerfiles of Ubuntu 
    and CentOs, that upgrades introduced non-trivial changes on both Linux
    distributions. but it has not been verified on MacOS. 
    Regarding the GSoC, GSoC student has finially submitted the code
    implementation as PR #118 to our mirrored Mnemonic Github repos.
    We have reviewed the code and provided the feedbacks and suggestion.
    Overall, the GSoC student has successfully delivered the result to our 
    community. I also have filled the final report according to student's 
    progress and results

Recent releases:
- 4.6.0 was released on 2019-05-05.
- V2 2.0.11 was released on 2019-02-16.
- 4.5.0 was released on 2018-08-13.

We were informed that people from the community plan to do security 
contributions in the form of a code review.
In addition they will create related JIRA issues in case of any findings.

## Community Health:
Overall community health is good.
The V4 code line is on steady development also reflected in 
related discussions on mailing list and new created JIRA items.
We plan to release the next V4 version (4.7.0) this year.
The V2 code line had minor bugfix contributions as well as
open and new created JIRA items.
Over the last months there were more new JIRA issues created 
then in the last quarter (+50% created). 
We neither could keep up with this nor reach the performance 
of last quarter (-30% closed). 
Hence we closed less JIRA issues but we now know that we have 
enough in our pipeline for at least the next half year.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Imesha Sudasingha]

## Description:
 Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
 rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
 data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
 management, and data processing.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache OODT was founded 2010-11-17 (9 years ago) There are currently 46
committers and 45 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is

## Project Activity:
We have just completed 2 GSoC projects. One to improve OODT deployment with
docker and the other one was to implement a new UI for OODT OPSUI. Both were
completed successfully. However, there are few PRs still required to be merged
and some minor improvements requires to be made on top of GSoC contributions
for the new features to be usable. Those students will help us get through
this.

With those additions we are planning to release OODT 2.0. We have 1.9 release
on the backlog which is dev completed, but not yet properly tested. We intend
to finalize that as well.

- Last release was 1.2.5 on 2018-09-13.

- 7 code contributors in the past quarter (250% increase)
- 19 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (375% increase)

Overall development activity was very high compared to past quarters due to
the GSoC projects. We hope that we will be able to keep this momentum.

 specifications which are defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0), JSR-346
 (CDI-1.1 and CDI-1.2 MR) and JSR-365 (CDI-2.0).

 The OWB community also maintains  a small server as
 Apache Meecrowave subproject. Meecrowave bundles latest releases of
 the ASF projects Tocmat9 + OpenWebBeans + CXF + Johnzon + log4j2.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenWebBeans was founded 2009-12-16 (10 years ago)
There are currently 20 committers and 13 PMC members in this project.

- No new committers. Last addition was John D. Ament on 2017-10-09.

## Project Activity:
We regularly get contributions from rather unexpected places.
Like the Jetty and Tomcat teams provided great feedback for
integrating OWB into their servlet engines.
We are right now preparing for a 2.0.12 release with bugfixes.

## Community Health:
Contributions are alright. Very ok-ish for such a mature project.
Otoh it's hard to attract new committers because of the complexity
of the topic.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache OpenWhisk Project  [Dave Grove]

## Description:
The mission of Apache OpenWhisk is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a platform for building serverless applications with functions

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenWhisk was founded 2019-07-16 (2 months ago)
There are currently 42 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- Justin Halsall was added as committer on 2019-08-22

## Project Activity:
- The project has completed updating its website, development tooling, and its
  52 github repos and associated CI/CD jobs  to reflect its graduation to a
  top-level project. In the process, 17 github repos were identified as being
  inactive and were archived (made read-only).

- We made our first two non-incubating releases of OpenWhisk sub-components:
  - openwhisk-apigateway-0.11.0 was released on 2019-08-30.
  - openwhisk-client-js-3.20.0 was released on 2019-08-28.

- Development work was completed on a new "standalone" configuration of
  OpenWhisk  that will enable significantly easier installation and
  experimentation with the OpenWhisk programming model by end users. A major
  focus for the next month will be to make a new release of the core system
  component so we can then make the standalone OpenWhisk jar easily available
  to end users via Maven.

## Community Health:
Overall community health is good.

There are active technical discussions on the dev list around several new
features that are being designed.

Overall, significant code contributions are holding steady. Statistically,
there was a large spike in GitHub PR activity (64% increase in opened PRs, 99%
increase in closed PRs) in this period, but at least half of the spike can be
attributed to fairly mechanical changes to "de-incubate" the repos, website,
and release tooling.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Lee Whitcomb]

Description:
Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
Java platform.

Issues:
No board-level issues at this time.

Activity:
A little bit of development work continued toward the 2.1.0 release. But
essentially no other traffic on either dev or user mailing lists.

Essentially the same theme as the last report (July 2019) in that after
this release some serious decisions need to be made about the future of
the project. I have some hope that we might pick up some interest from
the mobile (Android) community, and/or something, but this seems unlikely
given the current climate.

Health Report:
Basically unchanged again this quarter, although there was some small amount
of development activity. Users remain quiet.

PMC changes:
 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Niclas Hedhman on Wed Jan 13 2016

Committer base changes:
 - Currently 9 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago

Releases:
 - Last release was 2.0.5 on Mon Jul 03 2017
 - Still some development on next major version (2.1.0).

Mailing list activity:
 - dev@pivot.apache.org:
    - 13 emails sent to list (6 in previous quarter)

 - user@pivot.apache.org:
    - No emails sent to list (1 in previous quarter)

JIRA activity:
 - Two (2) JIRA tickets opened in the last quarter.
 - One (1) JIRA ticket closed/resolved in the last quarter.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache PLC4X Project  [Christofer Dutz]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache PLC4X project is creating a set of libraries for 
communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a 
variety of protocols but with a shared API.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache PLC4X was founded 2019-04-17 (5 months ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Łukasz Dywicki was added to the PMC on 2019-07-28
- Matthias Milan Strljic was added to the PMC on 2019-06-03
- Łukasz Dywicki was added as committer on 2019-07-28
- Matthias Milan Strljic was added as committer on 2019-06-03

## Project Activity:

Releases:
- 0.4.0 was released on 2019-05-26.

Community Events:
- 24.05.2019, Frankfurt (GER), Meetup: Industrial IoT goes Open Source: Apache
PLC4X Talks & Party
- 18.06.2019, Erfurt (GER), Meetup: Industrie & IoT: Die perfekte Verbindung
mit Flexibus & Apache PLC4X
- 29.08.2019, Frankfurt (GER), Meetup: Apache PLC4X Community Meetup

We have been working hard on the generated drivers side and are currently
approaching the finishing line on this feature. In parallel we had some major
refactoring of internal components such as the Scraper. A lot of work has
also been put into adding new integration modules (Logstash) as well as
improving existing ones (Apache Kafka Connect)

Also did we have some major improvements and bugfixes resulting from feedback
from enterprise usage.

Also the project is currently discussing the introduction of a computational
layer (most probably in a sub-project) mainly based on a proposed
code-donation.

## Community Health:

Slack has been more adopted for initial discussions and gossip, therefore
discussions on the mailing list have concentrated on technical discussions.

Also two of the main contributors have lately been very consumed with
outer-project activities.

- dev@plc4x.apache.org currently has 63 subscriptions (increase of 10 since
last report)
- dev@plc4x.apache.org had a 50% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (373
emails compared to 732)
- issues@plc4x.apache.org had a 48% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
(75 emails compared to 143)
- 11 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-73% decrease)
- 7 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (-63% decrease)
- 380 commits in the past quarter (7% increase)
- 12 code contributors in the past quarter (-25% decrease)
- 9 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-65% decrease)
- 9 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-65% decrease)
- 26 contributors which have contributed code to the git repo
- 99 Github Stars (up by 18 since last report)
- 187 @ApachePLC4X Twitter account followers (up by 12 since last report)

Even if the mailing list numbers could give reason to feel otherwise, we think
our community is very healthy and growing at an increasing rate. More and
more potential committers are starting to work on different topics.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and 
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface 
to underlying platform-specific implementations. The primary goal is to provide 
an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if 
not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is 
built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work 
around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.

## Issues:
  No issues requiring board attention at this time.
  On a personal note, this reporter has just moved house and currently
  has no internet connection except a mobile one for the macbook,
  which is not normally used for development or ASF work.

## Membership Data:
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) was founded 2000-12-01 (19 years ago)
There are currently 67 committers and 41 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Evgeny Kotkov on 2017-09-12.
- No new committers. Last addition was Evgeny Kotkov on 2017-09-13.

## Project Activity:
Since the release of APR 1.7.0 in April, activity has been modest,
and focussed on bug fixing.  One new suggestion has been raised:
a prospective apr-tools subproject providing commandline tools based
on the library.  The suggestion met with mixed reaction.

## Community Health:
The community remains long-term stable.  We maintain the steady hand
of a mature community more than the vigour of a youthful one.

- No new committers. Last addition was Prabath Ariyarathna on 2017-02-10.

## Project Activity:
There was a slight increase in the activity in the project compared to the
last quarter. One of the major activity we did during this quarter is moving
the project source code into Github. Moving the source into Github make life
easier for new contributors to send contributions. We got several
contributions from three new contributors after we did this move. We are
planning to incorporate a build system (Travis or Jenkins) for Github pull
requests through Github webhooks to make the review process simpler.

## Community Health:
There is a slight drop in the mailing list activity compared to last quarter.
Activity in the Jira has also gone down. However, activity in Github and
commits has gone up. We see a positive trend in the project activity in the
latter half of the quarter after project source code is moved to Github. So
hopefully we will able to increase the project activity further in the next
quarter too. A new contributor has given a suggestion and submitted a pull
request to introduce a unit testing framework for Synapse configurations. It
is going to be a major feature addition that we couldn’t introduce so far. We
are looking forward to more new contributions with the positive trend created
with the Github move.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Thiago Henrique De Paula Figueiredo]

## Description:
The mission of Tapestry is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Component-based Java Web Application Framework

## Issues:
As Shane Curcuru correctly noted, the Tapestry team was very slow in
responding and fixing the 3 vulnerabilities we got last year and we apologize
for that. Fixes for two of them were released in Tapestry 5.4.4, published in
December 18th, 2018. The other issue was fixed in 5.4.5, released in September
7th, 2019. We promise to do better next time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Tapestry was founded 2006-02-14 (14 years ago)
There are currently 27 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 9:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Dmitry Gusev was added to the PMC on 2019-09-02
- No new committers. Last addition was Balázs Palcsó on 2019-01-17.

## Project Activity:
Tapestry 5.4.5 was released September 7th, 2019, and we're working towards the
next major release, 5.5.0.

## Community Health:
The Tapestry community has been shrinking over time for two main reasons:
* It was a niche project among other Java web frameworks since its beginning.
* The web development world has been steadily moving logic from server to
  client. In other words, more logic is being coded in JavaScript to run in
  the browser and less in the server, which is usually reduced to a set of
  REST endpoints. This way, Java web frameworks, or similar frameworks in any
  language, are losing users.

Commits have been sparse in the latest couple of years due to mainly three
factors:
* We don't have any committer which is paid to work full-time or even
  part-time on Tapestry as other projects do. We're all working on Tapestry on
  our free time, with the exception of a few cases of a company commissioning
  us to work on some small enhancements.
* The project reached a maturity level so it doesn't really have many features
  to be added.
* The codebase is very flexible, so many interesting things can and are done
  outside of the Tapestry project. Our PMC has decided, a long time ago, to
  not include more subprojects so it could focus on the Tapestry core. There's
  a number of open source projects built on Tapestry, some integrating it with
  other libraries and frameworks, and some provide components.

We may have a small community, but it's passionate.

We voted a new PMC member this month. There's one committer we may invite to
the PMC.

Stats:

* dev@tapestry.apache.org had a 284% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (50 emails compared to 13)
* users@tapestry.apache.org had a 76% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (88 emails compared to 50)
* 3 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (200% increase)
* 1 issue closed in JIRA, past quarter (-50% decrease)
* 10 commits in the past quarter (42% increase)
* 3 code contributors in the past quarter (50% increase) 1 PR opened on
  GitHub, past quarter (100% increase)

webscale SQL-on-Hadoop solutions to ensure transactional integrity and
operational workloads for Big Data applications.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring the attention of the board at this moment.

## Membership Data:

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Anoop Sharma on 2018-12-06.
- No new committers. Last addition was Prashanth Vasudev on 2018-11-13.

## Project Activity:
The latest release of the project was r2.3.0, which was released to the public
on 2019-02-27. The project continues to work on improving the products, and
working towards a new release. In the coming period the PMC will continue to
work on on boarding new committers.

## Community Health:
In the reporting quarter the project experienced significant decreases of
activities in the mailing lists, compared to the previous reporting quarter.

The decrease of activities seem to be anomalous, when the period is compared
to previous periods and the same period of the previous reporting year.
However, activities in the previous reporting period was quite high to get the
release out. The pull-request on GitHub and commit activities show similar
decreases.

At the moment, there is insufficient data to draw conclusion. Upcoming quarter
will prove whether this is the new reality.

The PMC regards the project, even though there are significant drops in
activities, still as healthy.

## Description:
Apache UIMA's mission: the creation and maintenance of open-source software
related to the analysis of unstructured data, guided by the UIMA Oasis
Standard. The software provides frameworks, tools and annotators, 
facilitating the analysis of unstructured content such as text, audio and

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Lou DeGenaro on 2016-05-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Viorel Morari on 2018-09-20.

## Releases:

2 releases in last quarter
uimaj-3.1.0 was released on 2019-08-15.
uimaj-2.10.4 was released on 2019-08-09.

## Board question from last report: druggeri:  
>> It's good to see new contributors. 
>> Any prospects for new PMC members... it's been a while.

We do not currently have any new PMC member prospects, 
but we keep our eye out for some.

Activity:
  After the release of uimaj, we started the work to migrate 
  that project from SVN to GIT.
  This has been a slow and difficult process,   
  due mainly to a couple of things  
  
  1) the documentation for GIT at apache 
     leaves several things undocumented, and also includes 
     apparently out-of-date information.
     See for example, 
     https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LEGAL/issues/LEGAL-478
     (read the comments) 
     
  2) simple modifications for one's project's GIT repository 
     such as renaming a branch, sometimes require filing of 
     INFRA Jira issues, and due to current load, 
     these appear in their KANBAN queue that's 100's of items long.
     See https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/INFRA, and
     choose the KANBAN view on the left-hand navigation.
     The result is that with the current INFRA staffing resources,
     it can take more than a week to get these acted on.
  
Community Health: The community continues to be moderately active; 
some new contributors doing patches.

Issues: No Board level issues at this time.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Unomi Project  [Serge Huber]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Unomi is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to providing a reference implementation of the OASIS Customer Data Platform 
specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical 
Committee

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Unomi was founded 2019-02-20 (6 months ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 6 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was David Griffon on 2019-02-20.
- No new committers. Last addition was Taybou on 2019-04-01.

## Project Activity:
Following the release of Apache Unomi 1.4.0 we are now working on improving
the documentation & website to make the project more visible and easier to get
started with. We are also looking at recruiting new PMC members (looking first
at existing committers that are not yet PMC members) to address the concerned
raised in the last board report feedback. We are also preparing two
presentations to be giving at ApacheCon NA to help with project visibility and
community growth.

We are of course also working on improving the project, mostly focusing on
requests coming from the community.

## Community Health:
We are currently focusing on growing the community by making sure that the
newcomer's experience is as smooth as possible. There is still some work to be
done but already we are seeing more activity on the user mailing list (88% 
increase). Because of this focus the dev mailing list activity has reduced a 
little bit (56%) but should pick back up as focus on development comes back 
after this effort. 

In general we are happy with the way the user community is evolving but we want
to see more growth so presenting the project at ApacheCon NA is an important
part of that effort as, as seen last year in the stats following ApacheCon NA 
2018, it really helps making the project a lot more visible.

Xerces-J

Xerces-J's Ant build has been updated so that it can now compile the source
using Java 9+. A few other fixes were made to address JIRA issues that had

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Allen Wittenauer]

## Description:
Apache Yetus is a collection of libraries and tools that enable contribution
and release processes for software projects

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Yetus was founded 2015-09-15 (4 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-12-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Akira Ajisaka on 2018-02-06.

## Project Activity:
We released 0.11.0! New in this release was adding more static linters for go,
markdown, and protobuf, emojis on Github posts, and support for Slack and
Cirrus CI.

So far this year, we've done really well on getting somewhat quarterly
releases out.  This has been a goal from day one.  Let's hope it continues!

* 0.11.0 was released on 2019-08-28.
* 0.10.0 was released on 2019-04-21.
* 0.9.0 was released on 2019-01-18.

Allen Wittenauer gave a talk on "Testing Contributions at Scale" at ACNA19
that featured the project.

## Community Health:
The past quarter has been relatively slow (with literally no traffic for a bit
over a month).  This reflects that the busy-ness of the primary contributor to
the project:

* 12 commits in the past quarter (-85% decrease)
* 3 code contributors in the past quarter (-50% decrease)
* 6 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (-70% decrease)
* 6 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-76% decrease)

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Paiva Junqueira]

## Description:
Apache ZooKeeper is a software system for distributed coordination. It enables
the implementation of a variety of primitives and mechanisms that are
critical for safety and liveness in distributed settings, e.g., 
distributed locks, master election, group membership, and configuration.

## Issues:
No specific issues to the board. 

## Membership Data:
Apache ZooKeeper was founded 2010-11-17 (9 years ago)
There are currently 26 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Andor Molnar on 2019-04-08.
- No new committers. Last addition was Enrico Olivelli on 2019-05-19.

## Project Activity:
No new releases during the reporting period.The latest releases are:

* 3.5.5 was released on 2019-05-20.
* 3.4.14 was released on 2019-04-01.
* 3.4.13 was released on 2018-07-16.

## Community Health:
The traffic on the dev list has dropped during the period due to us shifting
some of the notification traffic from dev to the notifications@ list. We had a
spike on the issues@ list due to bulk changes to Jira issues (version
updates). We also observed more traffic on the user list, which are general
questions about ZooKeeper. We did observe a good number of questions around
the internals (Zab and reconfiguration) of ZooKeeper.

* dev@zookeeper.apache.org had a 44% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
(1231 emails compared to 2169)
* issues@zookeeper.apache.org had a 3130% increase in traffic in the past
quarter (1260 emails compared to 39)
* notifications@zookeeper.apache.org had a 1276% increase in traffic in the
past quarter (1666 emails compared to 121)
* user@zookeeper.apache.org had a 183% increase in traffic in the past
quarter (184 emails compared to 65)
* 112 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (-1% decrease)
* 83 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (2% increase)
* 102 commits in the past quarter (-18% decrease)
* 32 code contributors in the past quarter (39% increase)
* 96 PRs opened on GitHub, past
quarter (-29% decrease)
* 102 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-7% decrease)
