 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we welcomed four first-time directors to the board and one
       returning director. We held an orientation session and finalized the
       date and location of a face-to-face meeting to be held next month. We
       also continued discussion of budget priorities, which we will need to
       complete in the coming months.

    B. President [Sam]

       Despite 4 of the 7 operations reports not being posted at the time of
       this writing, I believe all areas are operating normally and without
       any items requiring board attention.

       Despite a late start, quite a number of good ideas have been posted
       for potential FY20 budget items, enough so that I believe that the
       board will need to prioritize the list.  A budget proposal will be
       submitted at the May board meeting.

       A proposal for a Diversity and Inclusion President's committee is
       being drafted, again targeting the May board meeting.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Below is a summary of the Foundation’s Financial performance for the
       first eleven months of FY19;

       However, before we get into the Financials I want to point out that we
       are now in April which is the LAST month of Fiscal year 2019.  So if
       anyone has any expenses that pertain to May 1 2018 thru April 30 2019.
       Please have them submitted and approved for payment with the April
       2019 AP run by the 26th of April 2019.  If you have any questions
       please let me know as soon as possible so we can close out FY19.

       Operating Cash on March 31, 2019 was $2,501.5K, which is down $157.4K
       from last month’s ending balance (Feb 19) of $2,658.9K.  Total Cash as
       of March 31, 2019 is $3,895.3K (includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation) as compared to $2,847.9K on March 31th 2018 (an increase of
       $1,047.5K year over year). The March 2019 ending Operating cash
       balance of $2,501.5K represents an Operating cash reserve of 16.3
       months based on the FY19 Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $153.7K/month ( this will most likely change for FY 20, as there was a
       fair amount of budgeted spend in FY19 that has not occurred but may in
       FY20 as we continue to work on the budget).  The ASF actual Operating
       reserve of 16.3 months at the end of March 2019 is ahead of the
       budgeted 11.2 month reserve for YTD through March 2019.  The ASF
       Operating reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of
       the ASF’s size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is ahead of FY18 at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $448.6K .  As compared to the FY19
       Budgeted Income,  YTD,  we are ahead by $589.1K.

       YTD expenses, through March 31, 2019 are under budget by $136.3K.  All
       departments, except for Conferences, are under budget, at the end of
       March 2019.  Conferences are over budget due to the 75% down payment 
       for ACEU19 that was paid in Mar 2019 as
       noted in the narrative last month. A couple of other areas that
       continue to be under budget, YTD, are Infra,  at $256K under budget is
       due to the timing of hiring of staff ( though this will change in
       April 19 as they have hired two new staff members, Congrats) and not
       paying any Lease web invoices YTD, and TAC which  is also under budget
       by $40K YTD for FY19 as well as .

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY19,  the ASF finished with a positive
       $423.9K NI vs a budgeted negative <$301.5K> NI or $725.4K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of some Sponsor payments as well as more
       Donations than were budgeted as well as underspending in most depts
       YTD vs the FY19 Budget. With  regard to FY18, we are outpacing
       revenue, by $448.6K as noted above,  but we are also out pacing
       expenses by $474.2K; thus, year over year NI for FY19 is behind FY18
       by $25.6K, again due to the 75% down payment that was made for ACEU19.
       As FY19 comes to a close we should all be very proud of the
       exceptional financial performance of the Foundation, both vs our
       budget and compared to the prior year, which has allowed the
       foundation to do a great many things during FY19.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       In March, a system reconfiguration of the whimsy vm resulted in a
       several-day delay in acknowledging receipt of documents.

       The public key repository hosted at MIT that is used by secretary
       workbench has become unreliable and the technical solutions attempted
       to date are not adequate to the task. We will need to investigate
       hosting our own public key repository if the situation continues.

       As of today, all but one membership invitations from the March 2019
       members meeting have been accepted.

       In March, 55 ICLAs, one grant, 23 membership applications, and
       two emeritus requests were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastrcuture
       ==============

       Team had an offsite which was very productive from a "getting things
       done" and a team building excercise (particular important with two new
       hires). Team will focus on having separate offsites from ApacheCon as
       there are less distractions.

       The host running our email service failed. Recovery was rapid
       (especially compared to the May 2014 outage). Congrats to the team on
       fighting this fire.


       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       As usual lots of cross-team collaboration and coordination across
       fundraising, conferences, trademarks and infrastrcuture. Perhaps the
       most visible of which was the delivery of an updated site for the 20th
       anniversary.

       A fairly standard level of PR, AR and Marketing activity outside of
       the mountains of anniversary work which was the culmination of months
       of preparation. A summary of highlights is available in the M&P
       report.

       Our thanks go to Sally and all those who helped bring the 20th
       Anniversary together. Of course there is more to come at our
       conferences this year.



       Conferences
       ===========

       Three events currently in flight, and a handful of other under
       discussion.

       ApacheCon North America 2019:
       - 14 project communities curating their own tracks.
       - David Brin, well-known science fiction author and futurist, is our
         first keynote.
       - CFP is openuntil May 13th.
       - Confernce site https://apachecon.com/acna19/

       ApacheCon Europe 2019
       - ApacheCon EU site is up including sponsorships, CfP, and
         registrations.
       - Sponsorships are not selling as well as forApacheCon NA, work is
         ongoing.

       Chicago Roadshow 2019
       - CFP has ended
       - Website has posted the schedule of speakers
       - We have one Platinum sponsor secured

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ===========================

       Preparing for ApacheCon TAC activities.

       TAC has agreed to accept and administer additional funds from a
       sponsor to target a specific underrepresented group ("Female Latin
       American"). As noted in February report a process has been defined
       that allows the team to use this money without it negatively impacting
       the chances for other participants being the benificiaries of TAC.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       Setup data in the Whimsy Board Agenda tool so that our new directors
       could see how we use homegrown tooling to run our monthly board
       teleconferences so efficiently.  Credit goes both to the many PMCs and
       officers that submit well-written reports, the Whimsy PMC and the
       agenda tooling, and especially all of our past directors for honing
       our all-volunteer governance structure to keep as many decisions as
       practical on our mailing lists, just like our projects are expected to
       work.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Security Team

       Mark Thomas says "This is a reminder that, as a board committee, the
       security committee needs to have a serving board member as a member of
       that committee.  As I am no longer a board member, I believe the board
       needs to appoint a board member to the committee."

       We need to resolve this ASAP.

       Craig Russell was appointed to the Security Team, by General Consent.

    B. Change Secretary

       With my election to the board, I would like to resign as Secretary and
       nominate Matt Sicker to be the Secretary. I will take the role of
       Assistant Secretary.

       Matt Sicker was appointed to Secretary, by General Consent. Craig
       Russell was appointed to Assistant Secretary, by General Consent.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues securing sponsorship renewals and are working with
Virtual closely on invoicing and following through with sponsor payment. We
were also able to recover payment and reinstate a Sponsor whose account was in
arrears for 11 months. As with our prior report, our Sponsor Ambassadors are
"current" on communications and check-ins. This has allowed us to catch and
 correct Sponsor personnel/contact/email quickly.

We have been unable to onboard a Targeted Platinum Sponsor, and are awaiting
clearance from ASF Legal in order to proceed.

We continue engaging with the Conferences team in support of our three events:
Apache Roadshow/Chicago, ApacheCon/Las Vegas, and ApacheCon/Berlin. We have
finalized the base sponsorship agreement for event (ApacheCon, Roadshow and
multi-event) sponsorships. We have onboarded with DocuSign to streamline and
improve the discoverability of documents via a templatized, digital signing
process. We're happy to have supported the efforts around The ASF's 20th
Anniversary, responding to the Apache Events CFPs and Event Sponsorships.

We're pleased to report that we've received $5,620 from individual donors
through our Hopsie page.

We're also pleased to receive ~$1,800 from proceeds of the InnerSource Commons
Summit, which is a recurring donation from that community.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - April 2019

I. Budget: we remain on budget and on schedule through the remaining weeks of
the fiscal year. Sally Khudairi requested a substantial, one-time increase in
the FY2020 budget for special projects to support promotion of the ASF
building upon the 20th Anniversary.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally continues to work closely with VP
Fundraising Daniel Ruggeri on ASF Fundraising activities. We continue to work
with existing sponsors, secure sponsorship renewals, and sign on new sponsors;
the team at Virtual are engaged to ensure timely invoicing. We are preparing
agreements and communications tactics for two incoming Targeted Sponsors. We
are liaising with ASF Legal on behalf of two Platinum-level Sponsors, and with
three Platinum-level Sponsors on behalf of ASF Infrastructure. The Central
Services sub-group helped with with three creative projects (site refresh of
apache.org, developing 20th Anniversary logo assets, and providing supporting
graphics for Apache Conferences). Sally continues to assist ASF Conferences
with planning, sponsorships, marketing and creative, PR and promotion, and
related tactics for Apache Roadshow/Chicago, ApacheCon/Las Vegas, and
ApacheCon/Berlin, and closed 16 event sponsor opportunities (Platinum
sponsorships for Vegas are sold out, and are actually oversubscribed), and has
also secured the first media partnership that will be promoting all three
events. We published two "Success at Apache" posts: "What You Need to Know"
https://s.apache.org/i1tM , and "Positively impacting the world one
contribution at a time" https://s.apache.org/aATd . We launched "Project
Perspectives", a new blog series that highlight how The Apache Way helped
Apache projects and their communities, with "Apache RocketMQ and The Apache
Way" https://s.apache.org/c358 . We completed the second ASF Sponsor Case
Study, "Apache Software Foundation Platinum Sponsor Profile: Leaseweb"
https://s.apache.org/apco , and published "The Apache Way to Sustainable Open
Source Success" https://s.apache.org/GhnI . Sally was invited to attend and

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Finances
========
Infra is within budget, as we close this fiscal year, primarily due to
the open headcount until just recently. The FY20 budget is mostly
developed, contains no surprises, and will be presented to the Board
in May, as part of Operations' overall budget.

Team Meetup
===========
The team gathered in New Orleans on Friday, April 12th. Over the
course of Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, we completed much more work
than expected. Some highlights are launching a CDN experiment; meet
our two new hires (Drew and John); puppetize our auto-block system;
complete the testing, puppet configuration, and removal of technical
debt around our email system; upgrade Confluence; deep discussions on
team goals such as ticket handling and service-level expectations; and
overall bonding among the team. Going forward, we will absolutely
continue this team meetup format, and switch/diminish our ApacheCon
goals to be primarily outward-facing (instead of a work agenda).

Mail Downtime
=============
The host running our email service failed.  If this sounds familiar,
we indeed had something similar in May of 2014.

Thanks to a lot of staff work in deconstructing, understanding and
automating, and maintaining our mail systems down time was more than
an order of magnitude less. (~6 hours vs 5 days).  While we don't
necessarily want to incur any downtime, we're very pleased with the
relative resilience we've been able to produce. Work is ongoing, to
drive MTTR for complex services another order of magnitude.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Test and migrate to the new email setup ("hermes-vm2").
- Turn off mail-archives.a.o and mail-private.a.o, in favor of
  lists.a.o, leaving behind a redirect system for permalinks.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

== Summary ==

We have three events currently in flight, and a handful of other under
discussion. We also have one event recently completed, which, by all accounts,
went well.

=== ApacheCon North America 2019 ===

We are now up to 14 project communities who are curating their own tracks at
ACNA19, plus the bar camp. In the last week, we had the Beam summit, and an
Observability track, added to our lineup.

We have signed on David Brin, well-known science fiction author and futurist,
for our first keynote. He spoke at ApacheCon once before, about ten years ago.
He'll also be signing some of his books on one evening of the event.

The CFP is going well, although we anticipate that many people will submit at
the last possible minute, as always. Additionally, several of our project
communities are handling their own talk solicitation and invitation, outside
of the call for presentations tool. The CFP closes on May 13th.

Further details of this event, including the CFP and Registration, are at
https://apachecon.com/acna19/

=== ApacheCon Europe 2019 ===

Report proided by Myrle Krantz

ApacheCon EU site is up including sponsorships, CfP, and registrations.  We
have presentation reviewers ready and waiting.  We have announced committer
discounts on the relevant mailing lists.  We have had some minor hickups in
the process, but are working out the kinks as we find them.  Tickets are
starting to sell, but we expect more once we can announce aspects of our
program.  We pushed the purchase deadline for "trust us" reduced tickets back
1 week to April 15th.  Sponsorship sales are not selling as well as for
ApacheCon NA, but we are actively pursuing sponsors and have several
interested companies.


=== Chicago Roadshow 2019 ===

The Chicago Roadshow CFP has ended, we have enough submissions to fill our
tracks for two days of content. The website has posted the schedule of
speakers and is now focusing on driving event registrations.  To drive
registrations we are working with Sally to devise a social media schedule, and
are monitoring actual registrations as well as site metrics on Google
Analytics.  We have one Platinum sponsor, Google, hoping to close more in the
coming month.

In addition to registration drives and sponsor pursuits, we will also be
working on things such as location for speaker / reception dinner, conference
swag, other odds and ends.

=== DC Roadshow Post-report ===

Report provided by Kevin McGrail:

The Apache DC Roadshow with GMU went really well.  Thanks to all the speakers,
volunteers, staff & attendees.  Many kudos received all around.

From a financial standpoint, we came in just under budget though we have one
sponsor who still owes a small amount that may or may not be realized
directly.  They are certain to help us with future events and I recommend it
be largely ignored.

As an experiment, we did record video for 1/2 of the event.  I have all the
slide decks and videos but video processing is taking a lot longer than I
hoped.  Posting those decks and videos is considered the last task for the
event.

This event should be repeated for 2020.

=== Other Upcoming Events ===

As mentioned last month, we have offers of a number of other events, but
nothing has progressed on these in the last month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Nothing to report this month either.

We are expecting more action in the upcoming months due to two ApacheCons
coming closer for which applications will open shortly.

Only thing that sticks out was a discussion of $5k donated by Google to
explicitly target "Female Latin American" developers, for which we had
discussed the mode of how we can incorporate this in our usual TAC sponsoring
without discriminating others in February.

Mailing List is quiet, only reoccurring topic seems to be that we need to find
a solution for punctually submitting board reports.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

Worked with Fundraising to assist with issues Assisted the DC Roadshow
by resolving the Insurance issue and purchasing it for the event.
Attended the DC Road show to add assistance to the event. Reviewing
FY20 budget submissions work with events and conference team.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Andy Seaborne (andy@), Rob Vesse (rveese@) and Adam Soroka (ajs6f@) have
joined the W3C SPARQL 1.2 Community Group.

ASF has agreed to the terms of the W3C Community and Business Group Process
and to abide by the terms and spirit of the Code of Ethics and Professional
Conduct.

Henry Story (bblfish@) has joined the Solid Community Group. ASF was already
participating.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. (we're down 5, from 24 to 19,
open issues this month).

We approved Jakarta TCK contracts that would allow ASF to officially join
Eclipse Foundation activities around Eclipse Jakarta EE Platform.

Hen continued with his updates/clarifications on the website overhauling the
overall menu systems for the legal matters.

Discussion around clarifying the scope and purpose of legal mailing lists and
also creating a privileged mailing list re-surfaced again. This time we have
much more consensus at least around how to proceed with privileged one.

We reviewed DataStax sponsorship agreement for ApacheCon and in general
started to question how deep into contract reviews should Legal Affairs
committee really go (remember: we're NOT trained lawyers).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.  There are
continuing issues with Mitre taking up to 2 weeks to update the CVE
database.

      15        [license confusion]
      12        [support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 39 (last months: 35, 38, 16)

      15      [hack or license confusion]

              [poi], [qpid], [shiro], [sling], [spamassassin],
              [spark], [tapestry], [zeppelin], [zookeeper]

     In total, as of 1st April 2019, we're tracking 84 (last month:
     85) open issues across 43 projects, median age 66 (last month:
     77) days.  57 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     12 (last month: 7) of these issues, across 6 projects, are older
     than 365 days.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Thiruvalluvan M. G.]

Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

This report is for the two months ending Mar 31 2019 (previous report covered
until Jan 31)

Activity

* 55 JIRA tickets opened by 19 developers
* 56 Pull requests opened in Github
* 51 issues resolved by 13 contributors
* 59 Pull requests merged
* 35 pull requests pending

Last release: version 1.8.2 20th May 2017.
Last time a new committer elected: 7 December 2018
Last time a new PMC elected: 7 December 2018

In spite of a lot of interest from developer community, new release is still
eluding us. It is almost two years since our last release. The community is
putting in a lot of effort to report and fix issues and enhancements, but
nobody has time to drive release as a project.

There is no outstanding issue requiring Board’s help to resolve. But, we'd
appreciate any suggestions based on other teams methods on ways to get the
next release.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

## Description:

Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as
Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Currently, Bahir provides extensions to
multiple distributed analytic platforms, extending their reach with a
diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data sources.

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

Apache Bahir community activity slowed down a little on the past couple months
but it continues to see a flow of contributions enhancing the existing
extensions for both Apache Spark and Apache Flink. There is a need to catch up
with recent Apache Spark releases that happened recently and the Flink
extensions are in need of a release as well and hopefully these will be
addressed in time for the next report.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Francis Chuang]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and its
Avatica sub-project.

We have been seeing a lot of new contributors open pull requests and
participating in our mailing lists to answer questions and partake in
discussions. This is most likely due to Calcite being increasingly adopted as
part of commercial offerings offered by cloud service providers as well as
being used to build internal tools. The increased participation by new
contributors is reflected in the 3 new committers we have added to the project
in the last 3 months.

In the last report, we mentioned that there were some issues with pull
requests not being reviewed in a timely manner. Over the last few months, we
have observed new contributors and non-committers reviewing open pull requests
in our repositories in conjunction with our existing committers. This is a
great improvement and we hope this will put us on the path to stop PRs from
getting too stale.

In terms of releases, Calcite 1.19.0 was released at the end of March and
includes numerous bug-fixes as well as extensive improvements in JSON query
support.

Finally, the Calcite website repository was moved to git. As a result of this
move, all of our source repositories are now using GitBox, enabling new
contributors to easily submit pull requests via Github.

## Health report:
Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both Calcite and
Avatica.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
The main activity in the project was getting the release of 3.3.0 out in
January. This was a big release with updates for Java 11 and a bunch of other
things. We did get a few serious bug reports shortly after the release so we
did a 3.3.1 patch release in early March to fix the critical problems users
were having.

## Health report:
For the most part, the project is making steady, but not stellar, progress. 
Many of the protocols and specs that CXF implements are mature specs and don't
really change much.   Thus, steady progress and regular releases are a good
thing.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Misty Linville]

## Description:

Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational
database. Apache HBase gives you low latency random access to billions of rows
with millions of columns atop non-specialized hardware.

hbase-thirdparty is a set of internal artifacts used by the project to
mitigate the impact of our dependency choices on the wider ecosystem.

## Issues:
Board-only information removed from public report.

## Activity:

There have been lots of interesting discussions on the dev@ mailing list.
Highlights:
- We have nearly all the infrastructure ready to complete the move to Gitbox.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3496568d  6cc002f74f5c3bcce46ed44b7ee9e90d7d53af2c65b6f785@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- An interesting discussion occurred about the frequency of releases in the
  2.1.x line
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/222aacbf7  4d9788287ef5606fe66a06c1a3aa31a299a469d124a5ee0@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E).
  The discussion included a sub-discussion about what it will take to separate
  the hbck took from the main project, and another sub-discussion about
  time-based releases and release cadence in general. It's worth a read.
- A conversation is underway about getting the branch-2 line ready for the
  "stable" pointer.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/81b2917e  ba3fce2872b96526635a5ba11535c73641cb3d38271ee353@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- We asked ourselves what our greatest friction point is when attracting new
  contributors. We'd love for you to weigh in.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/887a253c  cce44b51e4cfc57276545fcea123fa780a73ffc9fa279cd2@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- Sean Busbey, the release manager for 1.2, proposes that 1.2.12 (currently a
  release candidate) be the last release in the 1.2 line.
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/3cf19458  b739a612fbe1f72d17c14124ff536b0cb8678a63d80cf019@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)

Planning is underway for the next HBaseCon Asia! Contact Duo Zhang
<zhangduo@apache.org> to get involved.

The HBase project is working toward the goal of more frequent minor releases
and fewer unprompted maintenance releases. In total this quarter, HBase had 7
releases over this quarter, across 3 release lines, and hbase-thirdparty had 1
release.

Another goal, spanning several quarters, is to solicit more non-binding votes
on release candidates, as non-binding votes are one signal of broader
community engagement.
- HBase 2.1.3 RC1 had 40% non-binding votes
(https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/baef7847  6204a476b45f7e273b006f19d057c6d9123d8a34178539a9@%3Cdev.hbase.apache.org%3E)
- We voted on and failed several release candidates this quarter. We had less
  participation from non-binding voters this quarter. As a reminder, anyone on
  the dev@ list can test and provide feedback on a release candidate, and cast
  a non-binding vote.

One new committer was added this quarter, and one committer joined the PMC.
More details below. Thanks to the new committers and PMC members for agreeing
to take on more responsibilities in the project.

## Health report:

We've bounced back from the holiday dip in activity. Specifically, we have
fixed a lot of JIRA issues this quarter!

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

Incubator PMC report for April 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 53 podlings incubating. During the month of March,
podlings executed 10 distinct releases. We added two new IPMC members
and no IPMC members retired.

We have three new podlings this month, Apache DataSketches and Apache 
Tuweni and Apache TVM. No projects graduated last month but several
podlings are heading towards graduation in the next few months.

All three of the podlings that failed to report last month submitted a 
report this month.

Two podlings have not submitted reports and will be asked to report next
month. They are:
- Milagro
- MXNet

There was no IP clearance(s).

ECharts still has several issues that are outstanding (including the 
echarts baidu website) and it's probably time to discuss how to 
resolve this on the IPMC list.

Skywalking, on its second attempt, had a number of difficulties in cleaning up
rosters and getting PPMC members onto the private mailing list after
they proposed to graduate. Having a pre-graduation checklist may be useful
to make this process easier.
 
A shiny new Podling clutch page (and a new process behind it) have been updated 
and changed to improve tracking of podlings progress.

The incubator is providing a new service to podlings to provide feedback on
releases. Podlings can bring up a discuss thread asking for feedback on a 
release candidate rather than asking for it in a vote thread.

The release management documentation was updated to make it clear what to 
do about non-ASF releases and encourage podings to bring those in line with 
ASF release and distribution policy over time.

Having a smaller IPMC was discussed, it was suggested that anyone not
signed up to the private list to be removed from the IPMC. This was looked into
and people who make infrequent contributors are still helpful and make
useful contributions. What seems less helpful in some cases is "drive-by"
comments and the involvement of uninformed people on this list.

Mentors are being actively encouraged to vote on their podling releases, so 
that the VOTEs show up on the general@ list with 3 +1 IPMC votes.

Incubator wiki is being deprecated, we've tried to migrate via the self help
migration tool but it has failed every time. There is a risk that it will
not be transferred by the deadline. This may have an impact on submitting
the next report to the board.

A large number of incubator pages have been updated to be simpler and
remove policy content that is explained elsewhere at the ASF. More is still
needed to be done here and it's an ongoing process.

An incubator cookbook has been created, which single page of explanations
and links that cover all phases of incubation and should become the
central point for all questions related to incubation. 

There are other ongoing conversations about further changes to the IPMC and
how it operates. A couple of these conversations happened on the incubator
private list (and other lists) when they should probably be on the general
list so that all interested people can read and contribute.

Amaterasu

Apache Amaterasu is a framework providing configuration management and 
deployment for Big Data Pipelines.

It provides the following capabilities:

Continuous integration tools to package pipelines and run tests.
A repository to store those packaged applications: the applications 
repository.
A repository to store the pipelines, and engine configuration (for 
instance, the location of the Spark master, etc.): per environment - the 
configuration repository.
A dashboard to monitor the pipelines.
A DSL and integration hooks allowing third parties to easily integrate.

Amaterasu has been incubating since 2017-09-07.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow up user and contributor communities
  2. Prepare documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?

  There is still concern regarding the progress of the project. The 
  community tries to address this by making the project more accessible. The 
  first major step is releasing the documentation and simplifying the install 
  process. In addition, we are working closely with some of the newer 
  contributors to mentor them and help them be more productive.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, we have been focusing on the next release with 
  strong focus building the documentation which we hope will help with 
  adoption. We are still working with a couple of organizations on their use 
  case, hopefully, those could become a public use cases soon.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * 11 pull requests by 4 contributors have been opened since the last 
  report. Out of those 2 have been closed, 1 is awaiting fixes and the rest 
  have been merged.
  * Documentation has been progressing and is due for the upcoming release.

Date of the last release:

  12 July 2018

Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and 
humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

 1. Release initial versions
 2. Add more active contributors
 3. Community growth in general

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Community growth for our project has been much slower than expected. We 
  are aiming
  to ship a release and add at least one committer prior to the next board 
  report. We will
  also be discussing the project's scope and future and trying one last 
  time to (re)build the
  interest and community we'd had during the W3C's Web Annotation Working 
  Group days
  (and the time prior when Annotator.js and Open Annotation were in full 
  swing).

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The immediate Apache Annotator community has remained quiet,
  but interest in Web Annotations (and surrounding technology/specs)
  has increased. We hope to tap into some of that new activity in this
  second quarter of 2019. Additionally, we hope to do further community
  outreach in person at the upcoming I Annotate event in May:
  http://iannotate.org/

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code and community show minimal (if any) progress. The projects focus
  may be too narrow or the audience for our current DOM libraries may be
  too small to achieve frequent activity at this point. We did begin an 
  effort
  to expand the scope of the project slightly to include server-side code
  and Web Annotation Data Model testing, but interest so far has remained
  minimal.

  Last committer was added in August. That same committer is now on the

that need to be addressed.

  We did welcome our two new mentors, but have not had follow-up
  conversations as a community to (re)focus the group since then. We
  hope to change that in the coming weeks as we look toward promoting
  the project again at the upcoming I Annotate 2019 conference.

Hudi

Hudi provides atomic upserts and incremental data streams on Big Data

Hudi has been incubating since 2019-01-17.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Make frequent releases as per Apache guidelines
  2. Grow community
  3. Complete SGA, transfer code to ASF infra

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * PODLINGNAMESEARCH-162 has been completed, but is not reflected on Whimsy
  * SGA process has been delayed due to inability to quickly interact with 
  ASF legal counsel. Help expediting this communication would help a lot to 
  get the SGA done by Uber.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Project source code/docs/issue management all now hosted on apache 
  infrastructure
  - HIP, a process for proposing large changes to the project has been 
  formalized by the community
  - 30+ new threads on dev ML, with ~10 non-PPMC contributors

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Code has been moved over to apache/incubator-hudi
  2. hudi.apache.org site has been restructured and simplified for 
  community consumption
  3. Hudi Improvement Plan (based off Apache Kafka KIP) ratified and 
  formalized. Few first HIPs written
  4. Submitted a Hudi talk abstract for Kafka Summit 2019
  5. ~20 PRs merged

How has the project developed since the last report?
  Version 0.6 was released

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
  Mailing lists and project development follow the Apache way.
  The user community is active but lately the rate of change in the project 
  code is lower. 
  This may not be a cause for concern since it might indicate relative 
  maturity in achieving the desired functionality of the project.

PLC4X

PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable
logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API.

PLC4X has been incubating since 2017-12-18.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1.Vote on graduation on IPMC general list

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Not at the moment.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Previously added PPMC/Committers have setup and the onboarding process
  has been pretty successful. One new name has showed up on the list
  demonstrating willingness to help with the website and documentation.

  Now in total 3 people have demonstrated the ability to perform releases.
  We are currently tying up some loose ends and preparing everything to
  start the graduation vote in the next few weeks. All of this has been
  consuming quite some time.

  We have had a meetup in Nürtingen on 15th of February which a great part
  of the active PPMC and committers attended. Beyond that on 21th of 
  February
  Christofer had a talk on PLC4X at EURegJug in Aachen, on 8th of March in
  Solingen.

  Numbers:
  - Releases:
    - 0.3.0 RC2: 05.02.2019 (RM: Julian Feinauer)
    - 0.3.1 RC1: 13.03.2019 (RM: Julian Feinauer, but Tim Mitsch actually 
    did it)
  - Mailing-list Subscriptions: 43 (up by 1)
  - Twitter followers: 132 (up by 18)
  - GitHub stars: 52 (up by 10)

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Christofer is working hard on implementing a first POC for a tooling to
  generate drivers from DFDL and SCXML specifications, which will greatly
  simplify driver implementation as well as make it possible to generate
  drivers for multiple target languages, such as C++.

  No new POCs have been performed this period however another company has
  shifted to using PLC4X as main integration platform in their analytics
  software. Also a consortium of 3 companies and the ISW from Stuttgart
  University received a positive response to a project proposal that was
  supported for the funding program "KMU Innovativ" at BMBF German ministry
  of education and research. PLC4X will play an important role in the 
  project for communication with industrial controllers and will be
  integrated by the industrial partner pragmatic minds GmbH which is
  represented in the (P)PMC by Julian Feinauer.

SensSoft

Apache SensSoft is a generalized user behavioral logging platform for web 
pages and thin-client applications

Apache SensSoft has been incubating since 2016-07-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the Apache SensSoft (Incubating) Committer/Community Base.
  2. Complete our Podling name change
  3. Complete the issues highlighted at the SensSoft Roadmap [1]

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  * We have completed our PODLINGNAMESEARCH workflow and our new name Apache 
  Flagon has been approved by VP of marketing [2]. 

  * We have posted tickets to change the name of our core assets (JIRA, 
  Website, GitBox Repos) [3], to coincide with changing website text, other 
  content-based references to Apache SensSoft.

  * We are preparing for additional releases, immediately following our full 
  transition to the Apache Flagon Namesake (UserALE.js v. 2.0.0, 2.1.0; poss. 
  Flagon 1.0.0). 

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The community has been:
  - discussing reaching out to other open source projects to identify other 
  potential communities (analytical technologies) to drive developments, as 
  well as increase interest in the Podling.
  - discussing research applications with university research labs in 
  machine learning and social computing.
  - discussing adoption of the technology with interested entities and 
  identifying/eliminating barriers to adoption. 
  - updating documentation on wiki and READMEs to improve community growth

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Project maturity roadmaps (Wiki) and version release plans (JIRA) 
  continue to be maintained.
  * JIRA boards continue to be maintained
  * Core products have been maintained for modernization and for security 
  posture.
  * New features have been added to enhance adoption and make Apache SensSoft 
  competitive with open-source business analytics services (e.g., OWA).

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

  * Despite challenges posed by dispersion of the original committers, the 
  project is finding its footing again and continues to be desirable for 
  consumption and relevant amidst alternatives. The impending name change is 
  an opportunity for rebranding and acceleration of community growth.

Spot

Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model
and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Revive community activity (Discussion in mailing lists, increase 
  frequency of commits)
  2. Make it easier for Devs to contribute to the project (e.g. 
  documentation, framework).
  3. Developing a workflow in Spot that allows for intuitive analytics.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Unfortunately there has not been much more community activity. However, we 
  are need of more committers as there are only a couple of active committers 
  at this time. This creates a bottleneck which makes it hard for the 
  community to grow in interest.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A few members have been looking into merging one of the major branches that 
  the community has been waiting on into master. This should avoid a lot of 
  confusion among new community members in the future.

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for 
training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various 
Apache and non-Apache target projects. 

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Agree upon underlying technology stack and architecture for training 
  content
  2. Develop first training topic contents
  3. Set up our contribution process

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  - no critical issues at this point in time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - The project has been set up recently, so there is an initial 
  activation/development towards a community.
  - The dev mailing list is active. Total number of posts in March were 160 
  (+48 from March). Total number of
  subscribers is 28 (+3 from last month).

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - This is our first report covering a full month
  - We have decided on a Website technology and we have had our first few 
  commits (LICENSE, README etc.)
  - The scope of the project deliverables, core procedures, details regarding 
  website, and code management are still under discussion 
  - First offers of content donations have been made
  - We welcomed our first regular contributor to the mailing list from 
  outside of the original list of contributors
  - There are plans to talk about the project at both ApacheCons this year

  There are lots of parallel discussions happening. We have made some initial 
  decisions (e.g. website) but there are lots of topics still left to be 
  discussed. The major one is on whether or not to chose a canonical 
  technology into which we want to convert our training material and the 
  organization thereof (e.g. multilingual content and acceptance of material 
  in different formats e.g. PowerPoint, Google Slides).

  The project is a bit different from most others which come with existing 
  code bases, existing communities. We have to start from "first principles" 
  so it's not unexpected that this takes a while.

TVM is a full stack open deep learning compiler stack for CPUs, GPUs, and
specialized accelerators. It aims to close the gap between the productivity-
focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- or 
efficiency-oriented
hardware backends.

TVM has been incubating since 2019-03-06.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Finish the IP clearance
  2. Make the first Apache release
  3. Continue to grow the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - TVM PMC has been fully transitioned to private@
  - The development conversations are mirrored to dev@
  - TVM community has welcomed two new committers in the past month

  See more in https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/search?q=COMMUNITY&type=Issues

  NOTE: due to the transition, the vote of the new committers were done in
  the pre-apache PMC private list with our mentors as observers. 
  We are doing procedural votes to bring these committers formally to 
  Apache soon. 

How has the project developed since the last report?

  In the past month, 47 contributors have pushed 138 commits. 
  On master, 480 files have changed and there have been

Weex

Weex is a framework for building Mobile cross-platform high performance UI.

Weex has been incubating since 2016-11-30.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  they may violate the trademark / copyright of ASF
  2. The release procedure for Weex is not documented clearly.
  3. More active committers and PPMC members should be invited into the 
  community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

## Description: 
Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven applications
in Java. Users only write POJOs and Apache Isis handles the database and UI
automatically at runtime.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

We did two releases, one of each version of the framework: 1.17.0 [1] and
2.0.0-M2 [2].

The 2.0.0-M2 milestone introduces one new feature, namely support for a 
table tree view in the Wicket viewer. It also includes all the features as 
of Apache Isis 1.17.0. 

The 1.17.0 release was already reported in the previous board report.

Most of the development effort is in the 2.x branch, with efforts continuing
to be able to re-platform the framework on top of Spring Boot. There has been
an announcement on the users mailing list that Apache Isis v2 will most 
likely fully integrate with Spring Data, which means moving away from 
DataNucleus and losing support for JDO in favour of JPA (until a 
spring-data-jdo module becomes available). This announcement has been well 
received.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrea Turli]

== Description ==

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We are still struggling to release a version that supports Java 8 and newer
Guava versions. The main blocker for this has been the dependency on Karaf
and the lack of expertise on it by the active community. We've been working
with the Karaf community for around a year now, but results have not
materialized yet. We think it is not sustainable to have such a hard
dependency on jclouds, especially when the active community has no expertise
on it and when that dependency is not strictly related to the direct value
jclouds provides. For this reason, we are working with the Karaf community
and plan to transfer the jclouds-karaf and jclouds-cli to them. Our first
conversations are positive and we believe that this new home for those
projects, although they will be disconnected from the official jclouds
release cycle, will provide continued and better support for their existing
users.

This transfer also makes sense because Karaf already has some plans to
integrate their recent Kloud project with jclouds.

== Community ==

Outside the existing PMC and committers, we have had the usual contribution
pace. We've had some contributions to the Azure Blobstore provider with good
engagement in the issue tracker, slack and the mailing list by the
contributor. We will keep an eye on upcoming contributions.

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez) Last PMC member:
2016-10-21(Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Unblock the release of jclouds 2.2.0, which will provide Java 8 support.
Transfer jclouds-karaf and jclouds-cli to the Karaf project. Keep engaging
contributors on Slack, and propose them as new committers as appropriate.
Monitor the PMC and ensure we have enough resources to properly manage the
project.

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.1.2, took place on 2019-02-07.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards for RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The project has continued to evolve the codebase. It is still in the process
of incorporating the significant contribution of a GeoSPARQL implementation,
mainly restricted by PMC members' bandwidth.

Elsewhere, a new contribution of metrics support for the Jena Fuseki,
triplestore protocol engine, has been received and the project is working with
the contributor to incorporate that.

Discussion of release 3.11.0 has started.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez]

## Description: 
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
Java EE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - This quarter we saw 5 vulnerability reports; 2 of them were declined. We
ended up having the 2018/Q4 (2.11.0.M1) release on January, 2.11.0.M2 to 
address one of the vulnerability reports and not too much later 2.11.0.M3 to
address the other two vulnerabilities. TL-DR: quite busy quarter for our
regular pace.
   
## Health report: 
 - We continue to have a slight decline of people subscribed to MLs. OTOH, 
we've had 5 vulnerability reports which somehow translates in people 
interested enough on Apache JSPWiki, and we were able to pull the releases,
so I'd say there's enough oversight. Questions do get answered on MLs too.

- Regarding contributions, we've received this quarter a couple of small 
PRs which made into master, and a TikaSearchProvider to index a whole lot 
more types of attachments (JSPWIKI-469), which should also get into master 
within a short time.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache MADlib Project  [Aaron Feng]

## Description:

- Apache MADlib is a scalable, big data, SQL-driven machine learning framework
  for data scientists.


## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Maven Board Report - April 2019
---------------------------

## Description: 

 - Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
   development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
   standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
   lifecycle.

## Issues:

  <<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

## Activity:

   There is quite some activity on the surefire subproject. A lot of work
   is done to get rid of all the Maven 2 specific code and to rely on the
   Maven3 APIs.

   With the use of the Multibranch pipeline in Jenkins we've been able to
   verify all of our ~100 subprojects to be stable with a set of Operating
   Systems, JDKs and Maven versions. However, we were missing the overview
   of the health of all the projects. To collect that information a page
   was created (https://s.apache.org/cm8p). This showed us that at that 
   time only 2/3 of the projects were stable. Now about 90% of all our
   projects are stable the rest should follow soon.

   We've started the process for the clearance of the IP for the Maven 
   Wrapper Codebase. We've analyzed all commits per contributor and have
   sent a request of approval to five who did a significant amount of work.
   Four already gave their approval, with the fifth we're discussing the 
   process of transition.
   
   An interesting fact is that Gradle, the next most popular build tool,
   is providing Maven extensions. 

## Health report: 

  With the current small number of committers you see immediately the effect
  when people take a pause. Less mail, less commits, less releases. 
  We're spreading the word to the community about the small number of 
  *volunteers* that maintain Maven during conferences and meetups,
  and it surprises everybody. So yes, we are creating awareness, but it
  doesn't result in potential new committers yet.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Metron Project  [Casey Stella]

## Description:
Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order to
offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis.  Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying the
most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry within a
single platform.


## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time


## Activity:
Work continues along the vein of stabilizing the product as well as creating
infrastructure and abstractions to support other stream processing engines
(e.g. Spark Streaming).  Since this work is substantial, the next release is
 still pending (though in active discussions on the mailing lists).

## Health report:

Dev mailing list activity continued steady since the January report, but it is
still low when compared to the previous year.  This coincides with a drop in
commits as well (so at least activity is not happening without discussion). I
believe this means that we will need more effort to garner interest in the
project.  I have hopes that presentations (2 that I am aware of) at Dataworks
summit will boost interest.  I suggest revisiting in the next board report.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 3 releases this quarter The discussions around moving Vysper to the Attic
 have not progressed. The git repositories have been migrated to gitbox mid
 january.

## Health report:
 Both Mina SSHD and Mina Core subprojects have only two active committers
  (different committers though).  The SSHD subproject has external
   contributions so we may have new committers in the future. The FtpServer
   and Vysper have very low activity: a single commit since a year for

 - Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
   integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
   Java and C++ implementations.
 - Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
   including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
   MiNiFi.
 - Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
   NiFi classloader isolation model.
 - Apache NiFi Flow Design System is a theme-able set of high quality UI
   components and utilities for use across the various Apache NiFi web
   applications in order to provide a more consistent user experience.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Released Apache NiFi 1.9.0 containing numerous new features, bug fixes, and
   improvements. This includes support for several standard security headers
   such as HSTS, X-XSS-Protection, and Content-Security-Policy.
 - The community continues to make progress in externalizing all NiFi
   extension components which would help us reduce the size of our convenience
   binaries which reduces impact on infrastructure and mirrors.

## Health report:
 - Health of the community remains strong with many releases and robust
   discussion threads on new feature ideas like nifi-stateless and how to best
   migrate to Java 11.
 - The PMC has not discussed committer and PMC pipeline in some time and needs
   to put renewed attention on it.
 - As evidenced by the timeline between Apache NiFi 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 and 1.9.2
   we have had important defects requiring prompt resolution but also strong
   community effort to do so.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Sebastian Nagel]

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene®, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop® data
structures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.


ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


RELEASES

Nutch 1.15 was released on Aug 09 2018.

The last release on the 2.x branch (2.3.1) dates to Jan 20 2016.


CURRENT ACTIVITY

While the work on Nutch 1.16 is continued we still plan to release Nutch 2.4
first.  Issues with the dependency management (see NUTCH-2669 and linked
issues) currently block the releases. We need to wait for a fix in an upcoming
Ivy release or find a reliable work-around.

Migration of the Wiki from MoinMoin to Confluence is in progress
(waiting for INFRA-18076). We also plan to review the Wiki content and
 structure cleaning up outdated pages.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Sathwik]

## Description:
   Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web services
   orchestration using flexible process definitions.

## Issues:
   The ODE PMC had successfully voted to move the project to Attic in the
   Jan-2019 report.

   Vote: https://s.apache.org/11Fv Result: https://s.apache.org/NegQ

   Board heldback passing the resolution asking the PMC to see if a new life
   can be induced within the community around the new proposal. Mail from
   board: https://s.apache.org/6Oo3

   PMC then held a discussion on the new proposal here
   (https://s.apache.org/2e26). Couple of the PMC members did agree to
    support the idea, but may not be actively involved in the development
    activities. One of the PMC member did propose to take it to incubator
    without going emiritus and he would be able to mentor.

  PMC is not very clear on the way forward.

## Activity:

   The contributor who has given the new proposal is developing the POC on
   his personal github repo and he hasn't had the time to continue much as he
   has been held up in his official work.

## Health report:
 - There has been not much user/dev activity since the last reporting period
   Oct  2018.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 15 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
 - Last PMC addition was Rafal Rusin on Wed Oct 01 2014.

## Committer base changes:
 - Currently 26 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
 - Last committer was Sathwik on Dec 23 2012.

## Releases:
 - Last release was 1.3.8 on Fri Mar 23 2018

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for databases,
 relational as well as non-relational. For relational databases, OpenJPA is
 compliant to the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0.
 OpenJPA runs in stand-alone Java SE as well as  containers e.g Java EE,
 Tomcat, Spring or OSGi.
 We are currently working on implementing the JPA-2.2 specification and
 just released our first version.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 
 We have been quite active in the last quarter. 
 We worked towards more JPA-2.2 features and have just 
 shipped a 3.1.0 release.
 There also has been quite some interaction with contributors who reported
 bugs. The JPA TCK is now theoretically available via the JakartaEE project
 but we did not yet have a chance to test against it. This is on our
 list for the next few months. While doing this we will also figure
 the rest of the missing JPA-2.2 functionality.
   
## Health report: 
 Contributions are fine and the community activity is also quite ok.
 Ofc could be way better, but we are fine given how old the project is!

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Peter Kovacs]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## SUMMARY

This report has been sent in with a month delay due to full time schedules in
January. The Project did a release in November, containing bug fixes and a
security fix. The development regained activity concerning the modernization
of the code and build environment itself. One result of this development has
been that the process for releasing 4.2.0 has built momentum again.

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines: 1) 4.2.0 is the next minor
release, planned to be released into a beta phase. We have missed our goal on
going into the beta in 2018. We managed only to solve the biggest blockers.
Currently dev test versions are being rolled to be more widely tested. 2)
4.1.x is still in maintenance. We are discussing a parallel 4.1.7 release. The
motivation in maintaining the 4.1.x line is not very high. We will shut it
down as soon as we have a stable release of 4.2.x,

## Latest Release History

2018-11-18 4.1.6 2017-12-30 4.1.5 2017-10-19 4.1.4

## PMC

There are 28 PMC members as of 2018-Apr-11.

Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N. McKenna (knmc) Last PMC
member withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)

## COMMITTERS

There are 141 committers as of 2018-Apr-11.

Last committer addition was on 2017-Jan-28 Kay Schenk (kschenk) Last committer
withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)

## ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
We still have issues to bring Volunteers on board. Recruiting has the least
priority on the active members.

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

no changes in the last quarter.

## MARKETING
In February FOSDEM took place. OpenOffice was not as visible as in the years
before. Still our Members have been on the event and used the time to network.

In March our Booth team has visited the Chemnitzer Linux Tage. The Chemnitzer
Linux days is one of the most important OpenSource events in Germany. A lot of
talks turned around OpenOffice and that the Apache Software Foundation does a
lot more than a Web Server.

## DEVELOPMENT
We have changed gears, original we wanted to directly release 4.2.0 as beta.
However the work we invest into structure and build environment is time
consuming and disrupts the release capabilities. So we have split the 4.2.0
work and try to stabilize the new branch for 4.2.0 while in the background the
deeper work on the code substance is ongoing.

We have 3 deep structure projects ongoing: 1) migration from dmake to make 2)
Windows 64 bit migration 3) replacement from c-arrays to C++ STL structures

We are especially happy on LibreOffice patches. The responsible developers
have declared that we may use their work under the Apache License v2. The
Patches need additional work, but it is a good sign. We hope we find soon time
to integrate them.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

The project is in a recovery phase after a couple of years of deficient
activity both from committers and users (low activity in the mailing lists
too). The conclusion to the last email threads, where the level of interest in
the project from past users and contributors was trying to be measured, is
that the previous releases help developers to use Stanbol stably. However, the
ongoing development has stopped from a long time now, and there were no plans
so far to implement new features or re-engineer some of the older modules.

The Apache board started a discussion about electing a new chair who is much
more involved in the daily business of Stanbol. A new PMC member (Antonio
Pérez) has been elected recently. It was ensured that, at least, there were 3
PMC members already active in the project.

The Stanbol PMC should focus now on expanding the community by attracting new
committers and users. One discussed possibility is to re-architecture the most
complex parts of the project and simplify the code base, promoting those
features identified as most demanded by the users/devs.

Subscribers on the dev list: 227

Last new committer was Furkan Kamaci on December 18th, 2018

Last new PMC member was Antonio David Perez Morales on December 21st, 2018

Last stack release was: Apache Stanbol 1.0.0 on Oct 23rd, 2016

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
 - Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation
   uses to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The annual members meeting was conducted, and voting ran without any
   issues. A unicode issue that plagued us last year had been fixed prior to
   the meeting, and a bug in tallying under specific circumstances was also
   discovered, though none of them were relevant to the meeting, which went
   remarkably smooth.

## Health report:
 - We did a PMC check in January for sufficient oversight, and short of the
   PMC members going AWOL (they are still here!), we have enough folks keeping
   an eye on the project. The project is is in a maintenance phase at the
   moment, with the potential of a revamp/rewrite of the system before the
   next members meeting.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 5 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Rich Bowen on Mon Apr 20 2015

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 9 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Streams Project  [Steve Blackmon]

## Description:

- Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online
  activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets
  accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
  streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:

- More code has been unintentionally deprecated due to loss of functionality
  of upstream APIs.
- Keeping the existing community active and growing the community remains a
  challenge.

## Activity:

- Some additional development occurred on existing modules but activity was
  low again this quarter.
- Project is over-due for a release to incorporate new ActivityStreams
2.0 support and updates to several of our core dependencies.
- Three Apache members have recently expressed some interest in getting
  involved, potentially joining PMC, although not yet officially on-list.
- Some progress was made on firming up a project roadmap on email list, in
  confluence, and a public summary of the roadmap is now on the website.

## Health report:

- Mailing list and commit participation was low again.  Adding committers and
  growing the PMC needs to be a focus this year.

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made one GA release in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.5.20 - Feature release, including Java 11 support (2019-01-14)

Within the last quarter we saw steady development activity with over 30 closed
pull requests. We continue to receive high quality contributions as GitHub
pull requests by various individuals. We are currently in the process of
voting on one of these contributors to be added to the committership.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Georgios Petasis]

## Description: 
 - Apache Tcl is home to the Tcl-Apache integration efforts. The purpose of
   our project is to combine the power of the Apache web server with the
   capabilities of the mature, robust and flexible Tcl scripting language.
   Currently only the Apache Rivet project is actively maintained.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Rivet released one artifact (rivet-3.1.1 on Wed Jan 09 2019),
   which was a bug fix release.

 - The CMake build system was further developed, to perform all actions the
   autoconf based build system does, such as using the version from the VERSION
   file, and generating the correct pkgIndex.tcl file for the rivet library,
   after the library has been installed, in the installation directory.

 - As a response to the inability of rivet to link correctly under Windows, we
   tried to setup continuous integration for Windows through AppVeyor. This has
   been largerly completed, and will be tested in the forthcoming releases.

 - We are closely monitoring the changes Tcl version 9 will introduce, and a new
   branch (rivet 4.x) has been created.
 
 - Harald Oehlmann has made a proposal for a 20-min talk in Berlin ApacheCON.
   
## Health report: 
 - The project activity is limited to Apache Rivet.

   can be used to process arbitrarily complex directed-acyclic graphs (DAGs)
   of data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set of data-processing
   primitives which can be used by other projects.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- New contributors are submitting patches this quarter and pressing us to
  upgrade to yetus 0.9 to support github integration

## Health report:
- Tez 0.9.2 blockers were finally fixed and release was published and regular
  releases on that line are to be expected.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 35 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Kuhu Shukla on Sun Mar 25 2018

## Committer base changes:

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Thrift Project  [Jens Geyer]

## Description:

 - Apache Thrift is a high performance cross platform RPC and serialization
   solution.

## Issues:

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

 - Since our last 0.12.0 release Apache Thrift a number of bugs have been
   adressed and certain improvements have been implemented in various areas.
 - Version 0.9.3.1 based on 0.9.3 has been released to port the security fixes
   for CVE-2018-1320 into that branch. Due to an oversight the 0.9.3.1 was
   prematurely released to Maven Central prior to a vote. Corrective action
   was taken to properly vote on 0.9.3.1, and that vote passed.
 - A vote for another release 0.12.1 did not pass because the necessary number
   of votes was too low. As a result, we are planning for 0.13.0 as the next
   regular release

## Health report:

 - The project code is healthy and fairly mature
 - Main issue is the ratio between the numbers of active vs. silent committers
   and PMC members. With respect to the relatively complex code base
   consisting of 20+ supported target languages, there is room for
   improvement.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 17 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was James E. King III on Fri Nov 03 2017

## Committer base changes:

## Mailing list activity:

 - Mailing list activity is good, user inquiries are mostly answered very
   quickly, the rest was answered in a timely manner.

 - dev@thrift.apache.org:

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop just completed the release process for 3.3.6 and 3.4.1. Both 
versions contained a few new features, but were largely maintenance releases
carrying a number of bug fixes. At this time, we are focusing on trying to 
release code more often given the big release of 3.4.0 at the start of the
year which took a long time to finalize. We have already started on 3.3.7
and 3.4.2 and would expect to release those in the next two months or so.

In addition to the continued work on the 3.x line, early discussion and 
exploratory work for TinkerPop 4.x have begun. 4.x contains some major shifts
in thinking about the project as TinkerPop reinforces and expands upon its 
already agnostic nature toward graphs and related technology. Specifically, 
TinkerPop 4.x will look to achieve the following challenging and lofty goals:

* Language environment agnosticism so as to not be driven and bound solely
by the Java Virtual Machine. We see this as a logical extension of our 
already successful foray into Gremlin Language Variants[1].
* Data language agnosticism which means that TinkerPop can consume any query
language alongside Gremlin which we see as a logical extension of the success
in sparql-gremlin[2] recently released in 3.4.0, but also demonstrated in a 
number of other external projects like cypher-for-gremlin[3], sql-gremlin[4],
and others.
* Data structure agnosticism which is born of our roots in graph, but can be
extensible to other data forms like tables, documents and RDF.
* Data processor agnosticism which opens the door to a wider array of data
processing models beyond the either-or choice of real-time (OLTP) and batch
(OLAP).

In our previous report, we inadvertently omitted news regarding the W3C 
Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data[5], which, among other 
things, seeks to produce a standard graph query language. The query 
language largely under discussion for that position is GQL[6], which is
effectively the Cypher query language driven by Neo4j, a major player in the
graph database space.

After some discussion, TinkerPop decided not to participate in the W3C
working group directly. Given our long standing position on technological 
agnosticism which continues to expand with each major version, we felt that 
it was not our place to help construct official standards of that sort. The
outcome of that working group may be an ISO standard graph query language, 
and if that is the case, TinkerPop will simply "consume" that standard 
alongside Gremlin, as we currently do with SPARQL and other languages 
previously mentioned.

The wider TinkerPop community saw some additional growth with two new
graph systems that support the Gremlin query language:

* ArangoDB[7] - a native multi-model database 
* Alibaba Graph Database[8] - a cloud-native graph database service

The addition of these major graph systems that support TinkerPop brings the 
total number of graphs supporting the Gremlin graph query language to over
two dozen.

There were a number of talks/papers about TinkerPop, Gremlin and related
projects during this reporting period. Here were some by TinkerPop 
committers/PMC members:

* Introduction to Property Graphs and Gremlin[9] - Harsh Thakkar
* Stream Ring Theory[10] - Marko Rodriguez

Finally, Jason Plurad (PMC) volunteered to organize a Graph Processing 
Track[11] at ApacheCon North America 2019 which will be held in Las Vegas
in September.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.3.6 (March 18, 2019)

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

Community: WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also
quite mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity
required. However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being
fixed, and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the
project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web
Services is no longer considered state of the art, we don't expect a major
uptick in new development efforts, new committers, etc...

Activity: Much of the activity this quarter was around trying to get things
building and tests running with Java 11.  Also minor bug fixes for issues
submitted by users.  In general, not a lot of activity, but not much expected
either. A new release of WSS4J with bug fixes for Java 11 is in progress.
