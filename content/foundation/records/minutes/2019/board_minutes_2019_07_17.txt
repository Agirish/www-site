 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       Planning is well underway for our 20 year celebrations at ApacheCon
       NA in Las Vegas and ApacheCon EU in Berlin. Kudos to all the
       volunteers who are making this happen.

       We are on solid financial footing thanks to our generous sponsors and
       prudent spending. The FY2020 budget was approved and we are once again
       tracking actuals to budget.

       This month saw good progress on Apache's new initiative for equity,
       diversity, and inclusion, including the start of a partnership with
       Outreachy to help us understand better the barriers to contribution to
       our projects. Thanks to IBM who chose to sponsor up to three interns
       at Outreachy to work on Apache projects.

       We will shortly open a call to participation for all PMCs to nominate
       mentors for the Outreachy program. I encourage all PMCs to consider
       participating.

       With this on track, there are still obstacles to the smooth operation
       of this initiative. I'd like to thank Gris Cuevas for her leadership
       and look forward to her continuing to drive progress here.

       Apache was contacted by the European Commission Directorate-General
       for Competition and asked to comment on the proposed acquisition of
       Red Hat by IBM. Both companies are Apache sponsors. After deliberating
       openly on the board list, we decided to let the invitation lapse
       without responding.

    B. President [Sam]

       Financially, we are starting off as we have now for years, ahead on
       income and behind on spending.  As always, the caveat this early in
       the year is that timing of payments affects these results.

       Quiet month for Brand Management

       Fundraising has secured additional sponsors and is pursuing process
       improvements.

       In addition to keeping on top of things and having a pipeline of
       future announcements, Marketing and Publicity has begun on the new
       tasks recently approved in the FY20 budget.

       Finance, Conferences, and Marketing & Publicity continue to work
       closely together.

       Diversity and Inclusion has begun reporting on each of the three
       initiatives identified in the budget request.

       Conferences is wrapping up last minute details for ACNA.  Sponsorship
       levels for ACEU to date is a concern.

       ---

       Meta-governance discussions

       Despite the resolution to establish the position of VP, Diversity and
       Inclusion being rescinded and replaced, confusion continues.  This is
       impacting the ability of the committee that Gris established to get on
       with their important work.

       As I did last month, I will once again state that unless and until I
       hear otherwise, I will assume that the board agrees to the following:

       * VP's reporting to the President can add or remove members of any
         committees that they oversee, and can even create and disband entire
         committees, all without prior board approval.

       * VP's reporting to the President (or anybody they delegate to do so)
         can place any individual on moderation if they feel that they need
         to do so to improve the tone and effectiveness of their lists.
         Similarly, the President and EVP can do that for lists like
         operations@.

       * VP's reporting to the President, as well as the President and EVP,
         can talk to third parties using media such as telephones and
         videoconferences without being required to invite or even provide
         prior notification to others.

       If I'm incorrect in any of these assumptions, I ask the board to speak
       up now.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 8.


       @Roman: Discuss metagovernance of VPs

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operating Cash on June 30, 2019 was $2,302.8K, which is down $57.4K
       from last month’s ending balance (May 19) of $2,360.2K.  Total Cash as
       of June 30, 2019 is $3,696.7K (includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation) as compared to $2,847.9K on June 30th 2018 (an increase of
       $320.0K year over year). The June 2019 ending Operating cash balance
       of $2,302.8K represents an Operating cash reserve of 9.2 months based
       on the FY20 Cash forecast average monthly spending of $250.1K/month. 
       The ASF actual Operating reserve of 9.2 months at the end of June 2019
       is ahead of the budgeted 8.9 month reserve for YTD through June 2019. 
       The ASF Operating reserve continues to be very healthy for an
       organization of the ASF’s size and Operating activity.



       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is ahead of budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $63.5K.  As compared to FY19, YTD revenue
       is ahead by $45.0K because of prepaid revenue for ApacheCon NA 2019;
       however, Sponsorship Program revenue is under budget.



       YTD expenses through June 30, 2019 are under budget by $13.7K.  All
       departments, except for Publicity and Conferences, are under budget at
       the end of June 2019. Publicity and Conferences are over budget 
       primarily due to the timing of some payments, at this early point in 
       the Fiscal year.



       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$117.5K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$194.7K> NI or $77.2K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of Conference payments as well as underspending
       in most depts YTD vs the FY20 Budget.  At this point in the FY we are
       doing very well, ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses,
       even taking timing variances into account.  With regard to FY19, we
       are outpacing revenue, by $45.0K as noted above,  but we are also out
       pacing expenses by $77.5K; thus, year over year NI for FY20 is behind
       FY19 by $32.5K.

       @Daniel: Check in on treasurer availability

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In June, we received 45 ICLAs, four CCLAs, three software grants, and
       one emeritus request.

       Just before the end of the month, there was a DDoS vulnerability
       announced for PGP key servers and clients. We mitigated this by
       temporarily switching to a more secure keyserver instance for
       verifying keys in the Secretary Workbench that limits the signature
       data returned on keys to mitigate this problem. This has caused some
       interruptions to key verification on documents received by the
       Secretary, though work is ongoing to fully return the service to full
       reliability once we can upgrade to the latest release of GnuPG which
       has its own mitigations in place for any keyserver and not just
       keys.openpgp.org. We have been working closely with the Whimsy PMC and
       Infra to continue improving the tooling in this area.

    E. Executive Vice President [David]

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues to go well thanks to our wonderful sponsors. This month
we secured two new Bronze sponsorships and have processed four renewals (2
Silver, 2 Bronze).

We continue the efforts around consolidating terms of an ASF + Targeted
Platinum sponsorship. This has been an ongoing effort with the sponsor, Infra
and Fundraising for several months. Conversation has picked up recently and a
path forward has been identified.

We also continue our relentless pursuit of improved operations by driving
focus on updating record keeping, securing, and maintaining online accounts.
New sponsor agreements and renewals are successfully being processed using
Docusign through Virtual ensuring these activities continue to run smoothly.
Sponsor onboarding is now also done via online form which directly feeds the
central data tracker for sponsors. This unlocks significant automation
capabilities down the road!

Support for events remains on track and doing well. We are continuing to sign
on new sponsors for ApacheCon US and ApacheCon EU as well as working with both
sponsorship lead teams to improve sponsorship sales.

We received $3,135 from individual donors via Hopsie. An ApacheCon Bronze
sponsor also paid their sponsorship fee via Hopsie during this period as well.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - July 2019

I. Budget: we received Board signoff on the proposed FY2020 budget and
projections through FY2024, and have begun to commence activities on select
projects for the ASF 20th Anniversary at ApacheCon.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising by engaging existing sponsors, securing sponsorship renewals (2
Silver and 2 Bronze sponsors), signing and onboarding new sponsors, and
working on ApacheCon sponsorships. Her work with ASF Conferences continues.
There have been several delays with securing and publishing "Success at
Apache" posts over the past couple of months due to limitations in volunteer
availability: this is being corrected. We are working on finalizing and
publishing the ASF FY2019 Annual Report. She has also been supporting the ASF
Board with drafting statements and minutes.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

- 11 July 2019 - The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Program for
  ApacheCon™ Europe

- 24 June 2019 - Statement by The Apache Software Foundation Board of
  Directors

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 260 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 17 items to 54K followers on Twitter.
We posted 8 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 39K organic
impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 1 announcement is in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 4 media queries. The ASF received 865
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,668. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 2,130 press hits vs. last month's 3,263. ApacheCon received
14 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received no analyst queries. Apache was mentioned
in 2 reports by Gartner; 1 report by Forrester; 3 reports by 451 Research; and
2 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: members of the new Central Services sub-group under Marketing
& Publicity have successfully completed the redesign and relaunch of
  https://www.apachecon.com/. Sally continues to develop graphics to promote
  the ASF and ApacheCon, and aims to collaborate with fellow members of
  Central Services on future requirements.

IX. Events liaison: we continue to work closely with Virtual and
newthinking/Plain Schwarz on various advisory and tactical support across
ApacheCon/Las Vegas and Berlin. This includes engaging with various ApacheCon
chairs to promote their tracks on Feathercast, with subsequent blog posts, and
will endeavor to extend the same to ApacheCon Europe. We posted 6 items on the
ASF Events/ApacheCon pages on LinkedIn, tweeted 8 items on the ApacheCon
Twitter account (the event producers are picking up the pace on promoting
event activities and individual sessions). Sally continues to work closely
with ASF VP Conferences Rich Bowen, and plans to scale back her day-to-day
involvement by mid-month, particularly with event sponsorship. She is also
overseeing Sponsor Ambassador activities and the ASF’s presence at upcoming
events such as OSCON (July), Cumbre/CCOSS (September), and Huawei Connect
(September).

X. Newswire accounts: we have 1 pre-paid press release with GlobeNewswire
through December 2020. This order will auto-renew next month.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========

Builds
======
Many Foundation projects use TravisCI for their continuous build/test
system, rather than (or in addition to) our Infra-managed Jenkins and
buildbot systems. Infra has purchased additional capacity for use by
our projects, but we continue to overtax our Travis resources. This is
partly due to a typical tragedy of the commons: projects don't
understand how much they are using (and thus, denying to others). We
found just three projects were using over half of all our capacity.
Lack of APIs and detailed metrics from the Travis system have hampered
work to provide detailed feedback to our projects.

We are investigating alternatives for outsourcing build capacity. Some
suggestions on our builds@ mailing list have been provided, and a
couple targeted sponsorships are being investigated.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Complete our travel planning to attend ACNA 2019 in Las Vegas. The
  entire team will be attending this year.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Complete the migration to Ubuntu (LTS) 18.04 and Puppet 6 (P6)

General Activity
================
- Many migrations to 18.04/P6 have been performed. We are
  concentrating on the oldest systems running Ubuntu 14.04
- The team spent about two hours responding to a DMCA request. More
  information is in the Legal Affairs report.
- Emptying one of our datacenters, by migrating all services/VMs to
  other datacenters (primarily Hetzner).
- Certificate updates for our web sites, and several internal systems.
- Preparing moves for our Subversion server, for Jira, for our primary
  mail server, and for our mail archives. This entails lots of puppet
  work and testing, before "pulling the lever".
- Small in-place upgrade for Jira, to resolve a security issue (which
  didn't apply in our configuration, but just to be safe...).
- Automatically applied topics to all GitHub repositories to group
  them by project (h/t David Blevins), and to carry their DOAP settings
- Resolved a security issue within our Jenkins build environment.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon North America

Registration is open, and the numbers are coming in. As usual, there's concern
with the numbers, tempered by the fact that we have a community which, for
whatever reason, tends to register very late.

The effort to promote project interest in the Hackathons has started.

We still have a number of gaps in the schedule, from speakers who have dropped
out, and for sponsored sessions. We hope to fill all of these in the next two
weeks.

We are wrapping up last minute details, and are mostly focused on promotion at
this point.


ApacheCon Europe

Sponsorships: We currently have 4 sponsors (one at each level plus a second
one at gold level).  This level of sponsorship is low.  Sally is coordinating
with NewThinking to make suggestions and look for solutions. Ticket sales: We
have currently sold 33 tickets.  Our community tends to buy tickets late; we
are not concerned by this level of ticket sales.

Media relations: Sally and newThinking/plain schwarz put out press releases in
German and in English last week.  We have several media partnerships,
including the Irish Tech Times for which Myrle provided an interview

Content: We have sent out speaker acceptances, and formulated a schedule.  The
schedule is public We have all non-sponsor keynotes set, and we also know who
our keynote will be from Google (Leah Cole).  We still need to check
acceptances, send out reminders, and replace any "holes".  We have been
working on Visa letters.  We're trying to set up hackathon coordination, but
it seems to not be "taking". Travel: TAC will be closing on July 18th
(extended from the 14th).  We have been coordinating with them.

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:
- The mailing list and D&I committee are in need of a set of rules of
  engagement for dialogue and collaboration, the VP of D&I will appoint a
  group of experienced individuals to support the committee on this matter


## Activity:
Moving forward, the D&I committee will report activity by project, referring
to the top projects we proposed to the board each fiscal year. We’ll also add
a section on operations to report on bureaucratic tasks and a section for
community highlights where members can share their own efforts and wins.

*** Project:  Survey revamp***
- Started scope of project in a Google Doc for easy collaboration
- Looking for a contractor to start work, Myrle introduced Gris to a potential
  collaborator
- We need help identifying other vendors

*** Project: UX Research on new contributors ***
- Looking for a contractor to start work, Gris is talking to two agencies on
  the week of July 15th

*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***
- The VP of D&I hosted a meeting to discuss a path forward to establish a
  relationship with Outreachy, the notes of the meeting were brought back to
  dev@
- We sent a call for a Community Coordinator, an entity similar to the GSoC
  Chair for the ASF
- We’re laying down plans to catch the next round of internships
- Outreachy’s team sent introductions to Gris and D&I members of Mozilla’s
  working groups

*** Operations ***
- We have gotten approved budget to operate in the 2020 fiscal year
- Our GitHub repository is up and running
- We have started conversations with Outreachy to explore ways of
  collaboration on the research about the experience of underrepresented
  individuals who contribute to Apache projects

*** Community Highlights ***
- We’re working on the production of an event in Latin America that aims to
  increase the representation of Latin tech practitioners in Apache projects:
  ccoss.org
- We had 2 corporate sponsors commit funds to D&I projects, IBM for our
  Outreachy engagement and Google for D&I initiatives

## Health report:
- The committee is active, however some conversations haven’t been healthy and
  we are exploring ways to improve the environment, especially in the dev@
  list
- At this point, the V.P. of D&I is concerned the culture and perception of
  the D&I has been damaged due to recent developments, she will work with the
  committee to focus on achieving small wins that can bring credibility and
  positive energy back to the committee

## Committee members changes:
Removed one member from the committee

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're up 3 to 23, unresolved
issues this month.

We have received our first official DMCA takedown notice and acted
accordingly. The party who submitted the notice considers matter to be
resolved now. The material that had to be taken down consisted of 3 emails
available via mail-archives.apache.org. We are currently in the process of
formalizing a check-list/policy of actions to be taken should the next DMCA
takedown notice arrive.

We have provided guidance to the Incubator PMC around relaxing release policy
for podlings.

We are continue the work with Jakarta EE VP around implications of Eclipse
Foundation Jakarta EE paperwork.

We continue to evaluate additional options for counsel to augment the work of
DLA Piper. We expect to have an update on this in a month or two. Mishi
Choudhary from SFLC is looking into refreshing the relationship with us. In
additional to that we also had Cliff Allen reaching out offering his help.

Legal section of the ASF yearly report has been submitted to Sally

Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.  We have a
proposed resolution for this board meeting to expand the security team
to include Yann Ylavic and Dirk-Willem van Gulik, both of whom have
been on the security alias and doing security related work for some
time.

This month included the security disclosure by a researcher who found
several Apache projects used build scripts that would download
dependencies over http rather than https.  Prior to public disclosure,
we worked to address these examples and also contacted all Apache
projects to have them check build scripts and change to downloading
dependencies securely.  As a result, a number of Apache projects made
changes to their dependencies, some declared they were not affected,
and a few are in the process of being updated.

Stats for June 2019:

      12         [license confusion]
      10         [support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 23 (last months: 44, 29, 39, 35)

      3          [spark], [web site related]
      2          [httpd], [infrastructure], [lucene], [trafficcontrol]
      1          [activemq], [allura], [axis], [beanutils], [commons],
                 [nifi], [openoffice], [struts], [zookeeper]

     In total, as of 1st July 2019, we're tracking 64 (last month:
     73) open issues across 36 projects, median age 120 (last month:
     91) days.  45 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     8 (last month: 8) of these issues, across 5 projects, are older
     than 365 days.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Christian Schneider]

## Description:
 - Apache Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an
   enterprise OSGi application programming model.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- In this period we have rather low activity as the upcoming OSGi specs are
  still in early stage.
- Mainly fixes stable releases
- We now moved the main aries repo to git too. So now all Aries source code is
  available on git and github which makes it easier for new contributors to
  propose changes.
- We decided to work on a new website that has a nicer design and is easier to
  maintain. A new contributor François Papon offered to create the basic
  structure and design for us.
- Last year we decided to have a regular change in PMC chair. So I will call
  for proposals for a new PMC chair.

## Health report:
 - Health of the project is good. We have a low number of active committers
   but activity is stable.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 41 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Carlos Sierra Andrés on Tue Jul 03 2018

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory
data. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory
format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient
analytic operations on modern hardware. It also provides computational
libraries and zero-copy streaming messaging and interprocess
communication. Languages currently supported include C, C++, C#, Go,
Java, JavaScript, MATLAB, Python, R, Ruby, and Rust.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- The community is discussing a 1.0.0 release featuring
  forward-looking binary format stability guarantees. Given the
  nature of the project, this is obviously an important milestone
  for adoption and user support
- Since the last report, a new Buildbot-based CI system has been
  connected to apache/arrow to provide additional build capacity, with
  a bot system called "ursabot" to provide on demand builds, benchmark
  comparisons, and other tools to assist the developer community

## Health report:
- We have been having significant problems with CI build times and are
  discussing strategies to decouple our de velopment process from the
  shared pool of ASF-managed cloud CI resources like Travis CI and
  Appveyor
- The community is healthy, though there were some concerns
  around the 0.14.0 release vote and we are discussing
  conventions around handling issues raised during release
  candidate vetting.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 26 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Andrew Grove on Sun Feb 03 2019

Attachment G: Report from the Apache AsterixDB Project  [Till Westmann]

Description:

Apache AsterixDB is a scalable big data management system (BDMS) that provides
storage, management, and query capabilities for large collections of
semi-structured data.

Activity:

- Development and discussions are active, the community is healthy and
  engaged.
- Apache AsterixDB 0.9.5 and Apache Hyracks 0.3.5 are under review.

Issues:

- Concerning jj's question on release numbering: The product Apache AsterixDB
  currently does not fully support some features (e.g. backup or replication)
  that we would expect from a 1.0 release. So, the current numbering reflects
  the status of the product for production use. There has been no concern
  about this release numbering so far.

PMC/Committership changes:

- The last committer added was Hussain Towaileb on 2018-12-21.
- The last PMC member added was Xikui Wang on 2018-02-02.

Releases:

- Apache AsterixDB 0.9.4.1 was released on 2019-02-22
- Apache Hyracks 0.3.4.1 was released on 2019-02-22

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Thiruvalluvan M. G.]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Francis Chuang]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access,
and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data
not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite and provides a framework for building
local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica has an independent
release schedule and its own repository.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and its
Avatica sub-project.

Since the last report, we have added 4 new committers and 1 new PMC member. In
terms of pull requests and mailing list participation, we are also seeing a
lot new contributors. In our last report, we also noted an improvement in the
review of pull requests by new committers as well as contributors without
committer status. We are seeing a continual improvement in this area with most
PRs receiving an initial ping from a committer or a contributor within the
first couple of days after it's been opened.

A paper illustrating the use of Calcite for streaming-SQL applications was
presented by members of the Apache Calcite team in conjunction with members of
Apache Flink and Apache Beam at SIGMOD 2019.

In terms of releases, Calcite 1.20.0 was released in late June, containing
more than 130 fixes and enhancements. This makes it one of our largest
releases ever. We also released Avatica 1.14.0 in late April, which was then
followed by 1.15.0 in mid-May, due to a regression that broke existing
behavior expected by Avatica clients. A release of Avatica-Go, 4.0.0, was also
released in the middle of May.

We are seeing continual momentum in the project and are very happy to see new
faces, both on the mailing list as well as contributing code via pull
requests. We believe this is a testament to our welcoming community as well as
the commercial applicability of the project.

## Health report:
Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both Calcite and
Avatica.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Same as the off cycle report last month:

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software
related to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions.
Any language and build system are welcomed.


Status

------
Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk
of the project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing
lack of progress.

If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.


Community

---------

In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC /

Commit.



Releases

--------

Apache Rat 0.13 was released Nov 5th, 2018
Apache Rat 0.12 was released in June 2016
Apache Rat 0.11 was released in August, 2014
Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description: 
 Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
 and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 Some good work the past couple of months resolving some long-standing issues
 with S3 compatibility/utility that put us into good position for completing a
 release and adding new committers. 
   
## Health report: 
 Same structural issues as our last report; the utility of the project is
 primarily for developers who are using MapReduce pipelines either
 in local Hadoop clusters and/or migrating them to the cloud, so
 there isn't much new work to do besides those efforts.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP, JMS
or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
The activity this quarter centered around bug fixes for the 3.3.0 release that
released earlier in the year.   There are some discussions happening now around
changes that will be necessary to support Java 13+ which will definitely result
in some added developement efforts.  

## Health report:
For the most part, the project is making steady, but not stellar, progress.
Many of the protocols and specs that CXF implements are mature specs and don't
really change much.   Thus, steady progress and regular releases are a good
thing.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Shawn McKinney]

## Description:
The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
- ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in
  Java, which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides
  LDAP it supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
- LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
  replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).
  This is a "schema aware" API with some convenient ways to access all types
  of LDAP servers.
- Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be used with any
  LDAP server however it is particularly designed for use with ApacheDS. It is
  an Eclipse RCP application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
- Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
  role-based access control, delegated administration and password policy
  services with an LDAP backend.
- Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains various
  tools to access and manage kerberos principals and keytabs. It provides a
  rich, intuitive and interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
  facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2) as desired in modern
  environments such as cloud, Hadoop and mobile.
- Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
          (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.
- SCIMple:  An implementation of SCIM v2.0 specification.

## Issues:

- there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

Per sub-project:

- ApacheDS: good activity: Lots of work being done clearing out JIRA tickets,
  bugs and enhancements.  New release being planned.
- LDAP API: good activity: Three releases over the past quarter addressing
  security issues and new functionality along with significant performance
  enhancements.
- Studio:   low activity: New release planned after ApacheDS release.
- Fortress: low activity: Release 2.0.4 postponed to allow the LDAP API
  releases to happen. Next steps, migrate to LDAP API 2.X, combine the four
  git repos into one, remove ehcache.
- Kerby:    no activity
- Mavibot:  no activity
- SCIMple:  no activity

## Health report:

Number of releases is low compared to previous quarters.  However, there is
quite a bit of activity in LDAP API and ApacheDS.  New releases are planned in
Fortress and ApacheDS that will take advantage of the new code being produced
by the API project.

The PMC feels the overall project is healthy.  There is very low activity in
Kerby and Scimple which is a concern and will be monitored by the PMC.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Fluo Project  [Keith Turner]

## Description:

 - Apache Fluo is a distributed processing system built on Apache Accumulo.
   Fluo users can easily setup workflows that execute cross node transactions
   when data changes.  These workflows enable users to continuously join new

   reprocessing all data.

## Issues:

  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - A good bit of recent activity is focused on making updates that
   were found as a result of testing with Java 11, Accumulo 2.0, and
   Hadoop 3.0.  Hadoop is does not have a Java 11 ready release so
   some small workarounds are required to test on a cluster
   with Java 11 and Hadoop 3.0.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Misty Linville]

## Description:

Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational
database. Apache HBase gives you low latency random access to billions of rows
with millions of columns atop non-specialized hardware.

hbase-connectors is a collection of integration points with other projects.
The initial release includes artifacts for use with Apache Kafka and Apache
Spark.

hbase-filesystem contains HBase project-specific implementations of the Apache
Hadoop FileSystem API. It is currently experimental and internal to the
project.

## Issues:
Board-only information removed from public report.

## Activity:

There have been lots of interesting discussions on the dev@ mailing list.
Highlights:
- HBase 1.2.x is at the end of maintenance (EOM). 1.2.x users are encouraged
  to upgrade to the current stable line (1.4.9) or even newer if they are
  able.
- We had more discussions of EOLing the 2.0.x line, and decided to release a
  2.0.6 release first.

Another goal, spanning several quarters, is to solicit more non-binding votes
on release candidates, as non-binding votes are one signal of broader
community engagement. Based on several discussions, we surfaced the following
further expectations:
- Voting on release candidates is largely about well-formedness of the
  artifacts. A script exists to help determine well-formedness.
- A candidate that gets few votes can be discouraging to the release manager
  (RM).
- A +0 vote is a powerful signal to the RM that you care about a candidate but
  don't have enough information to vote decisively.
- Don't assume a single -1 means a candidate is sunk, even if it looks
  serious.
- If you find a problem, file a JIRA and try to help find root cause. Don't
  rely on the RM to own every problem.
- PMC members are expected to vote on as many release candidates as possible,
  and 1.x releases need more consistent voters. As a reminder, anyone on the
  dev@ list can test and provide feedback on a release candidate, and cast a
  non-binding vote.

Three new committers were added this quarter, and one committer joined the
PMC. More details below. Thanks to the new committers and PMC members for
agreeing to take on more responsibilities in the project.

## Health report:

We're in the middle of the summer in the northern hemisphere, but it hasn't
slowed down the conversation. Subscribers to dev@ are down a bit (-41), but
discussions are still vigorous, with 1524 emails (1064 last quarter).

The same pattern holds for users@, with 61 fewer subscribers than last
quarter, but 184 emails (115 last quarter).

We're still fixing a lot of JIRAs, and this quarter we fixed ever so slightly
more than we created! Numbers below.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for July 2019
The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
viewing this not in that format, it can be seen here:   
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/July2019

There are presently 48 podlings incubating. In June, podlings executed 7 
distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members and no IPMC members 
retired. We have no new podlings this month. A couple of other podlings are 
heading towards graduation in the next few months including OpenWhisk. A 
couple of podlings failed to realise that they can submit their own reports
rather than having to reply on their mentors. DLab, for instance almost
failed to report for the second month, although they did have draft reports
on their mailing list for previous missed reports. Three podlings Amaterasu,
Livy and Tuweni didn't submit a report and have been asked to do so next
month. Three other reports currently do not have sign off BatchEE,
DataSketches and DLab.

There was one IP clearance.

Milagro is trying to reboot themselves, and it's good to see lots of new 
activity, this seems a successful attempt so far, and they are working on a 
release.

BatchEE has decided to leave the incubator and join the Geronimo project as 
that seems a better fit for them than becoming their own TLP.

OpenWhisk has brought up graduation and has a few minor issues around 
releases, communication and branding to address. This again points out the 
challenges the incubator has when ASF policy may not be in line with modern 
development workflows.

Zipkin decided that the incubator wasn't a good fit for them culturally and 
left the incubator returning back to be OpenZipkin. They had a large amount 
of work to do before they could graduate and some of the issues they faced
would have been difficult to solve. It would be fair to say that their 
expectations were not correctly managed when entering the incubator.
There was some debate if a vote needed to be held by the IPMC to record 
this, with some people objecting in strong terms.

The IPMC is still working on if podlings need to follow ASF's release 
policy and distribution policy while in incubation. It seems that more 
people think that the incubator does not have to follow policy. However, 
the board has never granted an exception to the incubator for this, it's 
not in its original charter or documented anywhere. Last months 
proposal to do just this didn't get IPMC consensus.

In these threads, there were a number of good suggestions that could be 
implemented to smooth the progression from podling to top level project for 
some podlings. As usual, it's then difficult to get consensus on and 
implement these ideas. Hopefully, all this will coalesce into some 
action(s) and a new proposal (assuming one is needed) to be put forward to 
the board next month.

It was clarified with Infra that they will allow distribution of artifacts 
that don't follow policy, or rather they won't check and assume anything 
voted on by the IPMC is OK to be distributed. In other words, it's the IPMC 
responsibility.

Legal also clarified what they expected, and it's possibly a bit awkward as 
they (perhaps unsurprisingly) expect a TLP to follow all release policy, 
which includes any releases made by the IPMC. We have not been doing this. 
They went further saying if the incubator is not considered a TLP, or is 
somehow *special* then the legal committee has indicated what they would 
allow in releases. This list is less restrictive than what has previously 
been followed by the IPMC, but still includes some situations where the
incubator shouldn't approve a release.

It's considered that the incubator is a TLP so this still needs to be 
resolved in some way and the conversation is now focused on this.

Possibly getting a bit ahead of itself, the incubator made two releases 
that included issues that it would not usually release; inclusion of 
compiled source code and dependency on Category X software.

Until this issue is resolved, I don't see an end to this issue re-occurring 
every few years as it has done previously. This is confusing for podlings 
as they get mixed or contradictory  answers to their questions depending
on who they ask, and the ASF policy documentation is heavy on the compliance
side. This situation also had a part to play in Zipkin leaving.

The IPMC needs to be clear up front that some podlings may need major 
changes to how they operate, and they need to consider carefully if the ASF 
is, in fact, a good fit for them. The incubator has started work on a page 
outlining the expectations and what some of the issues are that they might 
encounter. there may be some overlap with the recently created Incubator 
cookbook.

A couple of podlings have not been able to attract IPMC votes on their
releases in the usual 72 hours.

A discussion has been started on changing the incubator DISCLAIMER text to 
more accurately reflect that podling releases may not be in line with 
policy. This has no legal standing but is informational.

Several podlings talks and talks about the incubator were accepted for 
ApacheCon North America.

Some of the incubator wiki pages were missed in the transfer and infra are 
looking into why.

A few more podlings have corrected PPMC members not been signed up to their 
private lists.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences.
Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream
and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to
computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than
traditional, exact methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Complete a successful 1st snapshot release of Memory repo to DIST and 
  Nexus. This is a blocking issue.
  2. Finish refactoring/snapshot releasing the other repos, which depend on 
  #1.
  3. Move, refactor Website.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  For the IPMC: 
  As a newbie podling, my experience so far has been exasperating. Finding 
  how to accomplish key tasks is difficult.  The information is spread all
  over and the essential details of how to actually
  accomplish tasks are often missing.

  I have run into multiple roadblocks, especially with regards to 
  permissions. I have to keep filing new tickets with INFRA to setup access
  to infrastructure and they reply that the Mentors need to do this. When
  I ask on general@incubator, the replies I get suggest I need to file
  tickets with INFRA. So I am  confused.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Not much. I wish I could spend more time on this, but I need to get
  the migration done.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  We continue to evolve the project's functionality with commits to our 
  GitHub repos.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

### Date of last release:

  No releases yet.

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?
  At the initial incubation date.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  1. I have opened INFRA issues that have not yet been addressed and there 
  will be more to come. 
  2. I could REALLY use some 1:1 help from an experienced release engineer 
  (perhaps from another project),that is very familiar with the Apache/Maven
  release process and POM to get us off the ground. 
  Once we have created our first release, we can continue from there. But 
  getting this first one is out is turning out to be quite a challenge.
  I don't think we need more than an hour with an experienced Apache 
  release engineer, our project just isn't that complicated.
  3. I haven't heard from any of the mentors for the last week or so, 
  perhaps they are all on vacation.

## DLab

DLab is a platform for creating self-service, exploratory data science
environments in the cloud using best-of-breed data science tools.

DLab has been incubating since 2018-08-20.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Execute the SGA between EPAM and the ASF so code can be imported - done
  2. Complete on-boarding of initial committers - done
  3. Work toward an initial Apache release - release branch created – done

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Not this time

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  All initial committers have completed on-boarding. Also we've added 
  couple of new contributors (some of them are waiting for PPMC to be created). 
  All new contributors are currently onboarding and doing initial work to prove 
  contribution:

  - Andriy Yatskovets
  - Kirill Makhonin
  - Vitalii Solodilov
  - Dmitriy Karbyshev
  - Aliaksandr Semianets

  Also a few new contributors will start submitting their .icla files soon:

  - Andrii Dumych
  - Mykola Bodnar

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The team fully switched our work to Apache Infrastructure: JIRA, Git.

  First release has been made 
  https://github.com/apache/incubator-dlab/releases/tag/2.1-RC2

  Team is actively working on release 2.2 features.

  There will be many new features and conceptual changes introduced in 
  upcoming release. We are introducing a concept of projects within DLab, 
  which will allow to control permissions for groups of Dlab users, improve 
  collaboration capabilities.

  Major improvements will be made in terms of GCP platform deployment. GCP 
  will support majority of the features, currently available in DLab for 
  AWS and Azure Clouds.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  Yes, mentors have been helpful with onboarding and were providing all
  answers timely. We just wish the podling report submission process
  could be supported more timely.

### Help needed by DLab team from Apache:

  We would highly appreciate if following page could start being populated: 
  https://incubator.apache.org/clutch/dlab.html, currently there are many 
  URL’s missing and empty sections.

  The team can provide all needed information, but unfortunately we don't

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## Flagon

Apache Flagon is a generalized user behavioural logging platform for web 
pages and thin-client applications

Apache Flagon has been incubating since 2016-07-13; Apache Flagon has 
officially changed its name from Apache SensSoft.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Accelerate release frequency and reduce branch complexity in repos to 
  reduce adoption, contributor disincentives.
  2. Grow the Apache Flagon Committer/Contributor/Community Base around our 
  core product Apache UserALE.js (Incubating)
  3. Complete the issues highlighted at the Apache Flagon Roadmap [1]

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Apache Flagon is currently suffering from unresponsive mentors:
  * Dave Meikle has been active and engaged, aside from a prolonged outage 
  due to a long-term illness. We are grateful for Dave's help and assistance 
  since then.
  * Lewis McGibbney has been uncharacteristically unresponsive on dev@, 
  private@, and to PM. Note that Lewis has been a champion for us and have 
  confidence that he will return to activity.
  * Atri Sharma has been wholly inactive. We tried to report this in our 
  last Q1 report; when posted to dev@ for review, he maintained that he 
  didn't the ability to cast binding VOTEs as an excuse for 
  non-engagement. We softened the language in our Q1 report and encouraged 
  him to participate by providing guidance, mentorship, and engaging in 
  community VOTEs. We haven't heard from him since despite numerous requests 
  for help and support posted to private@

  As a result of long periods of mentor absence:
  * ReRelease of v1.0.0 (at IPMC ) was delayed until mentors (Dave) were 
  available to guide us through a potential copyright issue (resolved).
  * Prolonged the process of our name change as we struggled to explore 
  Apache documentation and understand what we had to change (in process; HUGE 
  thanks to INFRA for assisting us with some of the details).
  * Is presently impeding our release process (not enough binding VOTES) 
  after tightening release procedures, and working hard to clean up our 
  branch structure to increase this cadence.
  * We have struggled to get timely IPMC sign-off on REPORTs and have been 
  unable to post these ourselves to the incubator wiki for lack of permission.
  * We have had to abandon our prior NPM distribution as it was released by 
  a non-responsive mentor on their personal NPM account (we don't have 
  credentials). [2]

  NOTE as of the date of REPORT (6/26/2019) our ReRelease of Apache Flagon 
  UserALE.js (Incubating) v1.0.0 has been under VOTE on general@ for 9 days 
  (6/17/2019). After community and PPMC   VOTE, we needed +2 binding votes. 
  We received helpful comments from Justin McLean, but despite numerous 
  reminders to VOTE, we still have yet to receive the last +1 binding VOTE 
  from IPMC. We are concerned that without active mentors, our release 
  cadence will remain slow and unresponsive to user communities.

  With Dave Meikle's help, we will be searching for two additional mentors 
  so that our community is self sufficient. We recommend dropping Atri Sharma 
  from the project for non-participation.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has:
  * improved release processes and code base to expedite future releases 
  [3,4]
  * gathered a wide base of users that are eagerly anticipating UserALE.js 
  v2.0.0 via NPM (under VOTE within the community as of this date). 
  * discussed with external parties research applications with university 
  research labs in machine learning and social computing.
  * the community has organically grown with a new contributor, who is 
  participating in VOTEs
  * the community expects to complete major updates to documentation on 
  website and READMEs, in early JUL 2019. Wiki updates will complete shortly 
  thereafter.

  Despite consistent challenges to our community throughout 2018, we are 
  showing signs of growth, continue to have a relevant project, and are well 
  postured to accelerate growth in the coming quarters. We remain committed 
  to learning and adopting the Apache Way.

## Milagro

Milagro is core security infrastructure and crypto libraries for
decentralized networks and distributed systems.

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Continue to build relevant and useful crypto libs 
     and applications for decentralized networks in order 
     to grow the ecosystem of users and contributors to the project. 
  2. Get all functions of the project in line with the Apache Way
     so we stay in compliance and can get a relase under our belts. 
  3. Get a relase under our belts!

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We're growing the list of potential new contributors and 
  collaborators. We have added two new additional 
  contributors and expect more soon as we get 
  milagro-crypto-c in line for release.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The main contributors continue to get their feet wet with Apache 
  processes and methodologies. Big shout out to the infra team 
  who have been helpful in dealing with the paculiarities of our project.
  As an example, we have managed to migrate issue tracking to GitHub,
  but are still using JIRA for release management task tracking.
  Most importantly, we have now moved the website to the asf-site
  branch model and are ready to update the site with documentation.
  Qredo Ltd in London has signed a software contributor agreement 
  that has been registered with legal office. Qredo is contributing its
  server code to become the Decentralized Trust Authority, the first 
  "product" release after the crypto library release.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

[Report] Apache Isis - July 2019

## Description: 
Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven applications
in Java. Users only write POJOs and Apache Isis handles the database and UI
automatically at runtime.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

Work continues on re-platforming the framework on top of Spring Boot for 
the upcoming 2.0 release. This work also includes restructuring of the 
code-base, decoupling functional parts and also renaming of packages to 
prepare for future releases that should support the Java module system.

Migration from DataNucleus (JDO) to Spring-Data, as previously announced 
on the user-mailing list, was postponed. We decided to descope our tasks 
to allow for the 2.0 release to be delivered earlier. Migration to 
Spring-Data is still on the roadmap, but needs more time than 
anticipated earlier this year.

While not yet released, there have also been made improvements to the 
user interface (Wicket Viewer) in the 1.x branch, which are expected to 
be part of the 2.0 release.
   
## Health report: 

We consider the project to be reasonably healthy with enough PMC members 
participating in votes and both project members and users exchanging 
questions and answers on the dev and users mailing lists.

There are two active committers on the framework. While individuals have
come and gone, the total has been fairly consistent throughout the history
of the framework.
  
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 14 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Johan Doornenbal on Thu Apr 05 2018 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 14 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Johan Doornenbal at Mon Mar 19 2018 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 2.0.0-M2 on Tue Jan 22 2019 [1]
   
   
## JIRA activity: 
   
 - 40 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 49 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache James Project  [Benoit Tellier]

## Description:

The Apache James Project delivers a rich set of open source modules and
libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which builds into
an advanced enterprise mail server.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We are concerned about adding committers
and PMC members, as well as increasing the diversity of our community.

During the last three months, we approached some community contributors
who we think would have been perfect candidates, but they declined our
invitations. We will continue active community members

Furthermore, we want to strengthen our community by making contributing
easy to use, feature oriented documentation. The expected long term
effect is a higher engagement from the users.

PMC members proposed several talks for both ApacheCON in Vegas and
Berlin, in order to spread the word about Apache James. Only one talk
("Gaining control over emails with Apache James") made it to the waiting
list.

We are working on releasing Apache JAMES server version 3.4.0, shipping
mainly performance improvements.

## Health report:

Many users exchanges regarding the Apache James server on the user
mailing list as well as on gitter. We try to encourage and accompany
contributions to either documentation or code, where users tend to help
each others.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrea Turli]

== Description==

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of cloud
providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

jclouds continues to accumulate bug fixes but little feature work. Notably we
are struggling with compatibility with Java 8 and newer Guava versions, which
vexes our users.

After a fruitful discussion with the Karaf community, we decided to move
jclouds-karaf and jclouds-cli projects to the Karaf project. This has removed
a blocker for new releases of jclouds, and we think it will help both
communities going forward.

== Community ==

We had 12 contributors this quarter - including several new ones - in addition
to the existing PMC and committers, and more activity on our issue tracker.
Notably, there have been very promising contributions from some new developers
to help with technical debt, particularly to remove uses of an internal
package that makes it impossible to use jclouds in an OSGi environment with
newer versions of Gson.

There is a growing concern around the amount of time being dedicated to the
project, since most of the PMC and committers are now "pure" volunteers (with
$dayjob no longer related to jclouds). Another concern is the lack of
traction, requests, and general interest from the community itself, or from
downstream projects like Apache Brooklyn.

Last committer: 2018-07-23 (Daniel Estevez)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

Unblock the release of jclouds 2.2.0, which will provide Java 8 support. Keep
engaging contributors on Slack, and propose them as new committers as
appropriate. Monitor the PMC and ensure we have enough resources to properly
manage the project.

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.1.2, took place on 2019-02-07.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards for RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time"

## Activity:

The project added a major new component to provide GeoSPARQL, an OGC standard
for geospatial query of RDF data in SPARQL.  Because this large contribution
needed time and effort to integrate, a regular release (3.11.0) was done to be
followed by a release for GeoSPARQL (3.12.0).

The project dev@ list is at normal levels of activity, the users list on the
quieter side though stackoverflow continues to have more user questions than
users@ - and more people answering users questions.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Bruno Demion]

## Description:
 Pure Java application for load and functional testing.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - No release since last report.
 - The project works on dual-migration from Subversion to Git and Ant to
   Gradle. The final objectives are 1/ bring a better (and modern)
   environment for the contributor and 2/ add more automation to the release
   process.
 - The git migration has been completed
 - The wiki (under MoinMoin) has been migrated to Confluence with help and
   slight pressure from Infra.

## Health report:

 - The project has a good activity during last quarter. The migration to git
   has slowdown the commits but it's done. So next quarter should be better.

 specification like JAX-RS providers and websocket (JSR-356) integration.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Status:
We finished and released the implementation of JSR-374 and JSR-367. Current
focus is now to optimize the performance and stabilize the new features. We
also recently added "Portable Java Contracts" to provide the widest OSGi
compatibility.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Joshua Project  [Tommaso Teofili]

## Description:

Apache Joshua is a statistical machine translation toolkit.

## Issues:

 - Activity in the project is very low

## Activity:

 - Since last board meeting a PR from a non committer was merged

 - Based on comment from TD to previous board report, a proposal came up for
   implementing models for CJK languages using more recent (and accurate)
   approaches that use pretrained embeddings

## Health report:

 - The community is essentially the same since graduation. No potential new
   committers / PMC members showed up

 - Mailing lists have very low activity
 
## PMC changes:

 - Currently 10 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition: Wed Oct 17 2018 (Felix Hieber)

## Releases:

 - No releases were performed since graduation

## Mailing list activity:

    - 29 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 17 emails sent to list (40 in previous quarter)  
   
 - user@joshua.apache.org:  
    - 34 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez]

## Description: 

 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

 - As opposed to last quarter, this one has been quieter. 2.11.0.M4 was 
released, fixing a few XSS vulnerabilities, and there's been a some work
towards 2.11.0.M5 which should be out on August.
   
## Health report: 

 - We've seen some spike of activity at users@j.a.o, no questions unanswered
on both mailing lists. We also received a couple of vulnerability reports, 
which are fixed on master and there was a third vulnerability caught by a 
committer, which is also fixed in master. Last but not least, we have an
external contribution waiting to be reviewed at JSPWIKI-1114; it should 
get merged before 2.11.0.M5. 

On the other hand, development has been mostly carried out by a single 
committer, although that's not totally uncommon on the history of the 
project.

TL-DR: project remains with enough oversight, usual slow pace of development

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description:
 - Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
   Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Apache Kudu 1.10.0 has been released with several long-awaited new features
   and improvements, including fine-grained authorization backed by Apache
   Sentry, synchronization of metadata with Apache Hive Metastore, and table
   backup and restore using Apache Spark.

## Health report:

 - User and dev mailing list subscriber growth up by 3% and 4% respectively,
   but their traffic is down by 36% and 21% respectively. Most questions are
   answered relatively quickly, but this decline can most likely be explained
   by people preferring instant messaging on Slack over the mailing list.

 - Website traffic remains the same, users and sessions both up less than 1%.
   We continued working on the revival of the blog with 2 new posts, although
   both were published early in the quarter. The blog traffic is up
   significantly, page views and unique page views both up by 20% compared to
   last quarter's traffic.

 - Development activity (measured by code review, JIRA traffic and number of
   commits) is up overall (reviews -2%, issues +37%, commits +10%). Commits
   were authored by 22 unique contributors (-1 since last quarter).

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 22 PMC members.
 - Yingchun Lai was added to the PMC on Wed Jun 05 2019

## Committer base changes:

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Lens Project  [Amareshwari Sriramadasu]

## Description:
- Lens provides an Unified Analytics interface. Lens aims to cut the Data
  Analytics silos by providing a single view of data across multiple tiered
  data stores and optimal execution environment for the analytical query. It
  seamlessly integrates Hadoop with traditional data warehouses to appear like
  one

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 A bug fix and few improvements suggested by one of the contributors.

## Health report:
As we saw on the roll-call, PMC is active and responsive.  The project is
being used in at least one of the organizations that we know of,  where it is
being used in sustenance mode with occasional changes being made. We are
looking at two of the contributors who are making occasional contributions as
prospective new committers. Project has not  been actively looking for new
committers or PMC, as existing committers and PMC are responsive. But PMC has
not done an outreach to users to get them more engaged.


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 18 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Puneet Gupta on Tue Sep 20 2016

## Committer base changes:

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache MADlib Project  [Aaron Feng]

## Description:

- Apache MADlib is a scalable, big data, SQL-driven machine learning framework
  for data scientists.


## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

- Last release was 1.16 which was the 6th release as an Apache TLP project.
  This was a significant release that included initial support for distributed
  training of deep learning models with GPU acceleration, utilities to load
  model architectures and weights, preprocessing of images for mini-batch
  gradient descent, and support for Greenplum 6 and PostgreSQL 11.  Plus the
  usual bug fixes and minor improvements.

- Community is at work on the 1.17 release.  Scope is still being decided by
  the community, but JIRAs call for improvements to deep learning as a follow
  on to 1.16, and improvements to correlation/covariance, association rules
  and decision tree.

- After that will be the 2.0 release with JIRAs related to versioning models.

- Frank McQuillan (MADlib committer and PMC member) presented at Dell Tech
   World on 2019-Apr-30 on MADlib and Greenplum Database in a talk called "AI
   in a Box".

- Yuhao Zhang, a PhD candidate at University of California, San Diego is doing
  an internship at Pivotal in Palo Alto to work on parameter selection in
  MADlib, which is an important area for deep learning practitioners.  Yuhao's
  advisor at UCSD is Arun Kumar in the Department of Computer Science and
  Engineering, whose research has contributed to MADlib in the past.

## Health report:

The community is relatively small but very engaged with robust mailing list
traffic, interest in doing frequent releases and new functionality being
developed by contributors.

The number of developers actively contributing to the code/documentation is
approximately 8 in the 2nd quarter of calendar year 2019.

We will constantly be on a lookout for new community members to be invited
either as committers or PMC.


## PMC changes:

- No changes in the last quarter.  Currently stands at 14 PMC members.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Maven Board Report - July 2019
---------------------------

## Description: 

 - Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
   development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
   standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
   lifecycle.

## Issues:

  <<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

## Activity:

  In our goal to have all our subprojects stable and to gain focus on the
  subprojects that really matter, we've started to retire several plugins 
  and libraries. In May we had a period where all was green in Jenkins.
  However, after adding additional JDKs some started to fail again. In 
  general the fixes are quite simple, so it shouldn't be too hard to get
  all back to green.  
  
  Retired project(s)
  - Maven Ant Plugin
  - Maven Repository Plugin
  - Maven Artifact Resolution API (Maven2)
  - Maven Runtime
  - Maven Downloader
  
  It is likely that more will follow.

  Github announced a new feature called Github Package Registry. This makes
  it possible to publish the binaries next to the sourcefiles (not just for 
  Java/Maven, but also other technolgies). We've identified several concerns
  that might damage our ecosystem. We've had a conference call with Github 
  and based on that they've already adjusted some features. We're still 
  keeping an eye on this to ensure Java developers can still rely on the
  current eco system.
  
  See also https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-package-registry
  
  We're seeing an increase of PRs that are related to performance 
  improvements. We're missing enough good knowledge to judge these requests, 
  so it takes quite some time to understand why a certain change can have a
  positive effect on the performance. Also ensuring that improvements won't
  be reverted or rewritten in the future is a challenge. We're very glad that
  people take time to look into this.

## Health report: 

  Up until now Maven has been working quite well for both small and large
  Java projects. But we recently see issues with real huge Java projects.
  It looks like Maven 3 has reached its limits regarding the size of Maven
  projects. It becomes more and more important to invest in Maven 4. The
  ideas are already there, but still not the human resources.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Metron Project  [Casey Stella]

## Description:

Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order
to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis.  Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
We released a point release in May, which provided stabilization as well
as infrastructure and abstractions to support other streaming engines.
Also, there was a conference (Dataworks Summit) in May which featured
two technical talks on Apache Metron.

## Health report:

The leadup to and aftermath of that conference seems to have had a
corresponding spike in dev and user list activity.  This is
good as there was a cause for concern during the last board report.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description:
 - Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
   distribute data.
 - Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
   integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are both
   Java and C++ implementations.
 - Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items
   including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi and Apache
   MiNiFi.
 - Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting the
   NiFi classloader isolation model.
 - Apache NiFi Flow Design System is a theme-able set of high quality UI
   components and utilities for use across the various Apache NiFi web
   applications in order to provide a more consistent user experience.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Released Apache NiFi Registry 0.4.0 which allows storage of extensions
   which is a critical step towards us breaking apart the monolithic release
   of today resulting in smaller binaries in Apache infra a mirrors and will
   also bring a better user experience for updating live running NiFi clusters
   and operations in container based environments.
 - The community is working the release preparation and voting process for
   Apache NiFi MiNiFi CPP 0.6.1.
 - Apache NiFi 1.10.0 is progressing nicely with nearly 200 JIRAs already
   included.  This brings powerful features such as sourcing extensions from
   the latest NiFi Registry at runtime, far better model for paramaterized
   version controlled flows, Java 11 compatibility, and much more.

## Health report:
 - Health of the community remains strong with many active release lines,
   feature development, active user and developer base including new
   participants and continued participants.
 - We see considerable commentary on Apache NiFi in the form of meetups,
   conferences, training, and talks including from folks at Google, Cloudera
   and others. A recent tweet from a Ford Motor Company employee says it best
   "Love, love, love @apachenifi   Using MiNiFi opens up IOT innovation in
    amazing ways.  Every IOT device manufacturer, including automotive, should
    consider opening up API's to let developers do their thing! Bringing value
    to your product! "

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene®, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop®
data structures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Development on Nutch 1.16 has been continued at slower speed.
Issues with the dependency management (see NUTCH-2669 and linked
issues) currently block the releases. We still need to wait for
a fix in an upcoming Ivy release, find a reliable work-around
or move to Maven as build system (NUTCH-2292).

Migration of the Wiki from MoinMoin to Confluence is still in progress,
waiting for INFRA-18528 to add missing pages which failed to convert.


COMMUNITY

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Peter Kovacs]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## SUMMARY

Latest Release was in November 2018. The community health in general is
mediocre. Short- and mid-term there is no view of improvement.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

No issues

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines:
1) 4.2.0 is the next minor release, planned to be released into a beta phase.
We have missed our goal on going into the beta in 2018. We managed only to
solve the biggest blockers. Currently dev test versions are being rolled to
be more widely tested.
2) 4.1.x is still in maintenance. We are discussing a parallel 4.1.7 release.
The motivation in maintaining the 4.1.x line is not very high. We will shut
it down as soon as we have a stable release of 4.2.x

## LATEST RELEASE HISTORY

2018-11-18 4.1.6
2017-12-30 4.1.5
2017-10-19 4.1.4

## PMC

There are 28 PMC members as of 2018-Apr-11.

Last PMC member addition was on 2017-Dec-20 Keith N. McKenna (knmc)
Last PMC member withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)

## COMMITTERS

There are 141 committers as of 2018-Apr-11. 

Last committer addition was on 2017-Jan-28 Kay Schenk (kschenk)
Last committer withdrawal was on 2017-Feb-04 Dennis E. Hamilton (orcmid)

## ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Community overall health is mediocre. On user level support and translation
teams are well working. Documentation team is virtual non-existent. We have
issues to bring volunteers on board for development.

We lack resources to build the community up in the area of development and
documentation. We are holding ground with the people we have in development.

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We had issues with Spammers on our template site at SourceForge.

## MARKETING

The booth team has been present at T-Dose [0] on May, 11th in Eindhoven (NL)
representing ASF and OpenOffice. The next planned booth is at FrOSCon [1] on
August, 10 + 11th in Sankt Augustin (D), which will be finalizing the
convention tour of our team in 2019. The feedback is positive and keeps the
project visible. We will continue these efforts.

## DEVELOPMENT

There has been only little overall progress, mainly in translations.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache ORC Project  [Owen O'Malley]

## Description:
 - A high-performance columnar file format for Hadoop workloads.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring the board's attention.

## Activity:
 - We released the bug fix release 1.5.6.

## Health report:
 - It has been challenging to get code reviews on the Java side. We prefer to
   have code reviewed before it is committed, but we allow commit then review,
   so the work doesn't get stuck. Hopefully the new committers will give us
   additional review bandwidth.
 - Two new committers were added this quarter.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
 - Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation
   uses to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Activity:
 - No especially noteworthy activity. There are some plans to make use of
   infrastructure's asfpy libraries for messaging in STeVe to properly quell
   the unicode issues that have popped up during prior elections.

## Health report:
 - As per usual, I did the standard PMC check[1], and we have four members
   reporting in, so still sufficient oversight on an otherwise quiet project.
   There are no outstanding vulnerabilities or major bugs that we are aware
   of, so I can relatively safely state that the project is in maintenance or
   hiatus mode currently, as opposed to unmaintained. If bugs creep up, we'll
   look at fixing them.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Streams Project  [Steve Blackmon]

## Description:

- Apache Streams unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online
  activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets
  accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
  streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## Issues:

- Keeping the existing community active and growing the community remains a
  challenge.

## Activity:

- Activity was low again this quarter, but a check-in thread in Q1 confirmed 4
  attentive PMC members [1]
- Some development occurred this quarter, primarily maintaining and
  modernizing existing modules.
- Several interesting new data integrations are being actively developed but
  have not yet merged.
- Several PMC members are committed to code and community development
  activities during ACNA 2019 hackathon, and ACEU 2019 hackathon, maybe also
  at Flink Forward Berlin 2019.
- Streams-related presentation at Chicago Roadshow in May

## Health report:

- Mailing list and commit participation was low again.  Adding committers and
  growing the PMC needs to be a focus this year.
- Streams is still over-due for a release to incorporate new ActivityStreams
2.0 support and updates to several of our core dependencies.

## PMC changes:

- None. There are currently 8 PMC members.  The most recent PMC addition
  occurred on July 19, 2017.

## Committer base changes:

- None. There are currently 8 committers.  The most recent PMC addition
  occurred on July 19, 2017.

- Perform first binary release
- Additional examples in source tree and on the web
- Export archives of more online services
- Integrations with additional APIs containing profile and activity data
- More support for Activity Streams 2.0
- Reduce disparities between normalized activities and objects of like type
  collected from various data sources.- Deprecate and delete non-essential
  modules
- Drop non-essential third-party maven dependencies
- Support JDKs > 8

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made no GA releases in the last quarter.

Within the last quarter we saw somewhat lowered development activity
with 13 closed pull requests. We invited one individual, from which we
continue to receive high quality contributions on GitHub, to become a
Struts committer. So far the candidate did not accept the invitation, to
our regret.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Georgios Petasis]

## Description:
 - Apache Tcl is home to the Tcl-Apache integration efforts. The purpose of
   our project is to combine the power of the Apache web server with the
   capabilities of the mature, robust and flexible Tcl scripting language.
   Currently only the Apache Rivet project is actively maintained.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - We are still testing Windows continuous integration. The major problem that
   needs to be resolved, is that testing whether the code compiles is one
   thing. It would be nice if we can provide pre-build binaries that can be
   used, but this needs some more work (i.e. to specify the paths the lib
   package is located and shared objects must be loaded from it).

 - We are closely monitoring the changes Tcl version 9 will introduce, and a
   new branch (rivet 4.x) has been created.

 - We have started thinking again Rivet's behaviour on how the "exit" Tcl
   command is executed, especially in a multi-threaded environment. A new
   branch has been created.

## Health report:
 - The project activity is limited to Apache Rivet.

## PMC changes:

## Description:

 - Apache Thrift is a high performance cross platform RPC and serialization
   solution.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - In the past weeks certain issues have been adressed and new features were
   added. We are currently in the middle of preparing for the next (0.13.0)
   release.

## Health report:

 - The project code is healthy and fairly mature.
 - Regarding the ratio between the numbers of active vs. silent committers,
   there is still room for improvement.
 - The level of participation and activity differs between the various
   languages Thrift currently supports, i.e. the bread-and-butter mainstream
   languages usually (and probably naturally) get more recognition and active
   participation than the more exotic ones.

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
In keeping with our decision earlier in the year to release more often,
TinkerPop released 3.4.2 and 3.3.7 at the end of May 2019, which continues
our pattern of releasing roughly every two months. We last released along
the 3.2.x line with 3.2.11 back in January 2019 and since that time no
additional changes have been made to that branch. As a result, the community
has decided to not do any more release on that line of code and have
declared it end-of-life. We have also started work on the 3.5.x line of
development which will contain major new features and changes. At this time,
we do not have any timeline for when this version will be ready for release.

Early discussion and design of TinkerPop 4.x continues. Recall that from
our last report that TinkerPop currently plans a shift toward programming
language, data language, data structure and data processor agnosticism, all
of which are extensions of where TinkerPop 3.x has evolved to this day. Of
key interest in recent discussion is the notion that we will try to make
available some features of TinkerPop 4.x in TinkerPop 3.x which should help
to ease transition between the two major versions for both end users and
the various graph systems out there that utilize the TinkerPop framework.

The wider TinkerPop community saw some new growth with some fresh additions
to the ecosystem:

* Alibaba Graph Database[1] - a cloud-native graph database
* gremlin-rs[2] - Gremlin Language Variant for the Rust programming language

The announcement of Apache TinkerPop support from Alibaba Graph Database was
an interesting surprise as it further confirmed TinkerPop's relevance in the
graph technology space. It was also good to see support for Rust as it opens
up TinkerPop development to that group of developers and widens the
TinkerPop community footprint.

There were a number of talks/papers about TinkerPop, Gremlin and related
projects during this reporting period. Here were some by TinkerPop
committers/PMC members:

* Extending Gremlin with Foundational Steps[3] - Stephen Mallette
* Building an Enterprise Knowledge Graph @Uber[4] - Josh Shinavier
* Introduction to Property Graphs and Gremlin[5] - Harsh Thakkar
* SPARQL and Gremlin Interoperation[6] - Harsh Thakkar

TinkerPop also added a new committer recently. Joshua Shinavier was one of
the original TinkerPop founders of the project from 2009, long before
TinkerPop entered the Apache Incubator in 2015. While he has been away for
a bit, he has returned to the project with interests in the future of
TinkerPop 4.x.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Bryan Call]

## Description:
Apache Traffic Server is a HTTP and HTTP/2 proxy server and cache.  What makes
ATS unique across the landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on
extensibility (plugins), HTTP and HTTP/2 protocol conformity, and performance.
ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs in the world, delivering a significant
portion of all Internet traffic.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - We had our ATS Spring Summit in Beijing China and it had great attendance
with 24 people singing up for the event.  The event was hosted by one of our
PMC members from Skyguard and they did a fabulous job on scheduling meals and a
social event to see the Great Wall.

- Our ATS Fall Summit will be held in the Bay Area and will be hosted by
Verizon Media.  Summits in the Bay Area tend to have a much larger number of
attendees.

## Health report:
- ATS 8.0.3 was released in March as planned.  We are working on a 7.1.7 and
8.0.4 releases and they will be released in August.

Attachment BY: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Daniel Kulp]


Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

## Community
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also
quite mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity
required. However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being
fixed, and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the
project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web
Services is no longer considered state of the art, we don't expect a major
uptick in new development efforts, new committers, etc...

## Activity
Much of the activity this quarter was around some bugs that users
have reported in WSS4J and doing some optimizations in WSS4J for very
large messages (>2G).

## Releases
 - The only release this quarter was WSS4J-2.2.3 on Wed Apr 03 2019

## PMC changes:

- Currently 42 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Alessio Soldano on Tue May 17 2016

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 224 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Alessio Soldano at Sun Sep 14 2014


Last releases:
*  WSS4J 2.2.3 : Apr 2019

Attachment CB: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Lee Whitcomb]
(postponed from June 2019)

Description:
Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
Java platform.

Issues:
This is a postponed report from June 2019, but otherwise no board-level
issues at this time.

Activity:
Some development work has picked up again. No user activity on the mailing
lists. I intend to finish the long-delayed 2.1 release this calendar year,
at which time it seems appropriate to have a discussion about the future of
the project, given the continuing low level of activity. There are now code
issues with the latest versions of Java (9, 10, 11, etc.) that have not been
addressed, and which could become serious impediments in the coming year.

Health Report:
Basically unchanged again this quarter, although there was some small amount
of development activity. Users remain quiet.

PMC changes:
 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Niclas Hedhman on Wed Jan 13 2016

Committer base changes:
 - Currently 9 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago

Releases:
 - Last release was 2.0.5 on Mon Jul 03 2017
 - Still some development on next major version (2.1.0).

Mailing list activity:
 - dev@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 62 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months): 
    - 6 emails sent to list (8 in previous quarter) 
   
 - user@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 168 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 1 emails sent to list (1 in previous quarter)
