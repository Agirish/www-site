 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       Work continues to better understand how Apache can be more welcoming
       to underrepresented communities. The 2019 Apache Diversity Survey has
       been released. All committers should have received a personal
       invitation to take the survey. If you have not done so already, please
       help by taking the survey.

       This has been a milestone year in many ways. I would like to thank our
       sponsors, members, officers, contractors, contributors, and all our
       volunteers for making Apache The Best Software Foundation. Raise a
       glass for freedom; something they can never take away!

    B. President [Sam]

       Financially, expenses are more comfortably under-running budget than
       they were last month; but income continues to under-run.  It looks
       like it will work out, but perhaps we should plan differently next
       year.

       Highlights for areas that I cover (David covers infra and TAC), where
       highlights are things that are notably different than last month:

       - Central services is working on a new landing page and on a number of
         updates to existing pages.
       - http://events.apache.org now shows an impressive line up of 2020
         events
       - Diversity survey launched and has received over 500 results to date
       - Our first Outreachy intern has been selected

       In the new year, I'll be looking to re-balance work with David.  One
       thing we have tentative agreement on is his taking the lead on the
       FY21 budget.  Additionally, I expect that David will take the lead in
       the oversight of the Data Privacy role, should that resolution be passed
       in its current form.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 8.


       @Gavin: document results of fundraising/TAC call

    C. Treasurer [Myrle]

       Operating Cash on November 30th, 2019 was $1,735K, which is up $34K
       from last month’s ending balance (Oct 19) of $1,701K.  Total Cash as
       of Nov 30th, 2019 is $3,158.9K (includes the Pineapple, Restricted
       Donation as well as the Tides Restricted Donations) as compared to
       $3,599.9K on October 31st, 2018, (a decrease of $441K year over year).
       The November 2019 ending Operating cash balance of $1,735K represents
       an Operating cash reserve of 7.5 months based on the FY20 Cash
       forecast average monthly spending of $229.8K/month.  The ASF actual
       Operating reserve of 7.5 months at the end of November 2019 is a bit
       behind the budgeted 8 months of reserve for YTD through November 2019.
       The estimated YE Operating reserve of 8.2 months is ahead of the
       Budgeted YE reserve of 7.6 month.  The ASF Operating reserve is above
       the ASAE standard average of 6 months of reserve for Non Profits.



       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is behind budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $469.1K, partly due to ACNA19 Registration
       income was behind but the budget but was,  offset to a degree,  by
       ANCA 19 Sponsorship exceeding the budget.  Public Donations are a bit
       behind as is Foundation sponsorship due to some timing of payments (
       The open Accounts Receivable is very healthy at $1,123.2K). As
       compared to FY19, YTD revenue is behind by $95.9K primarily due to
       timing of some Sponsor payments.



       YTD expenses through November 30th, 2019 are under budget by $203.3K. 
       All departments are under budget, except for Conferences.  As noted in
       last month’s narrative the budgeted loss for ACNA19 was $55K and we
       were estimating it to be in the $110K-$120K loss range, once all
       expenses are in.  As noted in the October Narrative, the estimated
       loss for ACEU19 could be 107K Euros, however as ACEU19 took place in
       October 2019, the final reconciliation is still being compiled.



       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a negative
       <$668K> NI vs a budgeted negative <$402.2K> NI or $265.8K behind
       Budgeted NI for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of Conference payments, Timing of TAC, Timing
       of the Lease web payment as well as timing of Sponsor payments vs the
       FY20 Budget.  The cash forecast has been updated, with the information
       we have at hand,  and at this point more than halfway through the
       Fiscal year, we are still on pace to meet our budget.  I would urge
       all dept heads to review, their depts in the Cash forecast, for the
       last 5 months of the Fiscal year,  and let us know if there is
       anything that they are aware of that could change the estimates for
       the remaining five months of FY2020.  This effort will make the Cash
       forecast a much more accurate management tool for the Foundation  
       With regard to FY19, we are behind in revenue, by $95.9K as noted
       above, but we are also ahead on expenses by $693.7K (due to ACNA19 and
       the Lease web payment which should have taken place in FY19, but did
       not); thus, year over year NI for FY20 is behind FY19 by $789.6K.  It
       is estimated that this will even out, to a degree,  as the FY20
       progresses.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Assigning committers@ and www.apache.org to Marketing and Publicity

       Our infrastructure team typically requires that there be an owner
       (generally a PMC or a committee or officer) for every resource.  To date,
       commmitters@ and www.apache.org have been exceptions.  To address this, the
       President proposes that the following takes effect at the start of the 2020
       calendar year:

       1) Marketing & Publicity gets final approval for all emails sent to
       committers@, as well as all emails addressed to all committers whether or not
       it uses such a list.  An example of this was as the recent email announcing
       the Diversity and Inclusion survey. Greg has a todo to come up with a proposal
       for guidelines.  Marketing & Publicity will ensure that the tools used for any
       emails that do not make use of the committers@ list are approved by the VP,
       Data Privacy.

       2) Marketing & Publicity would be responsible for Ownership and management of
       www.apache.org.  This would make things clearer for Central Services which
       will administer such pages as they would have a single source from which to
       get answers.

       This should provide clarity over list ownership whenever future
       infrastructure tickets are brought up regarding these lists.

       Send an email to press@ for inquiries about this list.

    B. Loomio Pilot

       Daniel Gruno and Sam Ruby have an instance of the Loomio application
       up and running on ASF Infrastructure and integrated with Apache OAuth.
       As the board is a potential user of this tool, lets take the
       opportunity to have a brief overview and answer any questions the
       board may have.  Results of the discussion will be brought back to the
       appropriate mailing list, and discussion can continue there after the
       meeting.

       The initial focus of this service would be for Foundation topics (and
       in particular, on the board mailing list), though the potential for
       wider community use may be possible in the future.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Our typical Fundraising operations continue as usual. Several renewals have
been processed and several are in flight. We saw a pleasant change in
sponsorship level with one sponsor upgrading from Bronze to Silver. Two bronze
sponsors have rolled off (on has gone out of business and the second is not
renewing). We continue working with a new Silver sponsor, but progress is slow
due to email deliverability challenges

We are excited to have completed onboarding for two new Targeted Sponsorships.
The Apache Cordova project received an anonymous donation and Cloudbees is
providing benefits to ASF Infrastructure https://s.apache.org/buq73

Although we've only just closed all remaining ApacheCon 2019 payments, work
for ApacheCon and the various roadshows in 2020 has begun.

In November we received $8,686 from individual and corporate donors via Hopsie
with THREE QUARTERS ($6,519) being raised during the Individual and Corporate
Giving campaign, which launched on 27 November and will continue to run
through the end of 2019.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity — December 2019

I. Budget: we are on budget as planned. No outstanding payments are due at
this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising with ASF Sponsor renewals, onboarding new Targeted Sponsors,
launching the end-of-year Individual and Corporate Giving campaign, and
working with virtual to close out outstanding sponsor payments. Additional
support provided includes publishing the Foundation Statement on the sale of
the .org registry https://s.apache.org/zkthl , helping launch the 2020 ASF
Community Survey for Diversity & Inclusion https://s.apache.org/pzol5 , and
provide strategic and tactical support for ASF Conferences, ComDev, and Brand
Management. We published the Foundation Operations Summary (quarterly report)
for Q1 FY2020 https://s.apache.org/a6s40 , and are preparing the Q2 report for
publishing before the end of the year. We helped develop an FAQ for a new
project. Two Platinum Sponsor case studies/profiles (similar to
https://s.apache.org/jKNc ) are on hold due to Sponsor scheduling. The ASF
documentary, “Trillions and Trillions Served”, is in post-production.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 4 December 2019: The ApacheⓇ Software Foundation Welcomes CloudBees as its
   Newest Targeted Sponsor at the Platinum Level

IV. Informal Announcements: 8 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 283 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 33 items to 55.5K followers on
Twitter, and posted 6 items on LinkedIn that garnered more than 101.2K organic
impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones, "Did You Know?" success stories, “Have You Met?”
highlights, and “Project Perspectives” profiles are requested to contact Sally
at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to two media queries. The ASF received 1,411
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,313. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 2,322 press hits vs. last month's 2,260. ApacheCon received
126 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 2 requests for fact-checking of an
upcoming analyst report, and have also been working on a few insights
projects. Apache was mentioned in 3 reports by Gartner; 4 reports by
Forrester; 3 reports by 451 Research; and 4 reports by IDC.

VIII. Central Services: Kenneth Paskett is working on updates to the ApacheCon
pages, Apache PLC4X theme, ASF Fundraising pages, and Apache project logo
pages (in collaboration with Daniel Gruno). He is also creating a new landing
page for Central Services, which will utilize Jira for project progress. The
volunteers for editorial services have mostly been unavailable over the past 6
weeks, aside from Swapnil Mane, who has continued to publish the majority of
the Weekly News Round-ups. We have also had to adjust our publishing schedule
of our “Success at Apache” series due to the availability of volunteer
contributors.

IX. Events liaison: we are supporting members of the Apache community who are
managing ASF booths by providing with signage, stickers, and swag for upcoming
third party events, including DevNexus, FOSDEM, and Huawei Developer
Conference 2020. We are also assisting ASF Conferences with planning and
advisory assistance for 2020 Roadshows and ApacheCon. We are working with ASF
VP ConCom Sharan Foga on stickers/swag production for community events as well
as various project MeetUps in China.

X. Newswire and press clip accounts: our pre-paid press release package and
clipping service have been set to auto-renew through 2020 to ensure we have
constant access without interruption.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- Likely to hire a Technical Writer/Editor this month

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Complete LDAP configuration changes.
- Solve httpd stability problem.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Complete the work on transitioning our email archives, and the email
  delivery systems.

General Activity
================
- Testing CloudBees Core for some Jenkins features, notably requested
  by the Apache CouchDB community. The system may be useful for other
  communities, particularly to fence off their allocated/donated job
  nodes to that community.
- Standing up some ARM Jenkins nodes.
- Getting Pootle in line for AOO, along with investigating other
  online collaborative translation tools.
- Upgraded Confluence.
- Testing some new GitHub features for our projects' usage: Pages, and
  Actions (along with Secrets for the Actions).
- Turned off our SonarQube server, in favor of the donated services
  from SonarCloud.
- New OTP command line tool for sudo access.
- Testing automated redirects for mail archives over to lists.a.o
- Some work to ensure svn authz is functioning correctly, and to
  simplify ongoing management.

Uptime Statistics
=================
- Our Subversion server has seen errors with "stuck" processes. We
  have seen similar behavior on our TLP website servers, and the
  Bugzilla server, so it appears to be due to the particular usage and
  configuration of httpd. We've spent a good amount of time trying
  different approaches of traffic management, configuration,
  reporting, and analysis. We are optimistic that it should return to
  stability shortly. It appears the root cause was our migration to
  the platform in early November.
- Our DNS provider was pointing at our old hidden master. We are
  investigating an alternate solution for DNS, to remove this reliance
  and problem vector.


-----------------------------------------

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Events
======

Currently supporting Travel and Accommodation to attend FOSDEM 2020 for ASF
Committers. Applications were open from November 23rd until December 10th. We
did not get very many applications. Of those, 4 have been accepted and they
will be informed over the next few days. With more preparation being possible
next time, and for the next event like Berlin Buzzwords, we anticipate a much
longer opening period for applications, more time for advertising etc.

Miscellany

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

Contributors Gris Cuevas Katia Rojas Georg Link

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:

The Survey launch plan surfaced the need to work with the V.P. of Data Privacy
Policy to define a scalable long term solution to reach out to people when
applying the ASF community survey.

## Activity:

*** Project:  Survey revamp***

The 2020 ASF Community Survey was launched on Dec 05, 2019 according to it's
launch plan [ 1 ]

We have had so far: 423 responses from unique links and 131 from the open
link.

Survey closes on January 4th, 2020.


Please, promote the survey in your project mailing lists using the message
shared by Sally in the pmc@ and ppmc@ lists.

You can find a template to promote the survey with the link to the public
version here [2]

Further reminders to take the survey won't be sent.

*** Project: UX Research on new contributors ***

We will start preparations to recruit people to interview.

We will also take a look at preliminary answers from the survey to draft
interview questions.

We are still on track to kick this off on time per the reviewed scheduled or
finishing the project on May 2020.

*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***



*** Operations ***

- We selected our first Outreachy intern and she has accepted the internship
  [3]. The interns selection was announced on the alums page on Nov. 26, 2019
  at 4pm UTC. The project is Migrate Apache Juneau PetStore Sample Application
  To Spring Boot Standalone Application [4]

-  Internship period is from Dec. 3, 2019, to March 3, 2020.

- The first mentor's review has been submitted to Outreachy and it is
  positive. Mentor's feedback about the last two weeks of internship is also
  positive.

- In order to address the problem of attracting applicants to the program we
  are developing a tooling training manual to help newcomers: Getting started
  at Apache [5]

- Friction log: we keep working with the friction log coordinators of the
  Survey Design & Contributor Experience Research project. We updated the
  first template of friction log with feedback provided in the dev@ mailing
  list, thread: First draft of friction log template. See updated draft [6].
  We are waiting for the coordinator's feedback before reopening the
  discussion on the mailing list.

- We keep working on the migration of previous meeting notes to Confluence to
  create a report that includes all action items, to make the process more
  transparent.



## Health report:

The dev@ and diversity@ mailing lists continue to be slow, not too much
activity outside the work done for each ongoing project. The discussions have
been focused on topics that pertain to the projects we are running.
## Committee members changes:

None.

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're up 4 to 24, unresolved
issues this month.

Sadly, there has been no progress with Eclipse foundation mainly because lack
of time on our end with key volunteers (Roman and Mark Struberg) we will try
to do better next month.

I had a call with Qualcomm clarifying some of the ramifications of the patent
clause in the Apache License. Based on the discussion, I'll be proposing
additions to our legal FAQ soon.

Attachment 12: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [John Kinsella]

Having been unable to devote enough time to the role John Kinsella has
indicated privately that he wishes to stand down. Given the need for action to
unblock operational risks a proposal to move the VP role to the President has
been added to the agenda as item 7B. Dirk-Willem van Gulik has agreed to
volunteer. (danny@)

site that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, wiki
pages, blogs, and more for any number of individual projects.

## Issues:

- No issues needing board attention.

## Activity:

- Large merge request from a new contributor is awaiting review
- Movement towards Python 3 hasn't been as fast as we'd want, but still on
  the short-term roadmap

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Any23 is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to automatic crawling, parsing, analyzing, producing, validating and converting 
RDF (Resource Description Framework) data

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Any23 was founded 2012-08-27 (7 years ago)
There are currently 15 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Hans Brende on 2018-02-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Hans Brende on 2018-02-21.

## Project Activity:
Although project activity has been low since October, Any23 is very close 
to a version 2.4 release. One of the IN PROGRESS tickets relates to fixing 
all spotbugs issues so this is taking a while. 
Recently a Docker build was developed and committed to the server repository.

## Community Health:
In October, the Any23 community decided to simplify the core repository by
extracting the Any23 plugins and server modules into separated repositories. 
This consensus indicated decent community health.
A new use case for Any23 is being realized at NASA JPL relating to
enterprise knowledge graphs so it is envisaged that
more community contributions will ensue from that.

## Project Activity:
We're in the middle of releasing a new version of our software. The voting is
currently open for the second RC for version 0.22.0 and only needs one more
vote to meet quorum. Mauricio Garavaglia has proven to be a very valuable and
very active addition to the PMC and has helped the project regain stability
after the departure of many folks including our former chair. With his help,
as the community health statistics show, we've been able to get more work
done, more fixes, and even land some new features into the master branch. We
will be looking to add more committers and possibly PMC members in the very
near future.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Axis was created on 2001-01-19 (18 years ago).

There are currently 63 committers and PMC members in this project, a vote in
2010 made all committers automatically PMC members.

Community changes, past quarter:

## Activity

- Axis2 Java 1.7.9 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Axis2 Java 1.8 (development)

- Axis2 C 1.7 (development)

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained.

We received and applied several patches this past quarter, see AXIS-2935 and
AXIS2-5969. There was light but consistent traffic of new users this past
quarter on the Axis2 users mailing list.

While best known for SOAP, the future of Axis2 is with JSON and REST - which
it supports well though its not well documated nor does it yet have the modern
auto config features that would make it easier for new users.

Work continues on removing the com.sun classes from the Axis2 client code, so
it can run on JDK 11 which the server code now supports.

The axis 1.4 branch, last released in 2006, has had several security patches
applied however its far from being able to run on JDK 11, which would also be
a compelling reason to upgrade for those users that remain.

Axis2 C PMC member Bill Blough has continued his progress via upgrading the
build system this past quarter. The communication continues to be good.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.
## Releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## JIRA Activity for Axis2 java

- 11 JIRA tickets created in the last 90 days.
- 3 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 90 days.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

## Description:
The mission of Bahir is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
Extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as Apache Spark

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Bahir was founded 2016-05-17 (4 years ago)
There are currently 40 committers and 11 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Prashant Sharma on 2018-10-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Łukasz Antoniak on 2019-01-21.

## Project Activity:
Apache Bahir community continues to see a flow of contributions enhancing
the existing extensions for both Apache Spark and Apache Flink.

A new SQS stream connector is being proposed/reviewed as a new extension
for the Spark platform. 

For the Bahir Flink extensions, multiple bugfixes and dependency updates
have been provided and is now available in master. A release of the Flink
extensions are still pending. 

## Community Health:
Overall community activity has decreased in the last quarter, with lower 
mailing list traffic, hopefully this will pickup again on the next year.

Also, there was a question related to committer:pmc ratio, and tha is a side
effect that we offered committer access to all Apache Spark committers when
the project was created, and a not all of them became very active, and thus
didn't become PMC members.

## Trademark/Branding
* No known issues.

## Legal Issues
* None


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Kenneth Knowles]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Beam is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data processing, 
enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution engines and 
providing extensibility points for connecting to different technologies and 
user communities.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Beam was founded 2016-12-20 (3 years ago)
There are currently 63 committers and 21 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 3:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Pablo Estrada on 2019-05-13.
- Alan Myrvold was added as committer on 2019-09-24
- Brian Hulette was added as committer on 2019-11-14
- Daniel Oliveira was added as committer on 2019-11-20

## Project Activity:
We crossed 10,000 pull requests! That is just a cumulative milestone, but this
quarter alone was extremely active. Number of days from PR #1 and PR #1000:
211. Number of days from PR #9000 and PR #10000: 71

Some notable technical developments, focusing mostly on integrations:
 - A new experimental Spark runner based on Spark structured streaming
   framework is available on master for testing. To fully support the Beam
   model, it will require Spark structured streaming to support multiple
   aggregations, but it can be tested for batch jobs in the meantime. [1]
 - A new Jupyter notebook integration, dubbed "interactive beam", was proposed
   and implemented, and remains under heavy development. [2]
 - Portability continues to mature, with significant use and development of
   Python on Flink, and maturation of multi-language pipelines, in which a
   "Beam Python" pipeline can include connectors and SQL from Java. The Go SDK
    intends to primarily support this mode, to avoid re-implementing any
    connectors, so this will lead to "Go on any data processing engine".
 - The beginning of transition from AWS v1 to AWS v2 [3]. Many other
   improvements across a many connectors to storage systems.

Some notable community resolutions and discussions:
 - Discussion of Beam Summit 2020 [4]
 - The Beam community has decided to adopt a mascot, the Firefly. [5] [6]
   Currently being designed by community members.
 - We documented Jira priority explanations and release blocking policies [7]
 - We joined a pledge on https://python3statement.org/ to discontinue Python 2
   support in 2020. [8]
 - A renewed discussion and interest is communicating effectively with Beam
   users the maturity and stability of different components. [9]
 - Another renewed conversation around a more formal "BIP" (Beam Improvement
   Proposal) process, to improve clarity of approval and development of bigger
   changes. [10]
- Our Outreachy proposals did not receive contributions in the needed
  timeframe, despite some initial interest. They may not have been
  appropriately scoped for an Outreachy internship. [11]
- LTS (Long Term Support) version has not been very successful, with zero
  patch releases, because no one really seemed to want one. We may designate
  another one and try harder next time to really finish a patch release and
  measure its uptake.

A continuing pain point is our release process being slow and cumbersome. The
2.17.0 release has been underway for over 6 weeks. Such a burden is not
approachable for volunteer contributors.


## Community Health:
The community is vigorous, but the balance of activities is imperfect.

Mailing list stats are worth mentioning because dev@ traffic is getting *very*
large. It does not include Jira/Jenkins/GitHub notifications. Even some steady
contributors have indicated that they cannot really follow the dev@ list.

- dev@beam.apache.org had a 23% increase in traffic in the past quarter (1820
  emails compared to 1478)
- user@beam.apache.org had a 32% increase in traffic in the past quarter (446
  emails compared to 336)

The open PR count (steady state) has climbed from about 100 to over 150. This
is not due to more PRs being opened. The PR open rate is about the same. The
PR close rate is also about the same. I think this implies we have been
steadily falling behind further and further. Cultivating new
contributors/committers may help, as well as highlighting or trying to
incentivize code review by existing committers and also by non-committers.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Youngwoo Kim]

## Description:
Bigtop is a project for the development of packaging and tests of the Apache 
Hadoop ecosystem. The primary goal of Bigtop is to build a community around the 
packaging and interoperability testing of Hadoop-related projects. This 
includes testing at various levels (packaging, platform, runtime, upgrade, 
etc...) developed by a community with a focus on the system as a whole, rather 
than individual projects. In short we strive to be for Hadoop what Debian is to 
Linux.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Bigtop was founded 2012-09-19 (7 years ago)
There are currently 37 committers and 27 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jun He on 2018-11-25.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jun He on 2018-02-23.

## Project Activity:
* Bigtop community have discussed and developed next 1.5.0 release.
In upcoming release, we will update the support matrix of Linux distributions
and also bump up up-to-date version of Bigtop components.
* Alongside 1.5 development, Bigtop community discussed about 
'Cloud Native Bigtop' as well. The purpose of CNB is building a 
big data and analytics distribution for cloud native world.
* What we are trying to achieve via Cloud Native Bigtop are pushing for 
replacing traditional packaging and provisioning to new container based tooling 
and platforms. Eventually, Bigtop project can help move data 
infrastructure to more simple and cloud native platform along with 
related projects in ASF. 
  

## Community Health:
* Overall, commits and discussions on the community have increased. 
* During the last period, there were discussions and development activities 
on upcoming release and new features.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

## Description:
Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the
CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in
Java, Python, PHP, .NET, Objective-C, and JavaScript (and possibly other
languages).

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Chemistry was founded 2011-02-16 (9 years ago)
There are currently 38 committers and 36 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Laurent Mignon on 2017-09-23.
- No new committers. Last addition was Laurent Mignon on 2017-09-20.

## Project Activity:
There was almost no activity in the last three months.
Last releases were in 2017.

## Community Health: 
We have a mature code base. No major development is expected.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Paul Angus]

## Description:
Apache CloudStack (ACS) is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud
orchestration platform. ACS manages many types of hypervisors, storage and
networking devices.

## Issues:
- The security ‘team’ is triaging a number of issues, progress is slow but
  steady.

## Activity:
-  the community has voted to accept two new sub-projects within CloudStack:
   https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate (see below)
   https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-kubernetes-provider (the CloudStack
   provider was removed from Kubernetes core code by the Kubernetes community
   as part of a ‘streamlining of the core’ exercise – the provider will now be
   maintained separately by the CloudStack community)
- The community has coalesced behind the development of an all-new UI
  (Primate). It is hoped that the use of modern tools and a modern interface
  will encourage a new wave of users and developers to get involved.  The
  outgoing UI is somewhat antiquated. A special interest group (SIG)  holds
  bi-weekly meetings and reports updates on dev@. Certainly, some ‘new faces’
  have got involved in the UI’s development already.
- A ‘winter’ LTS release would be expected in early Q1 next year, but no
  announcement has been made along those lines yet.

## Health report:
- Apropos of the activity report; the project is considered healthy

## PMC changes:
- Currently 51
- no new PMC members were added since the last report. The following members
  were added in the previous quarter: Andrija Panic, Gabriel Beims Bräscher,
  Bobby Stoyanov, Nathan Johnson, Sven Vogel

## Committer base changes (2 added since the last report):
- Currently 121 committers
- Most recently added committers: Sven Vogel on March 18th 2019 and Dennis
  Konrad on March 21st 2019

## Releases:
- 4.13 was released on 24th September 2019

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Commons is the creation and maintenance of Java focused 
reusable libraries and components.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Commons was founded 2007-06-19 (12 years ago)
There are currently 148 committers and 38 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alex Herbert on 2019-05-09.
- No new committers. Last addition was Alex Herbert on 2019-01-30.

## Project Activity:
The community is active and accepting a majority of its contribution 
through GitHub PRs.

Our releases this period were:

PARENT-50 was released on 2019-12-17.
POOL-2.8.0 was released on 2019-12-11.
SKIN-4.2 was released on 2019-11-25.
RNG-1.3 was released on 2019-11-11.
DAEMON-1.2.2 was released on 2019-10-03.
BCEL-6.4.1 was released on 2019-10-02.
BCEL-6.4.0 was released on 2019-09-24.

## Community Health:
Most activity is GitHub PRs.
Mailing list and Jira is active and questions are handled in a timely manner.

Commons allows any ASF committer to commit
(though of course we do expect prior discussion for new committers).
Additions to the PMC will result in additions to the committer group, but
there is no need to do this for other occasional committers.
So the size of the committer LDAP group is not necessarily a reflection of
acive committer numbers.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Olaf Krüger]

## Description:
Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop. Because the
FlashPlayer reaches its EOL at the end of 2020, we won't be able to
target the browser with Flex after 2020.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Flex was founded 2012-12-19 (7 years ago)
There are currently 69 committers and 45 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Olaf Krüger on 2017-08-28.
- No new committers. Last addition was Greg Dove on 2016-09-07.

## Project Activity:
The "flex-dk-converter-maven-extension" was released in order to simplify Flex
and Apache Royale builds. With this release current projects using this
extension can simplify the command line instructions by removing "-s
settings-template.xml" and not depending on that xml file anymore. That makes
the build process less verbose and more easy for the users.

## Community Health:
Activity on users list is still decreasing. Activity on dev list is
increasing, mainly because of the latest Maven related activities. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

## Description:
Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java, Scala, Python, and
libraries for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam, Calcite, Hadoop,
Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

## Issues:
  - There are no community issues that require board attention.

## Membership Data:
PMC members added since the last board report:
  - Jark Wu joined the PMC on November 8th, 2019
  - Becket Qin joined the PMC on October 21st, 2019

Committers added since the last board report:
  - Zhu Zhu was added as committer on December 17th, 2019

The newest PMC member is Jark Wu, joined on November 8th, 2019. The newest
committer is Zhu Zhu, joined on December 17th, 2019.

Flink currently has 52 committers and 26 PMC members.

## Releases
The following releases were made since the last board report:

  - 1.8.3 was released on December 12th, 2019.
  - 1.9.1 was released on October 18th, 2019.
  - shaded-9.0 was released on November 23rd, 2019.

## Project Activity:
  - The community has frozen the feature set for the 1.10 release and is now
    in the testing and validation phase. The release adds various enhancements
    to the runtime (easier memory configuration and threading model) and many
    enhancements to the "batch on streaming" capabilities of Flink, including
    the Table API/SQL and integrations with the SQL/Hive ecosystem.

  - There is an ongoing discussion how to better handle the use of the Apache
    Flink name in China, where there is a large community. The ASF does not
    have the trademark for Flink in China. The suggestion from Apache
    trademarks is that the PMC does outreach and education for now, and not
    push for a trademark registration process at the moment.

  - The PMC voted to start an WeChat account for Flink that is managed by the
    PMC. Similar to the @ApacheFlink Twitter account, this channel would be
    used for various types of Flink news and to publicize interesting
    mentionings of Flink from users and contributors.

  - The Flink community voted to accept the "Stateful Functions" project as
    contribution. https://statefun.io/ Stateful Functions is a library built
    on Apache Flink to support new use cases that are not easily mappable to
    the existing APIs, but more of a match distributed actor frameworks. The
    library was already open source and Apache 2 licensed.

  - The community is exploring to migrate the CI service fully away from
    Travis CI. Currently Pull Requests are tested through a separately-paid
    Travis subscription to take load off the ASF-paid account/budget, which
    is only used to test the master branch.
    The goal is to have everything in Azure Pipelines, which offers better
    tools as well as the opportunity to hook in external build servers that
    Alibaba is offering to sponsor. We hope that this both simplifies Flink's
    build setup, as well as reduces feedback times on Pull Requests
    significantly.

  - The next Flink Forward community conference will be in San Francisco on
    March 23rd-25th. There is a public call for presentations:
    https://www.flink-forward.org/sf-2020/call-for-presentations Apache
    committers can contact the organizers for a free pass.

## Community Health:
After a big increase in activity in the previous quarter, the mailing list
activity seems to be stable now.

  - user@f.a.o (1730 mails/quarter)
  - user-zh@f.a.o (570 mails/quarter)
  - dev@f.a.o (3057 mails/quarter)

JIRA continues to be active as well, 1096 JIRA tickets created, 833 JIRA
tickets resolved in the last 3 months.

## Description:
The mission of Apache Guacamole is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to providing performant, browser-based remote access

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Guacamole was founded 2017-11-14 (2 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 4:3.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carl Harris on 2017-11-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Joel Best on 2019-01-30.

## Project Activity:
Contributions from the community covering improvements to LDAP integration,
RDP keymap support, and the SSH/telnet terminal emulator have been merged.
Contributions covering REST API documentation and improvements to CAS support
are now under review. Core RDP support finally builds against the 2.0.0
version of the FreeRDP library. Support for non-core RDP channels remains to
be ported to the new library.

## Community Health:
The community is active and healthy, however there has been a decrease in
activity relative to last quarter across most metrics. The reason for the
decrease is unclear.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server. Gump's intention
isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that makes people look
beyond their project's boundaries and helps the projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version control
systems. The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well as non-ASF
projects and their dependencies. It started in the Java part of the foundation
but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and XMLUnit.NET.

# Summary

Some of the older projects that are no longer depended on by anybody have been
removed. This includes Forrest. The Tomcat community now seems to be the only
one still using Gump actively.

# Releases

Gump has never done any releases. One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the time
following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

# Changes to the Roster

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure the ASF
installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark Thomas join
in November 2014.

Brett Porter has left the PMC in December 2019.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and 
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here: 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/December2019

There are presently 45 podlings incubating. In December, podlings executed 
13 distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members and no IPMC members 
retired. There were one IP clearances.

We have one new podling this month StreamPipes; other is under discussion 
NuttX and two others a possibility. No projects graduated last month. Omin 
and Tephra exited the Incubator and became sub-projects of Phoenix. BatchEE 
is trying to complete becoming a subproject of Geronimo. At least one 
podling is heading towards graduation in the next few months. The Warble
podling did not submit reports and will be asked to report again next month.
TubeMQ has not been bootstrapped yet.

Weex is actively working on its branding issues mentioned last month.

Further work was done on cleaning up the incubator web site, including the 
cookbook.

Podlings, have continued to use the new disclaimer policy, and this seems 
to be working well. TVM asked the Incubator to review a release candidate 
before making a release, and several issues were identified and fixed. 
PageSpeed, which joined the Incubator in October 2017, also put its first 
release up for a vote. A couple of releases needed IPMC prodding to get 
votes, but most were quickly voted on.

Some statistics were generated, showing how many project enter and leave 
and how long they stay in incubating to see if any trends were visible. 
While the overall trend is up, there has been a decrease in podlings 
joining the Incubator in the last couple of years. There may be a number of 
reasons for this, including the outside perception of the ASF. It is likely 
that the carrying capacity of the Incubator had been exceeded in years 
before this. There have been 315 projects helped by the Incubator, and 77% 
of them have graduated, most spend 1 1/2 years in incubation. There's been 
more than a 1000 mentors.

The Incubator release area was cleaned up and old releases from retired and 
graduated projects removed.

A new branding/trademark question was added the podling report and the 
podling proposal as a few podling have not realised the importance of this. 

A new top level project called Petri, was approved by the board. It's goal 
is to help external projects go straight to TLP, not using the Incubating 
process.

     Comments:  Crail seems to be slowing down. Only about 5 emails per 
       month on the dev list, no significant code contributions for six
       months, no new committers or PPMC members added for a year. A new
       release is welcome, especially if it spurs community activity.
       I am worried that Crail will never acquire sufficient momentum to
       graduate.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## MesaTEE

MesaTEE is the next-gen solution to enable general computing service for
security-critical scenarios. It will allow even the most sensitive data to
be securely processed to enable offshore businesses without leakage.

MesaTEE has been incubating since 2019-08-19.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Finish the initial setup for MesaTEE and its sub-repos.
  2. Choose a suitable name for MesaTEE and rename the repos.
  3. Make the access control mechanism and RPC framework more scalable and
  ergonomic.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Regarding to the CI system, we do have some problem with migrating the
  webhooks. MesaTEE definitely requires CI runs on customized hardware.
  However, the Apache INFRA team is pretty conservative on adopting novel CI
  systems which support customized hardware and self-hosted agent, such as
  Github Action, Drone etc. We observed that Apache projects depending on CI
  running on customized hardware, such as incubator-tvm, experienced
  difficulty to migrate its webhooks and was challenged several times on the
  reason of using customized hardware in CI. Besides, we observed that 
  Apache Spark is using Github Action, while we are blocked on it (see 
  INFRA-19381).

  The bootstrapping process seems slow due to the above problem. We have a
  temporary workaround to use our Drone CI system. It leverages a sync bot
  which automatically sync up incubator-mesatee and a testing fork and
  triggers the webook of the testing fork. For management, we force the
  developers to put the link of CI status for each PR in their PR message. 
  It works, but we really desire the integration to new CI and self-hosted
  CI agents.

  For the renaming, we found a new name "Teaclave" which is not used
  anywhere.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  MesaTEE has one more contributor this month, and merged 50+ PRs from 13
  contributors.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  We implemented the new access control system in MesaPy, and merged into
  MesaTEE. The new access control system is much more powerful and flexible
  than traditional user/role/group based access control system, and is
  memory-safe and trusted with the help of MesaPy and MesaTEE.

  We improved the MesaTEE infrastructure to make it k8s-friendly. We
  refactored parts of the MesaTEE system and are doing on others.

  We improved the build system. We deprecated the old-fashioned Makefile, 
  and only kept the cmake system.

  We figured out a temporary solution for integrating the Drone CI system 
  and self-hosted agents by syncing up incubator-mesatee and testing fork,
  and triggering tests on the testing fork.

  We are improving the built-in RPC framework to use prost to automatically
  generate Rust source codes from protobuf's protocol definitions.

  We fixed a couple of bugs reported from the open source community.

## SAMOA

SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most
common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification,
clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop
new algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines
(DSPEs). It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on
several DSPEs such as Apache Storm, Apache S4, and Apache Samza.

SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Revitalize the project by resuming development
  2. Enlarge the user base and contributing community

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Nothing important. It took more than 2 months to create the account 
  of Corey Sterling, as it seems that some things are still done manually, 
  and there was a mistake with his email address. Finally, we could solve 
  it out.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  *  Mailing list activity:
   * @dev: 33 messages

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Retirement has been suggested due to its very low activity
  * To restart engagement, Corey Sterling has been elected as commiter in 
  late August. With his help, we prepared a new release of Apache 
  SAMOA, that is already being discussed and voted (RC).

## APISIX

APISIX is a cloud-native microservices API gateway, delivering the
ultimate performance, security, open source and scalable platform
for all your APIs and microservices.

APISIX is based on Nginx and etcd. Compared with traditional API gateways,
APISIX has dynamic routing and plug-in hot loading, which is especially
suitable for API management under micro-service system.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating

  1. More Apache Releases and more committers act as release manager to 
  release a version.
  2. More committers and PPMC members.
  3. Branding issues in the documentation, code, website, etc.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  - We are proud to have launched the first apache release (0.9).
  - Learning Apache way and its value behind rules, working in Apache way.
  - We have 13 committers and 46 contributors (including 13 committers)
    contributing to Apache APISIX.
  - PPMC members of Apache APISIX elected a new committer
    lilien1010@HelloTalk, who is the first non-initial committer.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has been quite health, with more than 88 pull requests,
  83 of them have being merged in November. These pull requests are authored
  by a diverse set of contributors. We also suggest and guide users from
  QQ group to make issues at Apache APISIX mailing list, which is helpful
  for people who have the same issue and tracking bugs. The active and busy
  dev subscribe mailing list dev@apisix.apache.org has received more than
  120 emails with various subjects, all of which are well repled.

Some highlights of recent developments:

  - Launched the first apache release 0.9.
  - Added advanced debug mode which is friendly to the developers.
  - Added new uri redirect plugin.
  - Use an entirely new jsonschema which performance increase by 
    an order of magnitude.
  - Enable HTTP2 support and settings for ssl_protocols.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?
  Mentors are responsive and helpful. Things tend to be on the right way.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand and trademarks?

  At present, there are still some brand and trademarks problems. `APISIX` 
  was the name of `Apache APISIX` before entering the incubator, so the 
  search results of `APISIX` currently obtained through the search engine 
  actually belongs to `Apache APISIX` and are completely controllable.

## ShardingSphere

ShardingSphere is an ecosystem of transparent distributed database 
middleware, 
focusing on data sharding, distributed transaction and database 
orchestration.

ShardingSphere has been incubating since 2018-11-10.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Clear Brand issues with other ecosystem projects.
  2. Further ASF culture and processes.
  3. Make more apache releases.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No. Right now, the brand issues are under control, so we think board or 
  IPMC may do not need do any actions for now.
  
  There are still several related project on GitHub org in ShardingSphere
  ecosystem, before or during project joined the ASF incubator, such as
  extension modules, extension module examples and acceptance test are not 
  in Apache repo. 
  We have already moved some extension modules into Apache repo, 
  and plan to transfer all of them soon.
  
### How has the community developed since the last report?
  
  1. Ya Li, Zhiyi Yan have been voted and joined as committer.
  2. There are 89 people to contribute codes to the main repo, there are 15 
     new contributors during last report. 
     We are happy to see the community are growing up.
  3. Over 100 companies have confirmed they are using ShardingSphere 
     through issue report, and show at powered-by page[1]. 
     Individuals from different companies and communities have provided 
     some patches to feed back ShardingSphere community.
  4. Share a topic for Apache way and how to join ShardingSphere community 
     in Apache meetup at Tsinghua University.
  5. Finish Podling Maturity Assessment for ShardingSphere[2].
  6. Plan to establish a co-meetup with Apache DolphinScheduler(incubator) 
     in Beijing at Dec 8th.

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:

--------------------
## Spot

Apache Spot is a platform for network telemetry built on an open data model
and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Revive community activity (Discussion in mailing lists, increase 
  frequency of commits)
  2. Create a new roadmap and release plan that will improve adoption.
  3. Make it easier to contribute to the project (e.g. documentation, 
  framework).

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  No

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  There are community members that have reached out and are interested in 
  contributing, but there are only a couple of active committers at this 
  time.  Currently the main hurdle for new contributors is the amount of 
  effort required today to deploy Spot and build development environments.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Open PRs with sufficient votes against the master branch and SPOT-181 
  epic have been merged.  There's also been a substantial amount of work
  to categorize all of the open JIRAs into a Project board on Github to
  help the community more easily triage high priority issues, organize
  feature enhancements into future epics, clean-up closed tickets, and
  also group issues that require more information from the community
  before taking action.  Additionally there's been some work to clean-up
  the asf-site branch, and minor updates (PRs are being pushed soon).
  There's a larger project to re-organize the asf-site to make it easier
  for the community to update and add new pages, but that hasn't started
  yet.

  The project with the most priority going forward is to make Spot easier 
  to deploy.  There's a large learning curve for deploying Spot today, which 
  makes it difficult for both users and committers to be successful when 
  standing up Spot, using certain features, testing, and making 
  contributions back into the project.  Using Cloudbreak to stand-up an
  environment and deploying Spot as an Ambari package will help lower the
  barriers to entry for new and existing users and contributors alike.
  We expect during this project that we'll also uncover a number of deployment
  issues and incompatibilities along the way and by resolving these will also
  help bring confidence to users that this new deployment pattern will be
  better tested and reliable.

## StreamPipes

StreamPipes is a self-service (Industrial) IoT toolbox to enable non-
technical users to connect, analyze and explore (Industrial) IoT data
streams.

StreamPipes has been incubating since 2019-11-11.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Finish the initial setup
  2. Make a first Apache release
  3. Grow the community

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  
  There are no issues right now.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  
  All initial committers have subscribed to the new mailing list. 
  We started to spread the project on Twitter and other channels to 
  reach more potential community members, but currently, the main priority 
  is to move the project infrastructure to Apache. 
  There was also one event focused on extending the developer base:
  * We gave a talk at a meetup on "Self-Service IoT Data Analytics with 
  StreamPipes" (~70 participants)

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  
  This is the first report after StreamPipes joined the incubator on 
  November 11th.
  Most work during the last month was focused around setting up StreamPipes 
  and doing some legal paperwork to transition StreamPipes to Apache:

  * Creation of mailing lists
  * Setting up the new StreamPipes Jira
  * We made a last pre-Apache release and started to refactor our code 
  (restructuring the code base to reflect the new repository structure)
  * The website and documentation is already moved to Apache Git 
  repositories, 
  and a draft is online at streampipes.apache.org, however, we need to wait 
  to "announce" the web page   and forward traffic from the existing 
  domains untilthe Git repos are all transferred
  * All initial committers have signed and submitted their ICLAs
  * FZI has submitted a CCLA and donated the initial code base to Apache
  * Right now, we are waiting to transfer our existing Git repos from the 
  streampipes organization to the Apache organization on Github
  * We are also waiting to get admin access to the StreamPipes instance on 
  Jira to import existing issues to the new issue tracker

  We would really like to thank our mentors. Chris was very helpful and 
  responsive in setting up the infrastructure, and all questions we had
  on the mailing list were answered immediately by our mentors.

### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?
  
  * We initiated an initial podling name search and created a ticket to get 
  the name approved in Jira (November 25th).
  * The name "Apache StreamPipes" got approved by VP Brand Management on 
  December, 12th

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Marcel Reutegger]

Apache Jackrabbit: Board Report December 2019
=============================================

## Description:
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming implementation
of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content repository is
 stable, largely feature complete and actively being maintained. Jackrabbit
 Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
 repository as a modern successor to the Apache Jackrabbit content repository.
 It is targeted for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and
 other demanding content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak
 does not implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it
 is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All maintenance
branches and the main development branch are continuously seeing moderate to
high activity.

We continue making regular feature releases of Jackrabbit Oak. The most recent
release was Jackrabbit Oak 1.20.0 that was made available on November 25th.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of the work
going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly driven by
dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

## Health report:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all mailing
lists reflecting the activity of the respective component.

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user lists as
well as on the various JIRA issues.

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the JIRA issues
and the desire of the individual contributors to bring features and
improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 56 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members. Last additions were Mohit Kataria and Nitin Gupta on
   2019-08-08.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

## Description:

 - jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
   Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification
   for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an
   implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR).
 
## Issues:

 - There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.
   If the board has explicit requirements for future reports, please 
   make it available. It is not always clear how much level of detail
   is required and I generally prefer not to bother the board for trivial
   issues or for issues in which no action is needed from the board.
 
## Activity:

 - jUDDI - last release was 04 DEC 2018. Resolved several requisite bugs for
   updating SCOUT. A demo site has been stood up on ASF INFRA at 
   https://demo.juddi.apache.org.
   Next release planned before the end of the year.
 - SCOUT - last release 10 DEC 2018. Resolved several bugs and dependencies.
 
## Health report:

 - Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in all
   likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.
 - There has been some new feature development recently related to enhanced 
   security and access control mechanisms.
 - There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to
   potential security issues. There were no issues raised since the last
   report.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Libcloud Project  [Tomaž Muraus]

## Description

Libcloud is a Python library that abstracts away the differences among
multiple cloud provider APIs.

## Issues

There are no issues which require board attention at this time.

## Project Activity

We released 3 new releases since the last report. That includes 2
releases with major new changes and improvements

We are also looking at releasing v3.0.0 early next year which will drop
support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. This date coincides with Python
2.7 EOL (January 2020).

This will allow us to simplify the code base and remove a lot of boiler
plate code which is / was needed to support Python 2 and Python 3 through
a single code base.

## Community Health

Community state is similar to the one in the last report.

We have received a good amount of activity on Github (this includes
merging multiple community contributed pull requests).

We also received a good amount of downloads / installations on PyPi (primary
method of installing the library) -
https://pypistats.org/packages/apache-libcloud.

## Membership Data

- Currently 13 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

- Currently 22 committers.
- Clemens Wolff was added as committer on 2019-07-15

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Cassandra Targett]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core
- PyLucene is a Python extension for accessing Lucene

## Issues:

During this quarter, one member of the PMC publicly called out the significant
tech debt Solr specifically is carrying with regard to features collectively
called "SolrCloud" (Solr's distributed mode) as a way of spurring us to action
(https://s.apache.org/66ri1).

The PMC realizes that the state of SolrCloud efficiency, reliability, and code
is something that needs to be improved drastically to better suit the needs of
ever-increasing scale of deployments and workloads that Solr is being used
for. Towards that, we recognize the challenges, and have solutions that we're
aggressively working towards.

The PMC feels we have this situation under control, and now need to follow
through with improvements in this area.

## Membership Data:
Apache Lucene was founded 2005-01-18 (15 years ago)
There are currently 82 committers and 53 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Kevin Risden on 2019-06-25.
- Atri Sharma was added as committer on 2019-09-18
- Bruno Roustant was added as committer on 2019-11-22
- Houston Putman was added as committer on 2019-11-13

## Project Activity:
We released Lucene and Solr 8.3 and 8.3.1 since the last report.

With 8.3, we expanded our Spanish language support in Lucene, as well as added
new PostingsFormats and several optimizations and enhancements. Solr added
support for two-dimensional collection aliases and improvements to caching and
math streaming expression support.

An 8.3.1 release was made for Solr to provide an emergency fix for a
corruption issue and lock our integration with Velocity from being able to
load external resources except when explicitly allowed by the system
administrator.

We are just beginning the release process for Lucene and Solr 8.4 and hope to
have that completed before the end of 2019.

PyLucene is actively voting on a 8.3.0 release.

We are still working to change our build system from Ant to Gradle. We are
making progress on that front, and hope it will be complete before the next
board update.

We are also working on migrating our project website from being built with the
CMS (via SVN) to being built with Pelican (via Git).

We are making a couple of changes to how we work together:

* We're discussing how to semi-require code reviews by defining project
  guidelines.  We invite a board member to help/advice how to navigate this
  balance.

* We're discussing use of a new "Solr Improvement Process" inspired from those
  of other projects, e.g. Kafka Improvement Process (KIP).

* We started a quarterly virtual committer meeting by video conference.

## Community Health:
Due to the changes we made right before the last report to the board to move
Jira and Jenkins notifications to their own lists, activity in our devs@lucene
list declined dramatically (-82%). I think I speak for all of us, however, in
saying that it is much easier to follow conversations now.

The main Lucene user list (java-user@lucene) saw a 50% decline in traffic,
while the main Solr user list (solr-user@lucene) saw a 19% increase. I'm not
sure there is anything to worry about in regard to the Lucene list decline,
but we will continue to monitor it.

Code contributions remain quite strong: we had 1560 commits (-18%) from 86
contributors (+10%_ and a 19% increase (197) in GitHub pull requests compared
to last quarter.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

There has been some progress in the last couple of months:

The broken NativeFSLock has been fixed for non-Windows platforms. The
remaining Lucene 4.8.0 modules, Lucene.Net.Analysis.OpenNLP (the Lucene 8.3
replacement for Lucene.Net.Analysis.UIMA) and Lucene.Net.Analysis.Mofologik
and its dependencies have been ported. ICU4N has had some API refactoring to
be more .NET-like and the API documentation comments have been (mostly)
completed. ICU4N has also had 2 releases on NuGet. A new project named J2N was
started to host the JDK-like types that were haphazardly lumped into the
“Support” namespace in both Lucene.NET and ICU4N. Full API documentation and
tests are being added, bugs fixed, as well as optimizations and finished
implementations. J2N has had 2 alpha releases to date. Now that the porting
work is complete, the focus has shifted to improving performance. Some
bottlenecks and potential bottlenecks have been identified, a few of which
have already been addressed. The API doc website (and the automation to
generate it) is continuing to be improved (thanks @Shannon Deminick and @Steve
Temple). It has been determined that NUnit has adequate repeatability for end
users to be able to debug random tests without having to port the
RandomizedTesting runner (which was previously our biggest remaining task).

Additionally, Aaron Powell blogged about Lucene.NET recently
(https://dev.to/dotnet/implementing-search-in-blazor-webassembly-with-lucene-net-4mpi)
and it was re-tweeted by Jon Galloway from Microsoft this week. Thanks Aaron
and Jon!

The mailing lists have been pretty quiet, and no new issues have been opened
recently. However, we are working on getting another beta release out soon.

== Remaining Work on 4.8.0 ==

We updated the itemized list of remaining issues for both Lucene.NET and ICU4N
and have arrived at the following estimates to production release:

Lucene.NET 4.8.0

Hours Completed: ~3850 Hours Remaining: ~600

ICU4N 60.x

Hours Completed:  ~500 Hours Remaining: ~300 (assuming we don’t port any more
of it) Hours Remaining: ~750 (ported to feature completion)

Lucene.NET 8.x Upgrade

Hours Completed: 0 Hours Remaining: ~1700

The primary items left to complete for the 4.8.0 release are migrating the
remaining types from Support to J2N (with improved implementations, tests, and
benchmarks), the API docs, and ICU4N.

== Releases ==

* Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012
* Working toward 4.8.0 - Currently beta0006, released 2019-08-13

== People ==

* Last PMC Member added May 2017, Shad Storhaug (nightowl888)

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    In this period of reporting, 1 of tickets has been created and
    1 resolved, basically, We added a new feature to support PMDK based 
    Persistent memory infrastructure and improved the code according to 
    community contributor's feedback, there are still some bugs at the
    service part, those bugs is very difficult to diagnose, we may need 
    more contributors to invest engineering efforts on that to make memory
    service stable and mature to use.

Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - no new PMC member added since Jun. 2018.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 13 committers.
 - No new committer added since Jun. 2018.

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.12.0 on Sep. 04 2018

report; we have other candidates in our watchlist and we will do our best to
grow both groups as soon as we identify good candidates; as usual the
community is actively involved in improving the trunk, fixing vulnerabilities,
stabilizing the release branches and in various discussions and support
requests posted mostly in the mailing list and in our issue tracker.

- 4.7.0 was released on 2019-12-04.
- 4.6.0 was released on 2019-05-05.
- V2 2.0.11 was released on 2019-02-16.

People from the community plan did several security contributions in the form
of a code review. As result three CVEs were requested and related JIRA issues
were created and fixed.

## Community Health:

Overall community health is good.

The V4 code line is on steady development also reflected in related
discussions on mailing list and new created JIRA items. Release of V4 version
4.7.0 was done in December this year.

The V2 code line had minor bugfix contributions as well as open and new
created JIRA items.

Over the last months there were fewer new JIRA issues  created then in the
past quarter (-27% created).

We closed as many JIRA issues as in the past quarter.

We used GitHub more and get 13 PRs closed which is an increase by 333% to past
quarter.

2 Google Summer of Code projects were completed in this quarter. With them a
new UI was introduced for OODT and main OODT components were dockerized to
support k8s deployment. These features are being further enhanced under 2.x
developments which are yet to be released.

After around one year silence, OODT 1.9 was released in this October which
included the major update of making Avro RPC the default. We are working on a
maintenance release, 1.9.x to address a backward compatibility issue
introduced with 1.9 release due to avro being default over XML RPC.

## Community Health:
Mailing list activity was high due to recent release and completion of GSoC
projects. Jira and PR activity were lower compared to last quarter since GSoC
projects finished at the beginning of this quarter.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache PLC4X Project  [Christofer Dutz]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache PLC4X project is creating a set of libraries for 
communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a 
variety of protocols but with a shared API.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache PLC4X was founded 2019-04-17 (8 months ago) There are currently 9
committers and 9 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
1:1.

- No new PMC members. Last addition was Łukasz Dywicki on 2019-07-28.
- No new committers. Last addition was Łukasz Dywicki on 2019-07-28.

However we just invited Lukas Ott to join the project as a comitter and he has
accepted the invitation. We are now waiting for his ICLA to be recorded on file.

## Project Activity:

Releases:
- 0.5.0 was released on 2019-11-25

Community Events:
- 2019-09-09 - 2019-09-12 ApacheCon NA 2019, Las Vegas, US (Multiple talks and
  hackathon)
- 2019-09-24 IoT Hessen, Kassel, Germany (From the chip to the cloud with
  Apache)
- 2019-10-22 - 2019-10-24 ApacheCon EU 2019, Berlin, Germany (Multiple talks

We have been continuing to port existing drivers to the new code-generation
framework. Also have we been implementing new protocols (Mostly based on paid
gigs from the industry). A lot of bug-fixing has been done and we're looking
forward to a big refactoring and brainstorming Hackathon form 2019-12-17 -
2019-12-19 in Weinheim, where we are going to work on a proposal for the
version 1.0.0 API.

## Community Health:

This quarter for most of the time activity on the mailing-list and in the
commits had dropped to worrying levels. This was mainly related to high
workload on the day-jobs of the community members. However in the past 2-3
weeks a lot of new people have joined discussions and submitted PRs and the
existing committer- and PMC activity has picked up again.

- dev@plc4x.apache.org had a 8% decrease in traffic in the past quarter (349
  emails compared to 379)
- issues@plc4x.apache.org had a 73% increase in traffic in the past quarter
  (132 emails compared to 76)

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and 
maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface 
to underlying platform-specific implementations. The primary goal is to provide 
an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if 
not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is 
built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work 
around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.

## Issues:
No issues at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Portable Runtime (APR) was founded 2000-12-01 (19 years ago)
There are currently 67 committers and 42 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Ivan Zhakov was added to the PMC on 2019-11-05
- No new committers. Last addition was Evgeny Kotkov on 2017-09-13.

## Project Activity:
Nothing to report in the project.  Activity has been subdued,
with a small amount of work focussed on Windows platform issues.
No milestones are in view.  This may be seen as a reasonable
baseline state for a project that is stable and mature.

## Community Health:
The community remains quiet but responsive.  In the short term, no change,
but perhaps worth noting that we may have improved since a few years ago,
as relatively-recent team members have somewhat rebalanced the project's
platform expertise towards Windows where we have at times been thin.

## Community Health:

- During the last period the activity of the community (mailing lists, JIRA,
  releases) has been slower than during the last period.
- As the most work is done in the dependency projects and the activity 
  in ServiceMix project is slower, we actually observe no potential

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for December 2019

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running of our rule update infrastructure
and our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

SpamAssassin 3.4.3 was released on 11 December, 2019, somewhat over a year
since our previous release. We now intend to return our development focus to
our main branch for 4.0.

We are having disruption to our automated processing due to denial of service
attacks against the SVN resources.  Thank you to infra for fighting this
attack.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.3 on 11 December 2019. 
It contained two CVE fixes and resolves all known outstanding open security
issues on the project.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Committer/PMC changes:

Most recent new committer:

Paul Stead (pds) 12 September 2018

## Project Activity:
- Version 2.1.0 was released on 2019-10-31. This represents a new release line
  making the currently supported release lines 2.1.x, 2.0.x, and 1.2.x. Earlier
  releases are considered EOL.
- I have announced my resignation as PMC Chair. We will hold nominations
  and an election in the near future and submit a resolution to the board.
- We have begun rotating release managers.

## Community Health:
- This has been a quiet quarter with respect to email and issue activity. This
  can be attributed to a quieting down from the previous quarter that included 
  a flurry of activity related to the lead-up and follow-up of the 2.0 release.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Isuru Udana]

## Description:
Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

## Issues:
None identified.

## Membership Data:
Apache Synapse was founded 2007-12-19 (12 years ago)
There are currently 34 committers and 26 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:7.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Prabath Ariyarathna on 2017-05-04.
- No new committers. Last addition was Prabath Ariyarathna on 2017-02-10.

## Project Activity:
We were expecting to see an increase in the activity of the project after the
Github move. But it didn't happen to the expected level.

We are having discussions on the PMC list on how we can improve the activity.
One of the major discussion points is that whether we should position Synapse
as an integration framework rather than an ESB. The world has been moved
towards container friendly products, microservices, and cloud-native
technologies. With a little effort, we could make Synapse a container friendly
product that suits any architectural style for doing the integration.


## Community Health:
dev@synapse.apache.org had a 16% increase in traffic in the past quarter (36
emails compared to 31) 
Activity in the Jira has also gone down in the last quarter.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Unomi Project  [Serge Huber]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Unomi is the creation and maintenance of software related 
to providing a reference implementation of the OASIS Customer Data Platform 
specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical 
Committee

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Unomi was founded 2019-02-20 (10 months ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 6 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was David Griffon on 2019-02-20.
- No new committers. Last addition was Taybou on 2019-04-01.

## Project Activity:

The Apache Unomi community is highly focused on working on the next version
(1.5.0) that will include major improvements including:
- Support for ElasticSearch 7.5 (including an automatic migration tool from ES
  5.6)
- Support for JDK 11
- Support for Apache Karaf 4.2

Some of these improvements required important changes to the underlying
persistence layer but fortunately migration will remain pretty
straight-forward as the REST API has not been touched at all.

On going efforts on onboarding and documentation are also paying off we are
seeing newcomers the users mailing list.

## Community Health:

The activity in the development mailing list mostly reflects all the current
work being done and mentioned in the activity. On the users mailing list
however we are seeing more newcomers which is great, and hopefully this is a
result of the efforts on the onboarding work being done.

We still want to continue to grow the community and make it easier to get
people to join the community. Also, we are seeing quite a lot of activity on
Slack which is not reflected in the standard Apache metrics. It might be
interesting to setup some kind of Slack digest in the mailing list.

Here are some community metrics:

- dev@unomi.apache.org had a 157% increase in traffic in the past quarter
- users@unomi.apache.org had a 100% increase in traffic in the past quarter
- 11 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (no change)
- 8 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (33% increase)
- 134 commits in the past quarter (509% increase)
- 10 code contributors in the past quarter (66% increase)
- 22 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (144% increase)
- 22 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (175% increase)

related to a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache VCL was founded 2012-06-19 (7 years ago)
There are currently 10 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 5:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Aaron Coburn on 2012-06-19.

## Project Activity:
Most of the activity we've had since our 2.5.1 release at the end of July has
been related to supporting people upgrading to that release.

## Community Health:
We typically have a bit of a lull in development after getting a release out
as committers catch up on things they have been putting off while working on
the release. We are seeing that now and expect to see things pick back up a
bit in the next few months.

We have a good candidate in a recently added committer to become a new PMC
member.

## Project Activity:
In this last quarter we have been pretty busy working on a couple of issues:

- WICKET-6703 which was about removing JavaScript window.eval from our Ajax 
  code in order to comply with CSP standard
- WICKET-6666 which is about rewriting our ModalWindow component. The current 
  one is pretty old and the code has become messy and difficult to maintain.
  So we decided to rewrite this component using modern web standards and 
  keeping code clean. This feature is not finished yet and will be available 
  only on the next major release 9.

More generally, in view of the next major release, we worked on some other
tasks aimed to clean our code base.

## Community Health:
The community is stable and healthy. Questions to the user list and dev list 
are answered, resolved and discussed. We are seeing an increasing numbers of 
contributions on our GitHub mirror with more PRs than the previous quarter.  
In the last three months we also seen a positive trend with downloads number 
on Apache Maven repository and on December we hit a new record for the last 
year (about 360000 downloads).

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

A vote was just started on a release candidate for Xerces-J 2.12.1. This would
roll up minor bug fixes and enhancements that have been made in the past year.
One of the developers has been cleaning up issues in JIRA and properly tagging
ones that would be resolved by the new release. Most of the activity for the
release preparation has been in recent weeks.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 70+ posts on the j-dev and j-users
lists since the beginning of September 2019.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-J
2.12.0 (April 30th, 2018).

Xerces-C

One of the developers finally got around to converting the Xerces-C++ SVN
repository to Git after it was understood that this a self-serve process.

A report is currently being drafted to report a vulnerability that is known
but not yet resolved. This was discussed with security@ before heading down
this path. The existence of an issue has been made public on the c-dev mailing
list, but as of today the details have not been disclosed yet.

Most of the project activity in the last four months has been in response to
JIRA issues.

Mailing list traffic has been increasing; roughly 130+ posts on the c-dev and
c-users lists since the beginning of September 2019.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-C
3.2.2 (September 19th, 2018).
