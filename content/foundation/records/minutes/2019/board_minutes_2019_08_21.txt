 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       Several board members plan to attend the 20th anniversary celebration
       at ApacheCon NA in Las Vegas. Timing does not work for a regular board
       meeting during the conference but there will be ample opportunity for
       individual directors to meet informally.

       Work continues to better understand how Apache can be more welcoming
       to underrepresented communities. A call from the Diversity and
       Inclusion VP was issued to solicit volunteer mentors to work with
       Outreachy to engage mentees. All Apache communities are encouraged to
       participate. https://s.apache.org/seeking-mentors

       The incubator has made progress on a new DISCLAIMER-WIP for
       non-compliant podling releases. See discussion topic 8A.

       Discussion continues on how to make board@apache.org a productive
       environment to conduct the board's work.

       Discussion continues on socializing the concept of non-code
       contributions being a factor in moving contributors along the path to
       become committers.

    B. President [Sam]

       Financially, we are doing very well even after taking into
       consideration timing considerations, which generally are breaking in
       our favor at this time making the picture look even better.

       Brand management responded to four queries, processed four
       registrations, and resolved one infringement.

       Fundraising is operating smoothly, and focusing on restructuring and
       conference sponsors.

       Marketing and publicity focused on cross-committee, graphics, and
       events liaisons, while also producing an annual report as well as
       handling a number of informal announcements and one analyst query.

       ACNA is coming together, with strong sponsorship, though possibly
       falling a bit short on attendees.  ACEU is tying up loose ends.

       Finance renewed D&O and is working closely with conferences and
       fundraising.

       Diversity and Inclusion made progress on each of its three
       initiatives, outlined a moderation policy, and added one new committee
       member

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operating Cash on July 31st, 2019 was $2,473K, which is up $170.2K
       from last month’s ending balance (Jun 19) of $2,302.8K.  Total Cash as
       of July 31st, 2019 is $3,866.9K (includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation) as compared to $3,435.3K on July 31st 2018 (an increase of
       $431.6K year over year). The July 2019 ending Operating cash balance
       of $2,473K represents an Operating cash reserve of 10 months based on
       the FY20 Cash forecast average monthly spending of $247.9K/month.  The
       ASF actual Operating reserve of 10 months at the end of July 2019 is
       ahead of the budgeted 8.1 month reserve for YTD through July 2019. 
       The ASF Operating reserve continues to be very healthy for an
       organization of the ASF’s size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is ahead of budget at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $209.1K.  As compared to FY18, YTD revenue
       is ahead by $205.1K primarily due to Conference income year over year
       at this point in time

       YTD expenses through July 31, 2019 are under budget by $259.5K.  All
       departments, except for Publicity, are under budget at the end of July
       2019, which is primarily due to timing and expenses for ACNA19. 
       Conference are at this point under budget due to timing and it is
       expected to normalize over the next two months as ACNA and ACEU are
       happening in the next few months.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY20 the ASF finished with a positive
       $52.8K NI vs a budgeted negative <$415.9K> NI or $468.7K  ahead of
       Budget, NI, for FY20 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of Conference payments, Timing of TAC as well
       as underspending in most depts YTD vs the FY20 Budget.  At this point
       in the FY we are doing very well, ahead in Revenue and well under
       budget in Expenses, even taking timing variances into account.  With
       regard to FY19, we are outpacing revenue, by $205.1K as noted above, 
       but we are also out pacing expenses by $125.9K; thus, year over year
       NI for FY20 is ahead of  FY19 by $79.2K.

    D. Secretary [Matt]

       In July, there were 68 ICLAs, two CCLAs, five software grants, and one
       member emeritus request received.

       The tooling issue around GPG signature verification has since been
       fixed by the Whimsy PMC. Documentation on apache.org around submitting
       digitally signed documents was updated to reflect our current accepted
       methods and in particular, it points to sks-keyservers.net instead of
       keyservers we had previous problems with.

    E. Executive Vice President [David]

       During some of the activities of the month we discovered some fragile
       bits of the Foundation operations that have a single or tenuous links
       to external service providers. In particular, most of our liaison with
       Virtual happens via Tom, making him a single point of failure. In the
       course of our relationship with Virtual it's grown considerably in
       scope from accounting work to providing significant finance
       capabilities, handling our PEO duties, event planning, and more. At
       the same time, Tom's responsibilities at Virtual have also grown
       considerably, and a lot of our operations now have a component that
       Virtual is involved in. Accordingly, Tom and I are discussing how we
       might best increase the connective tissue between Ops at the ASF and
       Virtual. More to come on this in coming months.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Infrastructure completed a datacenter exit in a very short timeframe,
       which will result in a large cost savings for the Foundation.

       There was additionally a mail issue with Virtual, where no mail from
       apache.org was being delivered. This situation happened twice, with no
       obvious blips in monitoring. While this affected destinations other
       than Virtual as well, none of them were as painful. There is now in
       place a temporary workaround, and some robust monitoring that looks
       for any queue of messages sent to Virtual that sit around for more a
       short period of time.

       Travel Assistance
       =================

       This month also saw significant progress in documenting tribal
       knowledge around the process and tools for running TAC, which also
       eliminates some single points of failure.

       Flights for EU are booked. Significant delays and problems securing
       ACNA tickets from our travel agency has been an issue. Those are
       mostly resolved, but I expect it will result in some changes in the
       future.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Incubator DISCLAIMER-WIP

       The Incubator proposes to make use of a new DISCLAIMER-WIP that
       addresses non-compliant releases.

       The IPMC can allow non-compliant releases to be distributed without
       IPMC VP or legal VP approval, based on a documented list of issues
       which are acceptable for such non-compliant incubating releases. Such
       releases will include an alternative "work in progress" DISCLAIMER-WIP
       to make users aware of the issues . When this occurs, podlings
       document the issues as blocking graduation and carry on incubating.
       They will not be allowed to graduate until all such release issues
       have been fixed.

       The board informally considers this a great idea.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising business is operating smoothly. We are pleased to welcome 1 new
Silver and 2 new Bronze foundation sponsors this month. We also renewed 1
Platinum,  2 Silver, and 3 Bronze sponsors. Work continues consolidating terms
of a combined (ASF + Targeted) Platinum sponsorship.

The previously reported email issues with a sponsor in China have been
resolved. They have renewed their sponsorship and are also becoming an
ApacheCon sponsor, and are in the final stages of  document signature.

Restructuring continues, with updated records, new forms, and online account
maintenance. The online form-based onboarding is working well and new sponsor
agreements and renewals are successfully being processed using DocuSign.

We are continuing to work with Virtual to sign on new sponsors for
ApacheCon/Las Vegas, and continue working with new thinking/Plain Schwarz on
bolstering their sponsor activities.

~$900 received from individual donors via Hopsie, which is not uncommon during
  the holiday period.

We are using the publishing of the annual report as a prompt to engage
sponsors through our ambassadors.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - August 2019

I. Budget: we are on budget and are on an accelerated schedule to support
three events in a month (ApacheCon North America, Huawei Connect, and
ApacheCon Europe). HALO Worldwide is supporting the overflow on expenses that
are unable to be covered by the M&P credit card (maximum limit): this includes
20th Anniversary promotional items and travel for select team members.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising by engaging new sponsors (1 Silver), securing sponsorship renewals
(1 Platinum, 2 Silver, and 3 Bronze), signing and onboarding new sponsors, and
 working on ApacheCon sponsorships. Work with ASF Conferences continues with
 expanded activities for ApacheCon/Las Vegas in 4 weeks. The latest  "Success
 at Apache" post, “The Path To Berlin,” is live at https://s.apache.org/xqvbo
 . The ASF FY2019 Annual Report has been published: press release
 https://s.apache.org/w7bw1 full report at
 https://s.apache.org/FY2019AnnualReport

III. Press Releases: there were no formal announcements issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during this
timeframe.

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 264 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 20 items to 54.2K followers on
Twitter. We posted 4 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 31K organic
impressions. Sally was on medical leave for most of July; special thanks to
Swapnil Mane for stepping up to publish the Apache Weekly News Round-ups
during this time, and for his commitment to publish future newsletters on a
weekly basis. Thanks also to Daniel Gruno for supporting the effort and
facilitating the publishing process.

V. Future Announcements: 3 announcements are in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 3 media queries. The ASF received 1,919
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 865. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 3,104 press hits vs. last month's 2,130. ApacheCon received
97 press hits. We will be offering Intermediate Media & Analyst Training
during ApacheCon, and will be offering the Beginner session online for any
Apache Committer to take at their convenience. This will help offset the
year-round demand for the training materials and to help folks unable to
attend or wait for the next ApacheCon to get started.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received one analyst query. Apache was mentioned in
1 report by Gartner; 2 reports by Forrester; 5 reports by 451 Research; and 5
reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: members of the new Central Services sub-group under Marketing
& Publicity are successfully collaborating on the development of new creative
  assets to promote the ASF and ApacheCon, and are developing plans/processes
  for new projects. We launched the new #LoveApache badge for third parties to
  include their logos/images with the Apache brand for stickers and online
  applications http://apache.org/foundation/press/kit/#badges . We reached out
  to the Open Source Design community for possible future collaboration and
  Kenneth Paskett from Central Services will be meeting them during ApacheCon
  Europe.

IX. Events liaison: we continue to work closely with Virtual and
newthinking/Plain Schwarz on various advisory and tactical support across
ApacheCon/Las Vegas and Berlin. This includes ASF 20th Anniversary projects
taking place onsite, such as the Peter Adams “Apache: Community Over Code.
Code Over Community” photography project in Las Vegas as well as the
“Trillions and Trillions Served” documentary being filmed in both Las Vegas
 and Berlin. New ApacheCon promotions are being posted on Feathercast, with
 transcripts published on blogs.apache.org, and will feature the same for
 ApacheCon Europe keynoters. We posted 3 items on the ASF Events/ApacheCon
 pages on LinkedIn, and the event producers have been very active in promoting
 the talks for both events. Sally continues to work closely with ASF VP
 Conferences Rich Bowen, and has scaled back day-to-day tactics with event
 sponsorship. She is also overseeing Sponsor Ambassador activities and the
 ASF’s presence at upcoming events including, Cumbre/CCOSS (September), and
 Huawei Direct (September). In addition, for the first time, as part of
 Central Services’ “Education and Outreach” activity, we are offering a new
 immersive session on how to host an "Apache@" event at corporate locations.
 Originally offered as a benefit for ASF Sponsors only, ASF Members and PMC
 members are invited to participate and learn best practices to help corporate
 teams succeed when contributing to Apache projects.

X. Newswire accounts: our pre-paid press release package with GlobeNewswire
has auto-renewed through 2021.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues
requiring escalation to the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
We experienced email delivery issues for a couple days due to a
misconfiguration on our server. That was corrected, and a variant
appeared some days later. This would not normally be an issue to
highlight to the Board, but in this case it affected our delivery to
Virtual Inc, our service provider for finances, fundraising, and
conferences. These three topics are particularly acute leading into
ACNA19 next month. Our apologies to Virtual, in specific.

Infra has coded up some special warning systems to detect similar
problems in the future, and applied additional monitoring should this
scenario reoccur under any other adverse condition.

Second: we completed the datacenter exit mentioned last month. This
occupied the team's highest priority for much of July.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Migrate and upgrade Jira on Sunday, August 18th (should be finished
  before the Board's meeting).
- Warm up a new IP address for outbound email. This includes an
  improved email system configuration for reliability, and to avoid
  future delivery problems noted in our Highlights.
- Restart our process to hire a Technical Writer/Editor.
- ApacheCon North America, in Las Vegas.
- Move svn-master.a.o onto a modern VM (18.04/p6).

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Deprecate the old Content Management System (cms.apache) that is
  running on old hardware, and unmaintained software. We are exploring
  "turnkey website publishing" for the Foundation's projects.

General Activity
================
- Moved our primary backup server off a failing machine onto newer
  hardware with more storage, at a lower cost.
- Many migrations from our old datacenter, primarily into Hetzner. At
  the same time, we upgraded to 18.04/p6.
- Completed the migration of moin wiki content over to Confluence,
  enabling us to turn off MoinMoin and its host machine.
- Improvements in our account creation tooling, along with some LDAP-y
  goodness in our Python support library.
- Lots of work on our underlying email systems, towards our migration
  to a modern, fully-puppetized system (and away from our old FreeBSD
  setup that is difficult to maintain).
- Lifting our runbooks off reference.a.o onto cwiki, and refining them
  to modern-day actuals. ref.a.o is deprecated.
- Moving off our own SonarQube installation to SonarCloud (a
  complementary service for F/OSS projects)
- Fixing up the fingerprint system on www.a.o/dev/machines.html


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Conferences

ACNA 19

Nothing much to report, other than that everything is coming together for the
event, which is now less than a month out. Registration is clipping along,
although it may fall a little short of our goals. Sponsorship is strong, and
our final promotion efforts are running. See you in Las Vegas!

ACEU 19

Organization continues apace.  Despite this being vacation time in Europe,
NewThinking continues to work hard providing visas for speakers, finalizing
organization of details like the speaker dinner, and etc.  We are in the
process of organizing space and food for the Movie Night, and finding a room
for the filming crew.  We’ve received confirmation from all but one of our
invited speakers.  We are holding two speaking slots open for potential
sponsors, but will need to send notification to our waitlisted speakers soon. 
The attendees of the Founder’s panel also remain uncertain.

We are currently up to 4 accredited press attendees: Heise, Linux Magazine,
Deutschland Funk, and D-Zone.  Press work to promote attendance has been
extensive, including local and international news organizations, event
calendars, and social media engagement both directly by us and via our
partners.

We need an organizer for the Hackathon in ACEU to send out an invitation to
the communities attending.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

ApacheCon NA Las Vegas
======================

Behind the scenes work is proceeding, booking flights etc. All Hotel rooms are
confirmed booked, and Conference passes should all be registered.

ApacheCon EU Berlin
===================

Judging completed, and we accepted 17 of 49 applicants. Work is under way to
get their flights done from a new Travel Agent (to us) local to Berlin. Hotel
rooms are all booked. Conference passes to be handed out.
(Chris informs that all flights are now booked!)

General
=======

With a new lead organiser for Berlin, and Chris going through the process for
the first time, some Tribal Knowledge and holes in our TAC internal
documentation were revealed; and, ultimately fixed.

TAC Membership
==============

No changes in the TAC Membership.

Mailing List
============

We currently have 20 subscribers to our main list.

Not much in the way of list activity other than the list being kept upto date
on progress.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

VP of Finance report July 2019 performed worked on the following:
- Renewing the ASF Director and Officers Insurance
- Obtaining a $2 million Event and Liquor insurance policy for ACNA19
  that includes a Terrorism clause
- Worked with the Fundraising team on a number of sponsors both
  Foundation and ACNA related


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion VP works in collaboration with a team who
  contributes towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in
  the industry and for the foundation. The team also focuses on developing
  resources the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in
  their communities.

## Issues:

None

## Activity:

*** Project:  Survey revamp***

Vetted 8 potential vendors, got quotes from 3 finalist and decided to move
forward into negotiation of deliverables with one: Bitergia. See JIRAs [1][2]
for complete context on vendor selection.

*** Project: UX Research on new contributors ***

Vetted 3 potential vendors, decided to move forward into negotiation with
Bitergia in a joint project to do the Contributor survey + User Experience
research.

*** Project: Internships for underrepresented groups (Outreachy) ***
    Outreachy's goal is to support people from groups underrepresented in the
    technology industry. Outreachy interns will work remotely with mentors on
    projects ranging from programming, user experience, documentation,
    illustration and graphic design, to data science. Outreachy interns will
    receive stipends for developing said projects full-time for three months.

We registered ASF with Outreachy [6]. Listed the sponsors [7]. We setup
communication tools (Jira, Confluence etc.) for D&I to communicate with each
other and communicate progress of initiatives. Created two project trackers:
“Outreachy Program Setup” to monitor the implementation of the program due to
 the first time collaborating with the Outreachy Program, and “Outreachy
 Internship Tracking” to monitor the schedule and onboarding actions [8]. We
 schedule two calls with Mozilla to get information about the templates: July
 18th and August 6th. We have created Apache labels for Outreachy in JIRA [9].
 We created the outreachy mentors mailing list mentor@diversity.apache.org
[10]. We are working in a blog post  [11]. We will send a call for mentor
 e-mail to the announcements lists on the 17th of August, almost a week ahead
 of the official launch of the initial applications [12].

More detailed reports on this work can be found on their update minutes[3].

*** Operations ***

Nothing to report.

*** Community Highlights ***

We have successfully set up the ASF as an Outreachy community, progress with
this program seems to be going smooth, and it gave a new community member the
opportunity to engage in an important project for the committee.

Discussions to find a vendor for the diagnosis work (survey & research)
started interesting connections with people in the CHAOSS community and
thought leasders in the topic of diversity and inclusion.

## Health report:

Update on Diversity & Inclusion mailing lists moderation: From the events that
occurred last month in the D&I mailing list, 4 components of a strong
moderation practice were outlined:

>Successful moderation requires at least a few things:
>
> 1. a clear, short list of rules people must follow
> 2. reasons provided to the poster on violation
> 3. a stated appeals process
> 4. consistent application of those rules

The committee has brought an initial draft of these guidelines to a Confluence
page[4] and feedback has been provided on an email thread in dev@[5]. Thanks
to everyone who has provided input.

Next steps are: Finalize moderation guidelines and publish them in D&I wiki,
and establish a process for appeals. We’ll work on these two points next.

Update on mailing lists status: We are back to normal cadence and volume. Work
in the three main projects for 2019 has started to show progress and tone and
interaction has re focused on core work.

## Committee members changes:
1 new member added to the committee

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time. We're down 1 to 22, unresolved
issues this month.

We have finally submitted Legal sections of the ASF annual report.

We have finalized our recommendations for how ASF may decide to engage with
Eclipse Jakarta EE Platform.

We continue to evaluate additional options for counsel to augment the work of
DLA Piper. We expect to have an update on this in a month or two. Mishi
Choudhary from SFLC is looking into refreshing the relationship with us. In
additional to that we also had Cliff Allen reaching out offering his help.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Thiruvalluvan M. G.]

August 2019

Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's
expected schema is different from the actual schema with which the data was
serialized the data is automatically adapted to meet reader's requirements.

This report is for the four months ending Jul 31 2019 (previous report covered
until Mar 31)

Activity

65 JIRA tickets opened by 25 developers
103 Pull requests opened in Github
90 issues resolved by 25 contributors
84 Pull requests merged
45 pull requests pending

Last release: version 1.9.0 16th May 2019.
Last time a new committer elected: 27 June 2019, Michael A. Smith
Last time a new PMC elected: 14 May2019, Ismael Mejia 

Finally, after a gap of two years, we managed to release a new version 1.9.0.
It was well received with a lot of feedback from the community. Kudos to the
new members of PMC and committers who worked hard to get this out.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:

BookKeeper is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage
service optimized for append-only workloads. It has been used as
a fundamental service to build high available and replicated services
in companies like Twitter, Yahoo and Salesforce. It is also the log
segment store for Apache DistributedLog and message store for Apache Pulsar.

Apache DistributedLog is a high-level API and service layer for
Apache BookKeeper, providing easier access to the BookKeeper
primitives. It is a subproject of Apache BookKeeper.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache BookKeeper was founded 2014-11-19 (5 years ago)
There are currently 21 committers and 16 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Charan Reddy G was added to the PMC on 2019-07-24
- No new committers. Last addition was Andrey Yegorov on 2018-02-10.

## Project Activity:

Recent releases:
4.9.2 was released on 2019-05-17.
4.9.1 was released on 2019-04-06.
4.8.2 was released on 2019-03-18.
4.8.0 was released on 2018-09-25.

Currently the community is working on releasing 4.10.0.
The two releases will be going out soon.

## Community Health:

The community is a bit slow. Because the committers and 
PMC members have a bit overlapped between Pulsar and BookKeeper. 
So a lot of them have been focused on growing the adoptions of 
Pulsar and hence BookKeeper. The adoptions of Pulsar has been 
increased a lot and so does BookKeeper. The members are able to
put more focuses on BookKeeper in the next month.

   members with the aim of regularly adding individuals.
 - There has been further discussion over the summer about releasing Brooklyn
   1.0.0, hopefully this will go ahead in the next month or two.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
- We have released 1.5.8 in July. The project is still otherwise very quiet, 
with some good patches helping keep up with maintenance.
   
## Health report: 
 - We still have a small PMC presence of 3 active members still able
to vote releases.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Peter Donald on Tue Oct 15 2013 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 10 committers. 
 - Olle Jonsson was added as a committer on Wed Dec 12 2018 
   
## Releases:    
 - Last release was 1.5.8 on July 14th 2019


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
We have sent off a trademark violation to aiven.io and have not heard a
response after five days.

We have moved off of IRC onto the ASF's Slack Instance. This has (anecdotally
as we don't have exact numbers) driven a large uptick in active conversations
on both #cassandra and #cassandra-dev over their IRC counterparts.

## Membership Data:
Apache Cassandra was founded 2010-02-17 (9 years ago) There are currently 54
committers and 32 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
roughly 7:4.

We have had no new committers added this quarter. We think this may be the
result of feature work being frozen and we are primarily focused on testing
for our upcoming 4.0 release. Given that last quarter saw the addition of
three committers, we do not see this as a negative for the project's health.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Alex Petrov on 2019-04-09.
- No new committers. Last addition was Dinesh Joshi on 2019-03-05.

## Project Activity:
We are eagerly anticipating this year's ApacheConNA as we have expanded our
track to three days. 

We have been assigned a doc writer through Google Season
of Docs and will begin working with them on our outstanding documentation
projects shortly.

## Community Health:
We are continue to track and prioritize issues as we approach 4.0:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/4.0%3A+Open+Issues+by+Component
Interesting statistics this quarter:
- dev@cassandra.apache.org had a 39% decrease in traffic in the past quarter
  (133 emails compared to 217)
- 84 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (35% increase)
- 66 commits in the past quarter (17% increase)

The dip in development list activity could be a result of the increased
participation in our slack channel. We have both an increase in the number of
commits and the number of closed issues for this quarter, so overall the
numbers seem healthy.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Cédric Damioli]

## Description:
Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Issues:
there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Still very few activity on the project. Last report was followed by the board
questioning us being somewhat dormant. As usual, this question is actually
fair regarding the activity, and as usual, many PMC members (8 IIRC) answered
they're still there. The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14 A few
JIRA issues opened or resolved since last report. A little activity on both
users and dev mailing-lists, even if still at a low level. The project is
mainly in maintenance mode.


## PMC changes:
None. Most recent addition: 2012-07-06

## Committer base changes:
None. Most recent addition: 2012-07-06

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

## Description:
The mission of Community Development is the creation and maintenance of
software related to Resources to help people become involved with Apache
projects

## Issues:
- No issues require board attention at the moment

## Membership Data:
Apache Community Development was founded 2009-11-01 (10 years ago) There are
currently 33 committers and 31 PMC members in this project. The
Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:8.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Christofer Dutz was added to the PMC on 2019-06-21
- Christofer Dutz was added as committer on 2019-06-21

## Project Activity:
Diversity & Inclusion With the establishment of the separate D&I mailing list,
discussions and topics related to D&I have been moved to that list.

Apachecon
We have been busy helping support Apachecon NA and EU. We are
organising the Apache booth and have called for volunteers from our community.
Several people from various projects have offered to spend time on the booth
others about their projects.

We are also ordering giveaways and stickers for the boot and have had an
amazing response from our communities wanting have some of their own stickers
available. Due to the demand, we are preparing an additional sticker order.

Redbubble
The Redbubble store was setup in April 2018 as an easy way for ASF
projects to order their own branded item such as t+shirts, mugs, etc. In
preparation for Apachecon many projects have asked to have their logos added
to the store so they can buy their own merchandise and promote their projects
visually.

Some additional volunteers have offered to help Mark Thomas who has been the
main administrator for the Redbubble site and a training session is planned.

Community Track NA & EU
The CFP for both Apachecons provided a lot of
submissions around community related topics. As a result we have a 3 day
Community track at Apachecon NA and a 2 day Community track at Apachecon EU.

To help promote our track a Feathercast interview [1] and blog post has been
published.

GSoC
GSoC is coming to an end and the final evaluations will start next week.
We are currently deciding who to send to the mentor summit in Germany.

Events We are still investigating opportunities for Apache Roadshows in 2020
including the possibility of one in India. We have also been invited to
participate with an Apache track in CCOSS 2019 [2] in Mexico

## Community Health:
Mailing list traffic has decreased this quarter probably due to the holiday
season. dev@community.apache.org:
    - 884 subscribers (down -7 in the last 3 months):
    - 545 emails sent to list (763 in previous quarter)

We are starting to track some task via Jira so this has increased activity
this quarter.
 - 8 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 7 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
Seamless multi-master sync, that scales from Big Data to Mobile,
with an Intuitive HTTP/JSON API and designed for Reliability.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache CouchDB was founded 2008-11-19 (11 years ago)
There are currently 64 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 4:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Nick Vatamaniuc on 2017-11-07.
- No new committers. Last addition was Jay Doane on 2019-01-05.

## Project Activity:

The Vote[1] to adopt FoundationDB as CouchDB’s future underlying distribution
and storage technology has passed unanimously.

See the two previous board reports for more context.

Current planning includes both a CouchDB 3.0 and a CouchDB 4.0 milestone. 3.0
will include the best version of the current, mostly Erlang-based project,
with many new features contributed by various project partners (but notably
IBM). This will be the LTS version for people who won’t be able to migrate to
the newer technology foundation. There are a number of technical limitations
that we are happy to adopt as a project going forward, but that might be deal-
breakers for some users. As such, we’ll serve those users best with an excellent
edition of the original technology stack. LTS-timelines are TBD.

CouchDB 4.0 which is already under development concurrently will include a 
mostly[tm] API compatible version of CouchDB built on top of FoundationDB. API
differences are going to be communicated clearly and migration paths documented
thoroughly.

For a little bit of context: with the addition of clustering, CouchDB 2.x turned
from an accidentally strongly consistent database (because it was a single-node 
database) to an eventually consistent database, losing some essential properties
in favour of scalability and fault tolerance.

With the help of FoundationDB, those properties lost after 1.x are going to be
regained, while retaining scalability and fault tolerance, and while putting the
CouchDB foundational underpinnings on a modern distributed database stack that
would easily take us 10+ years to build.

IBM is spearheading this effort within the ASF and is adding more resources to
the CouchDB project in terms of development, release management, infrastructure
as well as project management

[1]: https://s.apache.org/couchdb-fib-vote

## Community Health:

All parts of the existing community are participating in the 3.x and 4.x 
efforts. While no new committer-candidates have emerged yet, there is a small
influx of new and promising voices.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Same as the off cycle report last month:

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software
related to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions.
Any language and build system are welcomed.


Status

------
Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk
of the project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing
lack of progress.

If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.


Community

---------

In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC /

programming language. Groovy is a multi-faceted JVM programming language.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Wrt the Maven Coordinate namespace: we are planning to move to
org.apache.groovy for Groovy 4 with alphas expected soon.

## Membership Data:
Apache Groovy was founded 2015-11-18 (4 years ago)
There are currently 17 committers and 10 PMC members in this project.
Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Daniel Sun on 2019-05-06.
- No new committers. Last addition was Remko Popma on 2018-07-07.
A new committer has been invited and has accepted but the ICLA is
still pending. We anticipate including this in our next report.

## Project Activity:
Recent releases:
2.5.8 was released on Wed Aug 07 2019
3.0.0-beta-2 was released on Mon Jul 08 2019
3.0.0-beta-3 was released on Wed Aug 07 2019

This quarter, 327 commits were contributed from 9 contributors
including 5 non-committer contributors (1 new).

## Community Health:
We recently did an assessment of health across commits,
contributors, issues resolved, releases and downloads
over the last 15 years including approx 4 yrs with Apache.
Commits and issues resolved have remained steady for most
of the life of the project. Releases dropped in 2016 while
we were becoming accustomed to the Apache Way but is now
inline with pre-Apache cadence. Number of contributors has
increased since joining Apache. Downloads have always
increased and continue to do so. Groovy artifacts have been
downloaded more than a quarter of a billion times since its inception.

According to the TIOBE index for this month, Apache Groovy
is the 13th most popular programming language putting it ahead of:
Go (17), Swift (18), Perl (19), R (20), Scala (36) and Kotlin (45).

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP
standards.

## Issues:
There are no issues for the board at present.

## Membership Data:
Apache HTTP Server was founded 1995-02-27 (24 years ago) 
There are currently 122 committers and 53 PMC members in this project. 
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Stefan Sperling on 2019-01-24.
- No new committers. Last addition was Sebastian Bazley on 2018-07-14.

## Project Activity:

- 2.4.41 was released on 2019-08-12 (2.4.40 tag was burned). This release
  contained fixes for four moderate and two low level CVEs. I personally want
  to thank the developers and the security team for their work on these tasks.
  As evident in the community health section, a lot of work was put into
  making this release a reality.
- 2.4.39 was released on 2019-03-31.
- 2.4.38 was released on 2019-01-21.

- At ApacheCon North America in September, we have five httpd talks lined up.
- At ApacheCon Europe in October, we have two httpd-related talks (that I
  could find...the schedule page doesn't allow for searching)

## Community Health:
I will keep things a tad shorter this quarter, and attempt to incorporate some
of the helpful hints from the new reporting tool (eating my own dog-food):

There is more than sufficient oversight on the PMC, with more than a dozen PMC
members active on a monthly basis.

Commit activity has held pretty steady over the summer, with a moderate (30%)
increase - somewhat impressive for a summer quarter! Contributor count has
likewise held up, with 16 active contributors during this quarter.

Pony Factor[1], a measurement of the diversity and size of the 'core'
developers, is holding steady at 5, which is a relatively good number[2] for a
project of this age.

The development mailing list saw a sizeable increase (>80%) in traffic, where
some gritty technical issues and general business logic was heavily discussed
- some of it point towards a needed documentation fix (aka "what does this
thing actually do?"). On the user mailing list side, things are business as
usual, with no notable change.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for August 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

This monthly report is in markdown so that it's easier to read. If you are 
not viewing this in that format, it can be seen here:   
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/August2019

There are presently 47 podlings incubating. In July, podlings executed 9
distinct releases. We added five IPMC members and no IPMC members retired. 
We have no new podlings this month, but there have been a couple of enquires
about new projects, and some proposals are being worked on. A couple of 
podlings are heading towards graduation in the next few months, including 
Druid.

Some podlings Amaterasu, SDAP, Tamaya, Toree didn't submit a report and have
been asked to do so next month.

Two podlings that failed to report last month reported this month. However, 
Amaterasu didn't report for a second time. A couple of podlings had 
trouble getting previous months reports signed off have attracted new 
mentors.

TVM also gained a new mentor. Some podlings are  reporting on or after the
deadline and not allowing time to discussing the content on list. The 
quality of those reports may suffer as a result.

There were three IP clearances.

Apache Druid has brought up it graduation and may have an issue with its 
name being the same as a project by another company. The problem is being
dealt with, but this may delay graduation depending on the outcome of those
discussions.

The Incubator made a podling release (MXNet) that contained stock photos of 
unknown origin and licensing. Another release (from Tuweini) included 
Category X (GPL) licensed software.

The incubator policy page has been cleaned up and updated to be easier to
understand. Anything that was guidelines and not policy has been removed. 
This material was included elsewhere in the incubator and ASF websites, and 
there was no need for the duplication. Podlings can always request to do 
things in a different way as long as it is in line with the Apache Way.

Further work was done on a page outlining some of the issues are that 
podlings might encounter during incubation and on the Incubator cookbook. 
The incubator homepage was also updated to be more friendly and service 
orientated.

There were several lengthy discussions of the role of the Incubator, and 
its purpose, and while they were a little heated in a few places, they
were constructive.

There seems to be consensus on how the Incubator should handle podling 
releases (see proposal below). It's thought that education of mentors
and podlings on the Apache Way is lacking. The Incubator will discuss what
can be done about that.

A couple of podlings have not been able to attract IPMC votes on their
releases in the usual 72 hours.

The missing incubator report wiki pages have been transferred to the new 
wiki.

Based on several months discussion, the Incubator has a proposal for the 
Board to consider.

*Summary*

The Incubator PMC has been discussing allowing podlings to make releases 
which are not fully compliant with the ASF release policies.

Such releases would include a DISCLAIMER-WIP statement of being a "work in 
progress", pointing to the specific issues that make them non-compliant.

The IPMC is seeking approval from the Board to proceed based on the details 
of this proposal, below.

*Some Background*

The IPMC requires clarity from the Board if podlings need to follow ASF's 
release policy and distribution policy while in incubation. This question 
has been asked before, and the answer was unclear or strongly suggested 
that podling releases must follow ASF policy. What is happening in practice 
is that the IPMC allows releases with minor issues to go ahead and assumes 
they will be fixed in a later release (before graduation) and stops 
releases with any serious problem from going ahead (with an IPMC member or 
two voting -1). A -1 vote is not a veto but usually stops a release, 
there's only been a handful of successful releases with -1 votes. We have 
consensus among IPMC members that allowing podling releases with 
minor issues is a correct approach even it doesn't follow ASF policy. 
Serious problems, such as; including GPL licensed software, including
compiled  code, or copyright violations, in a release are currently seen as
a reason to vote -1 on a release. Podlings do try and do the right thing
but about 1 in 5 podling releases has a problem like this. Historically
there's been a few releases with serious issues that have got legal and
Incubator VP approval to make a release on a one by one, once-off basis.
The Incubator wants to allow podling to make non compliant releases to
ease their progress through the incubating process. We've come up with
an alternate disclaimer that clearly states that the release may not be
compliant with ASF release or distribution policy and lists known issues.
The legal committee have confirmed that the the Incubator as a TLP needs
to follow release policy and can only make releases with issues if it
considered to be special in some way.

*Proposal*

The IPMC can allow non-compliant releases to be distributed without IPMC VP 
or legal VP approval, based on a documented list of issues which are 
acceptable for such non-compliant incubating releases. Such releases will
include an alternative "work in progress" DISCLAIMER-WIP to make users aware
of the issues . When this occurs, podlings document the issues as blocking
graduation and carry on incubating. They will not be allowed to graduate 
until all such release issues have been fixed.

*Notes*

The IPMC and legal committee have come up with a well-defined list of those
issues. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-469

This list will be distributed to mentors, IPMC members and podlings so
that everyone's expectations are clear. This proposal does not change the
need for an IPMC vote on podling releases, which will be considered
separately.

## DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences.
Sketches are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream
and can provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to
computationally difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than
traditional, exact methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Our vote letter on general@ had no responses from anyone (not just 
     IPMC members) for the first 73 hours. After sending a pleading
     reminder email I finally got 3 +1 binding votes. I'm trying to be
     polite and not needle folks, but I need guidance on how to get IPMC
     members' attention. I realize the vote  must stay open for at least
     72 hours, but having to wait until the last minute get any response
     is very aggravating. Would it be fair to send out reminder notices on
     24 hour intervals?
  2. Continue to perfect the release process.
  3. After we get this first release, we need to finish migrating the 
     remaining repos.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?
  1. Yes. In addition to #1 above, not all of our Mentors have been 
     involved. Why do Mentors sign up if they do not or cannot mentor?

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  Not too much at the committer level. We have drawn the
  interest of a few new scientists in our work, but they did not
  learn of our work from Apache.
  It is still very early.  I am speaking at ApacheCon
  In September, hopefully we can attract some interest there.
  I am hoping to attract some committers.

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  We continue to evolve the project and make commits to the code base.
  We are also heavily integrated into the Druid platform.

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?

### IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: 72 hours is a minimum and a podling may not attract
  all needed votes in that time. I understand it may be frustrating
  but remember IPMC member are volunteers and mostly do this work
  unpaid in their spare time. If you need more Mentors just ask on
  the incubator general list.

## Edgent

Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime
that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Re-creating a working community
  2. Re-populating the PPMC
  3. Replenishing the group of mentors

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  For the past months, there has been very few activity in the project
  There have been a hand full of Emails from external peoples in the
  last 3 months but the activity in the project has been solely by me
  (Julian).

  Julian started an Approach for „Edgent Next“. This is a suggestion to 
  re-activate activities in the edgent community and integrate it as a 
  middle layer between several other IoT or Edge relared Projects.

  This was also announced on the new iot@apache.org<mailto:iot@apache.org> 
  Mailing list but on both lists no feedbackl was responded yet.

  The main problem we have is that the only active people in the project
  came in Late and are not that firm with the codebase. Currently, we
  have a codebase for which we have a detailed understanding of the build,
  but almost none of the code itself. Furthermore, there has been a lot of
  activity in other projects and generally edge processing has developed
  further in the recent years.

  Thus, there is some discussion going on about the core or the aim of the
  project to keep its significance and uniqueness.

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Total, we have 82 subscribers to our mailing list, an increase of 5 
  since the last report.
  * There have been four questions asked by users and little discussions 
  about these issues on the list
  * On April, 4th, Julian Feinauer has Talked about Edgent on the building 
  iot 2019
  * On July 16th Julian Feinauer started a discussion About „Edgent Next“ 
  on the edgent and iot Mailing lists

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  According to JIRA, 0 new issue were added and none were resolved in the 
  last 90 days

### How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  After the withdrawal of most of the active committers and PPCM members
  currently a new committer, PPMC and mentor-base has to be built.
  Currently we try to re-gain the focus of edgent to
  Start to rebuild the community and resume development.

  member.
  * In November 2018, we added Julian Feinauer as a new committer and PPMC 
  member.

### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

  I just double checked, but it seems our mentors are not existent
  there had been one or two issues where feedback was explicitly
  asked for, but both the PPMC as well as all mentors remained silent.
  Except Justin mentioning the absence of mentors. Christofer Dutz
  joined as new Mentor and is active in the project.

latency and bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Produce a release
  2. Grow more active contributors
  3.

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  What has been falling through the cracks is actually producing a release
  for review. That has been looked into [1] but the artifact needs a few
  tweaks to get it right according to ASF standards before it makes sense to
  enter the process.

## Pinot

Pinot is a distributed columnar storage engine that can ingest data in real-
time and serve analytical queries at low latency.

Pinot has been incubating since 2018-10-17.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Increasing frequency of release 
  2. Adding more committers from open source community
  3. Getting word out from community (blogs, etc.)

### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

  Pinot release is scheduled to happen quarterly but has been delayed due 
  to a bug we found in helix that was very hard to track down. 
  https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/331. We finally 
  found the issue, and should be cutting the next release shortly.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  We have had open-source contributions to integrate Calcite SQL parser, 
  support for transforms in selections and filters, support for kafka-2.0,
  and several other bug fixes and performance enhancements. Other 
  contributions on upsert feature, and deep-store commit are in the design
  process.
  Contributions from outside of Linkedin:
   - UDF support in filter predicates: 
   https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/4365
   - Kafka 2.0 support (work authored across open source community): 
   https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/4397
   - Variable length bytes dictionary support: 
   https://github.com/apache/incubator-pinot/pull/4321

### How has the project developed since the last report?
  1. Support for Kafka-2.0 added
  2. Work in progress to move closer to SQL syntax and semantics for 
  constructs supported.
  3. Helix and Pinot controller separation in final phase of development.

   updating SCOUT.
 - SCOUT - last release 10 DEC 2018. Resolved several bugs and dependencies.
 
## Health report:

 - Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in all
   likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.
 - There has been some new feature development recently.
 - There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to
   potential security issues. There were no issues raised since the last
   report.

 ## PMC changes:
 
 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Alex O'Ree on Sun Mar 17 2013

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Juneau Project  [James Bognar]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Juneau is the creation and maintenance of software
related to a toolkit for marshalling POJOs to a wide variety of content types
using a common framework, and for creating sophisticated self-documenting REST
interfaces and microservices using VERY little code

## Issues:
No issues to report.

## Membership Data:
Apache Juneau was founded 2017-10-17 (2 years ago) There are currently 12
committers and 12 PMC members in this project. The Committer-to-PMC ratio is
1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Ayeshmantha Perera on 2019-01-02.
- No new committers. Last addition was Ayeshmantha Perera on 2019-01-02.

## Project Activity:
Version 8.0.0 was released on 2018-12-13.  The community is currently voting
on version 8.1.0 which includes significant new functionality for use in
Spring Boot applications.  We hope to have this released within the next 1-2
weeks.

One of our newer members is working on a new component for a configuration
server.

## Community Health:
dev@juneau.apache.org had a 95% increase in traffic in the past quarter (92
emails compared to 47) 20 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (66% increase)
21 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (320% increase) 120 commits in the past
quarter (15% increase)

Our active community continues to be small and we have struggled to attract
new developers willing to make code contributions.  Our code base is rather
mature/complex and can be daunting for new developers to pick up.  Most of the
current JIRA issues are rather complex feature requests.  Low-hanging fruit
for new developers is not always available.  All code commits within the past
6 months have come from 2 developers.

The PMC Chair believes the project needs more exposure through external
articles which current members have not had time to devote.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform for efficiently storing
and processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========

We released 2.3.0 which includes new features such as incremental cooperative
rebalancing in Connect, external configuration stores, in-memory session store
and window store in KStreams, improved metrics and AdminClient.

We also released 2.2.1 which fixes more than 40 critical issues.

We are working on some of the new Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIP). In
particular, KIP-500 proposes to remove the dependency on Zookeeper to improve
the scalability and the dependency in Kafka.

===========

Lots of activities in the mailing list. We have 2824 subscribers in the user
mailing list, slightly more than the last 3 months. We have 1341 subscribers
in the dev mailing list, slightly more than the last 3 months. We have 432
JIRA tickets created and 220 JIRA tickets closed in the last 3 months.

We didn't add any new committer/PMC member in the last 3 months. We last added
a new committer on Feb. 14, 2019 and we last added a new PMC member on Apr.
18, 2019.

Kafka Summit London completed on May 14, 2019, with more than 1000
participants.

Releases
===========

2.3.0 was released on Jun. 24, 2019.
2.2.1 was released on Jun. 2, 2019.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

## Description:

The mission of Apache Kibble is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to an interactive project activity analyzer and aggregator

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:

Apache Kibble was founded 2017-10-18 (2 years ago)
There are currently 12 committers and 12 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Rafael Weingärtner on 2017-12-09.
- No new committers. Last addition was Rafael Weingärtner on 2017-12-09.

## Project Activity:

The Kibble demo moved to new hardware, where we were able to expand our demo
project to cover all of the ASF's repositories, mailing lists and bug
trackers. This should hopefully mean a wider use from the Apache community,
and thus more feedback.

Issues were raised[1] about, and efforts put into, scanning GitHub and other
resources at a massive scale (like the ASF). We were able to work with the
respective APIs and rules and come up with a process that works well at large
scale.

ComDev have started pulling data from the Kibble demo into the new reporter
tool wizard. (This report was drafted and published via that tool.) There 
are talks about also implementing metrics in Whimsy from Kibble.

A paper was written[2] by a member of the PMC using data gathered from Kibble to
support the validity of the claims in it.

[1] https://s.apache.org/e5wgi
[2] https://s.apache.org/w2gy6

## Community Health:

With Kibble being a relatively small and slow project in mind, we saw a good
uptick in issues opened, and discussions surrounding them.

We continue to be concerned (as we say almost every quarter) by the fact that
practically all of the actual code/doc commits are being made by one person,
and most comments/issues raised are of the "please do this for me" type. We
clearly need to focus on attracting developer/committer interest in the
project.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

## Description:
 - The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache
   Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all
   REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.
- The mission of Knox is the creation and maintenance of software related to
  simplify and normalize the deployment and implementation of secure Hadoop
  clusters.

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Membership Data:
Apache Knox was founded 2014-02-18 (5 years ago)
There are currently 21 committers and 17 PMC members in this project.

## Project Activity:
- Apache Knox 1.3.0 was released in July with over 200 fixes, upgrades and
  improvements.
- Planning for the 1.4.0 release will begin with the backlock of JIRAs and
  discussion around cloud usecases.

## Community Health:
- activity on the JIRAs and commits appear to continue to grow and seem rather
  healthy. Email list traffic seems to be trending down however I believe this
  to be due to much fewer infra related test failures that artificially
  inflated those numbers previously. Community Health Score 4.7

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Libcloud Project  [Tomaž Muraus]

## Description:

Libcloud is a Python library that abstracts away the differences among
multiple cloud provider APIs.

## Issues:

There are no issues which require board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Since the last report we added one new committer (Clemens Wolff) and started
a voting thread for another one.

We are also working on a new release which should be out some time in the next
month.

External contributor activity is similar as in the past and we still receive
a good amount of contributions.

To decrease the barrier to entry and contribution for committers and
external contributions, we decided to move the whole development workflow to
Github.

This means committers can now directly merge user contributions on Github and
we also utilize Github issues for issue tracking and project management.

## Answers to board questions / feedback added to the previous report

1. jj: Concerned that it seems like there is insufficient critical mass
       in the PMC to handle what looks to be a goodly amount of
       external interest

Yes, we had some committer activity issues.

As mentioned in the past, Libcloud utilizes adapter / plugin pattern which
means that even if we have some active committers they might not be an expert
in driver for some specific provider so they can't always effectively review
the code changes / troubleshoot the bug / similar.

2.  druggeri: Agreed with Jim. I would encourage addition to the PMC and
              committer pools even if those individuals are only
              interested in one area of the codebase.

Agreed, we are working on that.

3. rb: Am I correctly understanding that you don't extend committer
       rights to people who only care about one driver? If so, I'd
       encourage you to rethink that policy, as those people are as
       much in ownership of the project as those who care about more
       than one aspect.

We do extend committer rights to people who only care about a single driver /
provider. In fact, a big chunk of our current committer base primarily works
and is interested in a single provider.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 13 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 22 committers.
- Clemens Wolff was added as committer on 2019-07-15

## Releases:

- 2.4.0 was released on Thu Nov 08 2018
- 2.3.0 was released on March 03, 2018
- 2.2.1 was released on September 21, 2017

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Matt Sicker]

## Description:
The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-source
software related to the logging of application behavior and released
at no charge to the public.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Logging Services was founded 2003-12-16 (16 years ago)
There are currently 35 committers and 14 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 5:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Carter Kozak on 2018-07-29.
- No new committers. Last addition was Andrei Ivanov on 2019-04-18.

## Project Activity:
- In June, we released Log4j 2.12.0 which added support for runtime
  reconfiguration via HTTP/HTTPS, Docker, and Spring Cloud Configuration,
  along with numerous bug fixes and dependency updates.
- In August, we just released Log4j 2.12.1 which contains more bugfixes,
  a performance improvement to logger callsite location calculation,
  as well as an improvement to the Log4j 1.2 compatibility layer to not
  require log4j-core as a dependency.
- Discussions over IDE setup complications regarding multiple JDKs in a
  single Maven project raised an interesting point about a current barrier
  to entry in the project. No ideal solution has been identified yet beyond
  requesting IDEs to support Maven toolchains properly.
- A new discussion about the health of Log4net was started back in June
  by a contributor.
- Experiments with a fluent logging API inspired by the current FLogger
  and SLF4J fluent logger APIs discovered interesting performance
  improvements for logger callsite location calculation. After making some
  microbenchmarks, an improvement to the internals of log4j-core was made
  to significantly reduce the number of stack frames that need to be traversed
  to calculate callsite location info.
- In July, we began discussions around potentially adopting a formal
  code of conduct for the project to make the project more welcoming
  to contributors and community members. The general consensus seems to
  be to adopt the ASF's CoC, though there has been no formal action taken
  at this time.
- Discussions began on dropping Java 7 support in Log4j 2.x. This was
  originally deferred to Log4j 3.x, though we want to decouple the Java
  update.
- Early discussions on making new releases of Log4j Audit and Log4j Scala API.

## Community Health:
- Development and mail activity have increased over 100% since last quarter.
  This is explained in more detail in the project activity.
- Discussions around adopting a code of conduct were positive.
- Health of the Log4net subproject was brought up on the mailing lists.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.13 release on May 1,
2019.  The next major release is due on August 31, 2019.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Markus Schuch as committer on 11/25/2016. We
nominated and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did not
sign up any new committers or PMC members this quarter.  We continue to be on
the lookout for new PMC members and committers.  There is an open discussion
for an additional committer at this time but summer vacations are apparently
interfering with this right now.

The lack of quality engagement from the community of users continues to be a
concern.  Many demands exist for redevelopment of, or improvement of, existing
connectors.  Our model of relying on assisted contributions for these
redevelopment efforts cannot succeed if the user community has few competent
developers.  We thank the Board for its inquiry as to whether ComDev might get
involved here, but there is still no plan in place.


Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been fairly quiet this quarter, but requests for
connector development have been significant.  Some connector redevelopment that
was expected to be completed by now is still underway, because of lack of
competent development skill in the new development environment.  Without such
skills, development stalls over very basic issues, like how to debug in a Java
environment, or how to write a single class that can be used to exercise the
new API.

I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Oozie Project  [Gézapeti]

## Description:
The mission of Oozie is the creation and maintenance of software related to A 
workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Oozie was founded 2012-08-28 (7 years ago)
There are currently 25 committers and 21 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Kinga Marton was added to the PMC on 2019-07-16
- No new committers. Last addition was Andras Salamon on 2019-02-14.-

## Project Activity:
- Kinga drove the work on making Oozie compatible with Java 11. She did an
  outstanding job in OOZIE-3459.
- Many third party libraries were upgraded to mitigate vulnerabilities in them
- 5.1.0 was released on 2018-12-19
- Discussion started about a 5.2 release. There are more than a 100 commits
  since 5.1.0 and we'd like to make them available for the public. We're
  looking for a release manager and hoping to get one after the summer.

## Community Health:
Commit and Jira activity remained steady over the summer with busier and
quieter weeks depending on vacations. There were a couple new authors showing
up, but the code contributor count is still pretty low. We're keeping an open
eye for new potential committers among the new contributors.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache OpenWhisk Project  [Dave Grove]

## Description:
The mission of Apache OpenWhisk is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to a platform for building serverless applications with functions

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache OpenWhisk was founded 2019-07-16 (21 days ago)
There are currently 41 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members (project graduated recently).
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:

In the first few weeks post-graduation, there has been a focus on executing
the transfer of the project's resources out of the Incubator.  At graduation,
the project owned 52 github repos; an initial wave of 28 have been renamed and
we are in the midst of updating associated build tasks, cross-links, etc. to
reflect the renaming. A community discussion to identify inactive github repos
that should be archived has been started (most likely about a dozen will be
archived). We anticipate completing the transfer of resources before the
September board report is due.

A "standalone" OpenWhisk jar that enables easy local execution of the
OpenWhisk programming model is nearing completion and has generated community
excitement. We anticipate making a release within the next month to make this
capability widely available.  It will greatly simplify the "kick the tires"
experience of trying OpenWhisk by potentially interested users.

## Community Health:

Overall community health is good.  There is active technical discussion and
development activity across the various levels of the OpenWhisk stack.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe Chiasson]

--- mod_perl --

Apache-Test 1.41 was released on July 11th 2019

-- Activity --

Since the last report was late, there is very little activity to report
to the board this time around.

There was a flurry of activity surrounding the successfull testing and
release of Apache-Test 1.41.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, as usual.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers. 

No new changes to the committer base since last report. 

Last Commiter addition was Jan Kaluza in April 2013

-- PMC --

Currently 11 PMC members. 

No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 

Last PMC addition was Steve Hay on Wed Feb 29 2012

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Phoenix Project  [Josh Elser]

## Description:
The mission of Phoenix is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
High performance relational database layer over Apache HBase for low latency 
applications

## Issues:
No issues at this time!

## Membership Data:
Apache Phoenix was founded 2014-05-20 (5 years ago)
There are currently 44 committers and 30 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Chenglei on 2019-04-09.
  + New PMC member(s) under vote presently.
- Kadir Ozdemir was added as committer on 2019-05-30

## Project Activity:
The community continues to have two active release lines: 4.x and 5.x.

Since the last report, 4.14.2 was released and a 4.14.3 has its second release
candidate out for a vote now.

The 5.x release line has slowed since the initial 5.0.0 release. There was
interest expressed in both 5.0 and 5.1 releases happening, but there is still
significant progress required to get to a first release candidate for either.
One impediment around the 4.x and 5.x release lines was ensuring that code
changes make it to all relevant release branches. This continues to be an
operational challenge for Phoenix as supporting a wide breadth of
compatibility for Apache Hadoop and Apache HBase versions is challenging.

This challenge is constantly being worked. For example, one community member
took the time to re-vamp our automated testing on the ASF Jenkins which now
shows largely passing test results, whereas the test results were essentially
noise (no meaningful data could be parsed from the job output).

On top of release stabilization, we can also be proud of a new significant
feature (PHOENIX-5156 on ASF Jira) which took roughly 6 months to design,
iterate, and commit. This is the hallmark of continuing innovation in Phoenix,
rearchitecting one of the major enticing features of Phoenix to be more stable
for our users.

## Community Health:

Phoenix continues to be an active community with a strong core committership.
Mailing list traffic, Jira issue activity, and commits are up (at least
double-digit percents) over the last quarter.

We did have a rather negative thread[1] on our user list since the last report
in which a number of users expressed dissatisfaction with Phoenix. It is
frustrating to have individuals come to your project's list, ultimately
soliciting "what should I use instead?". Perhaps this is a good reminder to
take a step back and make sure we are doing enough as a community to help make
those who are not committers successful. However, as with all internet-based
communities, I'm sure there are some hyper-critical individuals on our lists
who aren't looking for a solution from Phoenix.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - No new release in this quarter, but a bugfix-release 4.1.1 or 4.2.0 is
   discussed, some changes/enhancements in various areas were performed, one
   regression for memory usage of XSSF were analyzed, but not yet
   fixed/circumvented.

   Early testing of JDK 13 was finished and some pre-testing of JDK 14
   started.

## Health report:
 - There are some ongoing discussions with users about features/behavior which
   indicates that the popularity of Apache POI is still high. Questions via
   email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   Activity from committers was rather low, some developers seem to be tied up
   with other stuff right now, still not critical, but active developer base
   should be expanded again when potential committers show up on the mailing
   lists.

   Bug influx was moderate this quarter, bug-numbers increased a bit, some bug
   influx and some could be fixed, but overall the rate of creation is a bit
   higher than resolving, also due to some invalid bugs being entered which
   need to be analyzed/triaged as well.

### XMLBeans
 - Some work continued on the buildsystem and JDK 9+ support of XMLBeans,
   however not much of it landed in SVN yet.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache REEF Project  [Sergiy Matusevych]

## Description:

 - Apache REEF (Retainable Evaluator Execution Framework) is a library for
   developing portable applications for cluster resource managers such as
   Apache Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Updating the project dependencies for a minor release in September.
 - Finishing work on .Net elastic broadcast. Planning a new release this year.

## Health report:

 - The engagement from the community has been declining perhaps because the
   codebase has been stable.
 - We've decided to do a minor release this quarter to update the project's
   dependencies.
 - Work continues in the elastic broadcast pull request (600+ comments/fixes).
   There was a delay in this effort due to the principal committer's paternity
   leave; We will resume that work after publishing a minor release of REEF.
 - We plan to issue a new release as soon as we merge the elastic group
   communication into master.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:
 - Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup
    search of network services.  Services may be implemented in a number
    of languages, while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at
    least), to allow proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 -  Minimal activity at present, initial work on the modular build structure
    has commenced.  The current monolithic build is complex, with it's own
    build tool classdepandjar, it adds complexity for new developers. In recent
    months I have had work committments that have limited my ability to
    integrate the modular build.  The other committers are waiting for the
    modular build and I have done a lot of work on this locally, this work has
    been a significant undertaking integrating the works of Dennis Reedy, Dan
    Rollo and myself.  This is also a mature codebase, having been in
    development since the late 1990's.

Release roadmap:

River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&   binary release)
River 3.2 - Input validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling&
safe ServiceRegistrar  lookup service.River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - River is a mature codebase with existing deployments, it was primarily
   designed for dynamic discovery of services on private networks.  IPv4 NAT
   limitations historically prevented the use of River on public networks,
   however the use of IPv6 on public networks removes these limitations.  Web
   services evolved with the publish subscribe model of todays internet, River
   has the potential to dynamically discover services on IPv6 networks, peer to
   peer, blurring current destinctions between client and server, it has the
   potential to address many of the security issues currently experienced with
   IoT and avoid any dependency on the proprietary cloud for "things".

- Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes
     required prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and
     Gadget attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports
     IPv4 multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so
     authentication can occur prior to downloading service proxy's,
     this addresses a long standing security issue with service lookup
     while significantly improving performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal
     of support for insecure cyphers.
   * Secure TLS SocketFactory's for RMI Registry, uses
     the currently logged in Subject for authentication.
     The RMI Registry still plays a minor role in service activation,
     this allows those who still use the Registry to secure it.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses
     classdepandjar, a bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
   * Updating the Jini specifications.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache RocketMQ Project  [Xiaorui Wang]

## Description:
Apache RocketMQ is a distributed messaging and streaming platform with low
 latency, high performance and reliability, trillion-level capacity and
 flexible scalability.

## Issues:
Some of the new PMC members, even including release manager, 
make some unofficial release without notice to release packages 
to apache's dist directory. RocketMQ will soon release docker 
images, which needs to be avoided. The ASF is supposed to 
make it easier for developers to develop. It is not 
supposed to be creating red tape to guard the entrance to 
the hallowed halls. However, according to the summary of 
several release managers, for China, Networking instability 
is the biggest obstacle, such as when typing the command
 "mvn -Psigned_release release:perform -Darguments="-DskipTests"
" or "svn commit". 

## Membership Data:
Apache RocketMQ was founded 2017-09-20 (2 years ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 13 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 2:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- ShannonDing was added to the PMC on 2019-06-13
- Kevin Wang was added as committer on 2019-06-29
- John Xu was added as committer on 2019-06-13
- Qipeng Li was added as PMC on 2019-08-12

## Project Activity:
- ROCKETMQ-4.5.2 was released on 2019-08-12.
- Apache RocketMQ Meetup Beijing, China ended 
on Sat Jun. 29 2019, 140+ spectators attended.
- Apache RocketMQ & Apache Flink Shanghai, China 
ended on Sat Jul. 6 2019, 160+ spectators attended.
- Apache RocketMQ Meetup Shenzhen, China 
ended on Sat Jul. 27 2019, 150+ spectators attended.


## Community Health:
Potentially useful observations on community health 
are clearly show in the new version of the ASF Board 
Report Wizard. So, there is no need to mention it here. 
In the past year, the community focused on the 
core feature development of the messging industry 
and the development of multi-language projects. 
At present, several stable versions of each language 
are released, and there are also good use cases 
in some companies. Overall community health 
is good. We have been performing extensive outreach 
to related projects, such as embracing k8s, microservice capability enhancement.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Roller Project  [David M. Johnson]

## Description:
Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based blog server that works well on
Tomcat and MySQL, and is known to run on other Java servers and relational
databases. Latest release is 5.2.4 and the ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org
runs on Roller 5.2.4 Tomcat and MySQL.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Roller was founded 2007-02-20 (12 years ago)
There are currently 9 committers and 6 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 3:2.

Community changes, past quarter:
- Aditya Sharma was added to the PMC on 2019-08-03
- Aditya Sharma was added as committer on 2019-05-19

## Project Activity:
The Roller community fixed a security vulnerability, fixed a series of bugs 
and made a 5.2.3 release on July 12. There was a regression that broke Roller's 
rich text editor, so the community made a 5.2.4 release on July 22. 
The blogs.apache.org site has been updated to the latest release.

The Roller web UI has been rewritten to use Twitter Bootstrap via the 
Struts 2 Bootstrap plugin. The Roller code base has been updated to 
run in Java 11. All of this work has been merged to master and the 
next step is a Roller 6.0.0 release. Roller 6 will be a major 
revision to Roller, but it will have the same database schema as 
Roller 5 and so should be an easy and no-risk upgrade.

## Community Health:
There has been an uptick in Roller activity with new committer and PMC 
member Aditya Sharma. Two releases and major features (Bootstrap UI 
+ Java 11 support) were merged to master. Also a contributor has provided 
the project with a set of new logos to consider. These are good signs 
for community health. 

Here are some stats that back that up:
* dev@roller.apache.org had a 785% increase in traffic in the past 
quarter (124 emails compared to 14)
* 9 issues opened in JIRA, past quarter (80% increase)
* 7 issues closed in JIRA, past quarter (16% increase)
* 37 commits in the past quarter (146% increase)
* 5 code contributors in the past quarter (150% increase)
* 7 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (133% increase)
* 6 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (20% increase)

XML Security in Java and C++

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention.

## Membership Data:
Apache Santuario was founded 2006-06-27 (13 years ago)
There are currently 17 committers and 7 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 9:4.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Daniel Kulp on 2018-10-01.
- No new committers. Last addition was Daniel Kulp on 2018-10-01.

## Project Activity:
There was one new release over the last quarter - Apache Santuario - XML
Security for Java 2.1.4 was released on 2019-07-20. This release fixed a
few bugs and included a fix for a security issue which will be
published shortly.

## Community Health:
Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
the PMC.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Branko Čibej]

Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Branko Čibej]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library built
   upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the default client
   library of Apache Subversion, Apache OpenOffice and mod_pagespeed.

## Issues:
   Activity on the project seems to have come to a halt in the last year.

## Activity:
   There has been no move towards getting Serf 1.4.0 released in the last nine
   months. A release candidate for internal testing was produced, but never
   released. The last Serf release is now 3 years old.

   The only active user of Serf seems to be Apache Subversion. Apache
   OpenOffice uses a version of Serf that was released before Serf became a
   Apache TLP.

## Health report:
   The last commit in the public repository was made on 11th June, being a
   minor fix to the build scripts. The commit previous to that was made in
   November 2018.

## PMC & Committer changes:
   Currently 13 PMC members and 13 committers.

   - No new committers added in the last 3 months.
   - Last new committer added in April 2017 (Evgeny Kotkov).
   - Last new PMC member added in September 2018 (Branko Čibej).

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:
Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs.
The base of the SIS library is modeled according international standards
published jointly by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

## Issues:
Latest release (0.8) was in November 2017. I wrote in reports for about one
year that SIS 1.0 release will come soon, but it has not yet happened. Apache
SIS is receiving active development, but most work has been for new
functionalities considered critical for some clients; we have been able to
allocate resources only a few weeks for preparing the release. The blocking
point is to resolve compatibility issues for all Java versions from 8 to 13.
More details in the "activity" section.

## Membership Data:
Apache SIS was founded 2012-09-19 (7 years ago)
There are currently 22 committers and 20 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Johann Sorel on 2017-09-07.
- Alexís Manin was added as committer on 2019-07-05

## Project Activity:
Developments in this quarter were mostly about improvements in raster data
support (coverage), tuning the API for reading/writing geospatial resources,
and spatial filters applied in queries. Work is starting in map display
capabilities (portrayal). Those core GIS concepts bring Apache SIS to a higher
level compared to previous functionalities, which explain the slight increase
in committers diversity (see "community health" section).

Regarding the SIS 1.0 release, some work has been done in June. This work was
about adjusting above-cited API in the hope to avoid need for API changes
after the release. In addition a new committer (Alexis Manin) provided a patch
for resolving a blocking compatibility issue with Java 11+, but we may want to
do a Maven profile for Java 8 before to apply that patch.

We will miss the geospatial track at ApacheCon this year, but George Percivall
from OGC accepted to insert some slides about Apache SIS in his presentation.

We made a presentation about Apache SIS to the Vietnamese space agency (VNSC)
and to some students of the Vietnam National University.

## Community Health:
We got an increase of email traffic in last quarter, but actually those
numbers fluctuate a lot from quarter-to-quarter and can not be taken as a
long-term trend yet. The most important number is that we had 4 code
contributors this quarter and that those contributors have done an increasing
amount of commits. Apache SIS is still a project with ~95% of the commits done
by a single contributor, but we hope that the recent increase in amount of
other commits will be a long term trend for the reasons cited in the "project
activity" section.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- Discussions are continuing about our next feature release, which will
  likely be Spark 3.0, on the dev and user mailing lists. Some key questions
  include whether to remove various deprecated APIs, and which minimum
  versions of Java, Python, Scala, etc to support. There are also a number of
  new features targeting this release. We encourage everyone in the community
  to give feedback on these discussions through our mailing lists or issue
  tracker.

- We announced a plan to stop supporting Python 2 in our next major release,
  as many other projects in the Python ecosystem are now dropping support
  (https://spark.apache.org/news/plan-for-dropping-python-2-support.html).

- We added three new PMC members to the project in May: Takuya Ueshin, Jerry
  Shao and Hyukjin Kwon.

- There is an ongoing discussion on our dev list about whether to consider
  adding project committers who do not contribute to the code or docs in the
  project, and what the criteria might be for those. (Note that the project
  does solicit committers who only work on docs, and has also added
  committers who work on other tasks, like maintaining our build
  infrastructure).

Trademarks:

- We are continuing engagement with various organizations.

Latest releases:

- May 8th, 2018: Spark 2.4.3
- April 23rd, 2019: Spark 2.4.2
- March 31st, 2019: Spark 2.4.1
- Feb 15th, 2019: Spark 2.3.3

Committers and PMC:

- The latest committer was added on Jan 29th, 2019 (Jose Torres).
- The latest PMC members were added on May 21st, 2019 (Jerry Shao, Takuya
  Ueshin and Hyukjin Kwon).

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The Subversion development community is fairly quiet these days. A
  small trickle of development is ongoing. The community usually
  responds to bug reports and is willing to help the reporter or any
  other volunteer to develop a fix. However, in many cases there is no
  such volunteer, and those bug reports are filed but often remain
  unresolved.

  In July 2019, a handful of developers has managed to put new releases
  out the door. Concerns over potential lack of testing and release
  signatures from PMC members were raised beforehand, but these problems
  did not materialize. Regardless, the project would do better with more
  active developers. The good news is that these issues are being openly
  discussed on our mailing lists, with even non-PMC members contributing
  to these discussions.

  Our user support forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers
  regularly.

  No new committers were added since the one reported in February.

* Releases

  Subversion 1.12.2, 1.10.6, and 1.9.12 were released on July 24 2019.
  These releases contain fixes for two security issues, CVE-2018-11782
  and CVE-2019-0203 (these affect Subversion 'svnserve' servers only.)

  We are currently discussing the possibility of dropping support for
  the 1.9 release series.

  Subversion 1.11 is no longer supported.

* Delayed patching of known security issues

  Patches for the pending security issues mentioned in the previous
  report have now been released.

Users keep asking for basic and advanced features and customization in user@
and are eventually getting supported by the community.

We have been notified of some people submitting their ICLAs with reference to
Syncope, we are eagerly waiting for their contributions.

We are seeing a small increment in both users@ and dev@ subscribers, despite
the relative calm with message exchange.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache SystemML Project  [Jon Deron Eriksson]

## Description:
SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at
flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid
runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to distributed
computations such as Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

## Issues:
Project activity has dropped off significantly this quarter.

## Membership Data:
Apache SystemML was founded 2017-05-17 (2 years ago)
There are currently 26 committers and 23 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 7:6.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Arvind Surve on 2017-05-17.
- No new committers. Last addition was Guobao Li on 2018-08-29.

## Project Activity:
Activity has dropped significantly.
- There were 3 emails on the dev list this quarter.
- There has been only 1 commit since May.
- No pull requests have been opened or closed this quarter.

The most recent release was 1.2.0 on Aug 24, 2018.

## Community Health:
The SystemML community currently is unhealthy.
Email activity appears to indicate a declining interest in the project.
Activity has dropped off from the two most active committers to the
project in the last year (114 of the 135 total commits). This is concerning
in terms of community health because it will make it difficult to review
new contributions without the assistance of existing committers with a
deep knowledge of the project.

## Answers to Board Questions:

 mk: I notice you have some very old pull requests that haven't
      received feedback. j143-bot in particular seems to be getting
      "starved". Do you have enough active committers to handle
      contributions from non-committers?

Great question. I believe j143-bot/j143-zz/j143 all refer to one of our
most active committers (with over 30 commits) in the past 2 years. I
believe the SystemML community has done a great job of welcoming
contributions from both committers and non-committers in the past. However,
I do believe this will be difficult to do in the future (not enough active
committers) if the current activity trend continues.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Activity

The community released 7.1.1 and 7.0.6 in June. These 2 releases are very
similar, with the key difference being 7.1.1 having a requirement of Java SE
8, and includes a number of MicroProfile specifications.

This is a maintenance release which includes dependency updates for Tomcat to
mitigate against:

  CVE-2019-0232 (RCE via CGI Servlet)
  CVE-2019-0199 (DoS via HTTP/2)
  CVE-2018-11784 (potential Open redirect attack)

These releases also include some key fixes for the CMP support, which is
based on dynamically translating CMP entity beans to JPA at deploy
time. Specifically the fixes address issues for users providing custom ORM
metadata in their applications.

Apache TomEE makes use of Commons-Daemon for its Windows service which has
seen recent updates to enable applications using UCRT to get correct
environment variables.

Work on Java 11 continues with intentions of releasing an Apache TomEE 8.0.0
final once complete.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Andy Gumbrecht on Tue Aug 11 2015


## Committer base changes:

- Currently 31 committers.
- Last committer added Roberto Cortez on Thu Sep 6 2018
- Cesar Hernandez invited to become a committer on July 1st 2019. Invitation
  accepted so we'll proceed with legal requirements and then with the
  announcement. Cesar started contributing on the mailing list in October
  2018. He did some great contributions with examples, documentation. But
  more important he has been key in terms of enabling other contributors.  He
  is responsive on the mailing list and he's also the most active in
  there. He's very welcoming and helps reviewing PRs.


## Releases:

- Apache TomEE 8.0.0-M3 on May 29, 2019
- Apache TomEE 7.1.1 on June 21, 2019
- Apache TomEE 7.0.6 on June 21, 2019

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Traffic Control Project  [David Neuman]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Traffic Control is the creation and maintenance of 
software related to building, monitoring, configuring, and provisioning a large 
scale content delivery network (CDN)

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Traffic Control was founded 2018-05-15 (a year ago)
There are currently 24 committers and 15 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is 8:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Derek Gelinas on 2019-03-17.
- Jonathan Gray was added as committer on 2019-06-12
- Brennan Fieck was added as committer on 2019-07-26

## Project Activity:
- Planned a Content Delivery Track for ApacheCon NA
- Agreed to do a 3.1 release before our next major release.  This release will
  contain fixes for some regressions found in the 3.0.1 release as well as
  some key performance improvements made since the 3.0.1 release was made.
- There has been a lot of discussion around a few new features, github
  milestones, and LTS for our releases
- We have also agreed that it is time to start planning our next major
  release, but we haven't nailed down a scope yet.

## Community Health:
The community is healthy. We have less commits and code contributors since our
last report, but we have had an increase in issues closed.  This is due to
some of our key committers working on larger features and our community being
focused on product stability over new features.  We also switched to a squash
and merge strategy for pull requests, which leads to less overall commits.

We have had conversations with several new users which is encouraging for the
overall diversity of our communities.

We are looking forward to having to getting the community together at
ApacheCon which always helps to inject enthusiasm into the project.

See below for specifics on mailing list and github activity:
- dev@trafficcontrol.apache.org had a 21% decrease in traffic in the past
  quarter (167 emails compared to 209)
- 96 commits in the past quarter (-35% decrease)
- 16 code contributors in the past quarter (-51% decrease)
- 138 PRs opened on GitHub, past quarter (6% increase)
- 113 PRs closed on GitHub, past quarter (-15% decrease)
- 154 issues opened on GitHub, past quarter (31% increase)
- 51 issues closed on GitHub, past quarter (8% increase)

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Turbine Project  [Georg Kallidis]

## Description:
The mission of Turbine is the creation and maintenance of software related to
a Java Servlet Web Application Framework and associated component library.

Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the base
of many other projects. It allows experienced Java developers to quickly build
web applications.

## Issues:
The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Turbine was founded 2007-05-16 (12 years ago)
There are currently 11 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 6:5.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Jeffery Painter on 2017-11-12.
- No new committers were added.

## Project Activity:
Three releases were done: Turbine Core 5.0, Maven parent (build) component
and a fixed Fulcrum component. Ongoing discussion about cleaning up
components, git release of Turbine archetypes, site updates and how to define
upcoming Turbine Core 5.1.

Releases:
- Fulcrum Parser 2.0.1 was released on Tue Jul 30 2019
- Turbine 5.0 Core was released on Tue May 28 2019
- Turbine Parent 6 was released on Tue Jul 23 2019

## Community Health:
- The Turbine project's quarter activity has been mainly in the dev mailing
  list with ongoing code changes on low/medium level.
- Providing a ready-to-use development environment, which is in preparation,
  is still important as well as probably (more) svn 2 git migrations (to be
  discussed). While Turbine might seem not to be up front from an outsiders
  viewpoint (which any newcomer is at the beginning), considering, that we are
  still using Avalon as a backbone, it is developed by at least three
  active committers, and has potential with new web
  features added to be an alternative to other java web frameworks with small
  footprint.

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Usergrid Project  [Michael Russo]

## Description:
The mission of Usergrid is the creation and maintenance of software related to 
The BaaS Framework you run

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Usergrid was founded 2015-08-18 (4 years ago)
There are currently 28 committers and 25 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 1:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Mike Dunker on 2016-01-18.

 - Various Bugfixes around index querying and maintenance.
 - Improved test stability.
 - Experimentation with using newer versions(5.x) of Elasticsearch vs.
   supported older version (1.7).

## Community Health:
Growth is flat. Some of the historical core contributors are no longer active
with the project. However, there is a new committer and additional interest
for modernizing Usergrid -- upgrading Cassandra to the latest version and
containerizing Usergrid. Getting the project to a healthier state will
continue to be a focus. This includes more discussion on the mailing lists,
better use of JIRA, and planning of a new release -- master branch is
currently stable and contains many stability fixes over the last release in
2016.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
The mission of Apache Whimsy is the creation and maintenance of software 
related to tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information 
lookup activities

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention

## Membership Data:
Apache Whimsy was founded 2015-05-19 (4 years ago)
There are currently 10 committers and 9 PMC members in this project.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was John D. Ament on 2017-06-11.

## Project Activity:
Some highlights for the quarter:
- We now have Travis testing of tools other than just the board agenda
- Experimental list-traffic and survey tools
- Secretary workbench workarounds to PGP keyserver issues
- Agenda updates to support Jakarta EE, D&I and new chair
- Support for TAC, Brand Management and D&I to maintain their own membership
- New APIs created to support reporter.apache.org

## Community Health:
While I, like others, have never been a fan of quoting numbers in this
section, the following reporter generated statistics caught my eye:

- 196 commits in the past quarter (44% decrease)
- 6 code contributors in the past quarter (40% decrease)

That's not bad for a "down" month. :-)

Sebb continues to outpace the rest of us.  The board agenda tool continues to
have essentially only a single maintainer.  This project has ample oversight.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description:
Apache Xalan exists to promote the use of XSLT. We view XSLT (Extensible 
Stylesheet Language Transformations) as a compelling paradigm that transforms 
XML documents, thereby facilitating the exchange, transformation, and 
presentation of knowledge. The ability to transform XML documents into usable 
information has great potential to improve the functionality and use of 
information systems. We intend to build freely available XSLT processing 
components in order to engender such improvements.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Membership Data:
Apache Xalan was founded 2004-09-30 (15 years ago)
There are currently 57 committers and 5 PMC members in this project.
The Committer-to-PMC ratio is roughly 8:1.

Community changes, past quarter:
- No new PMC members. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-02-19.
- No new committers. Last addition was Bill Blough on 2019-03-20.

## Project Activity:
- Xalan is undergoing a reboot.
- We have ported repositories from Subversion to Git.
- Research on builds is on-going but we cannot find folks with build knowledge.

## Community Health:
Despite the recent reboot, the community is not very active. 
The dev mailing list shows some activity around both the C and Java components.

Attachment BY: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

We have been stalled in the first half of 2019 with limited progress:

* New Website went live: http://lucenenet.apache.org/
* The team was looking at our CI options, the consensus was to try to get on
  Azure DevOps

However, over the past few months the community has submitted pull requests to
patch some important stability and thread safety bugs. We also got enough of
ICU4J ported to support Lucene.Net, which has been an issue that has been
blocking progress for some time. The previous dependency (icu-dotnet) was both
extremely large and unstable, and was causing lots of issues with getting the
tests to run reliably.

We have set up CI on Azure DevOps, which has also addressed another
long-standing issue: the amount of time it takes to increment and test.
Parallel testing was setup to reduce the testing time from around 1 hour and
15 minutes to around 45 minutes. The new setup also allows us to test on Linux
and macOS for the first time.

We released 4.8.0-beta00006 this month with the patches the community provided
as well as some bugs that were newly discovered with the new CI process. The
Lucene.Net.ICU module is now feature-complete. There was a command line tool
named lucene-cli included in the binary distribution of beta00005 but this
time around it has been packaged up as a dotnet tool on NuGet so it can be
installed directly from the command line.

We are currently working on finishing up the test framework module. It was
previously ported, but the fact that it was meant to be an end-user module was
overlooked, so there are several issues to address to ready it for wide use.
We are also working on more automation for generating API documentation to
keep it in sync with releases.

== Releases ==

* Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012
* Working toward 4.8.0 - Currently beta0006, released 2019-08-13
