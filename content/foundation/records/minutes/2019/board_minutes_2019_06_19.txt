 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Craig]

       At the May board meeting, we accepted the resignations of two board
       members and one executive officer. All had served with distinction and
       their resignations were accepted with regret. All positions were
       filled according to past practice and we are now at full staffing.
       Regular order business continues.

       During the transition of the Chairman to Craig Russell, a Request for
       Information from the EU was dropped and the June 4 deadline was
       missed. Corrective action is being taken.

       We entered the fiscal year with a substantial surplus. The budget
       proposes to spend down part of the surplus (run a deficit for the
       year). We will carefully review the proposed budget and expect to
       update/approve it shortly.

    B. President [Sam]

       Much of this past month has been spent on cat herding related to the
       budget; syncing with our new EVP; clarifying leadership expectations
       for any potential Africa events in 2020-21; diversity and inclusion;
       and meta governance discussions.

       ---

       Budget:

       Biggest change is the more accurate picture for conferences in terms
       of both income and expenses.  This shows a net investment (i.e.
       expense) of 160K mostly for big conferences with some additional
       roadshows and small events.  Net risk may be a small multiple of this
       number, but I believe it is containable.

       Next biggest change is Marketing and Publicity which kept their base
       services to the same level as last year, but added anniversary
       promotions and central services.

       Next comes infrastructure where the biggest change is staffing, and
       the biggest factor in this was the decision to fill open head count
       with more senior people.

       Then comes Travel Assistance with a proposal to support committers
       travel.

       A fifth major change is the introduction of Diversity and Inclusion
       expenses, which is partially offset by a targeted donation which
       Daniel and Gris are working through.  This consists of roughly equal
       budgets for Survey Design, Contributor Experience Research, and
       Outreachy funding.  As it is an entirely new budget item, I encourage
       the board to consider the request carefully.

       Overall, this is a lot of change with respect to the FY24 projections,
       but represents a prudent response to the results of those projections:
       we projected a surplus and decided that we should instead be working
       to spend down our ample cash reserves, a direction that was validated
       at our recent F2F board meeting.

       This does total a whopping $520K projected deficit with potential more
       risk from conferences.

       President/EVP split

       I met several times with David.  We continue to have a similar outlook
       and approach.  As opposed to the relatively static split of
       responsibilities I had with Ross, the division will be more dynamic
       between David and I.  At the moment, I'm focusing on finances and D&I,
       he's covering infrastructure and TAC, and everything else will be done
       on a case by case basis.

       Over time we expect this to be a sliding scale, with David taking
       primary role over more over time.  By early next year I expect David
       will be primary on most things, and by mid next year I expect to be
       formally stepping down.  I want to emphasize that none of these dates
       are cast in stone, but if they move, at most I expect they will move
       by a handful of months at most.  Nor does this represent any
       dissatisfaction I have in the role, it just represents my belief that
       rotation is good both for the individual and the foundation.

       Potential Africa events

       There has been confusion about the level of official approval,
       appointment of leadership, and state of progress towards potential ASF
       hosted or sponsored events in Africa in 2021.  The current state is
       that all that has occurred is explorations, nothing has been approved,
       and no leaders have been appointed.  Despite this, we continue to hope
       that we can work towards having one or more Africa events in the
       upcoming years.

        ---

       Diversity and Inclusion

       The first month has focused mostly on infrastructure setup and the
       like.  There has been some minor growing pains in the committee, which
       is totally expected.  This is a group of people, many of which hadn't
       previously worked with each other, some of which had only seen one way
       of doing things and not realizing that there is much variety in how
       things are done.

       Despite short deadlines and other commitments, both a board report and
       a budget request were posted.  In both cases, the first time is the
       hardest, it should get easier as time progresses and process
       improvements are incorporated.

        ---

       Meta-governance

       The Apache bylaws state "The officers of the corporation and the
       members of each existing Project Management Committee shall be
       appointed by the Board of Directors or appointed by an officer
       empowered by the Board to make such appointment" yet there has been
       continuing confusion as to whether the board has, in fact, empowered
       anybody else to make such appointments, and even whether the board can
       do so.

       Unless and until I hear otherwise, I will assume that the board has
       not delegated the creation or removal of VP roles outside of the
       narrow exception created for naming VP, Sponsor Relations following
       the process defined for the creation of that role.  I will, however,
       assume that any and all roles that have been identified as serving at
       the direction of the President serve at the pleasure of the person
       currently occupying the role of President.  I will further assume that
       creation, maintenance, and even destruction of any committees by
       officers reporting into the President do not require prior approval by
       the board.

       If I'm incorrect in any of these assumptions, I ask the board to speak
       up now.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 8.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       As the FY 20 budget is still being worked on we will be comparing May
       2019 to the actuals of May 2018

       Please note that we have updated the “Board Summary”

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s Financial performance in May
       2019:

       Operating Cash on May 31, 2019 was $2,360.2K, which is down $60.1K
       from last month’s ending balance (April 19) of $2,420.3K.  Total Cash
       as of May 31, 2019 is $3,754.1K (includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation) as compared to $3,391.8K on May 31st 2018 (an increase of
       $362.2K year over year). The May 2019 ending Operating cash balance of
       $2,360.2K represents an Operating cash reserve of 16.3 months based on
       the FY19 actual average monthly spending of $144.5K/month (this is
       expected to increase in FY20, but the FY20 budget has not yet been
       approved yet).  The ASF Operating reserve continues to be very healthy
       for an organization of the ASF’s size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the Cash P&L, May 2019 revenue exceeded that of May 2018 by
       $44.8K. However total expenses are higher in May of 2019 by $32.3K. 
       As had been noted in the April 2019 narrative, that based on the
       preliminary FY20 budget information that has been accumulated, FY20
       spending will be more than FY19, and the first month of the fiscal
       year is bearing that out.  Some of which is purely a timing issue,
       such as there was a Board F2F in May of 19 and not in May of 18,
       similarly Infra has filled their team positions, which were open in
       May of 2018.  This all equates to a <$60.1K> deficit in May of 2019 vs
       a <$72.6K> for May of 2018.  So year over year, we are Thus the net
       deficit for May 2019 is ($60.1K) compared to a deficit of ($72.6K) May
       2018.

       Section 5.9 or Section 6.3 of the bylaws; be it therefore

       RESOLVED, that Resolution 7A adopted on May 15, 2019 is hereby

       conduct of its directors and corporate officers, including Board
       appointed, President appointed, and V.P. Fundraising appointed
       officers of the Foundation, will help lead to more productive
       conversations;

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors intends to make this a visible and
       ongoing commitment each year by each new Board of Directors, and as
       such deems it is in the best interest of the Foundation to revisit

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors hereby
       adopts the ASF Director and Corporate Officer Code of Conduct, as
       provided in Attachment CD, as a guide to appropriate conduct; and

       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that each current Director has agreed to
       adhere to that Code of Conduct, subject to the Foundation's Bylaws.

       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Code will be in effect until June
       17, 2020, or 90 days after the next Board Election has concluded,
       whichever comes first, at which time the new Board may choose to renew
       this Code, renew it with modifications, or allow it to expire.

       Special Order 7C, Establish the Apache Director and Corporate
       Officer Code of Conduct, was approved by Unanimous Vote of the
       directors present.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - June 2019

I. Budget: we remain on standby for Board signoff on the proposed FY2020
budget and projections through FY2024. Time is of the essence as some projects
planned to commence in the Summer require our commitment.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising with engaging existing sponsors, securing $375K in sponsorship
renewals, signing on new sponsors, and designing Sponsor forms. Her work with
ASF Conferences is expanding, with continued planning, 4 new sponsors closed,
marketing/creative/PR support, securing three keynoter speakers (2 for Las
Vegas, 1 for Berlin), and finalized a new Community Partnership. There has
been a delay with publishing the latest "Success at Apache" post, which should
be rectified in the coming weeks. We published the latest "Project
Perspectives" post, "Apache Weex (incubating) and The Apache Way"
https://s.apache.org/jjzT .

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 5 June 2019 --The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Program and Early
   Registration Incentives for ApacheCon™ North America

 - 30 May 2019 --The Apache Software Foundation Welcomes JetBrains as its
   Newest Targeted Sponsor

 - 21 May 2019 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Dubbo™ as a
   Top-Level Project


IV. Informal Announcements: 11 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog, and 1 item was published on the ApacheCon Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups
were issued, with a total of 255 weekly summaries published to date. We
tweeted 33 items to 53.6K followers on Twitter. We posted 15 items on
LinkedIn, which garnered more than 87K organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 1 announcement is in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 8 media queries. The ASF received 1,668
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,854. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 3,263 press hits vs. last month's 3,130. ApacheCon received
174 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 1 analyst query. Apache was mentioned in 2
reports by Gartner; 1 report by Forrester; 2 reports by 451 Research; and 2
reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: as the new Central Services sub-group under Marketing &
Publicity continues to build upon its work over the past three months, we are
taking on new projects that include the redesign of apachecon.com. Sally
continues to create all promotional graphics for use in social media to
promote the ASF and ApacheCon, and aims to collaborate with fellow members of
Central Services on future requirements.

IX. Events liaison: we continue to work closely with Virtual and
newthinking/Plain Schwarz on various advisory and tactical support across
ApacheCon/Las Vegas and Berlin. We posted 10 items on the ASF Events and
Apache Roadshow/Chicago pages on LinkedIn, tweeted 32 items on the ApacheCon
Twitter account, and created all promotional graphics, animations, and digital
ad campaigns. Sally continues to work closely with ASF VP Conferences Rich
Bowen, and plans to scale back her day-to-day involvement by mid-month.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 3 pre-paid press releases with GlobeNewswire
through December 2020.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Highlights
==========
- We are starting a second CDN trial, which is looking promising

Finances
========
Our FY20 budget has been submitted to the President, for rollup to the
Board. It appears in this month's agenda for review, modification,
and/or approval.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Finish planning, and migration to a new svn server.
- Upgrade our backup server ("bai") to newer hardware and more storage.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Move our mail server to 18.04/P6

General Activity
================
- Migration of projects' VMs to Ubuntu (LTS) 18.04 and Puppet 6 (P6)
  has begun in earnest. The P6 support has been tested and solidified,
  so we have started the coordinated effort to move VMs.
- Gitbox improvements for availability, with some future plans to
  further harden its uptime.
- Upgrades of services: Pootle, Fisheye, Jira
- Work on upgrading mail-archive.a.o and mail-private.a.o to 18.04/P6,
  along with deprecating minotaur mbox archives (in favor of mbox-vm).
- Many conversions from the deprecated MoinMoin wiki over to
  Confluence. Many projects have voluntarily offered conversion and
  coordinated their move with us. Infra has also performed many moves
  for projects that are in the Attic, or for retired podlings.
- Upgraded Crowd, an SSO solution for our Atlassian products, along
  with integrating our LDAP users' authentication.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon North America 2019

The schedule for ACNA19 is published -
https://www.apachecon.com/acna19/schedule.html - and promotion has started in
earnest. We eventually had 17 project communities come together to curate the
schedule.

We have announced three keynotes: David Brin, noted Sci Fi author and
futurist; Samaira Mehta, founder and CEO of CoderBunnyz and the Billion Kids
Can Code project; James Gosling, father of Java and Distinguished Engineer at
AWS. We also hope to have a good turnout of the Founders for a panel looking
back on 20 years of the ASF, and forward to the next 50 years.

Registration is open - https://www.apachecon.com/acna19/register.html

TAC applications are open, with a June 21 deadline.

Over the coming 90 days we will be focusing on promoting the event, finalizing
sponsorship, and planning the on-site details.

Steve Blackmon has stepped up to lead the organization and promotion of the
Hackathon.

ApacheCon Europe 2019

The CfP has closed and the track chairs have provided their feedback on their
desired session count.  We have also been coordinating with TAC (room-block
secured).  We have secured two keynotes, and are in discussions on a third. 
The founders session will fill the fourth of four keynote slots, so keynotes
are very close to being resolved.  Currently we are working towards creating a
schedule, and other work has been put on hold while that proceeds.

Other

An event will be held in China, which was initially pitched as an Apache
Roadshow. However, given the timing (just a few weeks after ACEU) we decided
that we are unable to support this event in any meaningful way.

Discussion of ApacheCons in 2020 has begun, with the hope of announcing at the
2019 events.

At this time, there is discussion of various other events in 2019 and 2020,
but nothing appears to have progressed past the discussion stage.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Report Travel Assistance Committee (June 2019)

Events
======

There are two ApacheCon events happening within a month of each other, this
has the effect on the TAC committee of running two application campaigns more
or less side by side. Two lots of applications open, two lots of judging, two
lots of booking Flights, Hotel reservations, checking and sending supporting
letters for Visas, etc etc ...

Due to this, we have decided on two 'Lead Coordinators'  - Gavin McDonald is
the Lead for ACNA Las Vegas and Christopher Dutz is to be the lead for ACEU
Berlin. The 'Lead Coordinator' is in charge of making sure everything gets
done, and gets done in order and on time. It is 'not' their job to do
everything, but to plan timelines, coordinate with other TAC members helping
out, other committees, Financial, ensure things get paid, ensure judges get
done on time, etc etc, all the way through to making sure someone is there to
meet and greet each successful applicant, to ensure that they know their
duties whilst at ApacheCon, in coordination with the event organisers - and to
ensure they safely get checked out of the Hotel without issue and get to the
Airport in time for their flight(s). Not a small task and I for one thank
Chris for stepping up to handle ACEU!


ApacheCon NA Las Vegas 2019
--------------------------------------------

We are open for applications until June 21st 2019. Currently there are 27
applications submitted. We expect quite a few more before the closing date.
Two more reminders will be sent between now and then. Judging will take place
around 23rd June and we have 4 judges. Accommodation has been secured.

ApacheCon EU Berlin 2019
-------------------------------------

We are open for applications until July 14th 2019. Currently there are two
applications - one of which also applied for ACNA - but it is also early days
having opened later than ACNA.

Judges have yet to be selected. Accommodation has been secured.

We will use (as usual) a single travel agent for all flights, for both events.

Tooling
======

We are using a new json based app to replace the Py/DJango we have used for
several years. The new app is still being written in stages but should be
completed soon.

Mailing Lists
==========

The main members only 'travel-assistance@' mailing list has 20 subscribers.
Activity has started to increase with 43 emails in May and 4 so far in June.

There is also a non-archived 'tac-apply@' alias which the judges use once
applications are closed.

TAC Membership
=============

No changes to the TAC membership this month (and for many months). There will
be a proposal to remove inactive members soon - every once in a while have an
alignment of membership to those who are regarded as active. This is a
committee, not a PMC, and as such we have chosen to keep our membership upto
date, reflecting active members.

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of Diversity and Inclusion  [Gris Cuevas]

## Description:

- The Diversity and Inclusion committee is a group of individuals working
  towards generating a current description of the D&I landscape in the
  industry and for the foundation. We are also focused on developing resources
  the projects can leverage to increase diversity and inclusion in their
  communities

## Issues:
- There are discussion around the formation of the committee, the board is
  aware of them and will be address at the board meeting

## Activity:
- The VP position was established in May 2019 and a committee will advise the VP
- We requested infra resources: Jira board, mailing lists, wiki page and web
  landing page
- We started discussions to define our values, mission, vision and goals for
  2019, 2020 and 2025
- We launched a Diversity FAQ section
- We outlined a 2020 budget request to present to the board
- We started threads to share reading materials, talks, etc.
- We started discussions around diversity and inclusion content at ApacheCon

## Health report:
- The committee is healthy, is active, but we could use more input from new
  folks in the community
- We also need to focus on landing more deliverables

## Committee members changes:
- The committee was created with 18 members

## Releases:
- We haven't launched/shipped/delivered anything yet

## Mailing list activity:

Attachment 9: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing specific to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time.
(we're steady at 20, unresolved issues this month).

We have worked with DLA Piper and Linux foundation on formulating our official
position around DoC's Huawei Entity List ruling:
https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/statement-by-the-apache-software and
also greatly clarified our our EAR page:
https://www.apache.org/licenses/exports/

We've completed review of the JetBrains sponsorship agreement and clarified
the implications of JetBrains licensing to committers@.

Thanks to Hen we now have our official P&C mailing list setup. The subscribers
are strictly limited to:
* board-private@apache.org (which is limited to the 9 board members)
* All active ASF counsel (Mark Radcliffe currently, unless we determine SFLC
  are still active)
* ASF Legal VP, ASF Data Privacy VP, ASF Assistant Legal VP

We have completed the legal review of the Eclipse Foundation Jakarta paperwork
and expect to hand it over to Jakarta VP once Mark is approved for his role
this month.

We started to evaluate additional options for counsel to augment the work of
DLA Piper. We expect to have an update on this in a month or two. Mishi
Choudhary from SFLC is looking into refreshing the relationship with us. In
additional to that we also had Cliff Allen reaching out offering his help. We
expected to make more progress on evaluating these individuals and/or
organizations, but unfortunately the ammount of urgent activity this month
prevented us from making progress.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.  Had a discussion
with Mitre over the slow response to issues and how ASF operates in
handling security issues with a view to better supporting us in the CVE
process.

Stats for May 2019:

      11         [license confusion]
      12         [support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 44 (last months: 29, 39, 35)

       6 [web site related]
       4 [httpd]
       3 [sling], [tomcat]

                [shiro], [skywalking], [spark], [struts], [tika],
                [trafficserver],

     In total, as of 3rd June  2019, we're tracking 73 (last month:
     65) open issues across 37 projects, median age 91 (last month:
     82) days.  44 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     8 (last month: 8) of these issues, across 5 projects, are older
     than 365 days.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Airflow Project  [Bolke de Bruin]

## Description:
 - Apache Airflow (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically
   author, schedule, and monitor workflows. When workflows are defined as
   code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and
   collaborative. Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of
 workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line
 utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user
 interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor
 progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Increasing community engagement from several companies (e.g. Astronomer,
   Google)
 - Airflow has been accepted as part of Google's Summer of Docs. This is
   effort coordinated by Aizhamal on Airflow's side.
 - We received and addressed three vulnerability reports (two were the same
   issue manifesting in different ways plus one duplicate.) in the 1.10.3
   release: CVE-2019-0216, CVE-2019-0229. We also received a duplicate report
   after the release.

## Health report:
 - We have grown from 743 to 807 contributors since our last report. Many only
   submit one small fix and don't commit further.
 - We have invited a 7 new committers (and confirmed) since our last report.
 - 158 commits have made to the 1.10 release branch since our last release[1]
 - 339 commits to master branch (which will become Airflow 2.0.0) since our
   last report
 - We have started planning a roadmap for Airflow 2.0

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Aurora Project  [Jake Farrell]

Stephan Erb (serb) submitted the following report:

Dear Apache Board,

The Apache Aurora project will not be able to deliver a board report as
requested.

We are currently not matching the required number of PMC members and don't
have an active Chair. I have just raised this to the users and dev list to see
if the community is willing to step up.

I will inform the board if there are any updates.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis2 Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

- Axis2 Java 1.7.9 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Axis2 Java 1.8 (development)

- Axis2 C 1.7 (development)

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained.

Most of our users are using legacy SOAP services so we are lacking new
committers.

Our first priority continues to be responding to emails from
security@apache.org, for both Java Axis2 and Axis 1.x (last released in 2006).

Because of our mature code bases, we expect the security issues to become less
frequent in the near future.

At that point we can better grow our community by better docs in areas more
relevant today, such as REST and GSON. Axis2 has excellent support already in
those areas but there are few code examples.

Axis2 C PMC member Bill Blough has continued his progress via commits and Jira
issues this past quarter.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.
## Releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## JIRA Activity

- 8 JIRA tickets created in the last 90 days.
- 4 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 90 days.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as
Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Currently, Bahir provides extensions to
multiple distributed analytic platforms, extending their reach with a
diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data sources.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Apache Bahir community continues to see a flow of contributions enhancing the
existing extensions for both Apache Spark and Apache Flink.

The community has produced two new releases on the past month and is currently
working on necessary updates to perform a release compatible with Spark 2.4
and Scala 2.12.

There is a need to produce a new release of the Flink extensions and this has
been discussed on the project mailing list.

   data processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed
   execution engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to
   different technologies and user communities.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

 - A portable Spark runner added capable of running Python and Go pipelines in
   Batch mode.

   status, a signal to users that it is new and may have breaking changes
   before it becomes finalized.
 - Beam Katas (interactive programming exercises of gradually increasing
   complexity) based on JetBrains Education Products have been added to the
   project to aid increasing user growth. They are available for Python and
   Java.
 - Cross-language transform support for Flink runner was added. It now
   possible (with some effort) to build a pipeline in Python that utilizes
   transforms authored in Java.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matthew Jason Benson]

## Apache BVal Report June 2019 ##

 - The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
   specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
   the foundation on February 15, 2012.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Over the past quarter the team has managed to put out a needed point
   release, despite a precipitous drop in the availability of the chair.

 - We have accumulated a new committer/PMC member.

 - Finally, we have seen recent community participation that during the next
   quarter will, in all likelihood, result in releases on both the 1.x and
   2.x development lineages.

 - It remains an open task to certify Apache BVal as an implementation of
   the 2.0 BV specification.

## Health report:

 - We retain a small core of developers with the desire to keep this project
   afloat. It is not clear how to attract additional hands other than to
   trust that the right people for this niche project will find their way.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - Thomas Andraschko was added to the PMC on Wed May 15 2019

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 15 committers.
 - Thomas Andraschko was added as a committer on Thu May 16 2019

## Releases:

 - 2.0.2 was released on Wed May 15 2019

## Mailing list activity:

 - These numbers reflect the recent flurry of activity:

 - dev@bval.apache.org:
    - 42 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 85 emails sent to list (49 in previous quarter)

 - user@bval.apache.org:
    - 54 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software
related to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions.
Any language and build system are welcomed.


Status

------
Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk
of the project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing
lack of progress.

If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Recent updates:
* Migration to github eases work on RAT since it simplifies
contributions - Creadur benefits from that.
* Mainly infrastructure changes
* Project development: fixing security problems and bugs/enhancements


Community

---------

In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC /

Commit.



Releases

--------

Apache Rat 0.13 was released Nov 5th, 2018

Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016 Apache Rat  0.11 was

released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam, Calcite, Hadoop,
Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The work on improving community aspects is still ongoing. There is work in
    reorganizing the contribution process to encourage more early discussions,
    rather than immediately opening pull requests.

  - There are now more regular discussions on the private mailing list about
    committer and PMC candidates now. The project is adding PMC members and
    committers more regularly now. Actively reaching out and mentoring new
    candidate needs more follow-up work by the PMC.

  - The integration of the contributed Blink fork is ongoing. A good part of
    it will be included in the next Flink release (1.9).

  - The community working on the Flink 1.9 release. The release has among
    other things a complete overhaul of the Table API, a new SQL/Table query
    processor based on the Blink contribution, a new scheduler architecture
    and failover mechanics for batch/bounded programs. The release also
    introduces a first version of Python Table API.

  - Flink Forward San Francisco took place on April 1-2 with many Flink
    committers and contributors attending. The call for participation for
    Flink Forward Berlin just closed, the organizers plan to offer free passes
    again for Flink committers.

COMMUNITY

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Guacamole Project  [Mike Jumper]

## Description:
 - Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway which supports
   standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH. We call it "clientless" because
   no plugins or client software are required. Once Guacamole is installed on
   a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Progress toward 1.1.0 continues. Development toward release slowed down at
   the end of last quarter but has recently picked back up.
 - GUACAMOLE-249 (adding support for the 2.0.0 RCs of FreeRDP's library)
   remains both a priority of 1.1.0 and a major obstacle.

## Health report:
 - The project is healthy. Development and community involvement continue to
   be active.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server. Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems. The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well as
non-ASF projects and their dependencies. It started in the Java part
of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

## Summary

Some infrastructure activity, but really no changes compared to the
last quarter.

## Releases

Gump has never done any releases. One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

## Activity

We have migrated the content of the Moin Wiki to Confluence and it
seems to be working fine, but we still need to change some links on
our website before we can turn off the Moin instance.

The infra team has set up a new VM for Gump and we situation is
similar to that of the Wiki, we need to fix a few links, ensure
everything is working as expected and can then turn off the old VM.

The Tomcat and Forrest communities are still using Gump actively.


## Changes to the Roster

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

# Incubator PMC report for June 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

At the request of the board, this monthly report is in markdown so that 
it's easier to read. Some podlings struggled to get their content in the 
correct format. If you are viewing the report not in that format it can
seen here:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INCUBATOR/June2019
(minor changes exist)

There are presently 49 podlings incubating. During the month of May,
podlings executed 12 distinct releases. We added one new IPMC members and 
three IPMC members retired.

We have no new podlings this month. One project graduated last month Dubbo 
and a couple of other podlings are heading towards graduation in the next 
few months.

Milagro which failed to report twice, reported this month and is again trying
to reboot themselves, they seem a bit more serious this time. Toree's report,
also missing last month, did report. 4 Podlings BRPC, DLab, and Iceberg didn't
submit a report and have been asked to do so next month.

Samoa is considering retiring.

There were no IP clearances.

The IPMC requires clarity from the board if podlings need to follow ASF's 
release policy and distribution policy while in incubation.

*Some Background*

What is happening in practice is that the IPMC allows releases with minor
issues to go ahead and assumes they will be fixed in a later release
(before graduation) and stops  releases with any serious problem from going
ahead (with an IPMC member or two voting -1). A -1 vote is not a veto but
usually stops a release, there's only been a handful of successful releases
with -1 votes. I don't think anyone thinks that allowing releases with minor
issues to be released is an incorrect approach even if it doesn't follow policy,
even if some people have expressed an opinion that release must be "legal".
Serious problems, such as; including GPL licensed software, including compiled 
code, or copyright violations, in a release is currently seen as a reason 
to vote -1 on a release. Podlings do try and do the right thing but
about 1 in 5 podling releases has a problem like this. Historically
there's been a few releases with serious issues that have got legal and
incubator VP approval to make a release on a one by one, once-off basis.

These is a clear consensus that the IPMC wants to make this somehow easier
for podlings.

*Current Situation*

Recently it has been suggested by several people (including ex-board
members) that serious issues should be allowed in an IPMC release, and those
issues only need to be fixed before graduation. We've had several long
conversations about this and this seems to be unresolvable. I'll note there
have been previous conversions along the same lines recently and going
wayback, for instance in 2013, that also failed to get consensus.

Some people believe that podling releases do not have to follow policy and
most things are allowed until graduation and others say that ASF policy can be
ignored but releases must be legal, (which they may or may not realise is
stricter than what happens currently). This is damaging to the incubator and
causing confusion among podlings. This issue also seems to attract 
commentary by non-IPMC members whose opinions, not in line with policy, are
spread outside the IPMC list. One podling is likely to leave the incubator,
in part, because of this situation.

*Actions*

Initially, this report contained a proposal, to try and improve this 
situation, however, as it didn't have the consensus of the IPMC, it
has been removed.

From this discussion, The IPMC has identified a few things that can be 
done, like improving the incubating DISCLAIMER, and coming up with clearer
guidance with the the help of the legal committee on exactly what a podling
release should follow.

But either of those solves the underlying issue. We have been given 
contradictory guidance from the board in the past, which is making this
situation difficult. If the board could provide some clarity on what extent
that podling releases need to follow ASF policy, the IPMC would appreciate it.

*Current Challenges*

These policies live outside the incubator, and it's put in the difficult 
position of ensuring that podlings (via their mentors) are following them
by the time they graduate. In some cases it seems that these are not been
clearly passed on, this may be due to time poor mentors, lack of policy
knowledge, overzealous automation, and/or a poor fit of ASF policies with
modern development workflows. Modern development workflows seem to bring
up more issues for the IPMC, with use of multiple GitHub repositories,
wider looser communities (causing possible branding and trademark issues),
and expected use of alternative means of distribution. While work has been
done, and continues on how these practices fit into the ASF landscape/policy,
some podlings are struggling with inconsistent guidance and lack of
documentation on this. The IPMC also needs to be clear up front that some
podlings may need to make major changes to how they do things to become
a TLP.

A while back the IPMC identified all of the mentors that were missing, and 
not performing their duties, and ask them if they wanted to continue, most 
of them stood down from the IPMC. During this process, it was found there 
was a strong correlation between not signing off reports and missing 
mentors. Looking at the reports being signing off there are currently 13 
possibly inactive mentors. This number is a massive improvement over the 
last time where we had over 70 inactive mentors and is a good indicator 
that mentors are currently more engaged.

Some of the incubator wiki pages were missed in the transfer and infra are 
looking into why.

Podlings were reminded that they to put their logos on 
http://www.apache.org/logos/ about 1/3 of them responded and added their 
logo.

A large number of Podlings didn't have their PPMC members or mentors signed 
up to their private list. A few mentors and podlings have corrected this 
and reminders to fix this situation has been sent to 20 podlings.

## Crail

Crail is a storage platform for sharing performance critical data in
distributed data processing jobs at very high speed.

Crail has been incubating since 2017-11-01.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Community building: Increase on number of contributors
     and users.
  2. Further increase project visibility by establishing a
     convincing use cases of Crail.
  3. Make Crail better consumable / cooperate with other projects on
     Crail integration.

### Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be 
aware of?

  None

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Apache Crail was presented at 2019 Strata data conference
    in San Francisco. The presentation is online available.
  * We added one new blog posts to the projects Apache home page.
    It covers deployment options for tiered storage disaggregation.
  * A paper on an Apache Crail based, unified ehpemeral data
    storage architecture got conditionally accepted at the
    USENIX ATC'19 Conference in July.
  * The @ApacheCrail twitter account has now 164 followers. We use
    it to regularly tweet the availability of new blog posts,
    code releases etc.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  * New CrailConfiguration API to allow setting Crail configuration
    dynamically instead of loading it from a file.
  * NVMf tier: It is now possible to set Client host NQN to support
    restricted access on target side. If host NQN is not specified,
    a random UUID is still generated.
  * Started design of fault tolerance/robustness extensions
    to Crail namenode implementation.
  * Started integration of Crail as an ephemeral data store for
    serverless frameworks. Publicly discussed integration options
    at a presentation on 2019 OpenFabrics workshop.
  * Continued native C++ implementation of Crail tailored to
    Machine Learning framework integration.

     Comments: In my opinion Druid is overdue to graduate. There seems to
       be off-list consensus that graduation is near but I would like to
       see more conversation on-list. I don't agree that mentors "have
       been very helpful"; for the record, the other two mentors have been
       absent, including from tight release votes. I suspect that they
       are fatigued.

  by Apache (iotdb-vm.apache.org).
  2. A distributed version is almost done (in the 'cluster branch').

  3. In the last 3 months, we opened 78 JIRA issues and resolved/closed 40 
  JIRA issues.
                        Created   Resolved

on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both
Hadoop and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. MYRIAD-279: Reworking a new UI design
  2. MYRIAD-280: Improve overall stability
  3. Rethink a new roadmap for empowering the project 

### Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be 
aware of?

  We need new mentors. The PPMC number is a problem too, we are only two 
  PPMCs/committers, so we have problems with the minimum number of votes
  for consensus. 

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  We don't have activity in our community for this period.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  After a few years of inactivity the project is slowly getting activity, 
  at least from the PPMC point of view. The initial PPMCs are not active
  anymore, nevertheless the current PPMCs (only two right now) are able of
  continuing the project from a formal point of view, we are able  of
  creating new releases and to put under control the ASF resources available
  for Myriad, so the current PPMCs has the knowledge of creating new 
releases
  from end-to-end.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Document additional features added for the integration with Apache 
     Phoenix, as well as, the low latency algorithm.
  2. Get positive feedback from other projects currently in Apache.
  3. Do podling name search.

### Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be 
aware of?

  N/A

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Lars Hofhansl returned as a mentor.
  2. A new release 1.0.1 was done that contains optimizations and bug fixes 
  for the integration with Apache Phoenix.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

Release 1.0.1 was published and includes optimization to Omid that inferred 
from the integration with Phoenix. These features mostly improve the 
performance of Omid, however, some are bug fixes that revealed by the 
integration with Phoenix while pushing Omid to its corner cases.

  2. Make it easier for Devs to contribute to the project (e.g. 
  documentation, framework).
  3. Developing a workflow in Spot that allows for intuitive analytics.

### Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be 
aware of?

  No

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Unfortunately there has not been much more community activity. However, 
  we  are need of more committers as there are only a couple of active 
  committers at this time. This creates a bottleneck which makes it hard
  for the community to grow in interest.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  There's been discussions on the dev list to merge the existing SPOT-181 
  ODM branch into the master branch so that its easier to use the Open Data 
  Model within the existing architecture. This should avoid a lot of 
  confusion among new community members in the future as most of the recent
  work as been done in the SPOT-181 branch. A series of PRs have also been 
  evaluated and we're waiting for more votes before starting the merge 
  process on those PR, and also the PR for moving SPOT-181 into master.

## Superset

Superset is an enterprise-ready web application for data exploration, data 
visualization and dashboarding.

Superset has been incubating since 2017-05-21.

### Most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  Plan and execute our first Apache release. While pushing three release 
  candidates this far, we ironed out many issues around licensing, 
  copyright, and the existence of binary files in the repository /
  source code releases. 
  Address remaining project operations issues. See below.

### Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be 
aware of?
  For project operations, we have made the following progress and need the 
  following support:
  Trademark: No progress has been made here. No one volunteered to get this 
  done. Some attempts have been made but the documentation and deliverable 
  are confusing / unclear.

### How has the community developed since the last report?
  * Organic growth of our Github contributors (343->368), forks 
  (4300->4633), watchers (1170->1166) and stars (23,326->24,442)

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Added Ville Brofeldt as a new committer
  * Promoted Beto de Almeida from committer to PMC member
  * Promoted Krist Wongsuphasawat from committer to PMC member on 2019-04-23
  * In general, there has been a healthy, constant flow of bug fixes, 
  quality improvements and new features. Please see project’s commit log on
  Github for more details. Some highlights:

### Release-related:
  3 RCs were brought up for vote (2 failed, one vote in-progress), issues 
  were raised and addressed, the release process and release validation 
  process is becoming more automated through the use of Docker, which 
  allows for a reproducible reference implementation
  Moved example-related data to live outside of the repository and be 
  downloaded upon running “superset load_examples”
  Got rid of an image with an unidentified license
  Removed .mo files (translation-related binaries)

### New features / Progress
  * feat: Scheduling queries from SQL Lab (#7416) (#7446)
  * feat: Live query validation in the SQL Lab UI
  * Progress on visualizations as plugins and embeddable components
  * propagate color mapping from dashboard to charts
  * view presto row objects in data grid

### Bug fixes, code quality and housekeeping
  * Improved stability / usability of SQL Lab
  * Improved stability / usability of geospatial visualizations
  * More repo automation with issue stale bots
  * Fix control validation handling

data-driven workflows.

Taverna has been incubating since 2014-10-20.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Re-engage PPMC members
  2. Release IP-fixed repositories
  3. Graduate!

### Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be 
aware of?

  Whimsy detected some PPMC members where not signed up to private@taverna 
  list, as well as false negatives on emiritus mentors and alternative 
  addresses.
  Missing members have been requested added.  

  (our private list is quiet except for PPMC voting)

### How has the community developed since the last report?

  Active in March/April, quiet in May.

### How has the project developed since the last report?

  Release candidate of Taverna Mobile was in progress based on GitHub 
  release mechanism, but this became challenging as its Android source code 
  tend to include a Gradle binary and don't have good release-helpers like
  in Maven.

  This meant the Android release had to be delayed to be done "manually".

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Marcel Reutegger]

## Description:
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming implementation
of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content repository is
 stable, largely feature complete and actively being maintained. Jackrabbit
 Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
 repository as a modern successor to the Apache Jackrabbit content repository.
 It is targeted for use as the foundation of modern world-class web sites and
 other demanding content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak
 does not implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it
 is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All maintenance
branches and the unstable development branch are continuously seeing moderate
to high activity.

We made our 7th feature release of Jackrabbit Oak (1.14) in June.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of the work
going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly driven by
dependencies from Jackrabbit Oak.

We changed the release strategy for Jackrabbit Oak. The aim is to reduce the
number of maintained branches in the long run and deliver new features to
users more frequently. Feature releases are now planned roughly ever two
months. See https://s.apache.org/9SYQ on oak-dev for details.

A hackathon was held in Basel this quarter (https://s.apache.org/LRn6).
Various topics were discussed during the hackathon, including the planned
Apache MoinMoin Wiki decommission, making it easier for developers to run
proposed changes through a CI/CD pipeline and a prototype for asynchronous
commits.

As part of the hackathon the Apache Jackrabbit MoinMoin Wiki was archived
(https://s.apache.org/7rDN) and the project will no longer use a Wiki system.

## Health report:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all mailing
lists reflecting the activity of the respective component.

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user lists as
well as on the various JIRA issues.

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the JIRA issues
and the desire of the individual contributors to bring features and
improvements in for the next Jackrabbit Oak release.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 52 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Joshua Project  [Tommaso Teofili]

## Description:

Apache Joshua is a statistical machine translation toolkit.


## Issues:

 - The PMC has not been able to report in the past 5 months
 - Activity in the project is very low

## Activity:

 - Since last board meeting a PR from a non committer was merged and a missing
   fix related to post graduation task (dropping -incubating suffix) was
   performed

 - Since graduation (October 2018) activity in the project has been slowing
   down. One of the reasons for that is that some of the major code
   contributors moved to using/developing other machine translation libraries
   based on deep learning (NMT) rather than on statistical approach (SMT, like
   Joshua)

 - A potential GSoC candidate approached the project on the dev mailing list,
   got a reply but never followed up

## Health report:

 - The community is essentially the same since graduation. No potential new
   committers / PMC members showed up

 - Mailing lists have low activity. a roadmap was discussed and agreed in
   March 2019, follow up Jira tasks were created (labelling some with gsoc
   label to hopefully foster interest from GSoC students)


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 10 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition: Wed Oct 17 2018 (Felix Hieber)

## Releases:

 - No releases were performed since graduation

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Cassandra Targett]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core
- PyLucene is a Python extension for accessing Lucene

## Issues:
- There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
We have released Lucene and Solr 6.6.6, 7.7.2, 8.0, 8.1.0, and 8.1.1 since
the last report. PyLucene has also had a release, 7.7.1.

6.6.6 was released so users who need to remain on 6.x for the time being
have a way to get CVE/critical bug fixes which were released in later
versions.

7.7.2 was released to backport to 7.x a few important bug fixes that were
discovered with Solr performance. These same fixes were released in Solr
8.1.

With 8.1.0, we integrated Luke, a popular GUI for Lucene index inspection
andh had been maintained as an external add-on, as a core feature of
Lucene. Another key Lucene enhancement was the addition of a query
inspection API. Solr added support for JWT authentication, collection
aliases based on arbitrary field values, and the ability to rename and
reindex collections.

8.1.1 was released to fix a bad bug with querying collection aliases which
was discovered right after the release of 8.1.0.

Another severe bug in 8.x was discovered after release of 8.1.1, this one
with Basic Authentication support in Solr, and a volunteer release manager
has initiated the release process for 8.1.2.

We have decided to make Java 11 a minimum Java version for our next major
release (Lucene 9), and have changed our master Git branch accordingly.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    In this period of reporting, 7 of tickets has been created and
    3 resolved, basically, we have come up with the idea to validate the memory
    pointer in the layer of memory services that ensure the pointer is valid to
    recover durable objects. we also started the tickets about the python
    support. this feature will increase the influence of our project and ease
    the use of durable object for Python developers. we have completed some
    tickets to improve the Maven configuration and remove some warning during
    project building.
    Our community also started the GSoC mentoring activities, but looks our
    GSoC student is a bit difficult to reach out, might be in the different
    country and timezone.

Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public but development continues.

PMC Changes:
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - no new PMC member added since Jun. 2018.

Committer Base Changes:
 - Currently 13 committers.
 - No new committer added since Jun. 2018.

Releases:
 - Last release was v0.12.0 on Sep. 04 2018
 - Still active development on next major version (0.13)

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe Chiasson]

--- mod_perl --

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since 2016-10.

-- Activity --

Following last cycle's board feedback regarding the dormancy of this project,
I performed a rollcall with the PMC and multiple hands were raised, beside my
own.

Like I pointed out before, I'd call the project stable and somewhat dormant at
this time, but not devoid of interested and responsible PMC members.

For the time being, I am not sure what concrete steps can be taken. Certainly
open to suggestions, but I suspect for the time being, there is little that
can be done.

The project is still being used by numerous projects and organisations, it
just doesn't see a lof of changes at the moment.

There could be better support for httpd-2.4 onwards API parity, but that
hasn't even really been raised by end-user much as an apparent concern.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, as usual.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers.

No new changes to the committer base since last report.

Last Commiter addition was Jan Kaluza in April 2013

-- PMC --

Currently 11 PMC members.

No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Last PMC addition was Steve Hay on Wed Feb 29 2012

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache PLC4X Project  [Christofer Dutz]

## Description:
 - Apache PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial
   programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with
   a shared API.

## Issues:
 - none

## Activity:
 - Part of our team attended the European Union EU-FOSSA2 Hackathon in
   Brussels, which was a huge success. Not only did we work on quite a lot of
   different topics, but we managed to win 2-3 new people for the project,
   some of which have become quite active since then.

 - We managed to add OPC-UA client support with a new Java OPC-UA driver. This
   was a highly requested feature in the past.

 - Our multi-language configuration work has progressed very well and we
   hardened our build to do some pre-build-diagnostics in order to assist new
   contributors with setting up the project. We are currently fine-tuning this
   tooling. At the moment our build works fine with: Java, C++, C# and Python
   on Mac, Linux and Windows systems and we are able to release all of these
   with our standard release procedure. This has been proven by our first TLP
   release (Apache PLC4X 0.4.0) which is also the by far best tested and
   reviewed RC we ever had. Maximum KUDOs to our team for this.

 - We are currently working hard on finding ways to generate the boilerplate
   code for the drivers. Multiple people are working on different proposals
   for this. We are expecting to consolidate these into a new workflow within
   the next few months.

 - On 24th May 2019 we had our first Meetup as TLP and used this to also do a
   little graduation party where a big part of the community attended


## Plans for the future:
 - We hope to consolidate the code-generation initiatives and form a standard
   code-generation workflow for the project.

 - As soon as that's done we will start converting more and more protocols
   into a form so we can generate the drivers in the future.

 - Also do we need more working ports of existing drivers for generating
   code-generation templates for other languages than Java.


## Health report:
 - We would claim that the project is currently very healthy. We have several
   prospects for being invited into the PMC soon.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 8 PMC members.
 - Matthias Strljic was added to the PMC on Mon June 3 2019

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:
- Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup search of
  network services. Services may be implemented in a number of languages,
  while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at least), to allow
  proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:

- No significant issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Minimal activity at present, initial work on the modular build structure has
  commenced. The current monolithic build is complex, with it's own build tool
  classdepandjar, it adds complexity for new developers. In recent months I
  have had work committments that have limited my ability to integrate the
  modular build. The other committers are waiting for the modular build and I
  have done a lot of work on this locally, this work has been a significant
  undertaking integrating the works of Dennis Reedy, Dan Rollo and myself.
  This is also a mature codebase, having been in development since the late
  1990's.

Release roadmap:

River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (& binary release) River 3.2 - Input
validation for Serialization, delayed unmarshalling& safe ServiceRegistrar
lookup service.River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

- River is a mature codebase with existing deployments, it was primarily
  designed for dynamic discovery of services on private networks. IPv4 NAT
  limitations historically prevented the use of River on public networks,
  however the use of IPv6 on public networks removes these limitations. Web
  services evolved with the publish subscribe model of todays internet, River
  has the potential to dynamically discover services on IPv6 networks, peer to
  peer, blurring current destinctions between client and server, it has the
  potential to address many of the security issues currently experienced with
  IoT and avoid any dependency on the proprietary cloud for "things".

- Future Direction:

* Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required
  prior to announcement)
* Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and Gadget attacks.
* IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports IPv4
  multicast discovery).
* Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
  SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so authentication can
  occur prior to downloading service proxy's, this addresses a long standing
  security issue with service lookup while significantly improving performance
  under some use cases.
* Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal of
  support for insecure cyphers.
* Secure TLS SocketFactory's for RMI Registry, uses the currently logged in
  Subject for authentication. The RMI Registry still plays a minor role in
  service activation, this allows those who still use the Registry to secure
  it.
* Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses classdepandjar, a
  bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
* Updating the Jini specifications.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for June 2019

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running of our rule update infrastructure
and our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

We are still making slow progress to a release of SpamAssassin 3.4.3. We have
posted a release candidate, but there are a number of remaining issues we want
to complete for the actual release.

Our GSOC 2019 student is doing well. Apache Singa has joined to help with
statistical classification models. Thanks to Moaz Reyad and Wang Wei for
joining Kevin A. McGrail to guide Shreyansh Shrivastava.
Shreyansh has been blogging about the experience:
https://medium.com/@shreyansh25.shrivastava/spamassassin-singa-and-me-7927dbaa16d0

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.2 on 16 September 2018.
We are close to releasing version 3.4.3 to address some issues that were
deferred, in part so we could quickly release security fixes in 3.4.2. After
we release 3.4.3 we expect to resume development in our main branch for 4.0.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Rafa Haro]

## Description:

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

The project is in a recovery phase after a couple of years of deficient
activity both from committers and users (low activity in the mailing lists
too). Since the last report, the main technical activities have been:

- Security review for non-https dependency URLs in maven files
- Preliminary meetings between some committers to refactor some obsolete
modules and make some architecture changes for adopting modern approaches
and technologies that could make the project more attractive to the
community.

## Health report:

- At this moment, the project continues to be almost in stand-by until we
manage to expand the community following the plan described above.

## PMC changes:
- Currently, 23 PMC members.
- No new members since the last report.
- Last new PMC member was Antonio David Perez Morales on December 21st, 2018

## Committer base changes:
- Currently, 27 committers.
- No new committers since the last report
- Last committer addition was Furkan Kamaci on December 18th, 2018

## Releases:

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description:
- Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The Storm PMC released version 2.0. This was a years-long effort with many
   contributors, and represents a major milestone. One of the goals of this
   effort was to replace the Clojure codebase with a pure Java implementation
   to make the codebase more accessible to developers not versed in Clojure.
   We hope this will help expand the developer community.
 - The 2.0 release also includes significant performance improvements,
   usability enhancements, and many bug fixes.
 - There are currently two Twitter accounts associated with Apache Storm
   (@ApacheStorm and @stormprocessor) the PMC is actively discussing ways to
   consolidate the account and make them accessible to all PMC members.
 - In order to improve release cadence, the PMC has decided to move toward
   having multiple release managers to avoid single-RM bottlenecks.

## Health report:
 - We expect the release of version 2.0 to generate additional activity and
   interest in the project. We have seen a modest uptick in mailing list
   activity over the past quarter and expect this trend to continue as users
   and developers kick the tires of the new release. We expect JIRA activity
   to increase as well.

## PMC changes:

Attachment BQ: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Isuru Udana]

## Description:
Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight Enterprise Service
Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

## Issues:
None identified.

## Activity:

There was a significant increase in the activity in the project compared to
the last quarter. We actively worked on taking actions to security review
requested by the ASF security team. We got several contributions from a new
contributor who is interested in joining the project. Few committers worked on
committing the patches provided by our contributors. We are looking forward to
moving our source code into GitHub soon. So that it will ease the process of
providing new contributions and incorporating fixes into the codebase.

Answering to the followup question raised for the last report

Question: “Where was the "bring the project back to life" meeting organized?”

Answer: Meeting notes can be found in mail thread “Synapse Next Release
Initiation” at private@synapse.apache.org mailing list.

## Health report:
We see a positive trend in the project activity in the latter half of the
quarter. So hopefully we will able to increase the project activity further in
the next quarter too.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Health

The community did a concentrated push over the holidays to attract and get
new contributors engaged.  The most active window was mid November to 
February and in that time the project shattered every measurable record set
in the near 20 years of project history.

 - highest contributors in a 3-month period: 43 (average was 8 in Oct/Nov)
 - highest spike in commits (previous 2012)
 - highest sustained volume (previous 2011)
 - highest dev list: 1326 messages (previous 520 in Sept 2007)

Overall result is from mid November till now the project doubled in total
contributors, from 32 to 83.  Discussions in the PMC in adding some of them
as committers are in progress now, including one vote.

The PMC acknowledges issues with reports being delivered late to the board
and commits to an immediate change of chair should any report be filed late
in the next 12 months.  Discussions on how to achieve this are underway and
include both rotating reporting duties and change of chair.  At present
rotation of members drafting reports appears to be the preference.

## Activity

Four major jumps and areas of focus have taken place in the last few months.

The first has been to bring TomEE up from MicroProfile 1.2 support to 
MicroProfile 2.0 compliance.  This work is complete and passing all
MicroProfile 2.0 TCK tests.  The second area has been a push to add more
examples to the project, 26 new examples in total, 15 of those for
MicroProfile specifications.  The third focus was on the website itself,
code that generates the site and basic documentation.  The project had been
maintaining one set of documentation applicable to all versions.  We now
have a Tomcat-like system with documentation root per version.  The fourth 
area has been to translate the examples to other languages.  11 translated
in total, 6 in Portuguese and 5 in Spanish.

The result is the project has experienced a dramatic change, with many new
contributors and work that can be done at all levels from any skillset.  At
this moment there are still 19 PRs in the queue and more showing up
regularly.

We are very thrilled and proud of everyone.  It took 19 years to get 32
contributors and with a major focused effort by everyone simultaneously, we
were able to smash 19 years of "new contributor" work in 3 months.  It is
difficult to sustain and contributions in the last 2 months are lower, but
still far greater than the three month period before November.  The lesson
learned is there is a massive difference in outcome if one or two people
push for years vs everyone pushing at once, even if briefly.

We hope to do this again in December 2019 on the 20th anniversary of the
project, with more committers able to help and hopefully smash some records
again.

TomEE 8.0.0-M3 was successfully released on May 29th.  The community would 
like to get that codebase to run cleanly on Java 11 and then go for a final
TomEE 8.0.0 release.

Releases for TomEE 7.0.6 and 7.1.1 are currently under vote. These contain a
number of dependency updates and fixes for these maintenance branches which
both have a considerable userbase.

Attachment BZ: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Andrea Del Bene]

## Description:

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework.

## Issues:

 - No issues require board attention.

## Activity:

 - We have released the first two milestones for Wicket 9. We are mainly
   working to refactor and simplify the current code base of the project.

 - Since January Wicket has joined the OpenJDK Quality Outreach program (see
   link 1), which aims to test popular open source projects with JDK Early
   Access builds. As consequence Wicket currently has CI buildings for OpenJDK
   12 (which is now GA) and for OpenJDK 13 Early Access build 23. Both use the
   current master branch of our framework and so far we didn't need any change
   to the code to compile and run tests with these two OpenJDK versions. The
   collaboration is led by Martin Grigorov, who has been initially contacted
   by mr. Dalibor Topic from Oracle. Thanks to this effort, Martin recently
   managed to spot 3 regression with the last OpenJDK 13 build (see link 2).

1 - https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/quality/Quality+Outreach

2 - https://markmail.org/message/sljkujkdbq5clnmi

## Health report:

 - The community is stable as is to be expected from a mature server side Java
   web framework. We don't anticipate a sudden large growth or large decline.

 - Questions to the user list and dev list are answered, resolved and
   discussed.

 - We keep on the look out for new committers and PMC members. There are a
   couple of contributors [names redacted danny@]
   that have shown an increasing involvement with the project in the last
   weeks. It's too early to decide if they should be invited to become PMC
   members, but we will keep an eye on them.

No issue requires board attention
   
## Activity:
 - We have cut two releases in this period. 3.4.14 is a bug-fix release
of the 3.4 branch, while the 3.5.5 release is the one in which we transitioned
from beta to GA in the 3.5 branch. To recap, the 3.5 branch contains
reconfiguration work, which took a long time to stabilize, and it is in fact
a major milestone for the community.
 - Both releases fix the security vulnerability reported in CVE-2019-0201.
 - We have invited one committer to join the PMC, and offered committership
to two new contributors.  
   
## Health report: 
The community is stable at the moment, and there has been no significant
change to email and issue traffic. The community has been able to cut two
releases and increase the group of committers and the PMC. We are continuously
looking for opportunities to engage new contributors and offer committership
to the ones that make important community contributions. Overall, there
is no health concern.

Attachment CD: ASF Director and Corporate Officer Code of Conduct

In this document, "Corporate Officers" refers to:

  * Board-appointed corporate officers of the ASF, and
  * President-appointed corporate officers of the ASF, and
  * V.P., Fundraising-appointed corporate officers of the ASF

as specified at the URL:

  http://apache.org/foundation/

The current Directors and Corporate Officers of the Apache Software
Foundation agree to:

  * Work hard to represent the broader interest of the Apache Software
    Foundation in producing software for the public good.

  * Rigorously follow the general ASF Code of Conduct, [1] with the effect 
    of setting a good example for communications both inside and outside
    the Foundation.

  * Rigorously follow the Speaking Guidelines for ASF Directors and
    Officers. [2]

  * Seek to balance their contributions as both an advisor and a learner.

  * Be honest with others and true to themselves, but with the
    utmost respect for other individuals.

  * Refrain from trying to influence other Board member or Officers
    outside of board meetings and off of official mailing lists in ways
    that might have the effect of creating factions or limiting free and
    open discussion.

  * Be willing to be a dissenting voice, while working to build on other
    director’s and officer's ideas; offer alternative points of view as
    options to be considered, and invite others to do so too.

  * Be balanced in one’s effort to understand other board members and
    corporate officers, and to make oneself understood.

  * Once a board decision is made, support the decision even if one’s own
    view is a minority one: if necessary, disagree, and commit.

  * Fundamentally focus on transparency, yet respect the importance of
    confidentiality on sensitive issues, especially those relating to
    personnel and volunteers, security, or legal matters.

  * Limit use of the Director or Corporate Officer role to occasions when
    it is strictly required.
