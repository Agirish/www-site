 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we began preparation for the annual membership meeting to
       be held next month, March 26, with reconvene on March 28. We are still
       seeking vote monitors and proxies to help with the meeting.

       We continued discussion this on how, if at all, the ASF should engage
       in the external dialog on open source licensing and business models. 
       We do have consensus that any statement we make should confirm our
       commitment to the Apache License, possibly explaining how it supports
       and enables our mission. I would like to thank the members who
       participated for the constructive discussion started this month about
       how the mission statement might be slightly improved and the
       connection between the license, the mission and our core principles.

    B. President [Sam]

       Items Requiring Board Attention
       -------------------------------

       ApacheCon EU 2019 proposal (agenda item 8A)

       Overall
       -------

       Finances continue to be in an excellent position, with income
       exceeding both budget and previous year, and expenditures under budget
       and previous year.  Notable changes from last month (all positive): we
       now have the number and ApacheCon US made a modest profit; per the
       advice of the firm preparing our tax returns, the Pineapple fund
       donation is treated as ordinary income and included in cash on hand;
       and at this late point in the fiscal year, a number of areas (most
       notably infrastructure) are running far enough behind that they can't
       reasonably catch up in expenditures.

       I'm not sure how to proceed in the five year projections.  The only
       sized estimate that was produced in this past month was the estimate
       for ApacheCon EU 2019.  There clearly is value in having such an
       event; we could conceivably again make a modest profit on the event,
       but that's not the point of the event; the remaining question is one
       of risk.  There is a small chance that we could lose a relatively
       large sum of money, but even worst case, that amount is bounded and
       one that we could absorb.  My input is that it is worth the risk.

       Brand Management
       ----------------

       Operating normally, providing guidance, registering marks, and
       resolving potential infringements.  No items requiring board
       attention.

       Fundraising
       -----------

       Actively reorganizing; transferring that previously was done by Kevin
       to a mixture of paid staff and volunteers.  Thanks go out to Kevin: we
       are in a much better place than we were two years ago, and wouldn't be
       where we are today without his hard work.

       The transition itself is going to take months to work out.  While
       things look promising, there may be occasional bumps that are
       encountered along the way.  My request is that we give the team the
       space to work things out, keeping intervention to a minimum.

       Finance
       -------

       Again a month of research and review. I expect Finance to take a
       larger review in the FY20 budget.  Generally, the categories we have
       date back to Justin's original budget.  Tom is already working with
       groups proposing different categories to align with accounting
       principles.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


       Shane notes that it is difficult for projects to initiate
       cross-project proposals.

       Sam suggests that if there are proposals that might benefit
       just one project, then the projects could bring them forward.
       And then other projects might see how it might benefit them.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operating Cash on January 31st, 2019 was $2,599.2K, which is up 
       $272.4K from last month’s ending balance (Dec 18) of $2,326.8K.  Total
       Cash as of Jan 31st, 2019 is $3,993.1 ( includes the Pineapple and
       restricted Donation) as compared to $1,793.4K on Jan 31st 2018 ( an
       increase of $2,199.7K year over year. If we exclude the Pineapple and
       Restricted donation that is a year over year increase of $805.8K in
       net cash). The Jan 2019 ending Operating cash balance of $2,599.2K
       represents an Operating cash reserve of 19.1 months based on the FY19
       conservative Cash forecast average monthly spending of $136.2K/month (
       this will most likely change for FY 20 as we continue to work on the
       budget).  The ASF actual Operating reserve of 19.1 months at the end
       of Jan 2019 is ahead of the budgeted 11.1 month reserve for YTD
       through Jan 2019.  The ASF Operating reserve continues to be very
       healthy for an organization of the ASF’s size and Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income,  is ahead of FY 18, at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $436.6K. As compared to the FY 19 Budgeted
       Income,  YTD, we are ahead by $561.7K.

       ApacheCon NA 2018 has now been reconciled and considered closed. We
       have added two tabs to this month’s finance package – “Conference P&L”
       and “Conference P&L Detail.” Total revenue for the Conference came to
       $226.0K and expenses came to $193.4K. Thus, the net income for the
       event came to $32.6K versus a budgeted loss of $60.5K, Congrats to the
       entire team who helped make this event not only a success for the
       attendees but also a financial success as well.

       YTD expenses, through Jan 31st, 2019 are under budget by $346.6K.  All
       depts. are under budget, at the end of Jan 2019.  There are still a
       couple items worth mentioning, one being Infra,  as noted in the Board
       summary is $196.3K under budget due to the timing of hiring of staff
       and not having to pay any Lease web invoices YTD.  The other being TAC
       at $45K under budget YTD for FY19.  We have moved most of the dept
       underspending forward in the Cash forecast and will be reviewing the
       underspending with the departments as we move forward in FY19 Q4.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY 19 the ASF finished with a positive
       $539.8K NI vs a budgeted negative <$368.5K> NI or $908.3K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of some Sponsor payments offset by more
       Donations than were budgeted as well as underspending in all depts
       YTD, vs the FY19 Budget.  At this point in the FY we are doing very
       well, ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses, even taking
       timing variances into account.  We will continue to monitor this as we
       finish out FY19.  With regard to FY18, we are outpacing revenue, by
       $436.6K as noted above,  but we are also out pacing expenses by
       $166.8K. However, year over year NI for FY19 exceeds FY18 by $269.8K,
       another good yard stick of the Foundation’s financial health at this
       point in time.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Processing of submitted documents with digital signatures was
       deteriorating due to dependence on an oft-overloaded public key
       repository. After this issue was reported, the Whimsy team stepped up
       and within a few days, Sebb had committed a change that significantly
       improved the reliability of the tool.

       In January, 54 ICLAs, four CCLA, and four grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastructure
       =============

       Everything is healthy in Infrastructure.

       Hiring has reached the offer stage.

       All projects have been migrated to gitbox. Congrats to the team.

       Improved On-Call process with "yellow" alerts that don't create
       unnecessary late night pages.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       The role of VP Marketing and Publicity is becoming a central role for
       many operational activities, including but not limited to, Fundraising
       and Conferences. Sally has created a "Central Services" sub-group of
       volunteers to help manage selected cross-foundational projects. This
       group is intended to help spread the load with respect to ensuring
       things get done, thereby freeing Sally to concentrate on the more time
       dependent activities related to the expanded role.

       Fundraising handover is going well. The current focus is on reviewing,
       documenting and renewing targeted sponsorships, renewals are, for the
       most part, proving to be relatively easy to secure.

       Preparations for the 20th Anniversary are well underway - with lots of
       work to do, including an apache.org refresh. The central services team
       are helping drive this forward.

       The full report includes the usual details of key activities during
       the month.

       Conferences
       ===========

       DC Roadshow is now only a few weeks out.

       12 different projects/communities/topics have claimed a track at
       ApacheCon North America. A full CFP is expected to open soon.

       ACEU19 planning is also progressing. See discussion item 8A

       There was a slight venue hiccup with Chicago roadshow but planning is
       on track.

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ===========================

       No significant activity. No event currently in planning.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       As we approach the 20th anniversary of the ASF's corporate founding,
       it's impressive to review the ever-lengthening list of Apache project
       reports and consider the incredible number of successes that our many
       communities of volunteers have built for the public good.

       More importantly from a board perspective, it's heartening to see the
       continually improving organization and communications coming from our
       many operations groups.  The volunteers and the paid staff working
       together to keep everything behind the scenes (infra, legal,
       treasury/fundraising/finances, etc.) and our public face (brand,
       conferences, publicity!) running smoothly are doing an incredible job.

       I'm looking forward to the retrospectives on our history as well as
       the expanded and improved guides to the Apache Way that will be coming
       out in the next few months to celebrate our anniversary!

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Propose ApacheCon EU 2019 for October 22-24 in Berlin produced by NewThinking

       We'd like to do an ApacheCon in Berlin from the dates October 22 -
       24th, produced by NewThinking.  Because this is a large budget item,
       the Conferences committee would like to get the full support of the board.
       The contract will be provided to the board before the board meeting.  We
       are planning a 4-track event over 3 days for roughly 400 people.

       The board approves by unanimous consent continuing with the proposal
       to hold ApacheCon EU in Berlin in October 2019.

    B. Minor clarification to mission statement

       It has been proposed that we need a minor change to the Foundations
       mission statement. It is requested that the board discuss this proposal
       and make recommendations for making a change should the board agree it
       is necessary.

       The current statement is:

       "The mission of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is to provide 
       software for the public good. We do this by providing services and 
       support for many like-minded software project communities of 
       individuals who choose to join the ASF." 

       It has been observed that "join the ASF" gives the impression that there 
       is some thing that one joins, like a membership organization. We don't 
       really have a "joining" of anything. Given our inclusivity and the 
       growing need to literally "join" open source projects outside of the ASF 
       it is proposed that this potential misunderstanding is problematic.

       In order to resolve this it has been been suggested that we make a minor
       adjustment to this wording. It is not the intent to change the meaning of
       the mission statement, only to clarify this single point - that there is
       no need to "join" the ASF in order to participate in its projects. After 
       discussion on the board@ mailing list the following suggestions have been
       made and not been objected to:

       A)
       "The mission of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is to provide 
       software for the public good. We do this by providing services and 
       support for many like-minded software project communities of 
       individuals who choose to contribute to ASF projects."

       B)
       "The mission of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is to provide 
       software for the public good. We do this by providing services and 
       support for many like-minded software project communities of 
       individuals who choose to participate with the Apache community."

       C)
       "The mission of the Apache Software Foundation is to provide software for 
       the public good. We do this by providing services and support for many 
       like-minded software project communities. " 

       D)
       "The mission of the Apache Software Foundation is to provide software for 
       the public good. We do this by providing services, support, and a common 
       ethos for many software project communities. "

       @Ross: send message to board to finalize the change to mission
       statement

    C. VP Data Privacy

       Are we ready to appoint someone?

       The discussion at https://s.apache.org/vpdataprivacyfeb2019 seems to indicate
       consensus for John Kinsella who volunteered - and Mark's message to members@
       got no replies.

       By unanimous consent, the board appoints John Kinsella to the position
       of VP, Data Privacy.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

As always: we can't do what we do without our sponsors so we are delighted to
welcome AWS (Platinum) and Workday (Gold) to the ASF family as sponsors this
past month. We also renewed four sponsorships and received $3,414.55 from 42
donors via our individual giving platform. We thank everyone for keeping the
family strong!

As the Fundraising committee continues the "back office" work, we are pleased
to report that outreach to all ASF Sponsors and Targeted Sponsors has been
initiated as planned. Through these activities, we have confirmed renewal from
most Targeted Sponsors and increases in support for several Targeted Sponsors
going forward. These conversations even resulted in a new Apache Incubator
project proposal from a Platinum Sponsor! We also continue conversations with
top tier sponsors for promotional opportunities such as the recently posted
case study from Gold Sponsor, Bloomberg (https://s.apache.org/jKNc). Last but
not least, we greatly enjoyed shaking hands and exchanging smiles at FOSDEM
with our ASF family members that could make it.

The Fundraising committee is also gearing up for 2019 event support under a
new model and has engaged with the various event planning teams. Our own Bob
Paulin (Sponsor Ambassador) will serve as Event Sponsor Ambassador for the
Apache Roadshow Chicago event. Sharan Foga (VP ComDev) will serve as Event
Sponsor Ambassador for the ApacheConEU event in 2019 and Daniel Ruggeri (VP
Fundraising) will handle ApacheCon NA 2019. Early engagement and clear
documentation of roles/responsibilities with the various event planning teams
will ensure another round of awesome events for 2019!

We continue driving internal efficiencies in the committee to ensure our
Sponsors know how much we love them. A few notable activities:
 - Restructuring of team activities including regular reporting schedule from
   Sponsor Ambassadors
 - Formalized process and documentation for ASF Conference (ApacheCon and
   Roadshows) support
 - Documentation of roles/responsibilities/workflow for the new Event Sponsor
   Ambassador role and overall event planning support
 - Streamlining record keeping processes including reconciliation with
   Accounting
 - Continued auditing/cleanup of mailing lists and notification channels

The team also thanks Kevin A McGrail for his hard work and dedication (VP and
Co-VP Fundraising) over the past two years as he steps away from Fundraising.
We have successfully completed transition of notes, ongoing action items and
plans as of early Feb and wish Kevin luck in all his future endeavors.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - February 2019

I. Budget: we remain on budget and on schedule.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues restructuring efforts
for ASF Fundraising, in collaboration with VP Fundraising Daniel Ruggeri and
ASF Fundraising committee members. She has secured the renewal of a Platinum
Sponsor and is reviewing contributions from all Targeted Sponsors with 60%
responding within first 7 days with confirmed re-commitment for 2019. Sally
also established the new Central Services sub-group of ASF Marketing &
Publicity to manage various cross-Foundation projects, beginning with creative
support, specifically graphics. She has also been working with ASF Conferences
across planning, sponsorships, marketing, and related tactics. The latest
"Success at Apache" post, "For Love or Money: Volunteer vs Professional Open
 Source", has been published at https://s.apache.org/ePHl . We published the
 first ASF Sponsor case study (offered exclusively to Gold and Platinum
 sponsors), "Apache Software Foundation Gold Sponsor Profile: Bloomberg"
 https://s.apache.org/jKNc . Planning continues for promotions surrounding the
 ASF's 20th Anniversary (the community-wide survey on "The Apache Way" closes
 mid-February https://s.apache.org/oxTr ).

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

- 23 January - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Hadoop® v3.2.0

IV. Informal Announcements: 8 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 238 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 32 items to 51.7K followers on
Twitter. We posted 12 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 61.9K
organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 2 announcements are in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 6 media queries, and are working on 3
placed articles by invitation. The ASF received 1,053 press clips vs. last
month's clip count of 1,189. Media coverage of Apache projects yielded 2,062
press hits vs. last month's 1,697. ApacheCon received 198 press hits. We
continue to work with several corporates with strong ties to various Apache
projects on branding adherence and publishing internal guidelines to help
their employees to properly represent the ASF, the  Apache
brand/projects/communities in their externally-focused communications. We
helped the Apache Camel PMC have the @ApacheCamel handle successfully
transferred to their account on Twitter.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received two analyst queries during this time.
Apache was mentioned in 23 reports by Gartner; 8 reports by Forrester; 4
reports by 451 Research; and 7 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: we are continuing to develop promotional materials, create
assets, and Website refresh for the ASF's 20th Anniversary. Members of the new
Central Services sub-group of ASF Marketing & Publicity are leading the
apache.org refresh, reviewing and judging submitted entries for the 20th
Anniversary logo, and developing digital advertising assets for the Apache
Roadshow Chicago.

IX. Events liaison: we continue to work with Virtual regarding sponsorship and
marketing/promotional requirements for the Apache Roadshow/Chicago and
ApacheCon North America 2019, and are also involved with the initial planning
process for ApacheCon Europe 2019.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 1 pre-paid press release remaining in our
contract with GlobeNewswire, which will auto-renew through December 2019.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Finish planning/booking for Infra meetup in New Orleans in April.
- Make offers to new system admins.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Complete the hermes-vm transition. Mail and mailing lists appear to
  be working, yet more testing and edge case features need to be
  completed before we move a subset of email flow to the new system.

General Activity
================
- All projects have been moved to Gitbox, and the old git-wip box has
  been decommissioned. Related work with git commit emails was completed.
- The team has been interviewing our final set of candidates. Offers
  should go out within the next week or two.
- New "yellow alerts" class of warnings on PagerDuty to warn on-call
  about an issue, without a late night page.
- Continued work on hermes-vm, our mail system replacement for the
  aging hermes box at OSL.
- Several systems have been deployed with our new Ubuntu 18.04
  support, and using Puppet v6. These rollouts confirm and improve our
  ongoing work on this platform. We'll begin upgrades of existing
  puppetized systems to 1804/p6 later this year.
- Moved DNS "hidden master" off the again minotaur.a.o box, to a new
  dns-vm.
- Per above, minotaur is mostly deprecated at this point, and general
  login has been disabled, along with old cronjobs that were running.
- CPU rate limiting has been installed on some of our sites that are
  usually subjected to scrapes/crawls. https://s.apache.org/rate-limit
- Bugzilla has been migrated to a beefier server. Along with the new
  rate-limiting, it should have much better uptime. This will also
  decommission about four separate VMs that were being used to run BZ.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Planning is proceeding well for all of our in-flight events.

The DC Roadshow is now just a few weeks out, and we are actively
promoting and attempting to fill seats. We encourage you to follow
@apachecon on Twitter, and help us amplify that message.

We now have 12 different projects/communities/topics who have claimed
a track at ApacheCon North America, which we are very excited about.
Other aspects of this event planning are progressing. We expect to
have a CFP available this week or first thing next week.

ACEU19 planning is also progressing. There is a discussion item in
today's agenda to get consensus on moving forward with the agreement.

One of the venues for the Chicago Roadshow was lost, and has been
replaced. Planning for that event is also progressing well.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Nothing to report this month really.

Mailing List is quiet, with unfinished (and non-urgent) conversations paused
whilst folks work on other things.

I'll make a push to get some movement going again for the next report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of Finance  [Tom Pappas]

For the Month of January , continued conversations with possible
Wealth Management option for foundation's excess funds. Also reviewed
a possible CDARS option that has better rates than the current Boston
Private option. Will continue to research and review.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

We've had a lot of discussion on legal-discuss and general@incubator
converging the topic of projects publishing software outside of Apache
infrastructure. We don't believe this is currently clear.

JIRA issues continue to move along (we're down 4, from 28 to 24, open issues
this month).

Henri has offered up some initial brainstorming on our part of the 5 year
plan, the board are very welcome to offer their own thoughts:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LEGAL/issues/LEGAL-422

Martin Michlmayr reported that we have not published our IRS filings since the
2015/2016 year. Roman has acquired the PDF for the latest filing and is about
to publish it (with ample heads up given to the rest of the board members in
the past few weeks).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.  During
January we saw some delays with Mitre updating their site with our CVE
submissions to them, they expect this to resolve soon.

Stats for January 2019:

      15        [license confusion]
       9        [support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 38 (last months: 16, 34, 28)

      6	       [httpd], [site]
      3	       [ambari]
      2	       [kafka], [struts], [tomcat]
      1	       [activemq], [axis], [camel], [cassandra], [couchdb],

               [mifos], [netbeans], [ofbiz], [openoffice], [qpid],
               [sling], [zookeeper]

     In total, as of 1st February 2019, we're tracking 78 (last month:
     81) open issues across 39 projects, median age 75 (last month:
     109) days.  49 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     8 (last month: 13) of these issues, across 6 projects, are older
     than 365 days.

Attachment 11: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Chris Mattmann]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Airflow Project  [Bolke de Bruin]

## Description:
 - Apache Airflow (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically
   author, schedule, and monitor workflows. When workflows are defined as
   code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and
   collaborative. Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs
   (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of
    workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line
    utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user
    interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production,
    monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.


## Issues:


## Activity:
 - Most of our assets have been moved to TL. We might have some remnants here
   and there, which we try to track down
 - We released a new version (1.10.2)

   contributors to committer.
 - We are, measured by GitHub stars, the most popular project for data
   orchestration comparing Apache Oozie, Spotify's Luigi, Pinterest's Pinball
   and LinkedIn's Azkaban
 - Note: Apologies for not responding to the question by posting comments, it
   was unclear how this worked

## Health report:
 - We have grown from 674 to 712 contributors since our last report. We do
   monitor for potential committers, but we also see a lot of "hit and run"
   contributors that particularly add to the 'periphery' of our code.
 - Since the 1.10.2 release 914 commits have been made


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 17 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Aurora Project  [Jake Farrell]

Apache Aurora is a stateless and fault tolerant service scheduler used to
schedule jobs onto Apache Mesos such as long-running services, cron jobs, and
one off tasks.

Project Status
--------------

The Apache Aurora project has seen a significant slowdown of user and
contributor activity over the most recent months. This can partially be
attributed to the overall stability and maturity of the project, but more
importantly this is due to other external projects that managed to win the
developer mindshare within the container orchestration field
(e.g., general purpose cloud providers, Kubernetes, ...).

The project might be heading towards the Apache Attic in the future, unless
the community interest increases again.

Community
---------

* Currently 21 PMC members
* Currently 22 committer
* No new PMC members added in the last 3 months. Last PMC addition was Jordan
  Ly on Thu May 03 2018.

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Thiruvalluvan M. G.]

Apache Avro is a data serialization system with a compact binary format. It is
used for storing and transporting schema driven serialized data. The unique
features of Avro include automatic schema resolution - when the reader's

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

As for previous reports, progress continues to be slow.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

After the progress reported in the November report, progress stalled a bit
again. A few opportunities to report to the board have also been missed for
which the chair of the project apologises on behalf of the PMC. The PMC has
been able to confirm to the board that there is oversight of the project
from the PMC that exceeds the requirement of three PMC members.

Development effort on Bloodhound has focused on the api of the proposed
bloodhound core.

The mailing lists remain quiet although after a very recent announcement of
proposed updates to the api, it was good to see a positive response from
someone who wished to remind the project that the ability to host multiple
projects from a single bloodhound instance would be good to address early
in the api design.

As mentioned in the last report, the chair was expecting to arrange some
sprint days to bring interested parties together over the same time. These
have not yet happened but should be arranged for the coming months.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:

BookKeeper is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage
service optimized for append-only workloads. It has been used as
a fundamental service to build high available and replicated services
in companies like Twitter, Yahoo and Salesforce. It is also the log
segment store for Apache DistributedLog and message store for Apache Pulsar.

Apache DistributedLog is a high-level API and service layer for
Apache BookKeeper, providing easier access to the BookKeeper
primitives. It is a subproject of Apache BookKeeper.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - 4.9.0 was released on Sat, Feb 6, 2019
 - The growth of Apache Pulsar community also help grow the adoption
of BookKeeper. This helps building the ecosystem around BookKeeper.

## Health report:

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - We onboarded a new committer in December and had a bit of
discussion with him on what he would like to contribute.
Activity died down over the holidays and has not picked up since. 
Hopefully it picks up in Q2.
   
## Health report: 
 - We have a small PMC presence of 3 active members still able
to vote releases. We have voted a new committer in in the last quarter.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Peter Donald on Tue Oct 15 2013

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
We have had a very positive response to our blog and should have some more
articles posted shortly. We have also requested a day long track for ApacheCon
2019 and are looking forward to participating.

## Health report:
We are continue to track and prioritize issues as we approach 4.0:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/4.0%3A+Open+Issues+by+Component

We have a number of community members actively testing snapshots of 4.0 with
replays of production workloads using audit logging
(http://cassandra.apache.org/blog/2018/10/29/audit_logging_cassandra.html).
This in combination with recent improvements in property-based testing
(http://cassandra.apache.org/blog/2018/10/17/finding_bugs_with_property_based_testing.html)
has led to the discovery of a number of bugs that would have, in previous
major releases, been left for users to discover on their own.

## PMC changes:
There are currently 31 PMC members. No new PMC members added in the last 3
months. The last PMC addition was Stefania Alborghetti on Thu Sep 27 2018.

## Committer base changes:
There are Currently 51 committers. Chris Lohfink was added as a committer on
Sat Dec 01 2018

## Releases:
We recently made the following releases across four versions:
 - 2.1.21 was released on Mon Feb 11 2019
 - 2.2.14 was released on Mon Feb 11 2019
 - 3.0.18 was released on Mon Feb 11 2019
 - 3.11.4 was released on Mon Feb 11 2019

## Mailing list activity:
Mailing list activity is down for both user and dev lists. This may just be a
result of nothing new to discuss given the lack of a major release.

dev@cassandra.apache.org:
- 1597 subscribers (down -27 in the last 3 months):

there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Thanks Brett for the heads up last month. I (Cédric) have indeed several times
thought about making a release, but never found enough time. It happens that I
recently found a bug that I want to be fixed, so this will push me to move
forward !

The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14 A few JIRA issues opened or
resolved since last report. A little activity on both users and dev
mailing-lists, even if still at a low level. The project is mainly in
maintenance mode.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

## Description:
 -  The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
    involved with Apache Projects

## Issues:
 - No issues require board attention at the moment

## Activity:

Ideas and Material for Contributor Onboarding - One of the main topics raised
this quarter was around the ways to encourage new contributors by lowering
barriers to entry [1] and ways that could help onboard them.

Some new contributor onboarding material tailored to Apache is currently being
developed by the Open Source Strategy team at Google and community feedback
has been very positive [2]. A discussion has also been started about how to
recognise non technical contributions [3]. This is an area where community
development could help develop materials and processes as well as provide
guidance to projects.

Paris Open Source Summit - In December we again participated at the Paris Open
Source Summit, which is the main open source events in France. We had an ASF
booth and over the 2 day summit saw lots of attendees who were keen to know
more about the ASF. We also participated in a workshop discussing how the
administrative sector could help increase their collaboration with open source
foundations and communities. Thanks very much to Herve Boutemy and Olivier
Heintz for managing the Apache booth and our participation at this event.

Apache Roadshows 2019 - Two Apache Roadshows are currently planned for 2019.
The DC Roadshow is being run on 25th March and is being co-ordinated by Kevin
McGrail. It will feature over twenty presentations in two tracks and will also
include career fair. The Chicago Roadshow is being run on 14th and 14th May
and is being co-ordinated Trevor Grant. Several tracks are planned incuding
Apache in Adtech, Fintech and Startups.

New PMC Member - In January we invited Myrle Krantz to become a new member of
the PMC. Myrle has been very active in promoting Apache and as well as helping
out at many Apache related events. She will be a great addition to our PMC.

FOSDEM - Once again we participated at FOSDEM in Brussels. This year we were
located on the ground floor and so had a lot more foot traffic. Thanks very
much to Daniel Gruno for the great assortment of Apache giveaways (including
some nice warm fleece hats) that people were queuing up to talk to us to get.
Several projects were represented at the booth includin Beam, Httpd, Tomcat,
Fineract, OFBiz, Kibble and Jena. FOSDEM is great for visibility of the
Foundation and as a result we have been invited to participate at even more
events for 2019. Thanks very much to all the volunteers that helped out. One
thing we trialled a little was the  idea of getting people to ‘buy the ASF a
coffee’ or ‘buy the ASF a beer’ to get people to think about donating 2 – 5
euro especially if any of the ASF projects had helped them in someway. This
could potentially be something to look into further for future events.

GSOC - The ASF has applied to be a mentoring organisation for GSoC and
projects have been asked to start recording their ideas for tasks on the
ComDev JIRA or labelling them with the GSoC tag.

## Health report:

This is the second quarter where our monthly blog has slipped and although we
have an active mailing list, we are perhaps missing out at promoting things to
a wider audience.

We are looking at being more organised in our event participation and have
asked the community for the events [4] that they think we need to be involved
in for
2019.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
 - Seamless multi-master sync, that scales from Big Data to Mobile,
  with an Intuitive HTTP/JSON API and designed for Reliability.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Big News™: The IBM Cloudant team has started a discussion around
   replacing the bottom ~2/3s of CouchDB (file storage, btree,
   distributed computing layer) with FoundationDB, keeping most
   API semantics, but allowing for faster evolution of much needed
   CouchDB features while building on a reliable, wait for it,
   foundation.

   For now this is a discussion, ranging across many threads covering
   everyting from FDB governance considerations, the detailed tech bits
   as they pertain to CouchDB, as well as overall project roadmap.

   This is sparked a huge, and very fruitful discussion, including a
   transition phase and long-term support for existing users, who for
   one reason or another couldn’t do the future transition.

   Tentatively, this would be CouchDB 4.0 while the next major release
   would be aimed at being “The best version of CouchDB we can make
   without FoundationDB”, including several long-awaited features that
   have either recently landed or are nearing completion at the moment.
   Curiously, discussing a potential 4.0 has sparked activity around
   getting 3.0 done sooner.

   We expect the discussion threads to wrap up before long, after which
   we should have talked through all the relevant details so we can
   make an informed Vote.

 - Preparation of versions 2.3.1 (bugfix) and 2.4.0 (major new features).

## Health report:
 - The aboforementioned discussion has raised dev@ mail traffic to
   rarely seen heights.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 15 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Nick Vatamaniuc on Tue Nov 07 2017

## Committer base changes:
 - Currently 64 committers.
 - Jay Doane was added as a committer on Sat Jan 05 2019

## Releases:
 - 2.3.0 was released on Thu Dec 06 2018

## Mailing list activity:
 - Just to show the increase in activity on dev@ alone due to the
   FoundationDB discussion.

 - dev@couchdb.apache.org:
    - 538 subscribers (down -12 in the last 3 months):
    - 254 emails sent to list (34 in previous quarter)

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software
related to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions.
Any language and build system are welcomed.


Status

------
Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk
of the project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing
lack of progress.

If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.


Community

---------

In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC /

Commit.



Releases

--------

Apache Rat 0.13 was released Nov 5th, 2018

Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016 Apache Rat  0.11 was

released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache DeltaSpike is  a suite of portable CDI (Contexts & Dependency
 Injection) extensions intended to make application development easier when
 working with CDI and Java EE.  Some of its key features include:

 - A core runtime that supports component configuration, type safe messaging
   and internationalization, and exception handling.
 - A suite of utilities to make programmatic bean lookup easier.
 - A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans
   outside of a container.
 - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
 - JPA integration and transaction support.
 - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.
 - Quartz integration

 Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
 your CDI enabled projects.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
 
## Activity: 
 Our activity was pretty low in the last months. I hope we will
 get back to some normal level soon. Otoh we keep on fixing bugs
 if they arise.
   
## Health report: 
 As explained already, many parts of DeltaSpike made it into proper
 EE specs. DS still works great as we are still backward compatible 
 and can run 9 years old code. And it has still parts which are really
 unique and outstanding. The MicroProfile initiative also tackles
 some parts of that space.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DRAT Project  [Tom Barber]

## Description:
- Apache DRAT is a distributed, parallelized (Map Reduce) wrapper around
  Apache RAT™ and other code auditing tools to allow it to complete on large
  code repositories of multiple file types.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The discussion to start an RC was instigated but not actioned upon due to
   Chris switching his focus. Discussion will restart about an RC shortly,
   this can also take in new features in the OODT stack being worked on
   currently.

## Health report:
 - We are ready for a 1.0 RC1.
 - We expect some activity to pick up with 1.0 RC1.
 - In addition we also expect integration of the Avro integration work from
   Apache OODT (not a blocker to 1.0RC1 for DRAT) will also spurn some
   interest.
 - Slow pace of development, but functioning PMC and look to get 1.0 released.


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - Ahmed Ifhaam was added to the PMC on Thu Aug 30 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 14 committers.
 - Ahmed Ifhaam was added as a committer on Tue Aug 28 2018


## Releases:

 - Chris Mattmann will volunteer to be the RM for Apache DRAT 1.0. We slipped
   a little but are on target for a CY2018/1st Q 2019 release.

## Mailing list activity:

 - Mailing list activity took a slight dip. Main reason I believe is that we
   are waiting to test and integrate Apache OODT 1.9-dev with the AvroRPC
   module in our code base. It's not a blocker to releasing 1.0 for Apache
   DRAT but I think Imesha is waiting for that to be tested. Mailing list
   activity will probably spike for a bit in the next quarter as we roll RC1
   for 1.0 Apache DRAT.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Rainer Döbele]

## Description:

 - Apache Empire-db is a relational database access engine that takes an
   SQL-centric approach in contrast to object-relational-mapping like with JPA
   It encapsulates the functionality of a RDBMS in a powerful, vendor
   independent, intuitive and maintenance friendly API providing a maximum of
   compile-time-safety.

## Issues:

 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - After having released version 2.4.7 last October we had to deal with issues
   regarding database compatibility, especially regarding new versions of
   Microsoft SQL-Server newer than 2016, which  have been requested from users
   over JIRA. Regarding JIRA we have found, that the mailing notifications had
   been incorrect, which we asked INFRA to correct. Also we had to deal with
   the mandatory migration of the GIT repository from git-wip-us.apache.org to
   gitbox.apache.org.

## Health report:

 - The project remains healthy as activity in JIRA shows.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09
  None on the horizon.

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  This quarter there has again been no activity on any Forrest mail list.
  So that is two sequential quarters of zero activity.

  At this report, three other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision.

Project status:
  Activity: Idle
  4 people indicated presence: potential for sufficient oversight.

Project status:
  Please see the detailed status notes for the June 2018 report.

  It seems that it is now time for the PMC to raise the topic on the dev list
  about moving to the Apache Attic.

Security issues published:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  None.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache FreeMarker Project  [Dániel Dékány]


## Description:

Apache FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text
output based on templates. Apache FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class
library for programmers.

FreeMarker 2 (the current stable line) produces releases since 2002. The
FreeMarker project has joined the ASF in 2015, and graduated from the
Incubator in early 2018.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Activity was very low in the last 3 months. There's slow progress towards the
next micro version.

## Health report:

Activity is low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User questions
(mostly on StackOverflow) and new Jira issues are being answered promptly. The
short term goal is to release the next micro version (2.3.29) in February. The
long term goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0 branch, so
that the project can innovate and the code base can become much cleaner (and
more attractive for new committers), instead of being blocked by 15 years of
historical baggage.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 7 PMC members.
- No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 7 committers.
- No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Paul King]

## Description:

 - Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java
   platform. Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language,
   with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying
   developers’ productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn
   syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately
   delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting
   capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, first class functional
   programming support and runtime and compile-time meta-programming.

## Issues:

 - Outstanding issue: Website: some more progress has been made
   in the last quarter but this task is not quite finished - work will continue.

 - New issue: We have had additional requests (e.g. [1]) from Groovy
   language users to be able to contribute to Groovy's development through
   crowdfunding. Our understanding is that the ASF doesn't permit
  "cash for code" so we have suggested that a separate entity be set up
   for this purpose that can act independently to but in accordance with
   ASF guidelines. Our users didn't know what might be involved in setting
   up such an entity and asked us to help. With this in mind I have set up
   a strawman open collective site[2]. It is not currently active - so please
   don't distribute the URL publicly at this stage.

   My goal will be to hand this site over to whoever will take on board
   running the collective. I don't know whether that will include myself at this
   stage. My intention of creating the strawman was for feedback purposes.
   It's often easier to get feedback from a concrete example than to ask for
   feedback on an abstract idea and, if the wording is close to what we would
   consider acceptable from an ASF point of view, we can finesse the words.
   So, we are seeking feedback rather than having a strong feeling that
   the current wording on that site is fixed in stone.

   I have requested feedback from a branding/trademark point of view on the
   trademarks email address but we are keen on feedback on the whole
   concept from the board.

   Our take on this is that this initiative will be beneficial to the
project, so we
   would like to help get it off the ground so long as normal Apache
   procedures aren't compromised. We don't believe this will be the case
   and are also happy to act as somewhat of a guinea pig project in this
   regard in case other projects would like to go down this path.

## Activity:

 - This quarter, 165 commits were contributed from 12 contributors
   including 8 non-committer contributors (4 new).

## Health report:

 - Committee Health score: Healthy

 - Apache Groovy was downloaded 30 million times during the last
quarter of 2018.
   We closed the year 2018 with a record number of downloads (across
   Maven Central and JFrog Bintray) with over 100 million downloads,
   up from 23 million in 2017 and 13 million in 2016.

 - Also, Groovy re-entered the TIOBE top 20 most popular programming
   languages[3]. While not a super reliable metric for health due to
its volatility,
   it's a good indicator that Groovy remains an active, widely-used and relevant
   language.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
  The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
  open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX
  and Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure,
  efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync
  with the current HTTP standards.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.38 was released in January, fixing some
   bugs, enhancing features, and addressing three CVEs; two at a low
   severity (CVE-2018-17199, CVE-2018-17189) as well as one with an
   important severity (CVE-2019-0190), though the latter only applied to
   specific bleeding-edge configurations of httpd.
   
 - Stefan Sperling was added to the PMC.
 
 - It was decided to close down some unused mailing lists.
 
 - HTTPd was represented at FOSDEM (qua ASF's booth there), and as is
   often the case, was the baseline for many discussions and questions
   at the table.
 
 - There are plans among committers to represent HTTPd at the HTTP
   Workshop in Amsterdam, April 2-4 2019. TBD.
   
## Health report: 
 The project project remains healthy and community oversight is
 definitely present at all times. Code/commit-wise, we had a slower
 quarter (down some ~45% in activity compared to previous quarter),
 with the holidays likely being to blame there.
 
 Looking at the bigger picture, it's safe to say that HTTPd is a mature
 project, with activity having leveled out many years ago - in fact, we
 are at the same engagement levels now as eight years ago, and holding
 pretty steady at 30-40 people active on the codebase and 250-300 people
 on the issue trackers, while email traffic has steadily but slowly
 declined, leveling out over the past two years. While the shift from
 one or two major HTTP servers to a multitude of different software
 projects and cloud-based setups over the past decade has moved some
 traffic away from HTTPd, another important aspect is aforementioned
 maturity, in that a lot of questions and answers are much more
 readily available to users seeking information than they were before,
 and as such, new queries are less frequent, with services like google,
 reddit, stackoverflow (et al) covering a lot of ground. A positive
 take-away from here is that our developer community is now more freed
 up to focus on enhancing our project and fixing whatever bugs remain.
 
 We still maintain a very mature contributor community, with the
 majority of contributors having had well above 5+ years of experience
 with the httpd project, and only ~37% with fewer than five years of
 experience. As we seem very capable of retaining the more experienced
 contributors, I do not see any concerns here, though reaching out to
 new people is, of course, always worth exploring.
 
 The PMC has more than sufficient oversight, and we have no concerns
 on that front.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 53 PMC members. 
 - Stefan Sperling was added to the PMC on Thu Jan 24 2019 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 122 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Sebastian Bazley at Sat Jul 14 2018 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - 2.4.38 was released on Mon Jan 21 2019 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
  Traffic to the big lists (dev+user) were a tad quieter over this past
  quarter compared to other quarters, with Christmas and New Years
  taking some of the credit. BugZilla seemed surprisingly busy, but
  that appears to largely be a cosmetic change to many tickets by one
  user causing a lot of automated emails. A few lists, which have been
  receiving little to no traffic over the past few years, have been
  slated for decommissioning. The top three lists are as follows:
   
 - users@httpd.apache.org:  
    - 2495 subscribers (down -22 in the last 3 months): 
    - 297 emails sent to list (483 in previous quarter) 
   
 - dev@httpd.apache.org:  
    - 825 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months): 
    - 227 emails sent to list (663 in previous quarter) 
   
 - bugs@httpd.apache.org:  
    - 317 subscribers (down -5 in the last 3 months): 
    - 1111 emails sent to list (405 in previous quarter) 

   
## Issue tracker Statistics:

   As with the mailing list traffic, the large number of tickets closed
   in this quarter is related to some cleanups, rather than increased
   continuous effort.
   
 - 51 Bugzilla tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 749 Bugzilla tickets resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Impala Project  [Jim Apple]

## Description:

Impala is a high-performance distributed SQL engine.

## Activity:

The previous three months had 330 patches to the master branch, while this
three-month period had 237. This is likely a seasonal dip.

Prominent work in the last three months includes:

 - The revival of the 2.x branch

 - Modernization of the documentation of the HBase integration

 - Significant changes to enable Impala to run better in containers

 - Improvements to the user experience of dealing with changing metadata

 - Multiple improvements to profile statistics

 - Numerous build process improvements for performance

 - Support for reading additional Parquet field types

## Health report:

The project remains healthy and metrics (number of commits, bugs filed, and
mailing list activity) remain healthy.

Three new contributors had patches committed.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 28 PMC members.
 - Zoltán Borók-Nagy was added to the PMC on Thu Jan 03 2019

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 45 committers.
 - Paul Rogers was added as a committer on Mon Feb 04 2019
 - Zoram Thanga was added as a committer on Fri Nov 16 2018

## Releases:

 - 3.1.0 was released on Wed Dec 05 2018

## Mailing list and JIRA activity:

Activity dropped, consistent with a seasonal dip during US holidays that
Impala sees every year: reviews@, issues@, dev@ traffic decreased by about
30%.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

{{{
Incubator PMC report for February 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 51 podlings incubating. During the month of January,
podlings executed 3 distinct releases. We added no new IPMC members and 
had no IPMC members retire.

We have one new podling Hudi. No project graduated last month but several 
podlings are heading towards graduation in the next few months.

BatchEE took a vote to go to Apache Geronimo or TLP and decided on TLP and 
are back to being stuck in trying to graduate.

One podling failed to report this month BRPC and one podling failed to get
sign off from it mentors Tamaya. They been asked to report next month.

There was one IP clearance.

The mentor situation is continuing to improve. One of the mentors for the 
new Hudi project realised he didn't have the time be be able to give to the 
project and stood down. Thanks to him for being able to recognising that he 
wasn't going to be an effective mentor. Other mentors stepped forward to do 
the job.

We have a problem with unapproved releases. A spot check on some (not all) 
projects reporting this month showed that five projects were making 
unapproved releases. Hopefully that's a statical aberration, but it seems 
likely that we probably have more codlings making unapproved releases than 
this. This has been brought up one the general list and I see a few 
projects have taken note of it.

Three of the projects Doris, Pinot and Sharding Sphere responded quickly 
and removed the releases. SDAP is addressing the issue. ECharts is a little 
reluctant to remove the releases due to the high use and popularity of the 
project and is trying to find another way of resolving the situation. 
Mentors are working with them to resolve the situation.

ECharts was also found to hosting a Chinese version of their incubating 
site at echarts dot baidu dot com. The PPMC is also dealing with this.

A reminder to all incubating projects and mentors that all releases
and distributions advertised to the general public need to be approved by
the PPMC and IPMC. This includes docker, github, PyPi, npm and any
other platform for publishing releases, and also covers release candidates.
Nightly builds for project-internal use clearly marked as "snapshot" or
"prerelease" (or similar) can be made available to project contributors.
If in doubt please ask your mentors or on the incubator general list.

Superset has not made an Apache release but is making progress towards one. 
They accidentally published a release candidate to GitHub but sorting 
that out.

There was also an interesting discussion on binary releases on 
legal-discuss that could have some impact on the incubator.

New new project creating ASF training material may either go to straight to 
TLP or via the incubator. This did raise a few questions about how initial 
committers are selected.

  3. Grow the community encouraging patches and recognizing sustained 
  contributions by adding as Committers and PPMC members.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A new mentor will add to Doris community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Excluding merges, 9 authors have pushed 21 commits to master and 26

Date of last release:

  Still working towards an Apache Release. 
  Made 0.9.0 legacy releases just after entering the Incubator on 
  2018-07-18 and it failed to approve due to license and build issues.
  We have fixed all license issues and improved building scripts, also 
  provide a docker environment for building.
  We Will now focus on making a successful Apache Release.

--------------------
ECharts

ECharts is a charting and data visualization library written in JavaScript.

ECharts has been incubating since 2018-01-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Initiating a new release candidate (v4.2.1-rc1) on 2019-01-25.
  2. Discussing having a new committer.
  3. Discussing develop and release workflow.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  1. The entrance of Website with Chinese version is under discussion.
  2. Currently, the latest version on npm is an rc version. We are working 
     on retagging or deprecating it.
  3. Legal problems are under discussion about third party license header.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  More issues are in English now due to our encouragement.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has been improved and we issued a new release candidate on 
  2019-01-25.

     Comments: We have provided guidance to the podling about pre-Apache 
           releases and unapproved releases.
           There is a thread which discusses an issue where code was 
           inspired by code another a different license,
           but this was not a copy. If there is no conclusion on 
           legal-discuss@ then we will need to ask on a
           LEGAL JIRA.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Justin Mclean: I think this report could have more detail and misses a
    number of things that are report worthy. Next time carefully go
    though the mail list and add anything that the IPMC (and board) would
    want to know about.

--------------------
Edgent

  Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime
  that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
  local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
  from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
  all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
  conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
  efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
  center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.  Re-creating a working community
  2.  Re-populating the PPMC
  3.  Replenishing the group of mentors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  For the past months, there has been very few activity in the project
  There have been a hand full of Emails from external peoples in the
  last 3 months but the activity in the project has been solely by me 
  (Julian) and Christofer Dutz writing emails without getting any form
  of response from the rest of the committers, PPMCs or mentors

  The main problem we have is that the only active people in the project 
  came in Late and are not that firm with the codebase. Currently, we
  have a codebase for which we have a detailed understanding of the build,
  but almost none of the code itself. Furthermore, there has been a lot of 
  activity in other projects and generally edge processing has developed
  further in the recent years.
  Thus, there is some discussion going on about the core or the aim of the 
  project to keep its significance and uniqueness.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  *   Total, we have 82 subscribers to our mailing list, an increase of 5
      since the last report.
  *   There has been one questions asked by users and little
      discussions about these issues on the list
  *   Julian Feinauer has joined the PPMC on 2018-11-29
  *   On April, 4th, Julian Feinauer will Talk about Edgent on the building 
      iot 2019

How has the project developed since the last report?

  *   According to JIRA, 0 new issue were added and none were resolved in
      the last 90 days
  *   The repositories were migrated to gitbox
  *   2 commits were made in the last 90 days.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  After the withdrawal of most of the active committers and PPCM members
  currently a new committer, PPMC and mentor-base has to be built.
  Currently we try to re-gain the focus of edgent to

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. Making a new release (0.20.1). Formalize the release CI jobs under 
  Apache infra.
  2. Making several Releases.
  3. Continuing to grow the community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been growing. Monthly meetups have been regularly and 
  successfully organized. We have seen new users interested in Heron and 
  community has been discussing and working on different ideas such as 
  Streamlet API, Heron Spouts and Bazel upgration.In November 2018 the 
  first Apache release was done following the Apache process and we are
  working on the next release with artifacts to make Heron easier for
  users to access.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There have been mainly bug fixes and improvements to existing features. 
  Some to note are:
  * Works towards Apache release with binaries and artifacts. Currently 
    fixing build scripts and jobs.
  * New functions in Streamlet API
  * Community initiated a new Heron-Spouts project
  * Fixes for Helm Charts specific to AWS clusters
  * Current work in progress to support the newest version of Bazel

PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to 
help make the web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce
latency and bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. The project needs more active developers.
  2. Create a first release
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The number of active developers is low. It was suggested that a release 
  may help attract community members. This was started, but stalled because
  of us feeling that we wanted to land a certain bug-fix. This release 
  process will be re-spun and we should have a first incubator release
  candidate ready for review somewhere in the next couple of weeks.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  One new developer was invited to be added as a committer, but ended up
  declining.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There have been significant contributions to the core product, which is
  an improvement. Frequency is still low.

 2. Improve/create user guide documentation
 3. Grow Community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  A member of the SDAP podling stepped up to the release manager role which
  is great. It shows the the podling is maturing.
  Unfortunately, the release candidate which was produced was not in
  compliance with the ASF release policy, thankfully Justin highlighted
  this and we are in the process of rolling the RC back. Lewis (SDAP 
  champion) and the release manager are working to resolve this and get the
  first incubating release candidate finished.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Two VOTE's have been made over on private@sdap regarding extending
  PPMC and Committership to two community contributors. This is very
  positive.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  SDAP is on the verge of it's first release. With some persistence
  the podling will have a release candidate for community VOTE soon.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

## Description:

 - jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
   Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3) specification
   for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout. Scout is an
   implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries 1.0 (JAXR).

## Issues:

 - There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

 - jUDDI - last release was 04 DEC 2018. Resolved several requisite bugs for
   updating SCOUT.
 - SCOUT - last release 10 DEC 2018. Resolved several bugs and dependencies.

## Health report:

 - Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in
   all likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.
 - There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to
   potential security issues. There were no issues raised since the last
   report.

 ## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for efficiently storing and
processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========

We are preparing the next major release 2.2.0, which plans to include new
features such as separate control and data planes, re-authentication in SASL,
better fencing with broker epoch, reducing consumer group rebalance, more
functionalities in KStreams, etc.

We are also preparing a bug fix release 2.1.1, which fixes more than 30
issues.

Community
===========

Lots of activities in the mailing list. We have 2809 subscribers in the user
mailing list, up 37 in the last 3 months. We have 657 emails in the user
mailing list in the last 3 months, a bit less than the 811 in the previous
cycle (likely due to year end holidays). We have 1310 subscribers in the dev
mailing list, up 38 in the last 3 months. We have 2056 emails in the dev
mailing list in the last 3 months, a bit less than the 2689 in the previous
cycle.

We elected two new committers, Vahid Hashemian on Jan 15, 2019 and Bill Bejeck
on Feb. 8, 2019. We didn't add any new PMC members. We last elected one new
PMC member Dong Lin on Aug. 4, 2018.

An EU sponsored Bug Bounty program for Apache Kafka with a focus on security
is in progress.

Releases
===========

2.1.0 was released on Nov. 21, 2018.
2.0.1 was released on Nov. 9, 2018.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

Apache Kibble is a suite of tools for collecting, aggregating and
visualizing activity in software projects. http://kibble.apache.org/

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity and health

In February, we had community representation at CHAOSSCon, the annual
conference of the CHAOSS workgroups, who do work around community
metrics in FLOSS. This was a very positive interaction for everyone
concerned, and many new ideas came out of that event.

Daniel Gruno presented a lightning talk about what we’re doing.

Kibble also was represented at the Apache booth at FOSDEM, and we ran
demos for many interested attendees.

Discussions at the events have led to a shift away from simply providing
metrics reporting, and more towards asking the end-user what kinds of
questions they wish to answer, and adapting to those questions.

Discussion also began around integration with Slack and Bitbucket for
metrics collection purposes.

Sharan has provided a more detailed write-up of these events on our dev
mailing list, at https://s.apache.org/OEB1

Despite all of the interest and positive interactions, we continue to
struggle to find actual participants in the code-part of the project
itself. We hope that following up on some of our contacts from FOSDEM
will turn the tide on this.

There remains adequate (>= 3 PMC members) oversight on the project, and
on the more philosophical/design-wise level, we have discussions going
and being started.

We did have a query from a University student interested in joining the
effort, but we have not heard back from them in recent weeks.

A suggestion that arose at FOSDEM for future conferences was lowering
the bar for contributions by allowing instant subscriptions to mailing
lists at the Apache booth. While we have plenty of interest in the
project from users, we seem to suffer from "conference amnesia" where in
people forget their interactions due to the sheer volume of inputs.

## PMC/Committer changes:
   
 - Currently 12 PMC members and 12 committers
 - Last PMC addition was Rafael Weingärtner on Fri Dec 08 2017
 - Last committer addition was Rafael Weingärtner at Sat Dec 09 2017
   
## Releases:
   
We have not yet made a release
   
## Mailing list activity:
   
This quarter was, for us, an uptick in mailing list traffic, largely
around our activities at FOSDEM.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

## Description:
 - The Apache Knox Gateway is an HTTP/REST API Gateway for interacting with
   Apache Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for
   all REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.

 - We have recently migrated to gitbox and agreed to start supporting Pull
   Requests from github
 - We have begun discussing the planning for the 1.3.0 release with a focus so
   far on containerization and cloud.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Libcloud Project  [Tomaž Muraus]

## Description:

Libcloud is a Python library that abstracts away the differences among
multiple cloud provider APIs.

## Issues:

There are no issues which require board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Similar to the last report, activity has dropped (mostly on the committer /
reviewer side), but we have still received decent amount of contributions
from various users.

We are trying to recruit more committers / reviewers, but it's not easy due
to the nature of the project (driver / plugin model where most people only
care about a very small part of a project - e.g. either a single driver or a
particular change in the driver they are interested in).

## PMC changes:

Quentin Pradet who has joined us as a last PMC member has decided to go
emeritus.

We have explained to him that it's totally fine to become inactive and there
is no need for him to go emeritus because it doesn't affect our project and
things such as voting quorum in any negative way.

In fact, that's what a lot of people do over a life time of a project - life
and priorities change, etc., people move on.

We also explained to him that as an inactive PMC members he has no
obligations in any form to the project, but he said he would still prefer to
go emeritus because it will allow him to more easily move on to different
projects.

We would also like to thank him for his excellent work and contributions to
the project.

 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - Quentin Pradet was added to the PMC on Mon May 14 2018

## Committer base changes:

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

We had stalled in the second half of 2018, with several board members
attempting to reach out to figure out status, and several board reports
missing, there were several calls and questions regarding moving to the attic.

It seems in early January an email to the dev mailing list generated activity,
after the private pmc mailing list seemed to have gone radio silent. There has
been vocal support on the dev@ mailing list and a flurry of activity.

* Several members have stepped up to work on cleaning up JIRA
 - 1 JIRA ticket fixed
 - 1 PR opened to improve merge stability
* We have a new website design/repo in the works
 - https://lucenenetsite.azurewebsites.net/
 - https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206
* We're working on bringing our TeamCity CI Servers back online and reporting
* We've a community member at MSFT voice their support for the general
  stability of 4.8.0-beta0005 in their projects, and is investingating their
  ability to contribute

We need to run a roll call at the PMC to see who is still around and possibly
add new members and new committers.

== Releases ==

* Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012
* Working toward 4.8.0 - Currently beta0005, which has been out for some time

== Board Questions ==

"Missing Reports" (I'm not sure anyone explicitly asked this). As mentioned
 above, my time has been extremely limited, and we are looking to rotate our
 VP, but as of yet have had no takers. Stefan Bodewig suggests we might need
 to look towards the attic - which I believe would be unfortunate, but may be
 the reality.

== People ==

* Last PMC Member Added, Paul Irwin, October 2013
* Last committer added Sept 2016, Shad Storhaug (nightowl888)
* PMC Chair rotated 20 June 2018 to Shad Storhaug (nightowl888)

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.12.0 release on
December 20, 2018.  The next major release is scheduled for April 30,
2019.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did
not sign up any new committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the lookout
for new PMC members and committers.  There are several candidates at this time
but we have not yet held a vote for committership.  Several of our emeritus
committers have become active again after a lull of a couple of years.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been very active this quarter.  Much of the
communication has been related to support and installation debugging, but
we're also seeing calls for the development of new connectors, and connectors
to replace existing ones where the APIs have become deprecated. Development of
a new OpenText connector is underway.  Integration with SolrJ had a lengthy
discussion in December, but I don't believe that ever was fully resolved, and
will need further impetus to be completed.

Issues reported have been centered mainly on bugs this quarter.  I am unaware
of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Peter Kovacs]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, MacOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in 41 languages.

## SUMMARY

This report has been sent in with a month delay due to full time schedules in
January. The Project did a release in November, containing bug fixes and a
security fix. The development regained activity concerning the modernization
of the code and build environment itself. One result of this development has
been that the process for releasing 4.2.0 has built momentum again.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

Issue: CVE-2018-16858 It is a moderate security vulnerability affecting
another program. We were notified that it could be impacting OpenOffice in a
significantly less dangerous form. We are still investigating. If OpenOffice
is actually affected, a fix will be included in the next release.

## RELEASES

We are working in parallel on 2 release lines: 1) 4.2.0 is the next minor
release, planned to be released into a beta phase. We have missed our goal on
going into the beta in 2018. We managed only to solve the biggest blockers. 2)
4.1.x is still in maintenance. We are discussing a parallel 4.1.7 release. The
motivation in maintaining the 4.1.x line is not very high. We will shut it
down as soon as we have a stable release of 4.2.x,

## Latest Release History

2018-11-18 4.1.6 2017-12-30 4.1.5 2017-10-19 4.1.4

## ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

No Changes to report. We have newcomers working on parts of OpenOffice. We
hope they will commit something soon.

## WEBSITES & INFRASTRUCTURE

We have processed the migration towards new VMs. The Wikis and Forums are now
in maintenance by the developer team. We thank infra for their patience and
support.

We have initiated a new VM payed from the Project Funds in 2018 Q3, for a
reviving the OpenGrok Service. We are still in the process of setting the
system up.

We still use the Apache CMS for our web presence. It seems it is currently
unmaintained and unsupported. The recommendation is to migrate to a different
setup. Resolution to this issue is unacceptable in a mid term time frame. Only
little development has been done in this branch. However, without help from
outside the Project it's expected that this problem won't get solved.

## MARKETING

The German community is producing new flyers for the Booth team in German and
English. We are looking for translators into other languages.

We did not get a booth on FOSDEM and at first our application for a
documenters room was rejected. On short notice we were notified that the
documenters room has not been rejected. Some of our developer community will
still meet at FOSDEM, but with smaller engagement then in the last years due
to the short notice.

The German booth team will attend more conferences in Germany.

  - Activity remains constant on average. We had an expected tail-off during
    the Christmas and (calendar) New Year with our predominantly US-based
    membership.

## PMC changes:
  - Currently 28 PMC members.
  - New PMC members:
     - Karan Mehta (2018/12/23)

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - We released Apache POI 4.0.1 to fix some smaller issues that were found in
   the major 4.0.0 release. Overall the 4.x releases seem to be of good
   quality as many changes were made, but we only received few regression
   bug-reports.

   Some more work for Java 11 was done, Early testing of JDK 12 and 13 builds
   was performed.

   One new Committer/PMC member was voted in and started to apply some
   patches.

### XMLBeans
 - Work started on a release XMLBeans 3.0.3, a few issues were discussed in
   the area of multi threading/concurrency overhead, class-loading and XML
   parsing.

   Work is ongoing to refresh the buildsystem to remove some unnecessary
   complexity and make it easier for developers to build and use modern IDEs
   for development.

   Also some work and discussion is ongoing to improve support for Java 9+

## Health report:
 - There was some discussion of bug reports/features via bugzilla and a number
   of requests which indicate that the popularity of Apache POI is still very
   good. Questions via email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   Bug influx was moderate this quarter, bug-numbers went down, most likely
   due to developers could put in some time during the holidays.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode and was re-activated only a short while ago.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Roller Project  [David M. Johnson]

## Description:
Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based blog server that works well on
Tomcat and MySQL, and is known to run on other Java servers and relational
databases. Latest release is 5.2.1 and the ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org
runs on Roller 5.1.2 Tomcat and MySQL.

## Issues:
- There are no other issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- New release made in January to upgrade Struts 2 due to a vulerability.
- Roller web UI modernized and completelyrewritten to use Struts Bootstrap tags.
- Hope to release new web UI as Apache Roller 6 this year
   - Made 6.0.0-SNAPSHOT build available https://s.apache.org/6.0.0-snapshot
   - Asked for feedback from community, Infra and Sally on new UI
- Offered to help create new blog themes for blogs.apache.org

## Health report:
Community is made-up of part-time volunteers with limited time to devote to
Roller. Currently only one committer is actively working on developing Roller
and making release. For the most part other committers only have time to
review and test release.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 5 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Kohei Nozaki on Sun Dec 06 2015

## Committer base changes:

## Releases:
 - Last release was 5.2.2 on January 10, 2019
 - Release process underway for 5.2.3

## Mailing list activity:
Subscriber counts could be taken to mean there is still some interest in
Apache Roller. The low email counts reflec the low level of development and
user-support activity.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Branko Čibej]

Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Branko Čibej]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library
   built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the
   default client library of Apache Subversion, Apache OpenOffice and
   mod_pagespeed.

## Issues:
   Activity on the project seems to have come to a halt since
   the last report.

## Activity:
   There has been no move towards getting Serf 1.4.0 released in the last
   three months. A release candidate for internal testing was produced,
   but never released. The last Serf release is now 2.5 years old.

   Since the last report, we asked the AOO developers about their use
   of Serf. It turns out that they're using version 1.2.x (pre-ASF)
   and there was some interest but no work done towards updating it.

   The only active user of Serf seems to be Apache Subversion.
   mod_pagespeed is still listed as incubating but doesn't even have
   a podling web site (either that, or the link on the incubator page
   is wrong).

## Health report:
   The last commit in the public repository was made on 2nd November.

## PMC & Committer changes:
   Currently 13 PMC members and 13 committers.

   - No new committers added in the last 3 months.
   - Last new committer added in April 2017 (Evgeny Kotkov).
   - Last new PMC member added in September 2018 (Branko Čibej).

## Releases:
   Apache Serf 1.3.9 was released on Thu Sep 01 2016

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   The last message on the dev@ mailing list is 3 months old
   (it started a new thread and got no responses).

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The
base of the SIS library is modelled according international standards
published jointly by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

## Issues:

We have difficulty to make a release. See the health report section below.

## Activity

About 190 commits by 2 developers in the last 3 months. Extensive work
has been done for supporting some raster data in netCDF files from NASA
and JAXA space agencies. It caused relatively rapid development of
Apache SIS capability to handle remote sensing data. The library now
handles some non-trivial problems for positioning 4-dimensional
(including time dimension) images on Earth. However we still lack a
Graphical User Interface allowing non-developers to visualize their
data. The Google Summer of Code work that attempted to address this
problem has not yet been integrated.

We presented Apache SIS in Paris Open Source Summit 2018 [1]. We did not
attended to Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) meeting in the last 3
months. Activity on the mailing list dropped from 80 emails in the
summer to 25 in autumn to 6 in the last 3 months.

## Health report:

The last Apache SIS release (0.8) was one year and half ago. In the last
two reports, we wrote that Apache SIS 1.0 release would happen soon. But
we have been unable to make it happens. The reason is that the
developers who made previous releases are trapped in urgent work since
many months. Consequently Apache SIS got active development because
those new features were essential to the urgent company work, but this
is not the development needed for a SIS release. There is some
regressions that we didn't had time to fix. Even if we accept those
regressions and release SIS almost as-is, preparing a release still
require one or two full days (testing, documenting, synchronizing
extensions not included in Apache releases for licensing reasons,
discover issues, fix them…).

Activity on the mailing list dropped because we stopped reporting OGC
activities, proposing plan for ongoing work or discussing integration of
Google Summer of Code work. It will hopefully resume after the urgent
work is completed.

The current difficulty to release Apache SIS shows the project bus
factor. A proposal to rotate the chair has been posted on the mailing
list [2].

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- We created a security@spark.apache.org mailing list to discuss security
  reports in their own location (as was also suggested by Mark T in November).

- We released Apache Spark 2.2.3 on January 11th to fix bugs in the 2.2
  branch. The community is also currently voting on a 2.3.3 release to bring
  recent fixes to the Spark 2.3 branch.

- Discussions are under way about the next feature release, which will likely
  be Spark 3.0, on our dev and user mailing lists. Some key questions include
  whether to remove various deprecated APIs, and which minimum versions of
  Java, Python, Scala, etc to support. There are also a number of new features
  targeting this release. We encourage everyone in the community to give
  feedback on these discussions through our mailing lists or issue tracker.

Trademarks:

- We are continuing engagement with various organizations.

Latest releases:

- Jan 11th, 2019: Spark 2.2.3
- Nov 2nd, 2018: Spark 2.4.0
- Sept 24th, 2018: Spark 2.3.2

Committers and PMC:

- There was a discussion about lack of available review bandwidth for
  streaming on the dev list in January. The PMC discussed this and added a new
  committer, Jose Torres, specializing in streaming. We are continuing to look
  for other contributors who'd make good committers here and in other areas.
- The latest committer was added on January 29th, 2019 (Jose Torres).
- The latest PMC member was added on January 12th, 2018 (Xiao Li).

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community is healthy and active. New features are being designed
  and developed, and bug reports are being handled. Our user support
  forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers regularly.

  We added Yasuhito Futatsuki (futatuki@), who is working on
  Subversion's bindings to Python 3, as a committer in January 2019.

* Releases

  Subversion 1.9.10, 1.10.4, and 1.11.1 were released January 11 2019.

  Subversion 1.12.0 is expected in April 2019, at which point we will
  stop supporting 1.11 releases.

  Subversion 1.9 and 1.10 are our current long-term-support (LTS)
  releases and will receive support until August 2019 and April 2022,
  respectively.

* Delayed patching of known security issues 

  The project has been discussing its approach to security issues.

  We decided to move parts of related documentation and scripting,
  which had been kept private, to our public repository.

  We have two processes for handling security issues, a "public"
  process where fixes are committed to our public repository before
  a release is cut, and a "private" process where patches are
  maintained in the private area of our repository and are included
  in the release by our release manager. The community is currently
  debating the merits of each process, and perhaps switching to
  a single unified process.

  On January 18, we published a security advisory for CVE-2018-11803.

  The issue formerly known as CVE-2018-1293 is not fixed yet.
  It is no longer considered a security issue because its impact is
  minimal and the workaround is easy (use 'svn rm' on offending path).
  A fix is being developed in public and status is being tracked in
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4788

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Thrift Project  [Jake Farrell]

## Description:
 
- Apache Thrift is a high performance cross platform RPC and serialization
solution.
 
## Issues:
 
- The PMC has lost contact with its chair Jake Farrell. A new chair was
elected by the PMC to overcome the issue.
- Due to the short notice, we do not have access to Whimsy etc. set up,
so we are sending this report via mail.
 
## Activity:
 
- The community continues to dramatically reduce the issue and pull
request backlog. James King in particular deserves special mention in this
regard, as he has put in a huge amount of hours recently and is almost
singularly responsible for our recent 0.12 release.
 
## Health report:
 
- The project code is healthy and fairly mature. The build system is in
transition and while there is work to do there, the community is actively
discussing a 1.0 release. That said, we need more active committers and PMC
members. Of the 17 PMC members only 3 are active, of the 33 committers,
less than half are active.
 
## PMC changes:
 
- Currently 17 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 4 months

## Mailing list activity:

particularly exotic ones are answered by the community.
 
- dev@thrift.apache.org:

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

This is does not substitute for a board report and we will report next
month.  There was an ask by the Board for projects to indicate if they
would like to use the official Jakarta EE logo once certified. That
was discussed and all responses were a yes[1].

Short status of the project is that we've had the best quarter in the
project history, shattering previous records on mailing lists
communication, commits and new contributors by wide margins.  There
were over 40 new faces committing their first commit between December
and January and we still see a new face weekly.  This status is far
too amazing to slip in at the last minute, which is why we'll be
reporting next month, but we are quite proud of the massive
turnaround.

## Health report:
  Growth has been flat over the past year or so. Some of historical core
  contributors have not been active with the project recently. However, there
  are contributions from a potential new committer. Getting the project to a
  healthier state will be a focus over the next few months. This includes more
  discussion on the mailing lists, better use of JIRA, and planning of a new

  fixes over the last release in 2016.
