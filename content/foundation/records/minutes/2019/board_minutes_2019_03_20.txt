    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we will celebrate our 20th anniversary on the same date as
       the annual members meeting.  We also published an important blog post
       this month [1], elucidating the core concepts underlying the Apache
       Way.  This statement represents the collaborative work of quite a few
       ASF members and represents a big step forward in getting better
       clarity for ASF volunteers and others interested in understanding the
       Foundation.  Many thanks to those who contributed and for the overall
       positive and productive discussion around the post.

       Items requiring board attention
       -------------------------------

       Marketing & Publicity has a two proposals for substantial, one time
       investments in recognition of the ASF's 20th anniversary.  If there
       aren't objections, these items will be included in the upcoming FY20
       budget where they will receive final approval at that time.

       Financials
       ----------

       Overall, we are continuing our pattern of under-running expenses and
       over-producing on income.  The under-running will slow down a bit with
       the hiring of new system administrators.  Our finances are in such
       good shape that I approved of the pulling forward of 75% down payment
       on ACEU19 (which was approved by the board last month) into this
       fiscal year.  The net effect of this will be to reduce the amount by
       which we overachieved this year in terms of budget and will reduce the
       amount requested in the FY20 budget.

       Summary
       -------

       All areas operating normally.

       * Brand management responding to queries, working with council on
         registration and privately with third parties on infringements.

       * Fundraising have established a division of labor for working with
         existing sponsors, outreach, and events.  This is resulting in
         timely renewals, invoicing, and sponsor contacts.  Notably, there
         are two new sponsors.

       * Marketing and Publicity in addition to the normal media contacts,
         M&P is completing development of promotional materials, and working
         closely with event planners.  As mentioned previously, there is a
         proposal for the board to evaluate.

       * Infrastructure completed hiring of two new system administrators. 
         Otherwise operating normally with the exception of a bit of downtime
         on our TLP servers which has been resolved.

       * Conferences now has 4 events in flight; each with a dedicated
         volunteer event chair overseeing the report.

       * Travel assistance no report posted as of yet; I've sent an email
         reminding Gavin of this responsibility, and will follow up before
         the next meeting.

       * Finance there was an uptick of activity with respect to filings,
         fundraising, events, and meeting with banks.  Most notably, there
         was a conversation with a possible wealth management firm.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s Financial performance for the
       first ten months of FY19;



       Operating Cash on February 28, 2019 was $2,658.9K, which is up  $59.7K
       from last month’s ending balance (Jan 19) of $2,599.2K.  Total Cash as
       of Feb 28, 2019 is $4,052.8K ( includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation) as compared to $2,500.2K on Feb 28th 2018 (an increase of
       $1,552.6K year over year). The Feb 2019 ending Operating cash balance
       of $2,658.9K represents an Operating cash reserve of 20 months based
       on the FY19 conservative Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $132.8K/month ( this will most change for FY 20, as there was a fair
       amount of budgeted spend in FY19 that has not occurred but may in FY20
       as we continue to work on the budget).  The ASF actual Operating
       reserve of 20 months at the end of Feb 2019 is ahead of the budgeted
       10.6 month reserve for YTD through Feb 2019.  The ASF Operating
       reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of the ASF’s
       size and Operating activity.



       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Income is ahead of FY18 at this
       point in the Fiscal year by $501.7K .  As compared to the FY19
       Budgeted Income,  YTD,  we are ahead by $630.5K.



       YTD expenses, through Feb 28, 2019 are under budget by $382.1K.  All
       depts. are under budget, at the end of Feb 2019.  There are still a
       couple items worth mentioning, one being Infra,  as noted in the Board
       summary is $227K under budget due to the timing of hiring of staff (
       though this will change in Mar19 as they have hired two new staff
       members, Congrats)  and not having to pay any Lease web invoices YTD. 
       The other being TAC at $45K under budget YTD for FY19.  The Expenses
       vs Budget will also change in Mar 19 as we just put a 75% down payment
       on ACEU19 of $229.6K as well. So with both of these for the Mar 19
       close we will be closer to our FY19 Expense Budget.



       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY19 the ASF finished with a positive
       $607.2K NI vs a budgeted negative <$405.4K> NI or $1,012.6K  ahead of
       Budget, NI,  for FY19 at this point in the Fiscal year.  This is
       attributable to timing of some Sponsor payments as well as more
       Donations than were budgeted as well as underspending in all depts
       YTD, vs the FY19 Budget.  At this point in the FY we are doing very
       well, ahead in Revenue and well under budget in Expenses, even taking
       timing variances into account.  We will continue to monitor this as we
       finish out FY19.  With regard to FY18, we are outpacing revenue, by
       $501.7K as noted above,  but we are also out pacing expenses by
       $180.8K. However, year over year NI for FY19 exceeds FY18 by $320.9K,
       another good yard stick of the Foundation’s financial health at this
       point in time.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Internal procedures were updated for emeritus members who wish to
       be reinstated. External documentation of the process is pending.

       Several discrepancies in the records have been fixed (missing and
       duplicate ICLAs).

       In February, 56 ICLAs, three CCLAs, and one grant were received and
       filed.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Two new Sys Admins started on March 18th. Welcome to Drew Foulks and
       John Andrunas

       MoinMoin Wiki will be deprecated in favour of either Confluence or
       GitHub Wiki

       Assisting M&PR to stage the 20th Anniversary website design.

       Eclipse IDE caused a problem with a rapid rise in requests for a
       plugin that had been removed from dist.apache.org. This resulted in a
       large scale repeated fetch operations from across the globe. That had
       a knock on effect that led the team to revamp Blocky, our tool for
       automated ban/blocking. We are now better equipped to handle such
       events.

       Marketing and PR
       ================

       Lots of work for the 20th Anniversary.

       The Quarterly Report for Q3 FY2019 is live at
       https://s.apache.org/nUxz

       Fundraising re-alignment of responsibilities continues to bring
       results.

       Conferences
       ===========

       4 events "in flight" so the team are very busy. Of note is that we
       have a lengthy report with contributions from each of the event leads.
       This is very encouraging to see. Real teamwork but also with real
       leadership to keep things moving. Rich appears to finally have reached
       his goal - congrats to all.

       ApacheCon North America 2019 - CFP is open. There are a number of
       community led tracks (details in full report).

       ApacheCon Europe 2019 progressing well.

       DC Roadshow - in the black financially. Focus is on attracting
       attendees at this time.

       Chicago Roadshow is putting the schedule together.

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ===========================

       No report at time of writing. What I know is...

       Accepted sponsorship to assist attendance for specific minority
       groups. This is being administered within the existing process.

       Ramping up to run TAC for the multiple events on the horizon.

    F. Vice Chairman [Shane]

       Not much to report other than some Whimsy and documentation work
       trying to make our annual Member's meetings even easier to understand,
       attend, and manage.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising is doing well with timely renewals, invoicing and sponsor
contacts. Our Sponsor Ambassadors have completed outreach/check-in with ASF
Sponsors and Targeted Sponsors. Big thanks to our Sponsor Ambassadors for
their effort. We are also in the process of welcoming two new sponsors and are
happy to report this month that more than $500 USD has been donated by
individual donors.

We also continue working with Platinum and Gold sponsors for promotional
opportunities. Three Platinum sponsors have recently taken advantage of the
benefit and we will soon be releasing a Sponsor case study. We're also working
with sponsors for our 20th Anniversary.

Work with ASF events has continued picking up. We've partnered with the
Conferences team to help finalize event prospectuses for Apache Roadshow
Chicago, ApacheCon NA Las Vegas and ApacheCon EU Berlin. Sponsorship support
for the events is going well. We are also engaged with the event producers to
establish processes.

We continue our ongoing records maintenance and accounts reconciliation on the
backend of our processes and published our FY2019 Q3 report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - March 2019

I. Budget: we remain on budget and on schedule. We are exploring additional
promotional opportunities possible for the ASF 20th Anniversary, and will be
submitting an addendum to our proposed budget for FY2020.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to work closely with VP
Fundraising Daniel Rugger in restructuring ASF Fundraising. She continues to
secure sponsorship renewals and is working with Virtual to ensure timely
invoicing. We have signed a new Platinum Targeted Sponsor who will be
announced later this month, and has been following up on numerous incoming
sponsorship queries. The newly-established Central Services sub-group of ASF
Marketing & Publicity has kicked off with three creative projects, namely the
site refresh of apache.org, creating logo assets for the ASF's upcoming 20th
Anniversary, and launching supporting graphics for Apache Conferences. Sally
has been working closely with ASF Conferences across planning, sponsorships,
marketing, and related tactics, and has successfully completed content and
creative direction on the prospectuses for the upcoming Apache
Roadshow/Chicago, ApacheCon/Las Vegas, and ApacheCon/Berlin, as well as
launched a digital ad campaign for the Apache Roadshow/DC. The latest
"Success at Apache" post, "Growing with the ASF", was published at
 https://s.apache.org/NoXH . The Quarterly Report for Q3 FY2019 is live at
 https://s.apache.org/nUxz . We are finalizing the next ASF Sponsor case
 study
(offered exclusively to Gold and Platinum sponsors), which will be published
 in the coming days. Promotional planning and tactics continue for the
 upcoming ASF 20th Anniversary, which will be formally rolling out on 26
 March and continue through the calendar year.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this
timeframe:

 - 4 March - MEDIA ALERT: The Apache Software Foundation to present on Apache
   software projects in government, cybersecurity, and more at Roadshow and
   Open Source Job Fair at George Mason University

 - 19 February - The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Apache Arrow™
   Momentum

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 242 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 31 items to 52.1K followers on
Twitter. We posted 11 items on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 38.2K
organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 3 announcements are in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to
announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are
requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks'
notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 3 media queries, and are working on
several placed articles by invitation. The ASF received 1,235 press clips vs.
last month's clip count of 1,053. Media coverage of Apache projects yielded
2,461 press hits vs. last month's 2,062. ApacheCon received 120 press hits.
We continue to work with several corporates that are involved with several
Apache projects on externally-focused communications and publicity.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received one analyst queries during this time.
Apache was mentioned in 11 reports by Gartner; 2 reports by Forrester; 2
reports by 451 Research; and 6 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: we are completing development of promotional materials,
assets, and Website refresh for the ASF's 20th Anniversary. Members of the
new Central Services sub-group of ASF Marketing & Publicity have been
collaborating successfully on the apache.org refresh, reviewing, judging, and
optimizing the selected entry for the 20th Anniversary logo, and developing
digital assets for Apache events. We plan to expand this group to include
possible outside contributors and will be working on a strategy to promote
involvement with new communities.

IX. Events liaison: we continue to work closely with Virtual regarding the
Apache Roadshow/Chicago and ApacheCon/Las Vegas, as well as preparing
ApacheCon/Berlin for initial publicity. In addition, we are working with ASF
Conferences and ComDev on new opportunities to promote Apache projects and
exploring opportunities for ApacheCon in 2020.

X. Newswire accounts: we have renewed our pre-paid press release contract
with GlobeNewswire, which will run through December 2020.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating as expected, and has no current issues to
bring to the attention of the President or the Board.

Hiring
======
We completed our hiring process, and brought aboard two new system
administrators: Drew Foulks and John Andrunas. They started the week
of March 18, 2019.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Onboard the new employees.
- Deprecation of the MoinMoin wiki, and the associated moves of
  projects over to Confluence or the GitHub wiki system.
- Evaluate hosted solutions for Reviewboard and Sonarqube.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Complete puppetization and migration off the old hardware, then
  begin a mass migration to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and Puppet v6.

General Activity
================
- Upgraded Confluence, and its various plugins. We have now configured
  Confluence to use standard/simplified Apache LDAP sign-in, while
  retaining the ability for the public to create accounts and
  contribute to wiki pages.
- Working with M&PR to stage a new website design.
- Our automated ban/blocking system called "Blocky" was completely
  revamped, as a result of the Eclipse fallout (described below). The
  new Blocky better handles bans, limited-time bans, whitelists, and
  limited-time whitelists. The user interface has been rebuilt to
  simplify the discovery, ban repeal, manual ban/whitelist, and other
  functions.
- Jira plugins were upgraded.
- Our install of Crowd (an SSO solution for Atlassian products) has
  been upgraded, and we're rolling it out across our ecosystem.

Uptime Statistics
=================
We experienced some downtime on our TLP servers due to a bug in the
Eclipse IDE plugin loading system. The Apache Geronimo project removed
an obsolete plugin (that was erroneously hosted or referenced to our
dist.apache.org server), and Eclipse did not recognize the 404
response from our server. Eclipse retried endlessly/immediately. This
appeared to coincide with some Eclipse-related event, as the removal
occurred long ago. Whatever instigated the fetch from our servers, it
ramped up quickly and arrived from thousands of source addresses all
around the planet. The team worked on various remediation efforts and
blocks, but the final answer was to simply reinstate a file that
Eclipse could retrieve. This stopped the traffic load, and our systems
have returned to normal.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Overall, things seem to be going well. We have 4 events "in flight" right now,
so it's a lot to keep track of. I'm very grateful for the independence and
self motivation of each of the event chairs, so that I haven't had to do much
for those other events. Each event chair will provide a sub-report below.

## ApacheCon North America 2019

The Call for Presentations is now open, and registration should be open in
time for the DC Roadshow and the 20th anniversary announcements.

### CCC

The Cloudstack Collaboration Conference has launched their own website, at
http://us.cloudstackcollab.org/ to promote their event. We anticipate that
several of the other tracks/summits will do the same in the coming weeks.

### ACNA-IoT Track

We haven't emailed specific projects bc I thought there was an all-user
all-dev blast going out soon and didn't want to back-to-back spam, however I
have seen one-off announcements going out from other tracks so please let me
know.

### Integration track

The Integration track of ApacheCon NA is scheduled for Thursday 12th of
September in the Laughlin 1 room with the capacity of 100 persons. Zoran
Regvart is the chair of the track. He engaged his colleagues at Red Hat to
submit talks and sent an e-mail to dev@ ActiveMQ, Airflow, Arrow, Beam, CXF,
Falcon, Flume, Ignite, Kafka, Karaf, Lens, MetaModel, NiFi, Pulser, RocketMQ,
Spark and Storm projects highlighting the Integration track and encouraging
submissions. Additional invitation was extended to Camel dev@ and users@ with
the offer to help with topics and submissions.

## ApacheCon Europe 2019

Myrle:

ApacheCon Berlin is humming along.  Sharan got our website up, we've finalized
the sponsor prospectus, and gotten the registration system up and running.
Once the prospectus was finalized, Sally needed only 90 minutes to sell the
first Platinum sponsorship.  The first ticket sale (with a 40 euro donation to
the ASF!) was also quite fast.  The first pubic announcement for ApacheCon
Berlin has gone out on the coattails of the DC Roadshow.  We are coordinating
with ApacheCon Las Vegas as tightly as possible including on sponsorship
prices and on keynote speakers. Paul of NewThinking and Myrle have a weekly
meeting for Monday morning (CET) where we will coordinate whatever comes up.
And Sharan, as the event sponsor ambassador has been coordinating with Nina of
NewThinking as well.

Still on our todo list: get the CfP system up, get an announcement out that
focuses on Berlin, get our keynotes lined up, coordinate with TAC, and get
more track chairs on board.

## DC Roadshow

KAM:

The DC Roadshow is going well.  We are in the black financially.  The biggest
concern is putting butts in seats.  Lots of work is ongoing to do that.
Otherwise, I expect the event to be a big success and look forward to
repeating it.

## Chicago Roadshow

Trevor:


CFP is Closed- except for "Apache in Adtech" and "Apache in Startups" track,
still waiting on a few proposals to fill those out.  I've created a gdoc on
which-track-which-day.  Next step is to email selected talks (a correctly
filled out abstract was selected, but they all look good except one
maybe-questionable-maybe-just-a-bad-abstract).    After all of that, will post
schedule and start promoting the event. So far we've sold 4 tickets. Will be
updating website soon wrt GCP sponsorship (once I get green light that its
been signed?).

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
a good care of resolving most of these in time.
(we're down 4, from 28 to 24, open issues this month).

Kudos to Hen for leading a few cleanup/clarifications efforts, most notably in
private/foundation/legal SVN and web properties of legal committee available
under https://www.apache.org/legal Also, Hen contributed quite a bit to the 5
year plan with details available at:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LEGAL/issues/LEGAL-422

Discussions around evolving our binary release policies continued on 
legal-discuss and general@incubator with several data points for a potential
proposal emerging, but with no clear indication for how and when the process
will converge. This may require a board level feedback on how important it is
for us to spend significant resources on pursuing this.

Discussion around clarifying the scope and purpose of legal mailing lists and
also creating a privileged mailing list re-surfaced again. This time we have
much more consensus at least around how to proceed with privileged one.

We finalizing publishing of our IRS filings for the 2016/2017 as per request
of Martin Michlmayr. It is now available under:
https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/

Attachment 11: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [Chris Mattmann]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Report from the Apache Airflow Project  [Bolke de Bruin]

## Description:
 - Apache Airflow (or simply Airflow) is a platform to programmatically
   author, schedule, and monitor workflows. When workflows are defined as
   code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and
   collaborative. Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of
 workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line
 utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user
 interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor
 progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - New committer added: Xiaodong Deng
 - Healthy discussions on the mailinglist around DAG serialization

## Health report:
 - We have grown from 712 to 743 contributors since our last report. We do

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Aurora Project  [Jake Farrell]

## Description:

Apache Aurora is a stateless and fault tolerant service scheduler used to
schedule jobs onto Apache Mesos such as long-running services, cron jobs, and
one off tasks.

## Issues

The project might be heading towards the Apache Attic in the future, unless
the community interest increases again. We will need advice on when and how we
should make this transition.

## Health report

The Apache Aurora project has seen a significant slowdown of user and
contributor activity over the most recent months. This can partially be
attributed to the overall stability and maturity of the project, but more
importantly this is due to other external projects that managed to win the
developer mindshare within the container orchestration field
(e.g., general purpose cloud providers, Kubernetes, ...).

## PMC changes:

- Currently 21 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Jordan Ly on Wed May 02 2018

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 22 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Renan DelValle at Fri Jan 26 2018

Issue backlog status since last report:

* 0 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
* 0 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

* @issues      8 messages (15 in previous quarter)


## Releases:

- Last release was 0.21.0 on Sun Sep 09 2018

## Mailing list activity:

Activity for this project is on a downward trajectory. As noted above, this
project may be headed for the Attic if this trend continues.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Robert Lazarski]

# Apache Axis2 Board Report

## Description

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary components
(both Java and C).

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

- Axis2 Java 1.7.9 (stable)
  - Maintenance only.

- Axis2 Java 1.8 (development)

- Axis2 C 1.7 (development)

## Health report:
We have enough PMC to cut releases. Axis2 is a mature project, but still
actively maintained.

Most of our users are using legacy SOAP services so we are lacking new
committers. A committer offer was made this past quarter to an individual who
declined. As our day jobs move more into REST and JSON, we will continue to
use Axis2 for this and expect to grow our community by better docs and
examples in that area.

Axis2 C added a new committer, Bill Blough, this past December 2017 and so far
that is helping the project pick up speed. There was more progress via commits
and Jira issues this past quarter. Bill has indicated he expects his activity
to increase this next quarter.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 63 PMC/Commiters members.
 - No new committers were added in the last 90 days, last committer added was
   Bill Blough on December 7th 2017 who also was added to the PMC on May 9th
   2018.
## Releases:
 - Axis 2/Java 1.7.9 was released on November 16, 2018.
 - Axis 2/C 1.6 was released on April 20, 2009.
 - Axis 1.4 was last released in 2006.

## JIRA Activity

- 7 JIRA tickets created in the last 90 days.
- 3 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 90 days.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Kenneth Knowles]

## Description:
Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Apache Beam has a number of major technical endeavors maturing. As usual for
Beam, these include many integrations with other projects / communities:

 - Beam Python can be executed on Flink and is reported to be used in
   production
 - Beam Java on Samza is reported to be used in production, and some success
   reported running Beam Python on Samza
 - Our first release with partial Python 3 support
 - Beam's IO connector ecosystem is healthy, with additions or upgrades to
   connectivity to RabbitMQ, Redis, Spanner, Parquet, Hadoop, MongoDb, Kafka,
   BigQuery, Cassandra, JDBC. And Beam SQL has added Hive Metastore support.
   This reflects the growing diversity of users and use cases represented in
   the Beam community.

Community event activity has seen good developments and cross-community
building too:

 - A San Francisco-based Beam meetup group started and seems self-sustaining
 - Beam Python on Flink has gained interest and was presented at a Seattle
   Flink Meetup
 - Kettle on Beam was presented at a London Pentaho Meetup

Beam Summit Europe 2019 is approved, to occur June 19-20 in Berlin (convenient
to Berlin Buzzwords).

There have been three Beam Newsletters [1, 2, 3] since the last report was
authored. There are collaboratively authored - anyone can suggest content
about technical achievements, what they are working on, events, blog posts,
etc. Much of the above and other details can be found in the newsletter.

A nice community touch is that the newsletter also gathers information from
threads where people introduce themselves, so it is a place to learn/reflect
on new members of the community.

The community has recently discussed moving finalized newsletter to the blog
or creating a "News" section on the website to boost visibility of the
information and clarity around the newsletter's publication date.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matthew Jason Benson]

## Apache BVal Report March 2019 ##

 - The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
   specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
   the foundation on February 15, 2012.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - We have lately been working to support our 2.0.0 release from last fall.
   Most notably this release, which rewrote a large portion of the codebase,
   is quite slow compared to the reference implementation of the Java Bean
   Validation (BV) specification so our near-term efforts will revolve around
   making improvements in that regard.
 - The 2.0.1 release described in last quarter's report as being in planning
   has not yet occurred. To remind the reader, one of the main purposes of
   the release would be to enable the proper tooling to certify Apache BVal
   as an implementation of the 2.0 BV specification.

## Health report:

 - We retain a small core of developers with the desire to keep this project
   afloat. It must be admitted that the available time for this project
   among this pool of resources is suboptimal; we continue to do what we can.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 13 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Romain Manni-Bucau on Mon Nov 18 2013

## Committer base changes:

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Falcon Project  [Pallavi Rao]

ABOUT

Falcon is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop designed for
data motion, coordination of data pipelines, lifecycle management, and data
discovery. Falcon enables end consumers to quickly onboard their data and its
associated processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters.



ISSUES

The project is not seeing much traction in the past few months and seems to
have run its course. Have initiated a discussion asking for suggestion from
the community and so far there hasn't been much forthcoming. Wish to keep the
email thread open a little longer before we decide to move the project to
attic, just to give the community a little more time to think about it.

STATUS

After 0.11 release there have been no new feature asks from the community.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam, Calcite,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The Flink community is trying to improve many community aspects in
    the last months, resulting in a lot of discussions and efforts.

  - Inspired by the effort from the Apache Beam project, the Flink PMC
    is looking to have a monthly discussion on promising candidates
    for committers and PMC and actively reach out. There are already
    healthy discussions about PMC and committer growth.

  - The community added a Chinese language user@flink mailing list for
    user-to-user questions and support. Since its creation six weeks ago,
    the list has already gathered 300 subscribers.    
    Design discussions and decisions still happen on the dev mailing list.

  - The trademark issue with the https://flink-china.org website (mainly a
    translation of the official Flink website) was resolved by convincing
    the maintainers to contribute the contents to the Apache website.
    The Flink website is now dual-language (Chinese version under
    https://flink.apache.org/zh/).
    The https://flink-china.org is currently online, with a disclaimer that
    it is being contributed and to the official Flink website and will then
    be shut down.

  - Alibaba has contributed the code of their internal Flink fork 'Blink' back
    to the open source project. The code is available in a separate branch,
    the community is working on merging selected parts into the mainline.

  - The community published a roadmap for the project, which sums up the
    active Flink Improvement Proposals (FLIPs) and JIRA issues to give
    users and contributors an easily digestible overview of all the ongoing
    efforts.

  - There are several discussion threads on how to improve the experience of
    contributing to Flink and keeping up with a large number of contributions.
    Current efforts include a better organization of JIRA components,
    a more transparent review process, and some automation through a pull
    request bot. In addition, we are thinking about component-specific guides
    and test frameworks, for example for connectors.

  - The community is in the process of releasing Flink 1.8. The release
    contains some new user-facing features plus a lot of internal cleanup
    and refactoring, fixing some long term issues, and preparing the work
    on a deeper integration of batch and stream processing in the runtime.

  - Program for Flink Forward San Francisco is online:
    https://sf-2019.flink-forward.org/conference-program
    Flink committers can get a free pass, and there are a discount codes for
    other Apache committers.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Very light activity, but really no changes compared to the last
quarter.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The Maven Repository Proxy used by Gump in order to inject freshly
built artifacts into dependent builds was changed to only listen to
the local network address.

The Tomcat and Forrest communities are still using Gump actively.

We will need to migrate from our Moin Wiki instance. Work hasn't
started, yet, but we'll do so during the next quarter.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

Incubator PMC report for March 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 51 podlings incubating. During the month of February,
podlings executed 8 distinct releases. We added one new IPMC member
(and new candidates are being considered) and we've had one IPMC
member retire.

We have two new podlings this month, Apache Training and Apache Cava (name
will change). Unomi graduated last month and several podlings are heading
towards graduation in the next few months. There are currently a conversation
on accepting another new podling into the incubator.

BatchEE took a vote to go to Apache Geronimo or TLP and decided on TLP they
have given themselves until June to graduate.

Both of the podlings that failed to report this last month submitted a 
report this month.

Three podlings have not submitted reports and will be asked to report them 
next month.
They are:
- Spot
- Taverna
- Warble

Warble is mostly inactive but has plans to address this.

OpenWhisk failed to get sign off by any mentors and will be asked to
report next month.

There was one IP clearance.

As reported last month we have a problem with unapproved releases. Checking
other podlings showed several that are making unapproved releases or have
branding and trademark issues. Several where contacted and have fixed the 
issue.

ECharts has several issues that are still outstanding but their mentors and
their PPMC are dealing with it.

A podling (Zipkin) went straight to the board with a complaint that the
incubator is unfriendly. (Their first release had a -1 IPMC vote for
including compiled code in a source release and was muddied by further 
comments that were not pertinent to the -1 vote) Since then there has been
number of conversations on private and public lists about this (and other
issues) and it's brought up some old "the incubator is broken" threads.
The IPMC has been given many suggestions for improvement. Some of the
suggestions for incubator change are positive and are likely to show
benefits, some ignore recent improvements in the incubator and refer to how
the incubator was in the past, and a couple seem to have little basis in
fact. Several come from people who are not IPMC members or are not
currently actively involved in the IPMC. The IPMC is reviewing all these
suggestions and will evaluate them and other ideas to see what is possible
to implement in the near future without having a detrimental impact on all
current podlings and mentors.

Some of these discussion about IPMC interference have already had a cooling
effect of voting on releases and a couple of podlings needed to request
help on release voting. One release that was put up for IPMC vote,
seemingly without mentor input, and it contained several significant ASF
policy issues.

There were several discussions about podlings releasing software outside the
ASF (mostly on docker and GitHub) and ways of providing guidance to them to
comply with ASF's legal, release, distribution and trademark policy that
got a little derailed because of the above. It was noticed that GitHub is
publishing release candidates (and in fact any tag) as a release. I believe
Infra has reached out to GitHub to see what can be done to improve this.

  2. Begin to prepare an apache release
  3. Community buidling is going on

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Community is a little shy, some more activities could be occurred in the 
  mail list.

  the correct membership is on the PPMC the podling can finally get some
  community traction.
  I plan to keep a close eye and will ask to officially mentor if needed.
  Von Gosling: community should be encouraged to make more discussion in the

     and users.
  2. Further increase project visibility
  3. Make Crail better consumable / cooperate with other projects on
     Crail integration.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The OSDI'18 paper on Elastic Ephemeral Storage for Serverless
  Analytics (based on Apache Crail) increased projects visibility
  noticeable.
  * We added two blog posts to the projects Apache home page. One
  blog covers the performance of the Crail Python API, another
  efficient shuffle data dis-aggregation via Crail.
  * The @ApacheCrail twitter account has 155 followers. We use it to
  regularly tweet the availability of new blog posts, code releases etc.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Bug fixes for current release.
  * Started evaluation of options for adding fault tolerance/robustness
  to Crail service.
  * Started native C++ implementation of Crail tailored to Machine Learning
  framework integration (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Dave Fisher: DLAB is yet another podling that does not understand that the
             top 3 items to address question is forward looking. The IPMC
             needs to refine the question - English language tenses can be
             subtle. Since MOIN Wiki is going away there is an opportunity
             to do this.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make frequent releases as per Apache guidelines
  2. Grow community
  3. Complete SGA, transfer code to ASF infra

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * PODLINGNAMESEARCH-162 has been completed, but is not reflected on Whimsy

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Project's still being setup. Few new user inquiries, 10+ signups on dev@ 
  ML

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Podling name search has been completed (PODLINGNAMESEARCH-162)
  2. hudi.apache.org site has been published with community guidelines
  3. Hudi Improvement Plan (based off Apache Kafka KIP) under review

Iceberg

Iceberg is a table format for large, slow-moving tabular data.

Iceberg has been incubating since 2018-11-16.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Update build for Apache release, add LICENSE/NOTICE to Jars.
  2. Make the first Apache release.
  (https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg/milestone/1)
  3. Grow the Iceberg community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * No issues that require attention.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * The community has continued to receive new contributors
  * Several contributors are reliable helping review pull requests. Because 
    of these review contributions and the small number of committers, the
    community voted to relax the RTC requirements and allow committers to 
    push their own changes if the community has reviewed the PR. This helps 
    develop reviewers and gets changes in faster. The vote also set reasonable 
    limits for this practice: PRs must be up for at least 2 days and this is only 
    for the first year, while we are working with a small set of committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Podling name search concluded that Iceberg is a suitable name.
    (See PODLINGNAMESEARCH-163)
  * The community voted to accept a large PR with a Python implementation.
  * Contributors are fixing important predicate push-down issues, including
    case sensitivity, filtering on nested types, missing file metrics, etc.
  * Contributors added support for plugging in file stream encryption.

Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together
on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both 
Hadoop
and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. MYRIAD-283: Prepare for 0.3.0 release (Voting right now)
  2. MYRIAD-280: Improve overall stability
  3. MYRIAD-279: Reworking a new UI design

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We need new mentors, we have only one active mentor right now. We have
  to increase the community and we have to increase the number of mentors
  too. The PPMC number is a problem too, we are only two PPMCs/committers,
  so we have problems with the minimum number of votes for consensus.
  https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@myriad.incubator.apache.org/msg02661.html

How has the community developed since the last report?

  An increment of activity and newcomers with a desire to contribute,
  in particular in the scope of the user interface, and at least three
  new users ready for contributing.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  After a few years of inactivity the project is slowly getting activity,
  as a matter of fact we are right now in the voting process of a new
  release apache-myriad-0.3.0-incubating-rc1.

Omid

Omid is a flexible, reliable, high performant and scalable ACID
transactional framework that allows client applications to execute 
transactions
on top of MVCC key/value-based NoSQL datastores (currently Apache HBase) 
providing
Snapshot Isolation guarantees on the accessed data.

Omid has been incubating since 2016-03-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Optimise Omid for the integration with Apache Phoenix.
  2. Document additional features added for the integration with Apache 
  Phoenix, as well as, the low latency algorithm.
  3. Get positive feedback from other projects currently in Apache.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Integration with Apache Phoenix was over, we are currently working on 
  optimisation.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Release 1.0.0 was published and includes all the Phoenix required 
  features.
  2. The Apache Phoenix code that uses Omid was committed and currently 
  Omid serves as Phoenix transaction processor.
  3. We are currently working on a minor release in Omid, 1.0.1, that 
  includes optimization to Omid that inferred from the integration with 
  Phoenix.
  These features mostly improve the performance of Omid, however, some 
  are bug fixes that revealed by the integration with Phoenix while pushing 
  Omid to its corner cases.
  We will start the release process in a few days. Jiras 124 - 135 will 
  be part of the release.

  AFAIK that is the only blocker for graduation.  I've given this feedback to

OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing
platform able to execute application logic (Actions) in response
to events (Triggers) from external sources (Feeds) or HTTP
requests governed by conditional logic (Rules). It provides a
programming environment supported by a REST API-based Command
Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support packaging and
catalog services.  The OpenWhisk platform components are packaged
as Docker containers and can be deployed directly to Docker or
deployed using Container Frameworks such as Mesos, Kubernetes,
Compose, and YARN.

OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. Close legal transfer of trademark on "OpenWhisk" name and
     logo to ASF from IBM.
  2. Complete project maturity model assessment and formal
     graduation process.
  3. Improve release automation. A comprehensive OpenWhisk
     release includes over 20 sub-components, each drawn from its
     own github repo and each packaged as a separately
     downloadable source release.
    a. Release process/automation/documentation are here
       https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-release.
    b. During incubation, we have made over a dozen conforming
       Apache releases of sub-components.  We have developed
       reasonable automation for releasing a group of
       sub-components, but there is a need to further define and
       automate the process of making a unified release of a
       coherent set of released sub-components.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?
  1. Formal hand-off of OpenWhisk trademark/logo from IBM needs to be
     executed; hopefully this will happen at the March ASF Board meeting.
  2. The podling was down to one active mentor for several months,
     which has made getting the required minimum of 3 positive IPMC
     votes for each released component a significant challenge.  This
     had a negative effect on project velocity and PPMC morale.  At
     the time of this report, the IPMC is taking action by soliciting
     additional mentors to help the project finish out its incubation.

How has the community developed since the last report?
  + dev mailing list activity:
      + We have implemented an automated process to post a daily
        archive of the OpenWhisk Team Slack to our dev mailing list.
      + Increased use of the dev list for technical discussion,
        especially around releasing sub-components and ensuring
        awareness of significant PRs before merging.
  + incubator-openwhisk Github stars: 3,825 (+168 since last report)
  + incubator-openwhisk GitHub forks: 738 (+46 since last report)
  + Slack community:

  + The  bi-weekly Zoom "Technical Interchange" continues to be well
  received and attended.
    Complete videos posted to OW YouTube channel and detailed notes to our
    CWIKI.

     3. Rahul (Adobe) - working on some depl. strat.  starting a CWIKI
     post...
     4. Lavanya (Adobe)
     5. Manoj (Adobe) - SW quality engineer

How has the project developed since the last report?
  1. There has been a focus on clearing the backlog of PRs and issues
     across all our github repos, motivated by a desire to make a
     unified release of all the OpenWhisk system sub-components.
     There is still significant work needed to clear out stale issues
     in the core repository, but the PR backlog mentioned in multiple
     previous reports has been rectified.
  2. Project technical highlights include (a) the addition of a .NET
     runtime component, (b) merged support for concurrent activation
     processing, (c) merged support for a "lean" system configuration
     suited for resource-limited hosts, (d) added the capability of
     deploying OpenWhisk on Apache YARN, (e) the unification of the
     `wskdeploy` and `wsk` CLIs into a single `wsk` cli.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
  Alan Gates: One key question for the project is to determine how dependent the
  project is on a single group of contributors. This is a key community resilience 
  factor and should be addressed by the project. This isn't a graduation 
  preventer ... it is, however, very important to solve.

SkyWalking

Skywalking is an APM (application performance monitor), especially for
microservice, Cloud Native and container-based architecture systems. Also
known as a distributed tracing system. It provides an automatic way to
instrument applications: no need to change any of the source code of the
target application; and an collector with an very high efficiency streaming
module.

SkyWalking has been incubating since 2017-12-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. IP clearance. [RESOLVED]
  3. First ASF release. (SkyWalking 5.0) [RESOLVED]
  3. Further ASF culture and processes. [RESOLVED]
  4. 5.x releases are stable for product, and have 5 open end users, at
  least. [RESOLVED]
  5. Support multiple languages agents/SDKs. [RESOLVED]
  6. Integration with other pupolar OSS systems. Zipkin data format
  supported. [RESOLVED]
  7. Clear Brand issues with other ecosystem projects. [RESOLVED]

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Have six Apache releases already. 5.0.0-alpha, 5.0.0-beta, 5.0.0-beta2,
  5.0.0-RC2, 5.0.0-GA, 6.0.0-alpha, 6.0.0-beta, 6.0.0-GA

  There are several related projects and GitHub org in SkyWalking
  ecosystem, before or during project joined the ASF incubator, such as
  .net, node.js and php agents, they were using skywalking-* prefix in
  project name and releases, which may cause brand issue.
  We have fixed these. All skywalking-* have been renamed to skyapm-*, old
  releases with skywalking- removed(maybe not necessary).
  Old existing GitHub orgs, including OpenSkywalking, OpenSkywalkingTest,
  SkywalkingContrib, have been renamed to SkyAPM, SkyAPMTest or
  removed(SkywalkingContrib).

  Another brand related issue is `skywalking` in DockerHub, including some
  binary releases, which have been removed and moved to ASF Infra
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/skywalking-base
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/skywalking-oap-server
  - https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/skywalking-ui
  All of these are only including the approved releases.

  All known brand issues have been addressed and solved. Be good for the
  graduation.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. SkyWalking is working with Envoy community, trying to contribute a new
  service mesh probe.
  2. Lang Li, Yixiong and Jinlin Fu Cao have been voted and joined as
  committer.
  3. Yao Wang and Jian Tan have been voted and joined as PPMC
  4. There are 92 people to contribute codes to our main repo. 18 more than
  the last report.
  5  Over 60 companies have confirmed they are using SkyWalking
  through issue report, our powered-by page or through our ecosystem pages.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There has been over 100 commits by more than 27 contributors in the three
  months.
  In 6.1.0(in developing) release milestones, there are 81 issues and pull
  requests solved.
  SkyWalking 6.0.0-GA is suitable for production.
  In 6.0.0-GA release milestones, there are 134 issues and pull requests

Superset

Superset is an enterprise-ready web application for data exploration, data
visualization and dashboarding.

Superset has been incubating since 2017-05-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. Plan and execute our first Apache release. Since the last report, we 
  have removed  all questionable third party code from the repo, which was a 
  major blocker for the source code release, and are ready to begin the work 
  on the first code release. 
  2. Address remaining project operations issues. See below.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMS) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?
  For project operations, we have made the following progress and need the 
  following support:
  * Held a meeting on December 13 with Mentors, PMC, and Committers to learn 
  more about the Apache way and clarified ways of contributing and 
  collaborating that would uphold the principles. The notes from this meeting 
  were shared on the dev list. 
  * No more unapproved releases. We are working towards our first official 
  release; see above. 
  * Trademark: We continue to have challenges here. Our attempts to complete 
  this task has been unsuccessful and we would appreciate more specific 
  guidance. 

How has the community developed since the last report?
  * Organic growth of our Github contributors (306->343), forks (3974->4300), 
  watchers (1157->1170) and stars (22,097->23,326)

How has the project developed since the last report?
  * Added Christine Chambers as a new committer
  * In general, there has been a healthy, constant flow of bug fixes, quality 
  improvements and new features. Please see project’s commit log on Github 
  for more details. Some highlights:

  New features
  * Refined layout of SQL Lab.
  * Added back-end for tagging system, for organization and discovery of 
  content.
  * Added support for customization of deployments: feature flags, custom 
  logo. 
  * Decoupled visualizations as plugins that can be added/removed. 
  * Omnibar on dashboard page, to enable users to easily switch between 
  dashboards.
  * New deck.gl polygon visualization type that accommodates aggregated 
  spatial types (zip, geohash, etc.)

  Bug fixes, code quality and housekeeping
  * All files now include ASF header.
  * A lighter, more accurate events logger for user interactivities with 
  timing.
  * More translations were added.
  * Sped up build time and tests on Travis CI.
  * Fixed vulnerabilities from dependencies.

     Comments: Podling is continuing to struggle.  I strongly disagree with 
  the notion that this project is ready to graduate or nearing readiness.  It 
  has not executed a release in 2 years, Development activity has definitely 
  increased in the past few months, and with the addition of 2 new committers 
  may see more sustained progress, but we need to ensure that this vitality 
  continues on.

Zipkin

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed
to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures.

Zipkin has been incubating since 2018-08-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finalize the first release of the Apache Zipkin (incubating) for
  Apache Karaf
  2. Migrate other repositories to ASF Github organization
  3. Work towards releasing more Apache Zipkin (incubating) components once
  migration is completed

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The first release was very challenging. The Zipkin community found The
  Apache Incubator established practices to be somewhat hostile and
  unwelcoming for the newcomers. The community felt frustration and 
  demotivation to the the point that the issues had been raised for the
  attention of the board.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A lot of work has been done to get the first release out, by all means
  a great achievement. The team and community is looking forward to see
  the positive changes within Apache Incubator with respect to the
  feedback provided.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The team has mastered the Apache CI/CD infrastructure and was able to
  quickly do the switch over for the first migrated repository. Also, the 
  team better understands how the incubation process works and what to
  watch for.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

## Description:
 The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
 implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
 (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content repository is
  stable, largely feature complete and actively being maintained. Jackrabbit
  Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant hierarchical content
  repository as a modern successor to the Apache Jackrabbit content
  repository. It is targeted for use as the foundation of modern world-class
  web sites and other demanding content applications. In contrast to its
  predecessor, Oak does not implement all optional features from the JSR
  specifications and it is not a reference implementation.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All maintenance
branches and the unstable development branch are continuously seeing moderate
to high activity.

We made our 5th major release of Oak (1.10) in January.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of the work
going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly driven by
dependencies from Oak.

We are currently discussing a new release strategy for Oak. The aim is to
facilitate managing our many branches, releasing of tools and aligning with
Oracle's changes in their release and support model for Java. See
https://s.apache.org/oM0w, https://s.apache.org/0UKO and
https://s.apache.org/tk9u on oak-dev for details.

## Health report:
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all mailing
lists reflecting the activity of the respective component.

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user lists as
well as on the various JIRA issues.

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the JIRA issues
and the desire of the individual contributors to bring the features in for Oak
1.10.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Cassandra Targett]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
- There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
We are actively voting to release Lucene and Solr 8.0. PyLucene 7.7.1 is
also being voted on for release.

Since our last report, we released Lucene and Solr 7.6, 7.7 and 7.7.1, and
PyLucene 7.6.0.

7.7 was released as the final minor release of the 7.x line, in preparation
for releasing 8.0. Lucene 7.7 had some speed improvements for merging
segments with points and support for Unicode 9.0, while Solr 7.7 added a
login screen for the Admin UI (when auth is configured) and the ability to
configure a whitelist for distributed queries.

7.7.1 was a patch release to fix two bugs in Solr deemed critical: one that
impacted 7.6 and 7.7 and another that impacted 7.7 only. No changes were
made in the 7.7.1 release for Lucene.

## PMC changes:
- Jason Gerlowski added on February 20, 2019
- Ignacio Vera added on March 3, 2019

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Shad Storhaug]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

We had stalled in the second half of 2018, with several board members
attempting to reach out to figure out status, and several board reports
missing, there were several calls and questions regarding moving to the attic.

In January 2019 an email to the dev mailing list generated activity, after the
private pmc mailing list seemed to have gone radio silent. There has been
vocal support (reported last month), and we have continued to make some
progress:

* New Website went live: http://lucenenet.apache.org/
* The team is re-looking at our CI options (previously TeamCity, may continue
  with that)
* We're looking at stabiling the current 4.8.0-beta0005 and cutting it as a
  release, and then moving on.

Issues:
* PMC Still seems a little stalled as there isn't much activity at that level
* As previously mentioned we needed a PMC roll call, that was not yet done.

== Releases ==

* Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012
* Working toward 4.8.0 - Currently beta0005, which has been out for some time

== People ==

* Last PMC Member Added, Paul Irwin, October 2013
* Last committer added Sept 2016, Shad Storhaug (nightowl888)
* PMC Chair rotated 20 June 2018 to Shad Storhaug (nightowl888)

== Statistics ==

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Description:

Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute
resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling
fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and
run effectively.

Issues:

The project relies on ReviewBoard almost exclusively for doing
reviews. We've recently learnt that contributors cannot signup to
ReviewBoard anymore because of LDAP integration (which only committers
have access to).

This is a big problem for us and we would like to request that
contributors to the project be given access to signup and use
ReviewBoard. We've already engaged ASF Infra to figure out a solution
but would also ask for help from the Board to resolve it expediently.

Activity:

* MesosCon 2018 was held at SF (Nov 5th-7th) and was a success.

* Project migrated to the gitbox.apache. repository.

* We simplified the process for a contributor to become a committer on
  the project. We are optimistic this will reduce the burden of new
  contributors.

* 3 new committers were added to the project and several minor and
  patch releases have been cut since the last board report.orgnew

* The project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features,
  reviews and releases. The mailing lists, slack and IRC channels are
  also very much active with healthy discussions. Multiple active
  working groups (containerization, performance, API, community).

New committers:

Meng Zhu (2018-10-20), Andrei Budnik (2019-02-26) and Benno Evers
(2019-01-31) have been voted in as new committers / PMC members.

Releases (recent):

1.4.3 was released on Fri Feb 22 2019
1.5.2 was released on Thu Jan 24 2019
1.6.2 was released on Mon Feb 25 2019
1.7.2 was released on Fri Feb 22 2019

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze
   linked objects. The programmer is able to focus on the durable object
   oriented business logic instead of worrying about how to normalize/join,
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    In this period of reporting, 18 of tickets has been created and
    resolved, basically, we have improved our project, completed the
    documenting, upgraded the dependencies, added more test cases and 
    proceeded to support new PMDK memory service. 
    Our community has welcomed gsoc2019 participant to join our project, 
    we guided gsoc2019 participant to get insiged into our project structure,
    memory service to refer to for their ticket and which knowledges need to
    learn to fulfill the ticket.
    Our contributor has completed a test case for old API of Hadoop to 
    verify the functionalities durable object model also works on that API
    Recently, There are no new version Mnemonic released, we continue
    to work on v0.13 that might be released before next report.
    We are also voting a new committer to join our project.

## Description:
Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Highlights:
- Trademarks: we do not have trademark related concerns at the moment and our
  backlog of non-compliant parties is mostly empty [1]
- Releases: no new releases have been published in the last quarter but we
  will probably release 16.11.06 in the next few weeks;
  the stabilization of the new release branches is ongoing but we do not have
  a publication date, yet; however the 17.12 branch is quite stable and the
  community may release 17.12.01 sometime soon; we have also created, at the
  end of December, the new stabilization branch, named 18.12
- source code repository: recently, in the dev list, it was proposed [3] to
  switch the project's repository from SVN to Git; the proposal has triggered
  a lot of community feedback, mostly everyone in favor of moving to Git; we
  expect this switch is something the community will work upon the next months

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Imesha Sudasingha]

## Description:
 - Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for
   the rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components
   for data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management,
   resource management, and data processing.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Last release was 1.2.5 released on Thu Sep 13 2018
 - This has been a very quiet period since no major developments were carried
   out. The 1.9 release is yet to be made, but is on hold due to committers
   being busy to verify the changes made.

## Health report:
 - 1.9 release is yet to be made (though it is 100% ready from dev point of
   view, not verified yet). We hope we will be able to release this in the
   coming period with the new found energy due to GSoC 2019.
 - We are planning to offer 2/3 GSoC projects to attract new contributors to
   the community. These projects are focused on improving OODT UI (named
   OPSUI) and making OODT deployment easy.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe Chiasson]

--- mod_perl --

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since 2016-10.

-- Activity --

This report doesn't have much more to offer than last time around.

I am not sure how to describe the health of this project, it's not unhealthy
in my opinion. Just dormant, missing developers willing to spend time on it.

The project isn't done by any stretch of the imagination, there are still a
lot of things to be implemented, especially since httpd-2.4.

I am aware it's not an ideal situation for an ASF project, but for the time
being, I am not sure what could be concretely be done to address this.

As for specific comments from the board:

The concert about sufficient PMC members available to step in, for instance
in the case of a security issue, I can't be 100% certain here, but I can say
that myself, for one, would make the necessary time and I do read the
mailing-lists daily.

The suggestion to possible join the httpd project, I am not sure what that
would achieve. I think the most difficult issue with finding development
resources is that not only it requires a very good understanding of httpd's
internals *and* Perl's internals. I wouldn't necessarily be against it, but I
am just not convinced it would achieve much.

As for the overall issue of oversight, I've reached directly to the PMC to
see if folks want to speak for themselves and I'll include their responses
either in this report or the next.

Most certainly open to all and any suggestions.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, as usual.

There was some growing interest in seeing some form of support for the event
mpm, but that would be very tricky to implement robustly.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers.

No new changes to the committer base since last report.

Last Commiter addition was Jan Kaluza in April 2013

-- PMC --

Currently 11 PMC members.

No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Last PMC addition was Steve Hay on Wed Feb 29 2012

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Lee Whitcomb]

Description:
Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
Java platform.

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Activity:
Again, very little (almost no) development activity this quarter; combination
of work pressures and ongoing personal challenges. A tiny uptick in dev and
user emails, which still shows some interest. Otherwise no change from
previous quarters. Deprecations in the latest Java versions (esp. Applet and
Nashorn engine) will require serious development efforts to address, thus
some suggestions for different backends.

Health report:
Basically unchanged for several years:  development is ongoing, but users
are quiet.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
 - The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
   software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
   to underlying platform-specific implementations.  There are three
   sub-projects: APR, APR-UTIL and APR-ICONV, of which the first two
   are the main focus of developer interest.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   The project is broadly stable, and there has been little activity.
   Towards the end of the period, it was proposed we push for an
   APR-1.7 release.  This may be hoped for with APR within the
   next reporting period.  An APR-UTIL 1.7 release is likely to
   be further away, as there is more work to be done including some
   substantial backports from trunk.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:
 - Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup search of
   network services.  Services may be implemented in a number of languages,
   while clients are required to be jvm based (presently at least), to allow
   proxy jvm byte code to be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:
 - Answers to board questions: 

idf: It's been a year since the last committer addition. Are there a new prospects?

 - Not at present, due to low activity and the complexity of the unique
   monolithic build system.  We are working to resolve this with a Maven
   modular build structure.

rs: given 12 vs 16 members of PMC and committership roster, is there anything
preventing the remaining 4 committers to consider joining the PMC?

 - There are no blockers, I will ask them to join the PMC.

## Activity:

 -  Minimal activity at present, initial work on the modular build structure
    has commenced.  The current monolithic build is complex, with it's own
    build tool classdepandjar, it adds complexity for new developers. In
    recent months I have had work committments that have limited my ability to
    integrate the modular build.  The other committers are waiting for the
    modular build and I have done a lot of work on this locally, this work has
    been a significant undertaking integrating the works of Dennis Reedy, Dan
    Rollo and myself.  This is also a mature codebase, having been in
    development since the late 1990's.

Release roadmap:

River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&   binary release) River 3.2 - Input
validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling& safe ServiceRegistrar 
lookup service.River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - River is a mature codebase with existing deployments, it was primarily
   designed for dynamic discovery of services on private networks.  IPv4 NAT
   limitations historically prevented the use of River on public networks,
   however the use of IPv6 on public networks removes these limitations.  Web
   services evolved with the publish subscribe model of todays internet, River
   has the potential to dynamically discover services on IPv6 networks, peer
   to peer, blurring current destinctions between client and server, it has
   the potential to address many of the security issues currently experienced
   with IoT and avoid any dependency on the proprietary cloud for "things".

- Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required
     prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and Gadget
     attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only supports IPv4
     multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so authentication can
     occur prior to downloading service proxy's, this addresses a long
     standing security issue with service lookup while significantly improving
     performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal of
     support for insecure cyphers.
   * Secure TLS SocketFactory's for RMI Registry, uses the currently logged in
     Subject for authentication. The RMI Registry still plays a minor role in
     service activation, this allows those who still use the Registry to
     secure it.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses classdepandjar, a
     bytecode dependency analysis build tool.
   * Updating the Jini specifications.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Harbs]

## DESCRIPTION
Apache Royale is a new implementation of the principles of Apache Flex,
designed for JavaScript instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes. Apache Royale
improves developer productivity in creating applications to run wherever
JavaScript runs, including on browsers as well as in Apache Cordova
applications, Node, etc.

## ISSUES
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## RELEASES
- Apache Royale 0.9.2 was released on March 16 2018.
- Apache Royale 0.9.4 was released on November 14 2018.

## ACTIVITY
- No releases this quarter; however, we have started discuss about next
  release. We would like to make the whole process less complex, so there is a
  discussion on the dev list about making one central point where most of the
  steps happen automatically.
- Lots of improvements in one of the core parts of Royale responsible for
  communications with server sites (AMF).
- Lots of progress on a new default look (component set) for Royale apps.
- Lots of progress on migrating large Flex apps to Royale. A new "Flex
  Emulation" component set is being worked on to ease migrations.
- The owner of an ActionScript code base that doesn't use Flex is attempting
  to use the Royale compiler to cross-compile his code to JavaScript.
- There have been a number of blog posts on using Royale. They seem to be
  well-received.
- We are using Disqus for blog comments. It seems to help engagement. We were
  not able to figure out how to get comments sent to the @dev list.
- We had a lot of activity on social networks, sharing what is happening in
  Apache Royale as we progress in the project. We think it is important to do
  this so people outside the project and not following in a daily basis can
  get a notion of how we are doing. The numbers are:
    - Our Twitter account has gained 507 followers since we opened it, and we
      are getting around 30 likes and 10 to 20 retweets when we post
      something, showing interest in what we're doing.
    - Our Facebook page has 116 likes, and we get 10-15 interactions (likes)
      and some comments on each post, showing interest in Apache Royale.
    - We started a LinkedIn Group that 122 people joined almost immediately.
      Groups in LinkedIn tend to be watched by many people who remain silent
      most of the time.
- A contributor was able to migrate an Apache Flex application with success.
  The application, part of a suite is in the process of validation and testing
  and should be put in production for a client in about a month. The current
  version is the app's first iteration since the Flex version, a huge app
  developed over several years. The plan is to continue to migrate other parts
  of the suite in phases as the client requires them.

## COMMUNITY
- Greg Dove was added as committer on October 28, 2018.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for March 2019

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Status and health report:

The project activities, including running of our rule update infrastructure
and our dev and user mailing lists, are continuing smoothly.

We are close to releasing SpamAssassin version 3.4.3, although we missed
releasing it in the last quarter.

We have one mentored project for GSOC 2019, and are still soliciting
proposals.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.2 on 16 September 2018.
We are close to releasing version 3.4.3 to address some issues that were
deferred, in part so we could quickly release security fixes in 3.4.2. After
we release 3.4.3 we expect to resume development in our main branch for 4.0.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Andrea Del Bene]

## Description:

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework.

## Issues:

 - No issues require board attention.

## Activity:

 - After serving for 11 years as VP for Apache Wicket, Martijn Dashorst has
   stepped down from his role. Andrea Del Bene has been elected as new VP. He
   will be in charge for the current year (2019) as we have also decided to
   rotate our chair each year, just like many Apache project already do. We'd
   like to thank Martijn for his long and valuable service and we are happy
   knowing that he will continue to contribute to the project both as
   committer and PMC member.

## Health report:

 - The community is stable as is to be expected from a mature server side Java
   web framework. We don't anticipate a sudden large growth or large decline.

 - Questions to the user list and dev list are answered, resolved and
   discussed.

 - We keep on the look out for new committers and PMC members. The PMC is
   aware that to keep the project healthy new blood is necessary, but are
   realistic that server side Java web frameworks are not the newest and
   hottest technologies at this time.

 -We still working on Wicket 9. We started to collect some features and
  improvments we'd like to implement in the next main version (see
http://apache-wicke  t.1842946.n4.nabble.com/Future-releases-and-random-thoughts-td4681465.html).
  A first RC should see the light in two or three months.

## PMC changes:

 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Maxim Solodovnik on Thu Apr 13 2017

## Mailing list activity:

 - Despite a slight decrease of subscribers, we can see an increase in
   activity not only in downloads, but also on mailinglist activity as well.
   So usage of Wicket seems steady and healthy.

    - 827 subscribers (down -20 in the last 3 months):

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

A couple minor improvements were recently made to the XML Schema 1.1 support,
but otherwise it's been quiet.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 55+ posts on the j-dev and j-users
lists since the beginning of December 2018.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-J
2.12.0 (April 30th, 2018).

Xerces-C

There's been discussion on several JIRA issues since December, but otherwise
no development activity.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 35+ posts on the c-dev and c-users
lists since the beginning of December 2018.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-C
3.2.2 (September 19th, 2018).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity over the
reporting period.

XML Commons

There was a recent question about whether we should have a new XML Commons
release (to be consumed by Xerces-J).

There may have been some bug fixes made that would benefit users, but this
needs some investigation.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in April 2017 (Xerces-C) and May 2017
(Xerces-J).

No new PMC members since the last report. The most recent addition to the PMC
was in June 2016.

One committer has committed changes to SVN since December 2018.

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Allen Wittenauer]


## Description:

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and release
processes for software projects.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We released 0.9.0 and are working towards a 0.10.0 release to fix some
outstanding issues as well as add a few features.

## Health Report:

Since the last board report, the switch to lazy consensus has moved the needle
for the project as far as speed of commits.  No contributions have been
rejected.  To answer the board's question from the last report: there has been
no practical difference between RTC w/lazy consensus and CTR as yet.  However,
we have not done a release yet that compromised mostly LC commits since that
was put in place.

Adoption of/upgrades to 0.9.0 in the ASF remain lower than expected.  This
likely has to do with most of the contribution work being geared towards
non-ASF deployments.

Since the upgrade of the build infrastructure off of builds.apache.org in the
past few months, there has been an uptick of build jobs failing.  Some of us
have been getting queries from Yetus-based ASF projects. No real cycles have
been spent investigating why. Some thinking that the systemd defaults are out
of whack again. With our own (relatively tiny) jobs, rerunning on a different,
much less busy host usually succeeds.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 9 PMC members.
- Akira Ajisaka was added to the PMC on Mon Dec 17 2018

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 12 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Akira Ajisaka at Tue Feb 06 2018

## Releases:

- 0.9.0 was released on Thu Jan 17, 2019

## Mailing list activity:

INFRA made an unannounced change after we had been on Gitbox for a month
causing all Github traffic to head to dev@.  Attempting to get this changed
such that Gitbox emails go to the gitbox@ mailing list instead has been a bit
of a struggle.

- dev@yetus.apache.org:
- 44 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):
- 179 emails sent to list (49 in previous quarter)

- gitbox@yetus.apache.org:
- 5 subscribers (up 5 in the last 3 months)

- notifications@yetus.apache.org:
- 16 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
- 805 emails sent to list (448 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:

0.9.0 closed a lot of long-standing issues, thus getting us a net positive for
this quarter!

- 84 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 99 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months
