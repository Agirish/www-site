 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Acting Chairman [Shane]

       The board and executive officers are gathered this week for our F2F
       meeting to plan strategy and improve our decision-making and
       communications for internal operations.  Along with our 20th
       anniversary, growth in our projects, and many ApacheCon and Roadshow
       events planned for the year, we have a lot of positive things going
       on.

       The board extends an *immense* thank you to Phil Steitz (who recently
       stepped down as Chairman) and Ross Gardler (recently stepped down as
       EVP), and recognize the years of thoughtful service they have
       performed in those and prior roles.  Shane Curcuru, as Vice Chairman,
       will Chair this week's meetings as per our bylaws #6.2.

    B. President [Sam]

       I've posted a draft budget as a discussion item.  I don't think it is
       fair or appropriate to ask for it to be approved at this time.

       My ideal is that we should do the budget in two passes: one a rough
       cut where we identify priorities, and then a second pass where we
       commit to expenses.  That is the basis for the 5 year projection and 1
       year budget rhythm.  This failed for a number of reasons, all of which
       point back to me needing to make the process more clear.

       The key failure was where in previous years we had projected
       significant deficits and that suggested fiscal conservationism in what
       we attempted to do, this time we projected basically a balanced budget
       and large bank balance.  So I requested that people come forward with
       their wish lists, which took longer than expected.  Unfortunately,
       once it arrived the 1 year projection did not line up with the 5 year
       plan: it once again showed a significant deficit.

       Another complicating factor is that my instructions were unclear. Some
       broke out wish list items.  Others included them in their FY20 budget
       requests.  This needs to be sorted out.

       The good news is that we continue to be acting fiscally responsibly,
       and we continue to have a substantial bank balance.  There is no need
       to rush a budget.

       Brand management is seeking review of a downstream distribution
       policy.

       Sponsor Ambassadors are current in Fundraising; working with Virtual
       on business development/growth

       As always, Marketing and Publicity is not only chugging along, but
       providing invaluable assistance in fundraising and conferences

       No issues in infrastructure

       Conferences are doing well

       Travel Assistance has gotten to a late start, but I've chatted with
       Gavin and there should be progress by the board meeting.

        - - -

       Much of the effort this month has surrounded supporting the proposal
       for a Diversity and Inclusion President's committee.  I'm sad to see
       that this contributed to Ross's need to step down.  I'm recommending
       David Nalley as his replacement.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Operating Cash on April 30, 2019 was $2,409.0K, which is down $92.5K
       from last month's ending balance (Mar 19) of $2,501.5K. Total Cash as
       of April 30, 2019 is $3,802.8K (includes the Pineapple and restricted
       Donation) as compared to $2,964.4K on April 30th 2018 (an increase of
       $838.4K year over year). The April 2019 ending Operating cash balance
       of $2,409.0K represents an Operating cash reserve of 16.7 months based
       on the FY19 Cash forecast average monthly spending of $144.5K/month
       (this will most change for FY20, as there was a fair amount of
       budgeted spend in FY19 that has not occurred but may in FY20 as we
       continue to work on the budget). The ASF actual Operating reserve of
       16.7 months at the end of April 2019 is ahead of the budgeted 11.6
       month reserve for YTD through April 2019. The ASF Operating reserve
       continues to be very healthy for an organization of the ASF's size and
       Operating activity.

       Reviewing the YTD Cash P&L, total Revenue is ahead of FY18 by $256.2K.
       As compared to the FY19 Budgeted revenue, we are ahead by $413.4K.

       YTD expenses, through April 30, 2019 are under budget by $162.2K. All
       departments, except for Total Conferences, are under budget, at the
       end of April 2019. Total Conferences is over budget because we put a
       75% down payment on ACEU19 of $229.6K plus VAT of $43.3K. With regards
       to the areas that are under budget, one being Infra, as noted in the
       Board summary is $263.2K under budget due to the timing of hiring of
       staff (though this did change in April 19 as they have hired two new
       staff members, Congrats) and not having to pay any Lease web invoices
       YTD, thank you Fundraising. The other being TAC at $50K under budget
       for FY19.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD FY19 the ASF finished with a positive
       $331.0K NI vs a budgeted negative <$244.5K> NI or $575.5K ahead of
       Budget, NI, for FY19. This is attributable to timing of some Sponsor
       payments as well as more Donations than were budgeted as well as
       underspending in most depts YTD vs the FY19 Budget. In comparison to
       last year, FY19 revenue exceeds FY18's by $256.2K as noted above;
       similarly, expenses exceed last year's by $483.1K. Thus, year over
       year NI for FY19 is behind FY18 by $226.9K.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. ComDev supports formation of D&I committee

       The ComDev PMC hereby requests that the board create a President's
       committee tasked with supporting our communities in their efforts to
       be diverse and welcoming places, and tasked with helping the ASF
       formulate a strategy to improve our diversity and inclusiveness.  The
       ComDev PMC likewise formally requests that the new committee look for
       ways in which ComDev can support our progress in these areas.

    C. Appoint new EVP

       With Ross's recent resignation, we have a vacancy to fill.  Ross has
       recommended Bertrand Delacretaz for the role, and Sam has recommended
       David Nalley.

       David Nalley was appointed to EVP by general consent.

    D. Statement of Expectation of Conduct of Board Members

       Discuss, adopt and publish text akin to the following:

       Board members are held to a much higher standard than regular ASF
       members or VPs. This includes strict hat wearing, equitable decision
       making, and exemplary conduct. People look to the Board of Directors
       for cues about how to behave, especially on mailing lists and in
       public. It is important that all Directors understand the
       responsibility that they bear, and that they are individually
       committed to improving themselves and the Foundation.

       This could be considered to be extended to the Officers of the
       Foundation as well.

       @Tom: research what other nonprofits do for CoCs for boards

       This discussion item was tabled.

    E. Publishing of vote records

       Discuss whether the full voting record (of who votes Yes/Abstain/No)
       on each Board vote should or needs to be published publicly.

       If not, discuss whether the full voting record (of who votes
       Yes/Abstain/No) on each Board vote should be published internally,
       confidentially, for any Member to review.

       @Daniel: begin a discussion on the lists about this

    F. Convention of semantics of Board votes

       Discuss the semantics of a Director voting Yes, Abstain or No on any
       given item. Attempt to reach consensus on what these votes mean, with
       specific reference as to whether or not the expectation is that all
       Board votes should be unanimous or not.

       @Roman: create a framework of vote meanings

       Topic was tabled.

    G. Address board-level public communications

       In the past few weeks we have had a series of discussions at the board
       and membership level that have been viewed as non-productive and
       potentially harmful to the effectiveness of how ASF conducts its daily
       business. While, when viewed in historic context, this may not be a
       new pattern it seems it has reached the severity that requires us to
       have an active discussion at the board level.

       This item captures this need for discussion in the hopes that we
       can map out a plan for a plan and present it at the next board
       meeting.

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Mark Thomas]



* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

Feedback on the draft downstream distribution policy welcome. It is
essentially trying to document the status quo rather than set new policy.


* OPERATIONS

Covering the period April 2019

Responded to the following queries, liaising with projects as required:
- 3 enquiries about using logos (APACHE,CASSANDRA, KAFKA)
- 1 enquiry about using a derivative logo (HADOOP/SPARK)
- approved 1 podling name (DATASKETCHES)
- 1 enquiry about merchandise (BIG DATA)
- 2 enquiries about screenshots (NETBEANS, HTTPD)
- approved 2 3rd party events (HBaseCon Asia, BEAM summits)
- 1 enquiry about a non-ASF product
- 1 enquiry about use of an ASF mark in a unrelated, non-software use
  (SPARK)

Pinged several PMCs regarding outstanding issues.

A draft policy was produced for use of our marks by downstream
distributions:
http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/downstream.html


* REGISTRATIONS

- BROOKLYN have made the website changes and provided the information
  necessary for their registration to proceed

- APACHE IGNITE has been provisionally refused in China due to a little
  known usage of "apache". We are working with counsel to appeal this.

- We have received the paperwork to transfer the OPENWHISK marks. This
  needs to be completed and sent to counsel.


* INFRINGEMENTS


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Daniel Ruggeri]

Fundraising continues securing sponsorship renewals and are working with
Virtual closely on invoicing and following through with sponsor payment. We
were also able to renew AND upgrade a Sponsor whose account was in arrears for
6 months. As with our prior report, our Sponsor Ambassadors are
"current" on communications and check-ins.

We continue working to consolidate terms of combined (ASF + Targeted) Platinum
sponsorship; steady progress has been made over the past quarter.

As with the prior report, onboarding of a Targeted Platinum Sponsor remains on
hold pending legal clearance.

A potentially worrisome situation continues to present itself where we have
problems with email deliverability when reaching a sponsor in China. We have
had to resort to using our private emails to send messages (copying
@apache.org lists) until the issue is resolved. Infra is aware of the
 situation.

We have closed 22 event sponsor opportunities (with 12 organizations) and 2
media partnerships across Apache Roadshow/Chicago (1), ApacheCon/Las Vegas
(19), and ApacheCon/Berlin (2). Sponsor agreements have successfully been
 signed using our new Docusign account; we are waiting for final confirmation
 from 5 additional companies to enter contracts.

To that end, the digital sponsorship agreement process investment has helped
simplify the acts of creating/sending/signing/gathering completed event
agreements. Through this process change, we've witnessed a decrease in
volunteer time spent doing such clerical work.

Although we've had a slow start, we are working closely with Virtual‚Äôs
business development/growth team on targeting, qualifying, and pitching
candidate sponsors for both events and the foundation.

We're pleased to report that we received $4,927+ from individual donors via
Hopsie (PLUS additional payments received from PayPal and Amazon
independently) this past month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - May 2019

I. Budget: we have kicked off the new fiscal year with no vendor issues (all
payments are on schedule), and are standing by to answer any questions related
to the proposed FY2020 budget and projections through FY2024.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally Khudairi continues to support ASF
Fundraising with engaging existing sponsors, securing sponsorship renewals,
and signing on new sponsors; the team at Virtual have been very responsive in
ensuring timely invoicing and follow through. Assistance to ASF Conferences is
ongoing, through planning, sponsorships, marketing and creative, PR and
promotion, and a variety of supporting tactics for Apache Roadshow/Chicago,
ApacheCon/Las Vegas, and ApacheCon/Berlin. Sally closed 20 of 22 event sponsor
opportunities, and has secured a second media partnership to help promote all
three events. We are editing two "Success at Apache" posts, as well as a new
"Project Perspectives" post (highlighting how The Apache Way helps Apache
projects and their communities). Sally will attend the ASF Board face-to-face
meeting in May.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during this

   Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: 11 items were published on the ASF "Foundation"
Blog, and 1 item was published on the ApacheCon Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups
were issued, with a total of 251 weekly summaries published to date. We
tweeted 90 items to 53.3K followers on Twitter. We posted 26 items on
LinkedIn, which garnered more than 129.5K organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: 1 announcement is in development. Projects planning
to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are requested to
contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 7 media queries. The ASF received 1,854
press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,891. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 3,130 press hits vs. last month's 3,510. ApacheCon received 8
press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 2 analyst queries. Apache was mentioned in
3 reports by Gartner; 2 report by Forrester; 3 reports by 451 Research; and 6
reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: whilst no new programs are planned, Sally continues to create
all promotional graphics for use in social media to promote the ASF and
ApacheCon.

IX. Events liaison: we have been providing considerable support to all Apache
events, most actively the Apache Roadshow/Chicago, from marketing/promotion to
sponsorship sales to badges/lanyard production. Work continues with Virtual
and newthinking/Plain Schwarz on various advisory and tactical support across
ApacheCon/Las Vegas and Berlin. We posted 8 items on the ASF Events and Apache
Roadshow/Chicago pages on LinkedIn, tweeted 73 items on the ApacheCon Twitter
account, and created all promotional graphics, animations, and digital ad
campagins. Sally continues to work closely with ASF VP Conferences Rich Bowen,
and will be meeting during the face-to-face Board Meeting to discuss plans and
goals through FY2020. She is also planning the redesign of the apachecon.com
site.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 7 pre-paid press releases with GlobeNewswire
through December 2020.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
======= 
Infrastructure is operating as expected. No issues that
currently need escalation to the President or Board.

Finances
======== 
Infrastructure closed out well within budget for FY19
Proposed budget has been submitted to the office of President
for review at the upcoming Board meeting.

CDN Evaluation
============== 
As our communities grow, particularly beyond North
America and Western Europe, we're seeing more calls to
have greater geographic diversity in a number of our
services, simply to reduce wait time. Following our
team meeting in New Orleans, we've been working on
evaluating several different CDN options. Two projects,
both with significant Asian participation have been
assisting us in this evaluation, with their project
websites being moved to a CDN, and thus far the
feedback has been positive. Much more testing and
evaluation will happen before we arrive at a decision
on whether to proceed or in what direction.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Test and migrate to the new email setup ("hermes-vm2").
- Turn off mail-archives.a.o and mail-private.a.o, in favor of
  lists.a.o, leaving behind a redirect system for permalinks.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon North America

The CFP has closed. However, due to the inevitable outpouring of "You
closed it too soon" emails, I have silently extended the CFP by 48
hours, since I simply do not have time to handle the influx of people
sending me their proposals via email.

As of this writing, we have 313 proposals, plus 6 spam submissions
which I have already rejected. Additionally, several of the
project/community/topic tracks are actively soliciting and curating
content for their tracks.

We expect to announce the schedule by June 3rd, if all the stars align
and the review process goes smoothly.

ApacheCon Europe

ApacheCon EU has had a quiet month.  The CfP is going well, we
currently have 45 submissions even though we're well ahead of the
deadline.  If that is a good indicator we will have plenty of ticket
sales.  Ticket sales are within normal parameters.

We've begun working out details of the Friday conference extension in
Berlin.  We have one workshop already offered for the extension.

Chicago Roadshow

As of this writing, the roashow is currently underway. By the time of
the meeting it will be complete. We expect to have more to report on
the day of the meeting.

LATE ADDITION: Attendance was around 100. Talks were great. Look for a
more thorough report next month.

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

Events
---------

This monrh sees us opening up of applications for ApacheCon NA. Next month
applications will also open for ApacheCon EU

for NA , we should be open within 24 hours of writing.

Also for NA we have an extra $5K targeted pot of money to get a couple or 3
folks from a specific background, which requires us to ask a couple of extra
questions on our application form to gather the required info. The questions
are personal but will be 'optional' to answer.

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Roman Shaposhnik]

For the past months we've had a regular amount of usual requests flowing
through LEGAL JIRA and legal-discuss. Hen and the rest of the volunteers took
good care of resolving most of these in time.
(we're down 4, from 24 to 20, open issues this month).

Thanks to Hen we're closing the loop on rationalizing our mailing lists
infrastructure and are about to create our P&C list.

We're at the final stretch with reviewing JetBrains sponsorship agreement and
should have a final signoff from DLA Piper by the end of this week.

Jakarta VP discussion is going on and when the VP Jakarta role is created
whoever ends up in that role will be signing the agreement with Eclipse
Foundation.

We started to evaluate additional options for counsel to augment the work of
DLA Piper. We expect to have an update on this in a month or two. Mishi
Choudhary from SFLC is looking into refreshing the relationship with us.

We had Facebook and Uber reach out to us for help with detailed understanding
of our licensing practices. The meetings are being set up and we will report
back on the result.

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Continued work on incoming security issues, keeping projects reminded
of outstanding issues, and general oversight and advice.  There are
continuing issues with Mitre taking several weeks to update the CVE
database for some issues.

The Zeppelin project continued to not deal with outstanding security
issues despite numerous contact attempts and even a board escalation.
The issues had already been fixed in their code base for some time,
but the process to notify users via a security advisory and publish
the CVE names had not been completed.  After a final warning, the
Security Team Project therefore took the unfortunate step of
publishing the details on their behalf:
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/04/23/1

Stats for April 2019:

      8          [license confusion]
      15         [support request/question not security notification]

      Security reports: 29 (last months: 39, 35, 38)

        6       [httpd]
        4       [lucene]
        3       [site]
        2       [pdfbox], [shiro], [tomcat]
        1       [atlas], [commons], [fineract], [hadoop], [hive],
                [jspwiki], [kafka], [ofbiz], [struts],
                [trafficserver]

     In total, as of 1st May 2019, we're tracking 65 (last month:
     84) open issues across 35 projects, median age 82 (last month:
     66) days.  44 of those issues have CVE names assigned.

     8 (last month: 12) of these issues, across 5 projects, are older
     than 365 days.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 11: Report from the VP of Data Privacy  [John Kinsella]

Working on setting up structure for data-privacy. Modified
personnel-duties/vp-data-privacy.txt, will update further once mailing lists
are set up. Stalled on setting up mailing lists as I was going to start
conversation on legal ML first, but just going to create lists and run with
it.

Working on syncing up with others who have worked on data-privacy matters over
the last year and talked to counsel. Once that's accomplished, will stat work
to review data privacy policy and engage with projects looking for assistance.

Stats for April, 2019:
 * 2 open Jira tickets
 * 0 closed issues

## Description:
 - Apache Brooklyn is a software framework for modelling, monitoring and
   managing cloud applications through autonomic blueprints.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Health report:
 - The project continues with a regular turnover of pull requests and commits.
 - We continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
   members with the aim of regularly adding individuals (see "PMC Changes").
 - It has been nearly six months since our M1 release. While preparing for

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that‚Äôs simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that‚Äôs a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity:

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues:

## Activity:
We were accepted as Google Season of Docs participants. We have already
received four inbounds from potential documentation writers even though the
program has not officially begun.

Additionally, we have expanded our ApacheCon request to a two day track. The
first day will be our developer centric conference known as Next Generation
Cassandra Conference (NGCC). The second day will be a general-purpose
sponsorship. We have already attracted a pair of sponsors and received some
high-quality submissions from some of our largest users for both days of the
conference.

## Health report:
We are continue to track and prioritize issues as we approach 4.0:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/4.0%3A+Open+Issues+by+Component

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [C√©dric Damioli]

## Description:
Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

Last quarter report and board's heads up from the previous one gave us the
opportunity to work on a few issues. All pending activity seems now to have
been resolved. Following recent discussions on private list, we now have to
decide what to do with our several branches.

The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14

A few JIRA issues opened or resolved since last report, but more than previous
quarters. A little activity on both users and dev mailing-lists, even if still
at a low level. The project is mainly in maintenance mode.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

## Description:
 - The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
   involved with Apache Projects

## Issues:
 - No issues require board attention at the moment

## Activity:
 - GSoC: The ASF was selected to be a mentor organisation for GSoC. As usual
   the co-ordintation and mentor registration is being managed by ComDev. We
   have received a lot of ideas and are currently in the final stages of
   finalising the list of projects and students.

- Season of Docs: After some discussion on the mailing list we applied on
  behalf of some of our projects to be a mentoring organisation for the new
  Season of Docs program but unfortunately were not selected. Two other ASF
  projects Apache Cassandra and Apache Airflow were successful in being
  accepted and allocated a technical writer.

- Events:- We have requested feedback on the events that the community would
  like us to participate in for 2019. The next step is to finalise it, and
  then plan our participation.

- Diversity:- Diversity and inclusion has been a key topic this quarter with
  several discussions being raised on several aspects. One suggestion is to
  separate out these efforts into a focussed group that can co-ordinate
  activities.

- Community Tracks at Apachecon :-We are hoping to fill three days of
  community related content at ApacheCon NA, Las Vegas and two days of
  community related content at ApacheCon EU, Berlin. Several reminders have
  been sent to the community highlighting the range of areas that we would be
  keen to see covered. We have also requested volunteers from the community to
  help review the CFP proposals that have been submitted.

## Health report:
 -  We have a very active mailing this yet may be missing out of ways to
    promote and communicate all the things that are happening. This is the
    third quarter where our monthly blog has slipped.

## Mailing list activity:

 - Mailing list traffic has increased this quarter with a lot of active
   discussions around potential diversity initiatives and also ways to improve
   understanding of meritocracy and the Apache Way.

 - dev@community.apache.org:
    - 890 subscribers (up 4 in the last 3 months):
    - 799 emails sent to list (404 in previous quarter)

 - Seamless multi-master sync, that scales from Big Data to Mobile,
  with an Intuitive HTTP/JSON API and designed for Reliability.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Technical discussion for the move to FoundationDB outlined in the
   last report is ongoing and fruitful.

   release lines.
 - We are getting close to fully supporting arm64, specifically with pre-built
   binaries and CI coverage.
   
## Health report:

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description:
 - Apache Crunch is a JVM library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
   and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Most of the work this quarter focused on integrations with Hadoop's
   FileSystem extensions to better support reading/writing pipeline data
   from/to various object stores (mainly S3.)

## Health report:
 - The project's current work is focused on the needs of community members who
   are moving MapReduce-based pipelines that ran in legacy clusters to various
   cloud-based Hadoop clusters, and makes sense given Hadoop's general focus
   on this area as well.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Micah Whitacre on Wed Apr 02 2014

Attachment M: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description:
 Apache DeltaSpike is  a suite of portable CDI (Contexts & Dependency
 Injection) extensions intended to make application development easier when
 working with CDI and Java EE.  Some of its key features include:

 - A core runtime that supports component configuration, type safe messaging
   and internationalization, and exception handling.
 - A suite of utilities to make programmatic bean lookup easier.
 - A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans
   outside of a container.
 - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
 - JPA integration and transaction support.
 - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.
 - Quartz integration

 Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
 your CDI enabled projects.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
 Activity was still rather low. DeltaSpike is mature and an important
 building block for many enterprise projects. But nothing to worry 
   
## Health report: 
 Since jakartaEE must not evolve the javax.* namespace we will probably
 ship a jakarta.* version of DeltaSpike in parallel rather soonish.

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for
efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of
log data to scalable data storage systems such as
Apache Hadoop's HDFS.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - a few minor contributions were merged this month such as bug fixes and

Attachment S: Report from the Apache FreeMarker Project  [D√°niel D√©k√°ny]

## Description:

Apache FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text
output based on templates. Apache FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class
library for programmers.

FreeMarker 2 (the current stable line) produces releases since 2002. The
FreeMarker project has joined the ASF in 2015, and graduated from the
Incubator in early 2018.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Activity was very low in the last 3 months. As a consequence, the release of
the micro version (2.3.29), initially planned for February, has been delayed.

## Health report:

Activity is low but steady, as it's usual for this project. User questions
(mostly on StackOverflow) and new Jira issues are being answered promptly. The
short term goal is to release the next micro version (2.3.29) as soon as
possible. The long term goal is continuing the ongoing development on the 3.0
branch, so that the project can innovate and the code base can become much
cleaner and more attractive for new committers.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 7 PMC members.
 - No changes since the graduation on 2018-03-21

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 7 committers.

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Paul King]

## Description:

 - Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java
   platform. Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language,
   with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying
   developers‚Äô productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn
   syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately
   delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting
   capabilities, Domain-Specific Language authoring, first class functional
   programming support and runtime and compile-time meta-programming.

## Issues:

 - Outstanding issue: Website: some more progress has been made
   in the last quarter but this task is not quite finished - work will continue.
 - Update on open collective: the open collective crowd funding site[1]
   mentioned in the previous report has now been set up. So far all is
   operating well. We received positive feedback from within The ASF on
   how it was set up. The open collective has also received good support
   within the broader Groovy community. We will continue to monitor the
   collective to ensure branding guidelines etc. are maintained.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
  The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
  open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX
  and Windows. The goal of this project is to provide a secure,
  efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync
  with the current HTTP standards.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - The Apache HTTP Server 2.4.39 was released in March, including four
   important and three low severity CVEs. I would like to thank the
   security team for handling this in a diligent manner. A lot of work
   has also been done on various sub-modules of the project, including
   but not limited to; http2, ssl and proxying.
   
 - A thorough discussion on keep-alives in 304 responses was also
   started, and is still ongoing[1].
   
 - Members of the project have expressed an interest in revisiting the
   older parts of our BugZilla backlog for the purpose of cleaning up
   issues that are either stale or have been fixed/mitigated, as well
   as improving the overall state of tickets, so as to attract new
   people and ideas.
   
 [1] https://s.apache.org/2uyB
   
## Health report: 
 This quarter saw activity from 23 different committers, a very good
 number, 43% higher than last quarter, as well as a substantial
 increase in commits (258, up 45%) and changes. While no-one was elected
 in as new committers in this quarter, it is safe to say that we have
 a healthy and diverse community that produces changes, fixes and
 enhancements on a very stable basis. Retention-wise, we have had
 seven people (re)join the project this past quarter, which is a very
 good number - we need to go back to 2014 to see a higher quarterly
 uptick on that front. That no-one new joined the committer base
 obviously means these people were previously engaged in httpd, which
 is just as much a delight. We welcome them back with open arms.
 Bus/Pony/Elephant-wise, we remain at a Pony Factor[1] of 5, meaning
 around five people make up half of the new commits around here. For a
 project of our size, age and pace, this is a pretty good number,
 considering this tracks committers and not necessarily authors of
 commits. For reference, the Pony Factor of httpd has been 5 or 6 for
 the past 8 years, so nothing has really changed there.
 
 On a slightly more "extra-curricular" note, I did a little research in
 relation to some enhancements I developed for the Apache Kibble
 project, and plotted httpd's "punch cards" (commits across the hours of
 the week) for the past 18 years[2]. Touching on the diversity aspect of
 community health, we have seen a clear move from a US-centric project
 community to a more wide-spread committer base, now favoring the
 European and African continents (if we assume that we can roughly
 correlate a commit timestamp with a timezone through basic knowledge
 about when people are awake and asleep - this isn't always true of
 committers!). While not an exact science, as we do not store a whole
 lot of information about our committers, it is nice to see that the
 neutrality and governance of the ASF may have caused a natural shift
 towards a new group of core committers that help keep the httpd project
 alive and vibrant.
 
 Looking at the larger community, things have also been pretty steady,
 with a stable trend on the development mailing list, and a slight
 uptick in traffic on our users list (20% more topics discussed than
 in previous quarter). Numerical stats to follow in the mailing list
 paragraph.

 It should also be noted, that we have more than plenty of oversight
 in the PMC, with around 20 active PMC members involved in the 
 project discussions over the past quarter.

## Bugzilla Statistics: 
   There are currently 1075 open tickets, many of which - as stated
   in the previous activity paragraph - are either stale or no longer
   an issue. In our last cleanup session, we removed 700 tickets from
   the queue, and could likely halve our backlog if we did another
   cleanup session or hackathon, perhaps at an ApacheCon.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Impala Project  [Jim Apple]

## Description:

Impala is a high-performance distributed SQL engine.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity and health report:

The previous three months had 237 patches to the master branch, while this
three-month period had 286. This is likely the recovery from the usual
seasonal dip around the end of each calendar year.

Prominent work in the last three months includes:

 - An admission controller debugging page

 - Thousands of lines of new planner tests

 - A number of improvements to the shell scripts used to build and to start
   the various daemons

 - A few patches that reduced the disk space needed for development by tens of
   gigabytes

 - Support for development on Ubuntu 18.04.

 - Support for Apache Ranger and decoupling Apache Sentry

 - Support for complex types in ORC files

 - Better hardware detection

 - Compatibility with Hive 3.x for data loading and the Metastore

 - Numerous improvements to metrics and counters

 - Continued work on supporting Docker in development environments and in
   production

 - Initial support for a timeless DATE type

Health is a subjective metric, but the increased compatibility with other open
source and Apache projects is a good sign, as is the nine new patch authors.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 29 PMC members.
 - Quanlong Huang was added to the PMC on Sun Mar 10 2019

## Committer base changes:

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Justin Mclean]

Incubator PMC report for May 2019

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 50 podlings incubating. During the month of April,
podlings executed 10 distinct releases. We added two new IPMC members
and no IPMC members retired.

We have no new podlings this month. Three projects graduated last month 
namely PLC4X, SkyWalking and Netbeans and several other podlings are 
heading towards graduation in the next few months.

One of the podlings that failed to report last month, Milagro failed to
report again this month and the IPMC will discuss what to do. This is the 
not first time this project has failed to report and it may not have a
working PPMC.

Two podlings Milagro and Toree have not submitted reports and will be asked
to report next month.

There were two IP clearances.

The new Podling clutch page is working well and documentation has been 
created clearly explains what information is collected from where.

The incubator is providing a new service to podlings to provide feedback on
releases. So far no podlings have taken up this service. 

Mentors are being actively encouraged to vote on their podling releases so
that the VOTEs show up on the general@ list with 3 +1 IPMC votes. While a 
couple of podlings have managed to do this, most still need extra votes by 
IPMC members outside their projects. The IPMC will need to look further
into this.

In a couple of cases, podlings canceled vote too early and were encouraged
to continue voting.

Incubator wiki is being deprecated, and it's been migrated to confluence. 
Some of the pages were missed in the transfer and infra are looking into 
why.

The new wiki space has been reorganised and the pages categorised for easier
navigation. A few minor issues have been encountered e.g. confluence 
ignoring formatting but have been addressed. A few people have had permission
issues and because of this move mentor sign-off is a little lower than normal. 

The reorganisation and cleanup of incubator web pages started last month 
continues on.

brpc

brpc is an industrial-grade RPC framework for building reliable and 
high-performance services.

brpc has been incubating since 2018-11-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:
  1. We begin to prepare an apache release, including prepare for unified 
  License/Copyright, clean dependencies.
  2. We depend on npsr‚Äô time, it is MPL/LGPL license, we need to find 
  another lib for it.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware 
of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Added two potential committers, they are huwenwei and wangweibing ,
  they will participate in the work of first apache release , and take some 
  tasks already.  .

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There are many bugfix into the trunk.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  Still in early stage

DataSketches

DataSketches is an open source, high-performance library of stochastic
streaming algorithms commonly called "sketches" in the data sciences. 
Sketches
are small, stateful programs that process massive data as a stream and can
provide approximate answers, with mathematical guarantees, to 
computationally
difficult queries orders-of-magnitude faster than traditional, exact 
methods.

DataSketches has been incubating since 2019-03-30.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Finish IP Assignments
  2. Code Migration
  3. Perform a Release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have the key committers signed up. We are all learning how
  to navigate in the Apache environment and how to find things.

ECharts

ECharts is a charting and data visualization library written in JavaScript.

ECharts has been incubating since 2018-01-18.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Apache domain name should be used for the Website. 
  echartsjs.com and echarts.baidu.com should redirect to 
  echarts.apache.org. 
  Currently they are not redirecting due to slow loading time in China. 
  We are working on with a CDN to improve the loading time in China.
  2. Website Analytics information should be accessed by PPMC members.
  We are going to create an Analytics account that can be accessed by PPMC 
  members.
  3. Develop more committers from the community.
  Currently there are some contributors in the community that have 
  contributed continuously and should be considered as new committers.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
  We haven't come to a conclusion whether we could use Baidu Tongji in the 
  Website, 
  which is a product quiet similar to Google Analytics.
  We've consulted John Kinsella <jlkinsel@gmail.com> as our mentor 
  suggested, but got no reply. See 
  https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/efa62d1ace0cc27f7ee4e47df94c346e863b6419f1d1e3ea6fe32c10@%3Cdev.echarts.apache.org%3E
  My suggestion is to use both Baidu Tongji and Google Analytics. The 
  reason is that Baitu Tongji has only Chinese UI, while Google Analytics
  may have the potential of losing some data in China since many Google products
  are not accessible in China.
  If IPMC and ASF Board are OK with it, we will start a vote for the plan.

How has the community developed since the last report?
  We have announced our first new committer from the community.
  More people come to contribute in the community, in the forms of code 
  changes, document mending, and so on.

How has the project developed since the last report?
  We released v4.2.1.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

Edgent

Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime
that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Re-creating a working community
  2. Re-populating the PPMC
  3. Replenishing the group of mentors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  For the past months, there has been very few activity in the project
  There have been a hand full of Emails from external peoples in the
  last 3 months but the activity in the project has been solely by me
  (Julian) and Christofer Dutz writing emails without getting any form
  of response from the rest of the committers, PPMCs or mentors

  Julian held a Talk on the conference buildingiot 2019 with very positive
  response and we have an Edgent Meetup on May, 6. Where we hope to see 
  some new faces.

  The main problem we have is that the only active people in the project
  came in Late and are not that firm with the codebase. Currently, we
  have a codebase for which we have a detailed understanding of the build,
  but almost none of the code itself. Furthermore, there has been a lot of
  activity in other projects and generally edge processing has developed
  further in the recent years.
  Thus, there is some discussion going on about the core or the aim of the 
  project to keep its significance and uniqueness.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Total, we have 82 subscribers to our mailing list, an increase of 5
  since the last report.
  * There has been one questions asked by users and little
  discussions about these issues on the list
  * On April, 4th, Julian Feinauer has Talked about Edgent on the building
  iot 2019
  * On May, 6th, a Edgent Meetup is planned in Frankfurt

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * According to JIRA, 0 new issue were added and none were resolved in
  the last 90 days

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  After the withdrawal of most of the active committers and PPCM members
  currently a new committer, PPMC and mentor-base has to be built.
  Currently we try to re-gain the focus of edgent to
  Start to rebuild the community and resume development.

  I just double checked, but it seems our mentors are not existent
  there had been one or two issues where feedback was explicitly

  Except Justin mentioning the absence of mentors. Christofer Dutz
  joined as new Mentor and is active in the project.

PageSpeed

PageSpeed represents a series of open source technologies to help
make the web faster by rewriting web pages to reduce latency and
bandwidth.

PageSpeed has been incubating since 2017-09-30.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Get the project site in order
  2. Start releasing
  3. Engage more active developers, expanding the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The number of active developers is low, we are still working
  to follow up on the recommendation to create a release.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - A first draft-release is being manually checked for policy compliance.

  to be able to raise a thread on general soon to discuss/vote.
  - There has been some discussion how to get the project site in-order,

Training

The Training project aims to develop resources which can be used for 
training purposes in various media formats, languages and for various 
Apache and non-Apache target projects. 

Training has been incubating since 2019-02-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Agree upon underlying technology stack and architecture for training 
  content
  2. Develop first training topic contents
  3. Set up our contribution process

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  - no critical issues at this point in time

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - The project has been set up recently, so there is an initial 
  activation/development towards a community.
  - The dev mailing list is active. The total number of posts in March was 
  160 and in April 140
  - Total number of subscribers is 32 (25 in March)

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - The scope of the project deliverables and core procedures are still 
  under discussion (e.g. what makes a release?)
  - We have had our first few commits. They were for infrastructure (e.g. 
  website) and repository structure
  - We have been approached by a few more people wanting to donate content 
  and we hope to be able to accept it soon
  - We actually have the first issue for an actual content donation (Apache 
  Way, ZooKeeper and Git) and hope to have it included soon, the first ones 
  will probably be slow while we work on processes and best practices

blockchain and other decentralised software in Java and other JVM languages.

Apache Tuweni has been incubating since 2019-03-25.

Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:

  1. Grow the community;
  2. Have the works of the project comply with legal requirements of the 
  ASF;
  3. Consistently releasing products;

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Currently there are no issues that require the involvement of either the
  Incubator PMC or the ASF board.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  As this is the first full month of the project incubating the development
  of the community has been low.

  The project started out with onboarding all parties showing interest
  at the pre-incubation discussions in general@incubator.a.o.

  The project consists of a healthy number of mentors and committers/PPMC
  Members.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  All required INFRA services have been put in play to have the community
  collaborate.

  The project is working on getting more body to the whole set of

   updating SCOUT.
 - SCOUT - last release 10 DEC 2018. Resolved several bugs and dependencies.

## Health report:

 - Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in
   all likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.
 - There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to
   potential security issues. There were no issues raised since the last
   report.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for efficiently storing and
processing a large number of records in real time.

Development

We released 2.2.0 which includes new features such as separate control and
data planes, re-authentication in SASL, better fencing with broker epoch, more
functionalities in KStreams, etc.

We also released 2.1.1, which fixes more than 30 issues.

We are actively working on new features such as incremental client
rebalancing, MirrorMaker 2.0, improvements in KStreams and AdminClient, etc.

Community

Lots of activities in the mailing list. We have 2806 subscribers in the user
mailing list, about the same as in the last 3 months. We have 624 emails in
the user mailing list in the last 3 months, about the same as in the previous
cycle. We have 1305 subscribers in the dev mailing list, about the same as in
the last 3 months. We have 2152 emails in the dev mailing list in the last 3
months, more than the 1947 in the previous cycle.

We added one new committer Randall Hauch on Feb. 14, 2019. We added two new
PMC members Sriharsh Chintalapan and Matthias J. Sax on Apr. 18, 2019. We also
elected a third new PMC member. Unfortunately, that person declined the
invitation due to shifted focus.

Kafka Summit New York completed on Apr. 2, 2019, with more than 700
participants.

Confluent published two public guidelines on respecting ASF policies.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

Apache Kibble is a suite of tools for collecting, aggregating and visualizing
activity in software projects. http://kibble.apache.org/

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity and Health

The was an uptick in traffic on the issues list - 16 emails sent to list (0 in
previous quarter) - reflecting new activity from new contributors. However, we
still remain in a situation where almost all code is from one contributor,
which is a continuing source of concern.

We continue to engage with other metrics agencies, with CHAOSS being at the
top of that list. But this has not yet, so far, mapped into much actual new
activity.

We have had requests to add new sources to Kibble, which shows that new users
from within Apache are becoming interested in understanding and using the
stats that we provide. Most recently, we added Tuweni. And we have engaged
with the dev lists of these projects to let them know that they've been added,
in the hopes of receiving further feedback from those communities.

To answer questions from last report:

     On the "finding more people interested in the project" and
     "research on the topic" part - are you aware of the work being done at
      https://osr.cs.fau.de/people/ (I just recently came across several
      publications by Maximilian Capraro and Michael Dorner on open source and
      inner source activity metrics.)

I am not specifically familiar with these people and their work. Others on the
project may be. I will start a discussion of those individuals on our lists,
and attempt to reach out to them. Thank you.

     Another question to think about when trying to recruit more volunteers:
     How easy is it to setup Kibble without any prior experience? How easy is
     it to extend it?

The process for getting Kibble running -
https://apache-kibble.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html - is indeed a little
intimidating. There has been discussion in the past about how to simplify, or
package, so that getting started isn't quite so onerous, but here, too, we
suffer from lacking the volunteer effort to make this happen.

As for ease of extending - we believe it to be fairly easy, but the proof is
in people actually trying and reporting their success - something that we have
so far mostly lacked.

     Another question one could think about: Who are potential users and where
     do you find them (inside and outside the ASF)?

Potential users include any organization with some kind of Open Source
Programs Office, who wants to analyze their company's participation in open
source. And any university which is doing research in open source in general.
It may indeed be worthwhile trying to reach out to those groups specifically.

We get good responses from both of those groups to our demos at FOSDEM, but
followup is weak.

Thank you for your questions, as they indicate useful directions where we
might do more active outreach.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

## Description:
 - The Apache Knox Gateway is an HTTP/REST API Gateway for interacting with
   Apache Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for
   all REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Knox continues to leverage the KIP approach to communicate designs and
   proposals but has also integrated Github Pull Requests. The 1.3.0 release
   was proposed as mid April and we will start the close down in the next week
   or so.
 - There are a number of new contributors that are emerging as possible
   committer/PMC candidates and we will consider invitations over the next
   quarter or so.

## Health report:
 - Mail and commits continue to be at a good level. There were previously
   inflated email counts due to jenkins job failures as indicated in previous
   reports. These seem to be fewer - presumably due to the use of PRs instead
   of patches on JIRA.

## PMC changes:

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Libcloud Project  [Toma≈æ Muraus]

## Description:

Libcloud is a Python library that abstracts away the differences among
multiple cloud provider APIs.

## Issues:

There are no issues which require board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We still receive a good amount of contributions on Github and JIRA, but
overall the activity has dropped.

That's mostly due to lack of active committers / PMC who would have time
to review contributions and guide and help contributors.

We are trying to recruit more committers / reviewers, but it's not easy due
to the nature of the project (driver / plugin model where most people only
care about a very small part of a project - e.g. either a single driver or a
particular change in the driver they are interested in).

## PMC changes:

- Currently 13 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 21 committers.
- Rick van de Loo was added as a committer on Tue Jun 26 2018

## Releases:

- 2.4.0 was released on Thu Nov 08 2018
- 2.3.0 was released on March 03, 2018
- 2.2.1 was released on September 21, 2017

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Matt Sicker]

## Description:
 - The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-source
   software related to the logging of application behavior and released at no
   charge to the public.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Andrei Ivanov was added as a committer with a particular interest on Log4j
   Audit.
 - Log4j 2.11.2 was released with new database appender improvements, many
   bugfixes, a new internal build system for detecting API changes between
   releases, and some performance improvements.
 - Early discussions on a new Groovy configuration DSL have begun.
 - Small activity around log4cxx on mailing lists.
 - Early discussions on releasing log4net. Due to the lack of contributors and
   expertise in .NET in the Logging PMC, forming a release has been
   challenging. However, we are planning to work on some knowledge transfers
   during this next release to help keep this project component viable.

## Health report:
 - The project overall remains active and healthy. Overall activity was less
   this quarter than previous.
 - The log4net component has been struggling lately due to lack of
   contributors. Based on mailing list and jira interest, the project itself
   continues to have many users, though attracting new committers hasn't
   materialized.
 - Similarly, log4cxx has very little activity, and log4php has almost none.
   These concerns appear to date back several years at this point.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Carter Kozak on Sun Jul 29 2018

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 35 committers.
 - Andrei Ivanov was added as a committer on Thu Apr 18 2019

## Releases:

 - LOG4J-2.11.2 was released on Tue Feb 05 2019

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.12 release on December
20, 2018.  The next major release is currently undergoing voting.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We nominated and approved Markus Schuch as a PMC member on 12/29/2017. We did
not sign up any new committers this quarter.  We continue to be on the lookout
for new PMC members and committers.  There are several candidates at this time
but we have not yet held a vote for committership.

We have seen a noted change in the willingness of users of this project to get
involved in its maintenance and development.  This could be interpreted as
fewer active developers using the product and more inexperienced integrators. 
We have no solution for this development.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been fairly active this quarter, and requests for
development have been high.  Unfortunately the requests have exceeded the
capacity of the team to carry them out, with some notable exceptions. 
Requests to redevelop connectors due to the end-of-life of many repository
APIs is the most concerning development, since the team has neither the time
resources nor the software access to perform these without significant
assistance from the requestors.  Still, we managed to upgrade one connector
this cycle, and another rework is underway.

I am unaware of any mailing list question that has gone unanswered.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache NetBeans Project  [Geertjan Wielenga]

Apache NetBeans is a development environment, tooling platform, and
application framework.

The project entered the incubator in October 2016 and in April 2019 graduated
to become a top level Apache project. Three releases have been completed in
the incubator, the most recent release having been at the end of March 2019,
and the first release outside the incubator is aimed to be released in June
2019. The current aim is to attempt to release 4 times per year, as time-based
rather than feature-based releases.

The Apache top level infrastructure has been set up with thanks to the Apache
Infra team: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-18261

The last committers and PMC members have been voted in during April 2019,
Vikas Prabhakar and Sarvesh Kesharwani. In the incubator, everyone voted on
was automatically both a committer and committee member; now that we're a top
level project we are going to separate those two, as guided by our mentors, so
that we'll first vote on committers and then in time evaluate whether they are
suitable as PMC members.

Currently, 691 are signed up to the user mailing list, and 452 to the
developer mailing list, both of which is a slight increase over the numbers in
the last incubator report of April 2019.

A main task coming up is the rerouting of netbeans.org to netbeans.apache.org,
a first attempt was made, there were several unexpected side effects, and we
rolled back, hoping to try again soon. Another task in progress is the
completion of the donation of NetBeans from Oracle to Apache, which will still
take some time: though the main features have been donated, several ancillary
features, in particular support for C/C++ development, is still in progress,
being audited, scrubbed, etc. A rough estimate is that it should take at least
another year before all the source code of NetBeans at Oracle is donated to
Apache.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache PLC4X Project  [Christofer Dutz]

Apache PLC4X is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial
programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a
shared API.

# Project Status:

We are currently in the post graduation phase. All post-graduation tasks have
been performed and project activity is picking up again after finishing the
pre- and post-graduation work. Also did we invest a lot of effort in preparing
the project (especially the build) for upcoming activity with additional
languages such as C# and Python. The graduation media coverage was quite
extensive and did bring a lot of inquiries from outside entities which we are
currently processing. There is a lot of potential for new contributors as well
as cooperation with other open source initiatives.

# Issues, the board needs to be aware of or act on:

none

# Activity since last report:

This is our first report as TLP, so this answer will refer to the time since
the last podling report, which was last month.

Mostly pre- and post-graduation work. Handling inquiries from external
entities as a result of the graduation media attention. A lot of discussions
about other languages and driver generation have been has on the mailing list
and the build was prepared for the challenges of the near future.

# Plans for the near future:

A delegation of 3 PMCs and 2 non-PMCs will be attending the European Union
EU-FOSSA2 Hackathon in Brussels with the goal to grow the public awareness as
well as the community.

We are currently working on setting up a Python API where we will be testing
providing an intermediate solution to the unavailability of native drivers in
other languages by bundling a Java server with Python client.

In parallel there are currently two initiatives for defining a way to formally
specify industrial protocols and to generate native code in multiple languages
from these definitions. These efforts will be an ongoing effort for the next
months.

We will be having a first PLC4X Meetup in the next month or two where we will
also be doing a little graduation party.

# Numbers:

Mailing List Subscriptions: 45 (up by 2) Twitter Followers: 160 (up by 30)
GitHub Stars: 62 (up by 10) Last release: 2019-03-13: PLC4X (incubating) 0.3.1

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]


Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
 - Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
   formats

   The Apache POI PMC also handles bugfixes for the XMLBeans project: XMLBeans
   is a tool that allows you to map XML files to generated Java classes via
   XML Schema definitions.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Apache POI 4.1.0 was released, it features a new EMF renderer and support
   for SVG images in XSLF, improvements to Java 9+ support, a handful of new
   formula function implementations and numerous bug fixes.

   Early testing of JDK 12 and 13 builds continued.

### XMLBeans
 - In this period we released XMLBeans 3.1.0 with some important stability
   fixes.

   Work is ongoing to refresh the buildsystem to remove some unnecessary
   complexity and make it easier for developers to build and use modern IDEs
   for development.

   Also some work on better support for Java 9+ is planned.

## Health report:
 - There was some discussions of how to perform some non-standard effects with
   Microsoft document formats and other discussions which indicate that the
   popularity of Apache POI is still very good. Questions via email or on
   Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly.

   Bug influx was moderate this quarter, bug-numbers stayed mostly constant,
   some bug influx and some bugs could be fixed, also some bugs were closed as
   WON'TFIX after being dormant for a long time.

   Bug influx for XMLBeans is very low because it is a stable project in
   maintenance-mode.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Roller Project  [David M. Johnson]

## Description: 
  Apache Roller is a full-featured, Java-based blog server that works well on
Tomcat and MySQL, and is known to run on other Java servers and relational
databases. Latest release is 5.2.2 and the ASF blog site at blogs.apache.org
runs on Roller 5.1.2 Tomcat and MySQL.

## Issues: 
- There are no other issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 
- Currently preparing a Roller 5.2.3 release to address some bugs
- Currently working with Infra to get a blogs-test server setup to test 
Roller 6 for blogs.apache.org

## Health report: 
- Community is made-up of part-time volunteers with limited time to devote to
Roller. Currently only one committer is actively working on developing Roller
and making release. For the most part other committers only have time to
review and test release.
- Vote underway for a new committer, and initiated discussion with 
another possible candidate.

## Description: 
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - There was one new release over the last quarter - Apache Santuario XML
   Security for Java 2.1.3. This was our first Java release in 9 months, and so
   it contained a number of bug fixes. 
   
## Health report: 
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Branko ƒåibej]

Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Branko ƒåibej]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library built
   upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the default client
   library of Apache Subversion, Apache OpenOffice and mod_pagespeed.

## Issues:
   Activity on the project seems to have come to a halt in the last 6 months.
   Since the last report, there were a couple discussions with users (mostly
   on the #serf IRC channel on Freenode).

   Otherwise, there was no significant increase in activity on the project.

## Activity:
   There has been no move towards getting Serf 1.4.0 released in the last six
   months. A release candidate for internal testing was produced, but never
   released. The last Serf release is now 2.5 years old.

   The only active user of Serf seems to be Apache Subversion. mod_pagespeed
   is still listed as incubating but doesn't even have a podling web site
   (either that, or the link on the incubator page is wrong).

   Some of the PMC members chatted informally (on IRC) about pushing forward
   the next release (1.4.0).

## Health report:
   The last commit in the public repository was made on 2nd November.

## PMC & Committer changes:
   Currently 13 PMC members and 13 committers.

   - No new committers added in the last 3 months.
   - Last new committer added in April 2017 (Evgeny Kotkov).
   - Last new PMC member added in September 2018 (Branko ƒåibej).

## Releases:
   Apache Serf 1.3.9 was released on Thu Sep 01 2016

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   The last message on the dev@ mailing list a week old. It's a follow-up from
   a discussion with a user on IRC who had trouble building our sources..

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial objects
for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The base of the SIS
library is modeled according international standards published jointly by the
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO).


## Issues:

In last report (February) we wrote that we have difficulty to make a release,
because of lack of time. We wrote that we were hoping to work on a release in
March, but it did not happened yet. More discussion in the health section
below.


## Activity and health report:

Exceptionally, I merge those two sections together for this report since they
are closely related.

Last release (0.8) was in November 2017. About 30,000 lines of code (ignoring
comments) have been added since that release (~8600 in last 3 months). We
rushed in the development of features required by a contract focused on better
support of Earth Observation data such as JAXA's Global Change Observation
Mission. Despite the rush, the quality of the code has not been compromised:
Apache SIS still have a high comment/code ratio (1.16 : 1). An example of
comment documenting algebraic transformations together with a link to
OpenOffice document providing more details can be viewed at [1]. However this
rush has been done at the sacrifice of community activity (messages on
dev@sis.apache.org dropped to 3 emails in this quarter; we did not had the
time to make proposals for GSoC this year; we may miss the geospatial track at
ApacheCon this year for the first time; we did not wrote summary of latest
Open Geospatial Consortium meetings), and at the sacrifice of preparing a
release for more than one year. We reported those issues in February. In
reaction, the board requested us to confirm by email that there is at least 3
PMC members providing active oversight of the project [2]. The call received
responses from 4 PMC members, two of them being myself and a coworker.

In the last report, we wrote that we may have time to work on SIS release in
March. Unfortunately it did not happen, because of urgent work not yet
finished. Work on the SIS release started only last week (May 1st), with one
regression fixed [3]. I'm just starting to have weekends and holidays
available for working on SIS release. The plan is to ensure that SIS compiles
with Java 11 and to verify compliance of new features with OGC/ISO standards;
the remaining would be delayed to a future release. A user already sent a pull
request about the Java 11 compatibility issue [4] (disclaimer: he is a
coworker).

Apache Jena is starting to use SIS for GeoSPARQL support [5]. It is the second
Apache project to my knowledge, after Apache Tika, to use SIS.


## PMC changes:

  * Currently 20 PMC members.
  * No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.

  * Last committer addition was Johann Sorel on March 2016.

The user who sent above-cited pull request [4] could be a candidate for new
committer since he already provided other patches before. We are waiting for
the next opportunity, when he will need to work again on SIS.


## Releases:

  * 0.8 was released on November 24, 2017.
  * Work on 1.0 release started May 1st, but can continue only during weekends
    for now.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- We released Apache Spark 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3 and 2.3.3 in the past three
  months to fix issues in the 2.3 and 2.4 branches.

- Discussions are under way about the next feature release, which will likely
  be Spark 3.0, on our dev and user mailing lists. Some key questions include
  whether to remove various deprecated APIs, and which minimum versions of
  Java, Python, Scala, etc to support. There are also a number of new features
  targeting this release. We encourage everyone in the community to give
  feedback on these discussions through our mailing lists or issue tracker.

- Several Spark Project Improvement Proposals (SPIPs) for major additions to
  Spark were discussed on the dev list in the past three months. These include
  support for passing columnar data efficiently into external engines (e.g.
  GPU based libraries), accelerator-aware scheduling, new data source APIs,
  and .NET support. Some of these have been accepted (e.g. table metadata and
  accelerator aware scheduling proposals) while others are still being
  discussed.

Trademarks:

- We are continuing engagement with various organizations.

Latest releases:

- May 8th, 2018: Spark 2.4.3
- April 23rd, 2019: Spark 2.4.2

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The Subversion development community is fairly quiet these days. A
  small trickle of development is ongoing. The community usually
  responds to bug reports and is willing to help the reporter or any
  other volunteer to develop a fix. However, in many cases there is no
  such volunteer, and those bug reports are filed but often remain
  unresolved.

  Our user support forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers
  regularly.

  No new committers were added since the one reported in February.

* Releases

  Subversion 1.12.0 was released on April 24 2019.
  This is a regular release which will receive 6 months of support.
  Subversion 1.11, the previous regular release, is no longer supported.

  Subversion 1.9 and 1.10 are our current long-term-support (LTS)
  releases and will receive support until August 2019 and April 2022,
  respectively.

* Delayed patching of known security issues

  There are currently two pending private security issues, the one
  mentioned in the last report which was reported to us in August 2018,
  and a newer one which was reported to us in February 2019.

  In the past, there were usually enough volunteers willing to address
  security issues.

  A PMC member with commercial funding (Julian Foad) has recently been
  assigned some work time to address one or both of these.

2.0.13 were released recently), we have finally started the work on the master
branch around the new 3.0.0, with new components and features.

## Health report:

Discussions about new features and improvements keep appearing and being
followed up in dev@.

Users keep asking for basic and advanced features and customizations in user@
and are eventually getting supported by the community. Someone is offering
help on dev@ and was addressed to docs and tasks addressable as starting
points, we'll see if anything concrete is going to happen.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based on,
but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java Enterprise
Edition Specifications.

## Health

The community did a concentrated push over the holidays to attract and get new
contributors engaged.  The most active window was mid November to February and
in that time the project shattered every measurable record set in the near 20
years of project history.

 - highest contributors in a 3-month period: 43 (average was 8 in Oct/Nov)
 - highest spike in commits (previous 2012)
 - highest sustained volume (previous 2011)
 - highest dev list: 1326 messages (previous 520 in Sept 2007)

Overall result is from mid November till now the project doubled in total
contributors, from 32 to 83.  Discussions in the PMC in adding some of them as
committers are in progress now, including one vote.

## Activity

Four major jumps and areas of focus have taken place in the last few months.
The first has been to bring TomEE up from MicroProfile 1.2 support to
MicroProfile 2.0 compliance.  This work is complete and passing all
MicroProfile 2.0 TCK tests.  The second area has been a push to add more
examples to the project, 26 new examples in total, 15 of those for
MicroProfile specifications.  The third focus was on the website itself, code
that generates the site and basic documentation.  The project had been
maintaining one set of documentation applicable to all versions.  We now have
a Tomcat-like system with documentation root per version.  The fourth area has
been to translate the examples to other languages.  11 translated in total, 6
in Portuguese and 5 in Spanish.

The result is the project has experienced a dramatic change, with many new
contributors and work that can be done at all levels from any skillset.  At
this moment there are still 29 PRs in the queue and more showing up regularly.

We are very thrilled and proud of everyone.  It took 19 years to get 32
contributors and with a major focused effort by everyone simultaneously, we
were able to smash 19 years of "new contributor" work in 3 months.  It is
difficult to sustain and contributions in the last 2 months are lower, but
still far greater than the three month period before November.  The lesson
learned is there is a massive difference in outcome if one or two people push
for years vs everyone pushing at once, even if briefly.

We hope to do this again in December 2019 on the 20th anniversary of the
project, with more committers able to help and hopefully smash some records
again.

Work on a TomEE 8.0.0-M3 release is in progress.  The community would like to
get that codebase to run cleanly on Java 11 and then go for a final TomEE
8.0.0 release.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Turbine Project  [Georg Kallidis]

## Description:

 - Apache Turbine is a servlet based framework that allows experienced Java
   developers to quickly build web applications. Turbine allows you to
   personalize the web sites and to use user logins to restrict access to
   parts of your application.

 - Turbine is a matured and well established framework that is used as the
   base of many other projects.

## Issues:

 - No board-level issues at this time.

## Activity:

 - Finalizing component upgrades/releases before Turbine 5.0 release and site
   updates
 - Migrated MoinWiki to Confluence

## Health report:

 - The Turbine project's quarter activity mainly referred to release /
   organizational / community collaboration issues in the dev mailing list and
   ongoing code changes across many components on low/medium level.
 - Turbine characterizes as a light-weight and robust, but not very easy to
   use framework, especially for newcomers. Providing a ready-to-use
   development environment is still highly desired and already in preparation.
   Yet, the upcoming main release and accompanying site updates will be of
   still higher demand.

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Usergrid Project  [Michael Russo]

## Description:
 - Usergrid is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) composed of an integrated database
   (Cassandra), a query engine (ElasticSearch), and application layer and
    client tier with SDKs for developers.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - CI setup with ASF Jenkins in progress.
 - Various Bugfixes around index querying and maintenance.
 - Improved test stability.
 - Experimentation with using newer versions(5.x) of Elasticsearch vs.
   supported older version (1.7).

## Health report:
  Growth has been flat over the past year or so. Some of the historical core
  contributors have not been active with the project recently. However, there
  is a new committer and additional interest for modernizing Usergrid --
  upgrading Cassandra to the latest version and containerizing Usergrid.
  Getting the project to a healthier state will continue to be a focus. This
  includes more discussion on the mailing lists, better use of JIRA, and
  planning of a new release -- master branch is currently stable and contains
  many stability fixes over the last release in 2016.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:

  Tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information lookup
  activities

## Issues:

  None

## Health report:

  Sebb has clearly become the most active developer on the project.  Shane has
  become more active.  The times when this was mostly a one person project
  with occasional patches from others are long over.

  A number of individuals have expressed an interest in contributing, and have
  begun to do so.  I am hopeful that there will be new committers in the next
  quarter or two.

  We continue to have more than adequate oversight, with two to three active
  committers, and a few occasional committers.

## Development:

 - Some new tools are being developed, mostly in branches.  Nothing ready to
   be announced.

 - Numerous fixes.

## PMC and committer base:

  - Currently 10 committers, all on the PMC.
  - Last addition: Jun 2017 (John D. Ament)
