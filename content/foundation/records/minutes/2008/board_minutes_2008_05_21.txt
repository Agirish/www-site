 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Jim]

       On May 5th I speak at the Centers for Disease Control and
       Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta regarding "What is Open Source"
       and "How the ASF Does Open Source". I will make the slides
       available for others to view, use, expand, etc...

       Final preparations are underway for the annual ASF members
       meeting, set for June 3rd. Yesteday I sent out a generic
       reminder but later on this week I will send out a more
       specific reminder about ensuring that member and board
       nominations are noted in their respective files and pinging
       board candidates regarding their acceptance.

       Attendance records for the 2 meetings in 2007 have been updated.

       This has been one of our quietest months, with the ASF just
       ticking along. This will also be our last board meeting with
       the current roster (no matter who are re-elected) and so I'd
       like to personally thank all the directors for their hard work
       and dedication this last year.

    B. President [Justin]

       As denoted in the infra report, it's been a hectic month keeping
       critical services afloat.  Things are slowly returning to normal,
       but this outage blew up the short-term schedules so some PMCs
       are complaining about lack of responsiveness to lower-priority
       tasks.

       The role of Executive Assistant hasn't, so far, worked out yet -
       this is due to a number of communication snafus and conflicting
       schedules.  I take the responsibility for this failure as I simply
       haven't had enough cycles to power this through and bring the
       position up to speed as I had anticipated.

       In light of this, I have been contemplating new organizational
       structures that could be implemented in the new year to alleviate
       some of the disfunction that seems to always surround us.  Since this
       is the last Board meeting for this Board and I do not have anything
       concrete yet, I'll continue to ponder in the hopes of having something
       to present to the new Board before its inaugural meeting for their
       consideration.

    C. Treasurer [J Aaron]

       The Quickbooks are _almost_ completely back up to date.  All
       Wells Fargo Checking and Savings accounts are up to date.
       Paypal has been lumped in because their history/download
       functionality has been broken.  Also, the individual credit
       card transactions still need entered.  Perhaps we could have
       one of our contractors perform this last part.

       Work now needs to begin on the audit process and the 2007 tax
       returns.  That's my next step.

       Also, still waiting for Wells Fargo to issue new credit cards.

       With the books now up to date, I can now provide some better
       financial reports:

       I'd appreciate any feedback on the new financial reports.

       Discussion:
         * A number of kudos for the new report format
         * Aaron, Sam, Justin to pursue transferring Jim, Sander's credit cards
           to Aaron, Sam

    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Sam]

       3 grants, 79 iclas, 10 cclas were recorded this month.  Minutes
       are up to date and available.

       A growing number of people have emerged with an interest in correcting
       typos, auditing, and suggesting improvements to the way records are
       being captured and recorded.  As everything is completely under version
       control I see no issue with this, and am, in fact, thrilled it is
       happening.  I plan to further enable this activity by asking that a
       secretary-discuss, or perhaps a records-discuss, mailing list be set up.

       There has been some confusion amongst directors as to who can edit
       iclas.txt.  Since long before I was Secretary, it has been the policy
       that officers can make edits to it during periods when the secretary
       is unavailable.  In most cases, the simplest thing to do when an officer
       gets a document that needs to be recorded is to fax it to the ASF fax
       number, as Jim has recently done.  But directly recording it is OK, as
       long as it is followed up by either a fax or snail mail.  At the present
       time there is document which was received by a director, and an availid
       issued, for a document which has not been either forwarded to the
       secretary or committed to the documents/icla folder.   I requested that
       it be faxed, emailed, or committed 11 days ago, and followed up two
       days ago.

       While I had previously agreed to keep the mailing list address mentioned
       in the ICLA and CCLA documents, I now believe that doing such only adds
       confusion, delays, and additional possibility of transmission errors.  I
       plan no action at this time, but unless Jim discovers an appropriate
       mechanism for a virtual physical address, I plan to recommend (or
       implement) to the incoming (or returning) secretary that these addresses
       be updated to reflect either the address of the current secretary-assist
       or the secretary (if that secretary intends to directly handle the
       relatively few documents that arrive via snail mail).

       It turns out that the ASF debit card that I was issued by Wells Fargo
       is effectively useless as we have imposed a standing requirement that
       any withdrawls require two signatures.  To address an outstanding and
       overdue PRNewswire balance, I used a personal credit card and have
       been reimbursed by the ASF for the full amount.  I have been told that
       correcting the signature requirement would require somebody to show
       up to Wells Fargo in person.  I will be in the bay area next week and
       can take care of it then if it hasn't already been corrected.

       In the past 30 days, three paychecks have been issued to the secretary
       assistant.

       Discussion:
         * Justin and Sam to pursue Wells Fargo as iCLA, cCLA address
         * Greg to mail iCLA to secretary assist

10. Unfinished Business

11. New Business

    * QPid wants to buy the SPECjms SPEC kit for benchmarking their
      implementation. According to a mail to the board list, this
      would be $450 for a non-profit organization. Can we do this, do
      we do this, if yes, how do we do this?

      Geir to work with QPid on rationale and licensing

    * The issue surrounding the purchase of the TREC Terabyte Collection
      and a possible restriction to just one PMC, even though it has been
      licensed to the ASF. Quote from "Iadh Ounis":

      > The licenses are not site-wide.  It is only for a homnegeneous
      > unit such as a research group with a department. For example,
      > it is not uncommon to have university X having a Department of
      > computer science with more than one license, for a given test
      > collection - eg an IR research group and a ML research
      > group. In your case, you should license for the Lucene
      > top-level project at most. In terms of the contract, the
      > "organisation" is the research group (Lucene project), the
      > legal entity is in your case, ASF.

      Discussed creating a new committee for TREC Terabyte Collection
      users.  Likely interest from Lucene, UIMA, probably Hama, potentially
      Hadoop and Jackrabbit.

      Jim to follow up with Grant Ingersoll

Attachment 1: Report from the VP of JCP

(Apologies for delay - the quarterly JCP f2f is going on
at this moment, so was holding off as long as possible in case
I had something useful to report from it.  I don't.)

<sigh>

Still in the rabbit hole, we continue our discussions with Sun
regarding the Harmony TCK license.  I had a long meeting with
Jeet Kaul at Sun during JavaOne, and I continue to appreciate
his candor and directness, but am concerned about the ultimate
outcome.

We currently have a proposed license that contains a mix of
objectionable elements, including a kind of FOU limitation,
a notice requirement and some discussion on the version of the
TCK that would be licensed.  Honestly, I'm getting tired
of backing up.

The notice still doesn't conform to the "3 principles" that
have been articulated on internal (and soon to be external)
member and legal lists, so I haven't been formally wasting the
board's or member's time with the minutea.  My objective has been
to get Sun to clarify exactly what they are looking for, and
provide a reason (that I understand) as to why our original
notice counter-proposal was insufficient.

This week is the quarterly JCP F2F meeting, and I chose not
to attend for a variety of reasons in person, but did attend
for a period by phone.  Given the public nature of this report,
all I will report here is that the topic was discussed, and
still is of great import and interest to the EC as a whole.
I'll provide more detail during the board meeting.

As for next steps, I have two - probably final - ideas.  The
first will be to very visbily and publicly offer to accept
a trivially modified version of the TCK license offered by
Sun to the OpenJDK community and licensees.  The modifications
amount to little more than s/OpenJDK/Harmony/ and
s/derived from/not derived from/.  I plan to do this on
jcp-open and I think that this really is an issue for the
broader java community.

The second is to highlight the inappropriateness of the notice
for OSS in general by bringing the OpenJDK community into the
discussion and asking that whatever notice is required of us
will be required of OpenJDK and licensees (like RedHat).

I apologize for this taking so long - never in my darkest
moments did I imagine this could turn into the debacle
that this has become.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Status report for the Apache Legal Affairs Committee

A fairly quiet month.

The iBATOR trademark infringement issue seems to have been resolved
satisfactorily.

Glassfish has now corrected the license issue with prior versions of
their product (as of the last board report, they had only addressed
the latest version).

Andy Oliver is continuing to work quietly with myself and ASF council
to see if we can identify and resolve his concerns with the Microsoft
funding of Sourcesense to implement OOXML.

WSRP4J appears to be in a roughly analogous place.  There are no known
actively enforced patents by either IBM or WebCollege that apply to
this code, but a desire to preemptively and proactively get a
license agreement.

As indicated in the incubator report, nobody on the Legal Affairs
Committee has expressed any concern with the changes proposed by Roy
for the procedures for IP Clearance.

Questions on compatibility with various licenses continue to pop up
from time to time.

No questions on third party licensing issues arose during the past
month.

Attachment 3: Status report for the Apache Security Team Project

There continues to be a steady stream of reports of various kinds
arriving at security@apache.org. These continue to be dealt with
promptly by the security team.  Apr 2008 was mostly quiet:

1      Support question
6      Phishing/spam/attacks point to site "powered by Apache"
1      Vulnerability report

Attachment 4: Status report for the Apache Conference Planning Project

  General News
  ------------

  * Renewal of SCP Contract

    The ApacheCon contract with SCP has an evergreen clause, and the
    conference committee has voted to renew the contract.

  * New Committee Member

    The conference committee has voted to add Sally Khudairi as a new
    member. Sally received 9 +1 votes (and no other votes). The change
    was acknowledged by the board April 16, 2008.

  * Hackathon Survey for ASF Committers

    The conference committee is planning to make some changes to ASF
    Hackathon events, and is currently running a survey for ASF
    committers asking them about their preferences and wishes for
    future Hackathon events. The result of the survey will be published.
    In addition there is a discussion page about ApacheCon and
    Hackathon on the ApacheCon wiki at the following URL:
    http://wiki.apache.org/apachecon/ApacheConBrainStorm

  * ApacheCon events in 2009

    The conference committee and SCP are in the process of selecting
    the venues for the 2009 events. Currently the plan is to hold
    ApacheCon Europe 2009 in Amsterdam the last week of March again
    for the last time, and ApacheCon US 2009 in Oakland in November.
    Regarding Europe, SCP has been made aware that we need to find a
    solution regarding the Hackathon and the new BarCamp event, i.e.,
    that charging a high fee is not an option.

Attachment 5: Status report for the Apache Audit Project

There's been no activity that I can tell. Presumably the tax return
hasn't been started yet.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Status report for the Apache Public Relations Project

The issue with the outstanding invoices for the PR Newswire have really
been fixed now, as far as the invoices being paid.

There was positive feedback regarding the Media Training Sally performed at
AC EU. This does seem a popular and worthwhile "session" to maintain.

A request was received regarding an external company's request for an ASF
quote regarding the company's support plans for Apache ServiceMix. We
responded that we do not provide such quotes, especially for companies that
have no interaction or involvement at all with the ASF.

There was posting by Santiago Gala regarding a company's interest in
organizing a 1/2 day "Unconference/BarCamp" related to some Apache
technology. Santiago is following this effort.

Justin is taking the lead on our involvement with a workshop being
sponsored by Google and the National Science Foundation (NSF) related to
large scale computing in universities. What exactly is requested and
expected, as far as our involvement, is still being discussed, but likely
be such things as a letter of support, some sort of promotion, etc...

Sally is working on a Mid-Year PR Update, to be sent out via the normal
channels. This assumes that no further issues with PR Newswire pops up.

www.apache.com is a problem again, brand and trademark-wise.
The site (which redirects to http://apache.chasehosting.com/)
is purposely confusing, misleading and misappropriating our brand.
A PRC volunteer will follow up.

A vote was called to add Santiago Gala to the PRC. Unfortunately, it was
called too late to allow for the results to be final by this board meeting.
We hope to add him to the PRC next month.

HALO's report is as follows:
A quick update on April's busy-ness. My apologies for keeping this a bit
short, but I'm flying in a few hours and am not nearly close to the end as
originally envisaged. Hey-ho.

I. On the PR side of things, it's been quiet both proactively and
reactively. I've spoken to a few analysts on a background level, as well as
the two Dutch journalists invited to participate in the Media Training
during ApacheCon (more on that below). I'm also beginning to draft the ASF
mid-year momentum press release, with intended release timeframe mid-June
(following the Member meeting).

II. Sponsorship-wise, I've been in touch with Scott Lamons and Paul Holland
of HP (Gold Sponsors), with whom I've requested to submit two talks for
ApacheCon/US in November in spite of the CFP deadline having passed. One
talk has been accepted; the other is on the fallback list -- nobody has
been notified of this yet. They also seem to be pursuing additional funding
internally to sponsor ApacheCon again, and, hopefully, renew their
Sponsorship as well.

Also on the Sponsor outreach & education side of things, you know that I've
been working closely with Microsoft's Open Source/Linux team and PR corps
on both ASF and ApacheCon sponsorship through their partnership with
Sourcesense (Apache POI). I've been helping them learn how they can become
more proactively (and properly!) involved with the ASF, from ApacheCon
participation to ASF Sponsorship. They seem quite interested and are
discussing internally ways to get involved. I take this as an very positive
sign.

III. Media Training at ApacheCon/Amsterdam: this was the first time that we
held a formal Intermediate class (not just beginner), with all participants
staying on for both sessions. Overall, I think the class went quite well
(see feedback below) ... in attendance were: Noirin Plunkett Shirley,
Bertrand Delacretaz, Craig Russell, Wendy Smoak, Jukka Zitting (refresher
from Austin '06!), Emmanuel Lecharney (refresher from Amsterdam '07!), and
Mylene Reiners (paid registrant). ... please see post-training feedback
from attendees at end pf document. I've also Secured Michael Cote/RedMonk
as partner for Media Training (he'll cover the ASF's activities during
ApacheCons & will begin with ApacheCon US/New Orleans).

IV. Outstanding items: leaflet production (hadn't been addressed during
ApacheCon) ... and I'm still looking for some place/way to post the PRC
Process and Media Training content. Preferably online, and somewhere on
apache.org. Any volunteers to help with this? I've got TortoiseSVN on my
system (I'm a light user with one of my OS clients); perhaps this is a way
we can get this project going?


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Status report for the Apache Infrastructure Team

We purchased 3 Dell 2950s costing about $12K total.

We purchased a certificate for svn.eu.apache.org, intended for use as an
svn mirror of our main repos. We are in the final testing stages now, and
expect to bring this machine into community service in the very near
future.

Sun donated 8 SAS drives and we had them shipped to Sander Striker. The
drives will eventually be installed in odyne, the 4150 we cannibalized to
get harmonia up.

Sun has offered to provide us with a support contract for our machines in
SARA, at no charge to the ASF. Details have yet to be finalized.

Old eris has retired itself due to its failing RAID array, and one of the
2950s was pressed into service via trial by fire. A tremendous amount of
effort went into bringing the replacement box online and stabilizing it-
chiefly by Philip Gollucci, Norman Maurer, Paul Querna, and Tony Stevenson.

Work continues on setting up bia, our backup host, driven by Norman Maurer
and Tony Stevenson.

Roy T. Fielding made significant improvements to our ezmlm installation,
eliminating the need for moderation on our commit lists.

Sebastian Bazley has done an incredible amount of work rationalizing
various foundation records.

Roughly 3 dozen new accounts were created this month.

2 TLP's, archiva and cxf, have been migrated.

In light of the recent Debian/Ubuntu security advisory (CVE-2008-0166)
regarding ssh/ssl, we have upgraded the host keys on all of our Ubuntu
hosts, and have scanned all the public keys on people.apache.org. We
investigated the ssl certificate on brutus and found that it predates the
vulnerability.

4 committers' and 2 members' accounts had their public ssh keys disabled on
people.apache.org for failing to comply with a request from root@ to remove
them within 48 hours of being notified. The keys in question were all
detected by the dowkd.pl script, and most users (~30 total) who received
the notice dutifully complied.

Gaea has started shutting itself down occasionally for reasons unknown. We
are investigating, but so far there's been little information to go on in
the logfiles.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache C++ Standard Library Project

Notable changes since the last report (February 2008):

  The major accomplishment since the last report was the succeessful,
  albeit delayed, release of stdcxx 4.2.1 on May 1 which adds a total
  of 23 small enhancements and fixes 110 bugs. In March, we attended
  the interesting Microsoft Open Source Software Labs meeting in
  Redmond.

BIS Export Control Classification:

  Apache C++ Standard Library contains no encryption source code nor
  does it make use of any third party encryption software.

Future plans:

  We are making progress on the implementation of the next C++
  standard expected to be ratified by the end 2009. A partial
  implementation is expected to be released in stdcxx 4.3.0
  tentatively scheduled for Winter 2008. Our goal is to complete the
  implementation in the first half of 2009 and make it available in
  stdcxx 5.0.

Community:

  The stdcxx community is unchanged since the last report.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

RELEASES / ONGOING WORK

- Cocoon 2.2.0 was released on 2008-05-16.

- In the Cocoon whiteboard (our sandbox in SVN) there is a promising
 rewrite of Cocoon called Corona (working title). The Corona pipeline
 API doesn't have _any_ third-party dependencies and can be used easily
 from within any Java application. So far Corona only provides
 SAX XML pipeline components but alternative implementations (e.g.
 StAX) are welcomed.
 There are two additional modules "corona-sitemap" and "corona-servlet"
 that have the goal to make Corona usable for web applications.

- Cocoon uses Excalibur JNet, a common purpose lib that allows you to
 dynamically register own URL handlers. Since Cocoon is currently the
 only project that makes use of it, we have pulled it into our
 repository but we are aware that there are better places for it. In
 particular since it might be of interest to other libraries and
 frameworks that have to dynamically register URL handlers too.

 Carsten Ziegeler, who wrote the initial version of JNet, contacted
 the Apache Commons community which invited us to contribute JNet to
 their sandbox as a new project.

COMMUNITY

- After almost two years I stepped down as the chair of the Apache
 Cocoon project. Vadim Gritsenko was elected to follow me.

[no issues]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Continuum Project

This is the third board report submitted by Continuum since becoming a TLP.
Below are the important events that happened in the project since April.

Releases
--------------
* No new release since previous report

* Steady progress on the release, continued discussion on dev list

Community
--------------

* Discussion continue for the internal architecture in future versions

* No new committer

Issues
--------

* No issues related to the board.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache CXF Project

Releases:
2.1 released which is JAX-WS 2.1 compliant and has a BUNCH of new features
2.0.6 released as a bug fix/patch release of the 2.0.x line

Community aspects:
Voted in Sergey Beryozkin as a new committer.
Most resources have been moved from the incubator project to the full TLP
status. The main thing remaining is that mail archives aren't showing up
in mod_mbox. Still progressing through the web site and other resources
(confluence mainly) to find incubator references.

Crypto issue:
After reviewing: http://www.apache.org/licenses/exports/ it still shows
CXF under the Incubator project. We'll find an Apache member to help get
that page updated shortly.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention
------------------------------
None

Changes in the PMC membership
-----------------------------
Jeremias Maerki is a new committer and PMC member.

General status
--------------
Progress has been generally slow this quarter. Most developers seem busy with
other stuff.

Most issues on the user mail list are being attended to by various developers.
That list is also quiet. In fact there were almost no non-developer postings
during this quarter.

Issues still to be dealt with by the Forrest PMC
------------------------------------------------
Improve the project guidelines document.

Improve our way of presenting license information for included products.

Progress of the project
-----------------------
Attended to final step of "Export Notification policy". Sent BIS email notice
soon after our last quarterly board report, i.e. 2008-03-05. See FOR-1069.

Good collaboration at beginning of the quarter to get newest Apache FOP
integrated. Followed on soon after to use its new "any protocol" ability to
solve a long-standing images-in-pdf bug.

No releases since 0.8 on 2007-04-18.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache HiveMind Project

The HiveMind project has remained quite inactive during the last 3
months. There are currently no active developers on the project.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

The Apache HTTP server project has made progress through the quarter
without any significant issues.  We have no board-level issues at this
time.

We have added two PMC members, Eric Covener and Issac Goldstand, and
three committers: Takashi Sato, Guy Ferraiolo, and Tom Donovan.
Bill Stoddard has gone emeritus to focus on other projects.

We have not done any releases this quarter for httpd, flood,
libapreq, mod_arm4, mod_bw, mod_cache_requester, mod_mbox, mod_pop3,
mod_smtpd, mod_wombat, or mod_ftp.  This was partly the subject of
Roy's tongue-in-cheek keynote at ApacheCon Europe, and there has been a
considerable increase in mailing list activity since then.  However,
the proof is still in the pudding and there's nothing to eat yet.

Due to lack of activity and no releases, mod_arm4, mod_bw,
mod_cache_requester, and mod_smtpd have been demoted to the sandbox.
The mod_domain (nee mod_dns) contribution has been imported to the
sandbox and IP clearance filed with Incubator.

Roy had wished to open up the sandbox to all Apache committers, but
resistance to the idea among the PMC was sufficient to kill it.
Most of the PMC believes that we should lower the bar for commit
access to flood and the sandbox, but there is no path to providing
it other than the usual PMC vote and weeks of delay.

A question was raised about the provenance of the cvt() functionality
included with httpd since the introduction of ap_snprintf in 1997.
It turns out that the original source code is based on a version
published within Unix V7 and licensed in a form compatible with
our license.  Jim has updated the license headers accordingly.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache HttpComponents Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

CXF has graduated, Tuscany is before the Board this month to graduate.  As
they leave, at least 4 new projects are under consideration for Incubation.

Roy has raised issues with the procedure for IP Clearance.  The Legal
Committee has this week indicated that they've no problems with the changes
proposed by Roy.

Oddly, in that there has been a significant volume during the past month
compared to most months, there have been a lot of IP Clearances done since
the April Board report.

Tony Stevenson has helped to prod projects into cleaning up their resources
when leaving the Incubator, particularly disk space.

A number of projects, e.g., UIMA and River, performed releases during the
past month.

=======================================================

May 2008 Board reports (see ReportingSchedule).


=== Abdera ===

Abdera released it's 0.4.0-incubating release on April 11th.

We've been in incubation since June 2006 and main focus moving forward will
be working towards graduation and a 1.0 release. Main item to resolve before
graduation is more active committer involvement. 0.4.0 saw a marked increase
in community contributions.  We also need to continue improving
documentation.


=== CouchDB ===

CouchDB is a distributed document-oriented database system written in
Erlang. The project entered incubation on February 12th, 2008.

Work continued on adding the Reduce-part of our Map/Reduce powered view
system. Code for this is not yet in SVN, but is near completion. We also
began making CouchDB configurable at runtime. IBM want to contribute
JSearch-(JSON indexing built on Lucene)-support to CouchDB. We are in the
process of discussing how to do this with the developers. JSearch as
IBM-internal clearance of being added to Apache projects. The license of
this unknown at this stage.

Finally, we have been discussion open work items for our upcoming 0.8 and
1.0 releases respectively. We hope to be able to produce a 0.8 release soon.


=== Lokahi ===

Lokahi is a configuration and management console for Apache httpd, tomcat
and other web server infrastructure.

Incubating since: 2006-01-07

Testing on the MySQL port is continuing.  A Fast Feather presentation on
Lokahi was given at Apachecon in Atlanta.  Recently talk (and some code) has
begun around templating of configuration files, specifically for Apache
Httpd at this time.  And the need to extend Lokahi to manage Geronimo has
been mentioned.

Obstacles to graduation:

 *  community - now includes authors outside of the original dev community,
but additional committers are sought.

 * licensing - oracle-only backend is now 95% of the way to an alternate
MySQL backend, and soon to be enhanced with license agnostic interfaces


=== NMaven ===

NMaven develops plugins and integration for Maven to make building and using
.NET languages a first-class citizen in Maven.

Incubating since: 2006-11-17

Items to resolve before graduation
 * More active committer involvement. We have two active committers from
different organizations but need at least one more.

Status:
 * Voted on and did first release
 * Many more community patches are coming in.
 * Lost one mentor due to personal reasons.

Plans:
 * We lost a lot of features when we rewrote the code so the plan is to
start reimplementing these features.
 * We have a number of patches for an old snapshot, which is very different
from current trunk. Need to get all this migrated into the current trunk
(related to above).
s

=== PDFBox ===

Apache PDFBox is an open source Java library for working with PDF documents.
PDFBox entered incubation on February 7th, 2008.

No progress last month as we're still waiting for the software grants for
the PDFBox sources. Once received, we'll finish the migration to Apache
infrastructure. We also need to do a more thorough license and export review
and work on migrating the web sites and the user community.

Issues before graduation:

 * Bring the sources to Apache
 * Increase community size and activity
 * Release once all licensing and export issues are resolved


=== Shindig ===

Shindig is a reference implementation of the OpenSocial and gadgets stack.

Incubating since: 2007-12-06

High-level status summary: Shindig community growing and working on
OpenSocial v0.8 implementation.

 * Community presence/growth: JavaOne, OpenSocial Summit, Google I/O
 * Aiming to get Infrastructure to provision a Zone (but progress is slow):
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-1585
 * Retired 10 inactive committers (from Google)
 * Shindig docs are coming together:
http://chrisschalk.com/shindig_docs/shindig_sql_tutorial/shindig_data_tutori
als.html
 * Formally update the incubator status page (in progress)
 * Technical progress:
    * Initial work towards implementing OpenSocial v0.8
    * Lots of progress getting new RESTful server implemented
    * Implemented full OAuth support
 * Top 3 things to resolve prior to graduation:
    * Improve diversity of committers (progress, but on-going)
    * Run through at least one release (seems like 0.8-compliance is a good
time)
    * <there seem to be only 2>


=== Sling ===

Sling is a framework to develop content centric web applications based on
the idea of modularizing the rendering of HTTP resources.

Sling entered incubation on September 5th, 2007.

Community

 * Sling saw an increased community activity over the last two months.
 * Present at Apache Con EU 08 with a BOF, a Fast Feather Track
presentation and several mentions in other talks.
 * Sling won the 5th prize at the JAX Innovation Award
(http://jax-award.de)

Software

 * Sling enjoyed an intensive quarter of development moving towards an
initial release. Currently we are finishing up and taliating issues required
in the initial release.
 * Sling is participating in the GSOC program with Bertrand Delacretaz
mentoring Janandith Jayawardena developing integration support for the Scala
programming language.
 * Talks between folks of the Apache Felix project and the Sling project
took place which resulted in an agreement to prepare moving the Sling
Management Console to the Felix project.

Issues before graduation

 * Make an incubating Sling release.
 * Grow a more diverse community (so far commits mostly from Day
employees). Getting the first release out will hopefully help.

Licensing and other issues

 * none


=== Tuscany ===

Tuscany simplifies the development, deployment and management of distributed
applications built as compositions of service components. These components
may be implemented with a range of technologies and connected using a
variety of communication protocols. Tuscany implements relevant open
standards including, but not limited to, the Service Component Architecture
standard defined by the OASIS OpenCSA member section, and related
technologies.

Incubating since: 2005-11-30

Top issues? None, graduation votes have started!

News

- Releases: SCA 1.2 and SDO 1.1 are out and SDO 1.1.1 RCs are currently
under review

- Voted in three new committers - Mario Antollini, Feng Wang, and Giorgio
Zoppi

- Tuscany presentations at several conferences including PyCon Italia Due,
OASIS Symposium, and JavaOne

- strengthening of links with other open source communities such as with the
Apache ODE BPEL community and with the communities around OSGi

- Six students undertaking Google Summer of Code projects with Tuscany


=== WSRP4J ===

Failed to report.  One item of interest is that the community has engaged
the Legal Committee regarding blocking concerns with respect to IP.


=== XAP ===

Failed to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Lenya Project

Community
========
We added one new comitter, Markus Angst, and two PMC members, Juergen
Ragaller and Richard Frovarp.
We are holding another Lenya meeting, in Freiburg, Germany in June.

Technical Issues
============
We picked up roadmap discussions again, as well a new approach to the
navigation framework.
We are also working on a 2.0.1 maintenance release.

Legal Issues
==========
none


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Logging Project

Apache log4cxx 0.10.0 was released on April 3rd.  This is the first release
after incubation and came almost 4 years after the release of log4cxx 0.9.7
which is now thankfully relegated to the archives.  The release of 0.10.0
has increased activity on the mailing lists and issue tracking.  An 0.10.1
release with minor fixes is anticipated in the next reporting cycle
though one potential issue might warrant jumping to an 0.11.0.

log4j is overdue on an 1.2.16 maintenance release which will likely
occur in conjunction with a push for a release for Chainsaw.

log4j 2.0 development is still just a good intention.  A JIRA
project was started to collect feature requests.

log4net has had relatively quiet and is overdue for a release.

log4php continues to have no development or mailing list activity
and appears to have drifted back off into dormancy
after restarting incubation last summer.

Curt Arnold and Ron Grabowski both attended the Microsoft compatibility
lab in February.

Curt Arnold, Ron Grabowski, Paul Smith and Scott Deboy committed changes
to the SVN in the quarter.  Andreas Fester and Jacob Kjome participated
in the log4cxx 0.10.0 vote.  There was little or no activity from other PMC
members or committers in the period, many who have been dormant for
a long while.

* Export Notifications

The following is reiterated from the previous board report:

The log4cxx, log4j and log4net code bases were reviewed
and did not appear to require a notice.  Chainsaw
and log4php were not reviewed, but are considered
unlikely to contain issues.

log4cxx depends on APR-Util which requires a notice
due to the SSL abstraction, however log4cxx does
not use that feature in APR-Util.

log4net when compiled for the .NET Compact Framework 1.0
calls Win32's CryptGenRandom for random numbers, but no
other methods from the platform's encryption API.

log4j had no identified issues.



-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Perl Project

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since the last report.


--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

2.0.4 - April 16, 2008


--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server. It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

No new Apache-Test releases since the last report.


--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments. It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since the last report.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

This quarter marks the first release of Apache-Reload since we
imported the codebase.

0.10 - February 25, 2008



-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be an active and healthy development community -
bugs are found, bugs are fixed, development moves forward as usual.


-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is, as always, thriving. Nothing noteworthy
has happened since the last report.


-- PMC --

We're in the process of a formal vote on granting commit karma to
a new developer. Expect an update next quarter.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache POI Project

OOXML Support
-------------
The OOXML support has been improving quite a bit in the last quarter.

Starting in late March, running through to mid April, there was a lot of
debate on existance / non-existance of legal issues surrounding
implementing the OOXML support. Much of this took place on public lists,
especially poi-dev.

With help from pmc members and board members, we were able to clarify many
points, and draw up a small list of outstanding queries. These have now
been passed on to Microsoft, and we're hoping for the clarifications /
statements we seek in the near future.


Community
---------
We added three new committers + PMC members this quarter. These were Josh
Micich, David Fisher and Paolo Mottadelli

The lists have remained nicely active. We had several well received
sessions at ApacheCon EU, and lots of people there were keen to talk to us
about POI.


Releases
--------
We released a beta of POI 3.1 a few weeks ago. This carries on from the 3.0
series, and includes a great many bug fixes. We hope to do a final release
of this in the near future.

The first alpha release of POI 3.5 (including ooxml support) is on hold,
pending clarification on the legal issues from Microsoft.

Attachment P: Status report for the Apache Roller Project

Since our last report in February the Roller project has been making slow
progress on two fronts: Roller 4.0 and Roller 4.1, mostly in the form of
testing and bug fixes. Community is healthy, though we have seen some
slow-down in mailing list activity. Here are the details.

Roller 4.1 development, now in trunk

Roller 4.1 development is underway and since the Roller 4.0 release, we have
merged the work into the trunk. The proposal to Externalize user management
has been implemented, as has the proposal to add a Tag Data API so other
apps can get Roller's tag cloud data.

* See also Proposal Roller 4.1 Release
* See also list of issues resolved in our JIRA bug tracker

Apache Roller 3.1 completed, 3.1.1 RC6 ready for testing

No change in 3.1.1 status since last report. We still have not gotten votes
for release.

We shipped 3.1 on April 23, 2007. A number of significant problems
(including an XSS bug) were found and fixed. We are now testing a fix
release known as 3.1.1 RC6, made available October 4, 2007
(announcement here: http://tinyurl.com/ynmrtj).

Community health

Community health is good, but activity has slowed a little since Fall of
2007. Developers and users are active on the mailing lists, reporting bugs,
submitting patches and seeking support. An all-new talk on Advanced Apache
Roller was given ApacheCon EU 2008 and was submitted for ApacheCon US 2008.

Other matters

Review of encryption technologies is underway. At this point it appears that
our only usage of encryption is for password authentication, provided by
Spring Acegi and Commons Codec.

Attachment Q: Status report for the Apache Santuario Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Turbine Project

Status
======

The Turbine project continues on with its usual fairly low level of
activity. This quarter there was a burst of activity from those present
at ApacheCon eu.

The Turbine project has no board-level issues at this time.

Community changes
=================

No new committers were voted in since the last board report.

No new PMC members were voted in since the last board report.

Turbine core project
====================

There has been quite a bit of progress towards Turbine 2.3.3:

   * Thomas Vandahl has added l10n support to the ParameterParser
(cleaning up the code quite a bit in the process) and integrated this
into the Intake validation service. In the process of doing this Thomas
has removed a few undesirable service interdependencies, thus resolving
a long standing stumbling block on our quest to separate the services
out of turbine core.
   * Dependency versions have been updated.

The 2.3.3 release is now pretty much ready to go. Thomas Vandahl is
mentoring Juergen Hoffmann through the release process.

Discussion on the naming of a future trunk release has been kicked off.
The possibility of jumping to "Turbine 4" is being considered.

Henning stopped by and committed a DOAP file for the Turbine project.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

Fulcrum component project
=========================

Siegfried Goeschl continues to commit tweaks to the fulcrum components
as well as some work on migrating the build process to Maven 2. Thomas
has also been maintaining fulcrum components in parallel with the
equivalent changes to turbine core.

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.

META project
============

No beta or final releases were made since the last board report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Velocity Project

May 2008 Board Report

Velocity remains a mature product. Development activity this past quarter
was mild and focused on preparation of the Velocity Tools 2.0 codebase
towards an upcoming release. User mailing list traffic remains at 1-2
messages a day with responses generally answered quickly.

The Velocity project currently has no board-level issues at this time.

Community Changes
---
Since the last board report, Chris Schultz has been added as a new committer.

Crypto Status
---
As requested, the PMC chair has reviewed the ASF notes on cryptography
export notification. Since Velocity has no crypto code, and no links or
dependencies on such code, these requirements do not apply to our project.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache Xalan Project

Xalan-C
=======
The xalan-c-users mailing list is in low activity, about 20 posts per
month, with 1/3 of those being from David Bertoni who is answering
questions.

The next release is not in plan.

Xalan-J
=======

The xalan-j-users mailing is in low activity, about 40 posts per month.
Questions are being answered mostly by Henry Zongaro, Joe Kesselman and
Mukul Gandhi.

The next release is not in plan.

LEGAL
======
The PMC has not looked into the crypto policy but Brian Minchau will raise
the issue on the xalan-dev mailing list and an update to this report may be
made before the board meeting in May 2008.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment U: Status report for the Apache Xerces Project

Xerces-J

Xerces-J was fortunate to be awarded one Google Summer of Code project for
2008. Starting this month Hiranya Jayathilaka (the new student) will be
working on [WWW] type alternatives for the XML Schema 1.1 implementation which
has been under development on a branch in SVN.

We received several patches in April for improving memory management in the
DOM implementation. These should help orphaned DOM objects to get garbage
collected sooner. Just waiting for the contributor to get their CLA faxed in
before committing them.

We're getting requests again to put our jars in Apache's Maven repository.
Since none of the Xerces developers are familiar with Maven or the repository
we're going to ask again for help from the community to create the POMs and
upload the jars to the appropriate place(s). For communities which don't use
Maven it would be nice if the repository managers took care of this.


Xerces-C

Due to potentially frequent changes that may be required to support various
scripting languages it was decided on the c-dev mailing list to split the swig
directory into two separate distributions: Xerces-SWIG (SWIG interface
definitions) and Xerces-P (Perl-specific part).

The work is underway to align the DOM XPath interfaces defined by Xerces-C++
with the implementation of XPath 2 provided by the XQilla project. This should
allow out-of-the box integration (currently requires patching of Xerces-C++
2.8.0) as well as cleaner user code (no casts) once Xerces-C++
3.0.0 is released.

The first beta for the upcoming 3.0.0 release helped identify a number of
problems which were addressed. A number of bugs have been fixed since the beta
release. The plan is to release another beta in the 1-2 months timeframe once
the XQilla-related work is completed as well as the remaining important bugs
are fixed.


Xerces-P

Xerces-P split out of the Xerces-C SVN repository back into it's own space, as
well as breaking into a new xerces-swig SVN space in order to contain the
Perl-independent parts of the SWIG bindings for Xerces.

Xerces-P had a lot of activity this quarter getting ready for a 3.0 joint
release of Xerces-P and Xerces-C. A lot of bug-fixing and improvements were
added. First 3.0 Beta will be released in first week of May.

The Xerces-P project is suffering from a lack of help, and a lack of
oversight. It is hoped that by having the language independent bindings, it
will attract more assistance from other language communities such as Ruby,
Tcl, and Python...


XML Commons

Nothing much to report. Just a few posts to the mailing list on the behaviour
of the resolver. One minor improvement was made to xml-commons-external to
allow applications to more easily clear their JAXP system property settings.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Status report for the Apache XML Project

From a general point of view, there is very little to report for the XML
project. No activity at the PMC level, and no particular issues requiring
board attention.

Everything is quiet in Xindice with the exception of few bug fixes.
Occasional questions on users mailing list are getting answered.

No activity to report for AxKit.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment W: Status report for the Apache XML Graphics Project

General Comments

There are no project-level issues.

XML Graphics Commons

We've released XML Graphics Commons 1.3 (with the new image loading
framework). Since then a number of bugfixes and minor enhancements
happened which results in version 1.3.1 to be released shortly.

Batik

Very little development activity since the last release. There was some
discussion about turning Batik into an SVG plug-in for browsers but so
far it's just a good idea.

FOP

We've release FOP 0.95beta. Since then we've fixed a number of bugs.
0.95 final is not far away. In the Trunk, normal development continues
while 0.95 is stabilized. The most notable changes are additional font
functionality and integer values for keeps.
