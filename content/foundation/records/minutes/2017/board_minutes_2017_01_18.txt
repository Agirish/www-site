 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The item from the December meeting regarding the Role of Brand
       Management as it relates to PMCs has continued to generate vigorous
       discussion over the last month. The agenda this month draws several
       conclusions from that discussion.

       During the meeting, a question was raised regarding the ability of a
       director, who serves as an officer, to participate in a discussion or
       vote pertaining to their role. As a result of this discussion, I’ve
       added an agenda item for the board to confirm that this in itself poses
       no conflict of interest.

       This led to a separate perceived conflict of interest being raised,
       which unfortunately became heated and singled out an individual,
       appearing to question their integrity. The concern was found to be
       without merit and withdrawn, and there is no outstanding concern over
       the individual's actions in any capacity.

       The incident highlighted the need for Directors, and officers
       participating in board discussions, to maintain a respectful attitude
       toward each other during difficult conversations.


       I have not yet proposed a date for the Annual Meeting, but will do so on
       the board mailing list in the next couple of weeks. It is to be held no
       later than 22 April, however I expect to maintain the timing we’ve used
       in March if practical.

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall
       =======

       My current priorities: brand, fundraising, EA/TAC, then FY18 budget.
       Depending on timing, FY18 budget will likely rise in priority.

       Thanks go out to the board for approving the FY17 budget.  As mentioned
       in the last board meeting, I'd like to discourage the board from
       deferring the FY18 budget to the next board as revisiting the budget
       mid-year is always a possibility.  See the budget item below for more
       detail.

       Discussions have resurfaced concerning the equity of last calendar
       year's compensation.  As a part of this, I'm working with Greg and
       David to revisit whether FY17's budget needs to be tweaked and to see
       if there are better ways to plan for FY18.  Operations is also working
       closely with the Treasurer and Virtual to revise how compensation
       related disbursements are approved and tracked in order to maintain
       privacy.

       Other discussions have made it clear that there is a need to
       reestablish and maintain a safe working environment for officers.  To
       help address the specific and immediate problem, I've added a
       resolution that gives the board an opportunity to reaffirm that Brand
       Management has been operating in the best interests of the foundation.

       More generally, the scope of Brand Management is not the last of the
       contentious issues that I will need guidance from the board on.  We
       need to work together to ensure that there is an environment where the
       relevant officers can not only participate but even are free to take
       uncomfortable or unpopular positions, and not allow those with
       differing opinions to seek to question their integrity.

       Finally, I'd like to once again apologize for the frequency which with
       I contributed to the discussion.  I should have allowed a greater
       opportunity for others to speak and instead focused on re-teeing up the
       discussion items for this month's board meeting as well as preparing
       one or more resolutions.


       Brand Management
       ================

       Brand Management is continuing to work with the Podlings and PMCs that
       are willing to work within the constraints of the published ASF
       Trademark Policy, and per my direction is deferring activity related to
       the remainder of the projects.

       A summary of those policies has been published at:

       http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/policies.html

       I continue to seek clarification and guidance from the board on this
       matter.  And have added a discussion item again this month to cover
       this topic.  Additional background can be found in the Brand Management
       report.

       Meanwhile, Mark is making progress on producing a private JIRA instance
       for tracking trademark (as well as security) issues, and will be
       starting with some pilot projects.


       Fundraising
       ===========

       In conjunction with the Assistant Treasurer and VP of Marketing of
       Publicity, the possibility of making use of the facilities provided by
       Hopsie (https://hopsie.com/) are being explored.   Benefits include an
       (as of yet unknown) increase in funds raised (largely by providing
       gentle reminders to repeat donors), and to improve on our ability to
       send out thanks.  The plan is to proceed with the free trial period and
       if the expectation is that this will pay for itself in increased
       donations, to select one of the paid plans going forward.


       EA/TAC
       ======

       As we are in the lull between conferences, not much activity to report
       this month.  The EA also took some much needed time off.

       Melissa did add three new members to TAC.  It turns out that two of
       these individuals are not ASF members, and this was done without
       consulting with the existing TAC members.  This is being revisited.


       Budget
       ======

       The first thing to be aware of is that the FY17 is that it doesn't
       include substantial strategic investment beyond the normal (and
       continual) focus on retiring technical debt and aging hardware.  In
       other words, it is the new normal.  In fact, the infrastructure costs
       for FY18 are likely to go up as the plan will be to be fully staffed
       for the full year, and little (if any) savings resulting from the
       investigations into reducing the infrastructure cost per project will
       be realized in this timeframe.

       On the plus side, we have more than adequate cash reserves, so none of
       this is an immediate problem that needs to be addressed.  But back of
       the envelope calculations indicate that we will run out of money in
       four to six years.

       So in addition to a year+1 (i.e. FY18) budget, I plan to start
       exploring what a year+5 (i.e., FY22) budget outline would look like.
       The hope is that this will give us an opportunity to discuss topics
       like whether or not we need TAC or need an ED five years from now, and
       to work backwards to determine what steps we should be taking along the
       way to make that happen.

       My ideal would be that the board has complete say over the five year
       plan and individual officers have complete say over the one year plan
       subject only to the constraint that their plan conforms to the five
       year plan.  I recognize that this ideal isn't practical as officers
       will need to have some say in what is possible, and the board isn't a
       mere rubber stamp for the one year plan.

       I'd like to discourage the board, however, from selecting individual
       contractors (DLAPiper was discussed in board meetings a few months
       ago), and making use of a line item veto.  A few illustrative examples
       as to why that might be: Fundraising's input may be that given one
       level of investment we can expect a given level of income; with
       additional investment we can expect more.  Selecting a lower level of
       investment and a higher level of return isn't an option.  More
       subtlely, there are some variables, like the rate at which new projects
       are accepted, that affect multiple line items.


       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       We have started preparing the production and filing of the FY2016 990 for the
       ASF which is due on March 15 2017.

       We are also currently trying to figure out how to convert our significant
       bitcoin balance into traditional currency and are waiting for Virtual to come
       back with guidance on that.

       Especially VP Infrastructure has seen problems with our current SVN based
       invoice submission and approval process which in principal is open for all
       members to see. This transparency has caused unneccessary and painful
       discussions. In order to protect employee and contractor privacy and to simplify
       the reimbursement process, we will be looking into third-party expense
       management solutions to replace the current system. We hope to have a concrete
       proposal for next month's board meeting.

       Virtual Update:

       Here is a brief summary of the Foundation's performance through December
       2016.

       Cash at December 31st 2016 was $1,598K, which is down $100.9K from last
       month's ending balance (Nov 2016) of $1,698.9K, due to monthly AP.   The
       December 2016 cash balance is up $14.4K from the December 2015 month end
       balance of $1,583.5K.  The December 2016 ending cash of $1,598K represents a
       cash reserve of 15.7 months based on the FY17 Cash forecast average monthly
       spending of $100.8K/month. The "Estimated" yearend cash reserve for
       the ASF, based on the Cash Forecast tab  is  16.3 months and the reserve
       continues to be very healthy for an organization of ASF’s size.

       Regarding the Cash P&L, the Foundation's total revenue YTD through
       December 2016 was $546.8K and is behind the "UPDATED" budget by
       $37.5K.  We will connect with the VP of Fundraising to review the outstanding
       Sponsorship billing.  Sponsorship payments were received from the following
       Sponsor in December 2016:  iSIGMA for $20K.

       In December expenses were under budget by $12K due primarily to Publicity
       underspending.  We have in the forecast moved that spending forward.  Because
       we have an adjusted budget with actuals through Nov 2016 and we have moved
       underspending from Dec forward for Publicity the YTD variance is the same as
       the Monthly variance, for Dec 2016.  The rest of the depts. had small
       variances that washed each other out in total for the month of Dec 2016.
       Regarding the bottom line the Foundation on a YTD Cash Basis has generated a
       Net deficit of -$184.9K,vs a budgeted net deficit of -$159.2K for FY17. The
       deficit shows that the Foundation is investing in area’s such as Branding
       and Infra and we have moved underspending and sponsor billing forward
       accordingly to address this for the YTD numbers. 

       So in summary with the close of the first month of the "UPDATED
       BUDGET" for 2017 we are still on track both from an expense and a revenue
       standpoint.

       We continue to work on the FY 16 990 with the CPA, and have a target date of
       Wed Jan 18th to send it to the CPA, with the final due date to the IRS of
       3.15.17.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       December was an average month of document filing for Secretary.

       In December, 77 iclas, two cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       I took the whole of December off in unexpected (personal) ways. Due to a mail reconfiguration (on my end) prior to the holidays I appear to have lost access to much of the ASF mail. This went unnoticed until the last couple of days when I resurfaced from an unexpected off the grid experience on the account supposed to be receiving ASF mail. Consequently I am doubly out of touch, though priority ASF mail is still routed to my day job account and thus has been processed.My apologies for the absenteeism.

       Infrastructure

       The big news is that it is now a priority to move a few test projects to Gitbox. This is (hopefully) the last stage before the full roll out of an improved experience for projects wishing to use Git as their primary source control repository.

       For the long range the infra team have set a goal of moving "all services off ASF-owned hardware". Though I note some apparent contradictions between this goal and some short term activity, e.g. "Finalizing launching Fisheye services locally at the  ASF to replace the third-party service run by Atlassian". After checking with the infra team I confirmed that this item means moving to an ASF owned service but not moving to ASF owned hardware.

       The infra team also provide some community engagement numbers. This is a new practice and one that should be encouraged given concerns that Infra has become divorced from the broader community wishing to contribute to our infrastructure efforts. The headline here is that there are non-infra patches being applied to areas such as the puppet work.

       There is no progress as yet for the "cost per project" analysis.

       Rich: Still have a large number of podlings in the incubator;

       Shane: It appears that the issue is the number of active
       Mentors.

       Mark: In the past, problems were that the podlings were
       straining the structures of the Foundation; but now, this is
       not such an issue;

       Ross: This discussion should focus on long term budget not
       mentoring

       Sam: There are the two issues: budget and mentoring.

       Jim: Seems to be a disconnect between board and IPMC; may need
       better communication.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. There seems to be an unmet need for documentation of overall ASF
       policy.  Either a single page, or a small set of pages, authored
       and maintained by the board would be helpful.  Ideally this list
       would be light on details and heavy on pointers.

       The consensus of the board is that this is worthwhile to pursue.

    B. Role of Brand Management as it relates to PMCs.  Do we empower PMCs
       to do what is best for their communities, and let a thousand flowers
       bloom, even to the point where we allow actions that may limit our
       abilities to enforce our marks?  Or do we treat Brand as a core part of
       our unique Apache model for community, and require consistency in
       approach across all PMCs and third parties, even if it means denying
       use of marks to friendly third parties in ways that would benefit
       communities?

       More specifically:

         1) Is the Trademark Policy a policy or a set of best practices?
            https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/

         2) Are PMCs the wrong tool for trademark enforcement?


       The board has previously concluded that brand management has the
       authority to set branding policy for the foundation and for PMCs
       (Minutes: July 16, 2014).

       PMCs may request exceptions to policy, and such exceptions are to be
       publicly documented. In addition to this policy, Brand Management
       provides best practices for PMCs to handle branding issues.

       The board concludes that PMCs are a valid means for trademark enforcement,
       and are responsible for handling all external branding issues they become
       aware of. PMCs may request assistance from Brand Management as required.
       However, Brand Management does not unilaterally handle branding issues.

    C. Discussion of Brand Management during the December meeting raised a
       question about whether a Director who serves as VP, Brand Management
       would have a conflict of interest by participating in the discussion.

       The Board concludes that Directors who also serve as non-compensated,
       volunteer officers are not presumed to have a conflict of interest
       when discussing or voting upon topics related to their officer
       role(s), aside from their own appointment or continuance as an
       officer.

          Status: Complete. A discussion was launched on dev@stratos in December
                  ( https://s.apache.org/KXBg ). No objections were raised to
                  retiring the project. A few weeks later, I asked for a
                  volunteer to submit the Attic resolution for Stratos and to
                  carry through the steps of moving to the Attic (
                  https://s.apache.org/9Rm0 ). Imesh Gunaratne stepped forward
                  and has created ATTIC and INFRA Jira issues. No resolution was
                  submitted, but I have now taken the liberty of adding it
                  myself, as I believe that the consensus to retire is clear and
                  that there is no point in drawing this out further.

                  as to improving their "what is it" messaging. We'll see in
                  next quarter's report whether they make any change, as there
                  was no response on-list.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Nothing to report; I've been catching up on emails from my absence.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

As noted in last month's report, we await ratification by the board as to the
status of brand policy and unresolved questions thereon (as is amply reflected
in mailing list archives). 

Separately, it is clear we lack the volunteer time to respond to questions
from outside parties and PMCs with either the timeliness, or the consistent
and knowledgeable answers and assistance that our projects and contributors
deserve.  I do not have a solution to this long-term issue other than the
documentation already provided, so I look to President and the board as a
whole to help brainstorm.

In particular, while we have detailed documentation and education on a wide
variety of trademark related questions, it is clear from recent experience
that what's provided is not sufficient to better educate our project
communities and our Membership.

* OPERATIONS

Issues and questions are far behind normal answers given the long,
contentious, and confusing threads about all of brand policy (or lack
thereof).  Attempting to answer Member questions, deal with the harsh
rhetoric, and providing additional explanations for brand activities sucked up
virtually all available volunteer time over the past month.

Additional documentation was created in response to questions, including
listings of both selected known trademark issues requiring evaluation, as well
as a listing of known cases where non 
detailed overview of all existing brand documentation:

https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/policies

I co-presented "Trademarks In Open Source" at the Practising Law Institute
legal education conference, which was very well received.

* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

Signed updated event contract for a major Hadoop-related conference.

Our CASSANDRA application in the US has published for opposition.
 
Several requests are still in process at various stages.

Sam asked about a proposal for increasing the ASF revenue and Hadrian is
preparing it.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Finances & Operations
=====================
We've been working with Virtual to deal with a process improvement
that results in better privacy protections for HR-related data
for our contractors and employees. 


Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Get one or more projects launched on the Gitbox system
- Training of our new staffers, particularly towards VM migration
- LDAP changes to support podlings, and to integrate it within our
  supported services (eg. Sonar and Roller)


Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Move all services off ASF-owned hardware, including the difficult
  process of moving our email infrastructure
- Finish the use of puppet for all services, then explore to move
  towards upgrading to Puppet 4, and/or containers for ongoing service
  management


General Activity
================
- Tightened/streamlined git sync processes (see paragraph below)
- Ongoing conversation and development plans for integrating podling
  management into LDAP (and other ASF tooling; particularly, gitbox)
- Finalizing launching Fisheye services locally at the
  ASF to replace the third-party service run by Atlassian.
- Restructured the git repository request service (reporeq.apache.org)
  to better handle podlings, in particular assist them in setting the
  right name and notification lists.
- We suffered a catastrophic hardware failure on the physical machine 
  that was hosting the application side of Jira. The service was
  fully-puppetized and relocated to a VPS. More details will be
  published after a post-mortem, during the week of the 16th. 


Uptime Statistics
=================
Uptime for this month has been around 99.6% overall. Some issues with
git-wip running out of memory at times have pushed the uptime for this
down to around 98%. We are investigating the issue. blogs.apache.org
moved to a new host, which also caused a small amount of downtime.
Jira going down hard has not helped.

For more details, please visit: http://status.apache.org/sla/


Github as Master
================
The GitBox project is pending responses from the pilot projects before
it can continue. We are looking at multiple potential candidates at the
moment for this. Rather than wait on external groups, we will be using
Infrastruture's own website repository for our testing.


Git mirror/GitHub sync process
==============================
The sync process between Subversion and Writeable git repositories to
git.apache.org and onwards to GitHub has been suffering from missed
syncs lately, at an approximate rate of 1 miss out of every 10 hits. The
process has been improved and the logging also widened, so we can better
analyze any failures that may occur. The upgrades appear to have cut
down on the missed syncs by a large factor. We have, as of this writing,
had 2 missed syncs compared to the 100 or so we usually have, and both
seem to be attributed to timeouts pushing to github. The error rate
going from git-wip to the pubsub system has been reduced from around
10-20 errors per day to 0 by refactoring the pubsub agent. We continue
to monitor the situation and address any bugs that may show up.


Community Growth 2016
=====================
Since this is a new year, it might be worth looking back at 2016:
- We had 34 people contributing to our codebase (puppet) for the first
  time in their involvement with the ASF, compared to 12 people who
  regularly contribute to the repo.
- 354 new people have filed an issue with infra for the first time,
  while 329 people, who regularly work on issues, have also been
  contributing to the 2,321 issues created in 2016.
- 9 people who were previously active on JIRA have now started
  contributing code (patches etc) to Infra.


'Costs per project' Project
===========================
Unfortunately, I've been a bit swamped with other things
and this hasn't gotten many cycles. Expect more on this 
issue next month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

We are now one month out from the CFP for ApacheCon North America
closing, so we are still not seeing a lot of action. So far we have 38
papers submitted for ApacheCon, and 40 for Apache: Big Data. While we
usually get 75% of the submissions in the last 2 weeks, I do
nevertheless encourage you to go ahead and submit your talks if you
have something already in mind.

Email will go out to our users@ and dev@ mailing lists today or
tomorrow reminding everyone of the upcoming CFP deadline, and of the
next registration rate change deadline. A draft of that email appears
on the dev@community.apache.org mailing list. Another email will be
going to the committers@apache.org mailing list with a registration
code within the next few days.

We had a very encouraging call with the Linux Foundation yesterday in
which they went over their marketing plan with us. I can provide
additional detail to anyone who is interested. Meanwhile, Sally and I
will be coordinating with LF in the coming 6 months to promote the
CFP, registration, sponsorship, and then doing post-conference
promotion to lead up to the next event.

In the past, we have stated a "requirement" that projects display an
"upcoming event" image on their project website. A combination of
factors have resulted in that no longer being a reality. In the coming
weeks I hope to 1) provide the necessary images and 2) reach out to
the various PMCs to ask/encourage them to resume this 

At the beginning of next month, we will participate in FOSDEM. This
effort has been headed up by Sharan Foga and Daniel Gruno, as last
year. We have a table in the expo area, and are producing various
small swag items to give away. We have asked projects to step up to
take an hour at the table to promote their project. We also have a
number of speakers appearing in various tracks and devrooms. Further
details of our FOSDEM participation may be found at
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COMDEV/FOSDEM+2017

Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

As you all know, I have been on sick leave for the past three weeks.
In my absence, Nick Burch has taken care of several issues (thank you
SO much, Nick!!):

* Recorded the surveys received from Seville
* Sent out the interview questions to those who agreed from the surveys
* Started to make the changes on the application questions (awaiting
  confirmation that he's received all the requested
  changes/additions/modifications)
* Call for judges emailed

Applications are scheduled to open on January 19th.  Nick is working
with Freddy (from Infra) on a project to migrate tac-vm2. 

Apps close on March 8th Judges call planned for March 10-12th Budget
approval by March 13th

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Summary

The project is active and there are no Board-level issues at this time.
We have made no new releases since the previous report and have
added two committers/PMC members. We forgot to mention in our last
report that our trademark registration for ACCUMULO in the US has
been granted! We also amicably resolved a trademark issue with the
GitHub organization "accumulo" [1].

Releases

There have been no new releases since the last report.
The latest release was version 1.6.6 on 9/18/2016.

Activity

The number of subscribers to the dev list and the user list has
decreased slightly. User list activity has increased slightly, while
activity for other mailing lists has decreased from the previous quarter.
Activity is still generally strong.

In the past 3 months, there have been 81 commits to the master branch
from 14 authors, 5 of whom are not yet committers.

We have not begun release planning for our next release, but have
63 of 122 issues resolved towards a 1.7.3 release, 31 issues resolved
for the 1.8 branch, and 58 issues resolved for the master (2.0) branch.

Community

Mike Miller was added as a committer and PMC member on 10/24/2016.
Mike Walch was added as a committer and PMC member on 11/3/2016.

Branding

We noticed that the "accumulo" organization on GitHub did not meet third
party branding guidelines. After we discussed this with the owners of the
organization, they transferred control of the organization to the Apache
Accumulo PMC and moved all third party repositories that had been
associated with the organization.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache ACE Project  [Marcel Offermans]

## Description:

 - Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to
   centrally manage and distribute modular software components, configuration
   data and other artifacts to OSGi based and related target systems.

## Issues:

 - Last time, the board asked us to clarify a couple of things:
   - We mentioned there were off-list discussions about future work.  These
     were informal discussions between some committers, but nothing came out
     that was worth sharing. In hindsight we could have omitted this from the
     report.  We are obviously aware that any decisions need to be made on the
     list.
   - It was mentioned that activity was low, asking us if there are still 3
     PMC around.  We acknowledge that activity was (and still is) low, but
     there are still at least 3 PMC members around to answer questions and fix
     bugs.

## Activity:

 - Activity is still fairly low.

## Health report:

 - It is fair to say that the project is in "maintenance mode" at the moment.
   There are still enough PMC members around, but activity is low.

## PMC changes: 
 
 - Currently 11 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Bram de Kruijff on Mon Jul 08 2013

## Committer base changes: 
 
 - Currently 12 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Bram Pouwelse at Thu Feb 25 2016

## Releases:

 - February 9th, 2016: ACE 2.1.0 release.

## Mailing list activity: 
 
 - users@ace.apache.org: 
 - 74 subscribers (down -2 in the last 3 months): 
 - 2 emails sent to list (11 in previous quarter) 
 
 - dev@ace.apache.org: 
 - 70 subscribers (down -2 in the last 3 months): 
 - 3 emails sent to list (4 in previous quarter)

## JIRA activity: 
 
 - 1 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 0 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Airavata Project  [Suresh Marru]

## Description: 
Apache Airavata is a distributed system software framework to manage
simple to composite applications with complex execution and workflow 
patterns on diverse computational resources.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - The community is active and rocking. 
   
## Health report: 
 - The project remains healthy. The community has found a rhythm in
transitioning active developers. We see a cycle of new contributors
taking more pro-active role while previously active developers answer 
key design questions. The project should brainstorm mechanisms to further
retain contributions from folks moving on.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 22 PMC members. 
 - Eroma Abeysinghe was added to the PMC on Sun Dec 11 2016

PMC is planning to release 0.17 within next 2 to 3 weeks. 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - The mailing list traffic is steady and nothing concerning, hence omitting.
   
## JIRA activity: 
   
 - 131 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 156 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Apex Project  [Thomas Weise]

## Description:

Apache Apex is a distributed, large-scale, high throughput,
low-latency, fault tolerant, unified stream and batch processing
platform.

## Issues:

There are no issues that require the Board's attention.

## Status/Activity:

In November the community released 3.6.0 of Apex Malhar library, which
added the initial version of SQL support using Apache Calcite,
improvements to windowed state management performance and scalability,
expanded user documentation and many other improvements.

In December followed the 3.5.0 release of Apex Core, which is the stream
processing engine. The previous release was 3.4.0 in May and releases are
generally less frequent than the library. The release contains several
operability improvements and also moves the Apache Hadoop dependency from
2.2 to 2.6, enabling the engine to take advantage of newer features in
Apache Hadoop YARN.

Apex is now also present in Apache Beam; the first version of the
Apex runner is part of the recent 0.4.0 Beam release.

Another integration with Apache SAMOA (incubating) was also completed
recently. Apache SAMOA is an open source platform for mining big data
streams and allows multiple Distributed Stream Processing Engines (DSPEs)
to be integrated into the framework.

Apex was presented at Apache Big Data in Seville, at Big Data Spain in Madrid,
Big Data Conference in Phoenix and also as part of the Apache Beam tutorial
at Strata Singapore. We continue to see increase in interest and adoption, 
more info can be found on the Powered By page on the project web site.

   enterprise OSGi application programming model.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - As a community we made 3 releases this quarter and 3 further releases
   currently under vote, and added Johannes Utzig as a new committer.
   
## Health report: 
 - The PMC were requested by the board to consider if there are any
   potential PMC candidates among the current committers. There was some
   discussion, but no people were decided upon. This will be discussed
   again in the coming days.
 - A new contribution of the JAX-RS Services OSGi specification Reference
   Implementation has been contributed from Carlos Sierra Andrés. This
   specification is currently in draft.
 - The number of subscribers to the dev@ user@ private@ and commits@ lists
   are roughly consistent (down by 0-3 in the last 3 months).
 - The dev@ list traffic is consistent, while the user@ traffic has been
   down over last three months. However, there has been a wide variety of
   discussion across the different modules within Aries.
 - Despite 32 issues being closed off, the number opened was slightly
   higher in the past 3 months.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description: 
Arrow is a columnar in-memory analytics layer designed to accelerate big data.
It houses a set of canonical in-memory representations of flat and
hierarchical data along with multiple language-bindings for structure 
manipulation. It also provides IPC and common algorithm implementations.
  
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
  
## Activity: 
- Arrow has made great progress since the last report. 
- The community has actively been driving towards a set of cross-language 
  compatibility tests. These are now complete.
- The compatibility tests were a key gate identified to seeing the
  specification as solidified. Now that it is, the community will be starting
  work on our second release.
- This release will show the arrow projects java arrow, arrow-cpp, py-arrow
  and Parquet's parquet-cpp all working nicely together.
  
## Health report: 
- A core group of community members continue to make good progress on various 
  aspects of both the Java, C++ and python projects. 
- We're seen a small number of casual contributors arrive and provide 
  additional patches to the project.
- Multiple people have been doing community outreach through the various blog 
  posts, meetups and conference presentations. Examples include
  - Upcoming talk at Strata San Jose in March
  - Upcoming talk at Dataworks Summit Munich in April
  - Arrow and Pandas vision: https://s.apache.org/arrow_1701_01
  - Python Data Wrangling talk: https://s.apache.org/arrow_1701_02

Attachment J: Report from the Apache AsterixDB Project  [Till Westmann]

Description:

Apache AsterixDB is a scalable big data management system (BDMS) that
provides storage, management, and query capabilities for large collections
of semi-structured data.

Activity:

- Development and discussions are active, the community is healthy and
  engaged.
- The activity to make AsterixDB more extensible is ongoing. The BAD (Big
  Active Data) extension of AsterixDB is now maintained in a separate
  repository and relies on available extension points.
- Couchbase is working on another extension that supports a tighter
  integration with Couchbase server.
- SQL++ has been added as a second query language for semi-structured data.
  There is hope that its more familiar syntax can help to increase interest
  in AsterixDB.
- A lot of activity around the first non-incubating release. Most release
  activities are around generating LICENSE and NOTICE files based on
  manually curated and version controlled metadata. RC1 is currently under
  review on the dev list.

Issues:

- There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

PMC/Committership changes:

Wenhai Li was added as a committer on 2016-10-05.
The last committer added was Wenhai Li on 2016-10-05.
The last PPMC/PMC member added was Michael Blow on 2016-03-28.
Jochen Wiedmann resigned from the PMC on 2016-10-26.

Releases:

AsterixDB graduated from the Incubator on April 20, 2016. The last releases
were on February 26, 2016: AsterixDB 0.8.8-incubating and Hyracks
0.2.17-incubating.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Henri Yandell]

The Attic is where projects slumber when their communities fade away.

DeviceMap moved to the Attic last quarter, and Etch's move to the Attic 
was completed.

Nothing much else to report - low activity, but there's little in the 
way of priority items that need to be done.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently there are 20 PMC members.
 - Last PMC addition was Herve Boutemy on Sat Jul 18 2015

## Mailing list activity:

 - general@attic.apache.org:
    - 36 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 41 emails sent to list (85 in previous quarter) 

## JIRA activity:

 - 1 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 2 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Ryan Blue]

## Description:

 - Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - The 1.8.2 release candidate failed with too few PMC votes.

## Health report:

 - The 1.8.2 release candidate failed because only 2 PMC members
   voted. When discussed on the dev list, there were two
   suggestions to avoid this in the future. First, use open-ended
   votes to give PMC members more time to notice there is a vote.
   Second, the RM should reach out to PMC members to make sure
   they see that a vote is happening.

 - After last report IDF asked, "What steps precisely do you have
   planned to take to increase contributor engagement?" The step
   that the community agrees on is continuous integration to
   provide automated feedback to both contributors and committers.
   Not much has been done to set up automated testing.

   Part of the community is also in favor of splitting out
   implementations into separate repositories to make the project
   easier to work with. This idea is controversial and discussion
   has stalled without a resolution.

 - Last report stated, "Contributor engagement is still a goal we
   are working on. Many committers do not have time to review 
   patches." IDF asked, "Where does this time pressure come from?"
   To clarify, time pressure was a generous assumption. A more
   correct statement is simply that reviews are not keeping pace
   with contributions. Part of the community considers this a
   problem becuase without reviews we can't grow the community.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Davor Bonaci]

## Description:

Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:

There are no issues that require the Board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

Apache Beam was established as a top-level project at last month's Board
meeting. This is the first in the series of three consecutive monthly reports
for new projects.

Since becoming a top-level project, we have:
* completed administrative and infrastructure-related tasks to transition from
  a podling to a TLP,
* published the press release and a follow-up blog,
* published the first non-incubating release, version 0.4.0.

In addition, since the last report, we have participated in major conferences
and meetups, including:
* presented at Apache: Big Data Europe 2016 and ApacheCon's Podling Shark
  Tank, as well as and the Birds of Feather session,
* presented at QCon San Francisco 2016,
* presented at Strata + Hadoop World Singapore 2016, along with a hands-on
  Beam tutorial,
* co-organized a meetup with an Apache Apex user group, and presented at
  another meetup.

Beam continues to interconnect additional execution engines and data
storage/messaging systems. Since the last report, a runner for Apache Apex was
merged from a feature branch and released, and IO connectors for Elasticsearch
and MQ Telemetry Transport have been contributed.

Going forward, the main focus continues to be on community growth. On the
technical side, the next major milestone is the availability of the first
stable release, which will include backward-compatibility guarantees.

## Health report:

The community continues to grow steadily, as follows:
* The number of contributors continues to increase, with an expectation of
  additional committers in the near future.
* Releases continue at a regular pace of 1-1.5 months per release.
* Mailing list activity continues to increase, with some metrics doubling
  quarter-over-quarter (see below).

## PMC changes: 

Currently 14 PMC members. No new PMC members have been added since graduation
a month ago.

## Committer base changes: 
  
Currently 17 committers. No new committers have been added since graduation a

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Jesús Camacho Rodríguez]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and
planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-module within Calcite, and provides a framework for
building local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Since March
2016, Avatica has an independent release schedule, but resides in the
same git repository.
  
## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and
its Avatica sub-project. Since the last report there have been two
Calcite releases (1.10.0 and 1.11.0) and an Avatica release (1.9.0). 

Interest in Calcite by other projects and developers continues to
grow, and we have recently added a new PMC member.

There was an important presence of the Apache Calcite project in
Apache: Big Data Europe 2016 (Seville, Spain). In particular, there
were six talks revolving around Apache Calcite. Topics included
streaming SQL and integration with Druid, Apache Geode and Apache
Hive.

In addition, existing adapters that allow Calcite to read data from
other systems (JDBC, Druid, Apache Cassandra) continue gaining wide
adoption and multiple parties continue contributing to their
development.

Finally, work to extend Calcite SQL capabilities and improve Calcite
core has been ongoing for the last few months, consolidating existing
code as well as adding new features.
  
## Health report:

Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both
Calcite and Avatica.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

## Description:

Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Issues:

We are currently in the process of choosing a new PMC chair. The community
will also be asked if it's time for the project to go to the Attic.

## Activity:

The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14
2 JIRA issues opened since 2016-10-01
3 JIRA issues resolved since 2016-10-01
11 commits since 2016-10-01

There's only a little activity on both users and dev mailing-lists.

There have been some quite interesting changes since last release, at least
for 2.1 branch, which would deserve a release.

## PMC changes:

None. Most recent addition: 2012-07-06

## Committer base changes:

None. Most recent addition: 2012-07-06


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
 
## Activity: 

The JIRAs for the past few months have focused on core bug fixes and
iteration/fixes on the Apache Kafka support that we started on after our last
release in May. 
 
## Health report: 

The Crunch code does what it does well, and it has for at least a few
releases. Beyond bug fixes and supporting upgrades to new Hadoop/Spark
releases, there isn't an obvious new direction to take the project in that
would stay true to its original mission while remaining useful to developers.
In terms of project goals, API design, and even a subset of committers, Crunch
has a lot in common with the newly top-level Apache Beam project, which is
focused on the next generation of data processing engines that unify batch and
streaming use cases into a single API. Finding a way to join forces with Beam
is one available way forward for the project, but figuring out what that move
would look like would require some extensive discussions on the mailing lists,
both about the future of data pipelines in general as well as the role that
the Crunch community most wants to play.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

## Description:

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o Derby    : a relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
              testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
              persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Activity in the DB project was quite low this quarter, although we
did complete the Derby 10.13 release that was begun in the previous
quarter.

## Health report:

In general, the software in the DB project is mature and sophisticated,
and isn't undergoing much change, so periods of low activity occur.

In the Derby community, the largest project underway involves an
effort to ensure that Derby is compatible with the upcoming Java 9
release; members of the Derby community are engaged with the Java 9
community to test Derby using early access builds of Java 9.

BatchEE

BatchEE projects aims to provide a JBatch implementation (aka JSR352) and a
set of useful extensions for this specification.

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. some more activity probably (but since we are between specification
     releases it was expected)
  2. probably graduate
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No, BatchEE implements a JavaEE specification and its development cycle is
  pretty close to the specification, since there was no new version.  It is in
  maintenance mode for now which was expected.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Not much, BatchEE is stable and used with few container flavors (part of
  TomEE plus, used with tomee embedded, application composer, meecrowave, ...)

FreeMarker

FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text output
based on templates. FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class library for
programmers.

FreeMarker has been incubating since 2015-07-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  We think that the project is getting ready for a successful
  graduation, since during incubation we have cleared copyright and
  trademark, migrated all the project's assets to the ASF Infra,
  learned how to produce and publish releases (with 2 releases issued
  during incubation), learned how to invite committers. But, the
  project is still struggling to find a way to "convert" active users
  into committers; there are several users that have expressed the
  desire to be more involved and help the project, but this doesn't
  materialize into consistent contributions. In order to facilitate
  new contributions and attract new potential committers we are trying
  to define new ideas/tasks that are useful to the project but can be
  completed even by contributors who don't yet know the project in
  depth. We also plan to make a non-backward-compatible branch which
  is easier to contribute to because it removes the substantial
  complexity caused by the legacy burden, and also allows adding
  interesting new features that wouldn't be feasible with the backward
  compatibility constraints set more than 12 years ago.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

  1. Create some tutorial videos and blog posts to educate people on Gossip
     Project
  2. Focus on some critical technical improvements multi-node testing and
     accrual failure detection that will be critical for adoption into other
     projects

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - One contributor has been voted as a committer. There are 13 watches 24
    stars on github.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Some technical features were frozen out until we completed our first
  release. Effort was spent on doing the first release (getting access, key
  signing, correctly enabling RAT maven plugin etc). This was mostly one-time
  effort.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Josh Elser

    The podling put in a substantial amount of work to get their first
    release out. We noticed that their geospatial indexing support was
    bringing in a bunch of incompatibly licensed deps. Multiple members made
    an effort to both understand the problem and the potential to address it.
    I was/am very happy both with their patience, effort, and concern that
    was given to the problem. It was a good sign that they will pay attention
    to these kinds of problems on their own in the future (self-governing).

Traffic Control

Traffic Control allows you to build a large scale content delivery network
using open source.

Traffic Control has been incubating since 2016-07-12.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Licenses and legal details. Traffic Control is a project made up of
     several different components, and includes or depends on an extensive
     list of software. We are working on making sure all source files have
     the right headers, all the licenses of included software are compatible
     and the LICENSE and NOTICE are correct.
  2. Enhance automation to facilitate committer voting on new releases.
  3. Enhance documentation to ease ramp-up time for new community members.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?



How has the community developed since the last report?

  We hosted a 2 day user / dev meetup in the Bay Area in October that was
  attended by 16 people representing 5 companies.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  All code has been move to Apache git. All new issues are being opened
  in Apache JIRA. All email communications have been moved to to Apache
  email lists. Our website has been moved to
  http://trafficcontrol.incubator.apache.org/ .

  Since the last report (October 2016), we have

  * Merged 145 Pull Requests with 314 commits from 19 contributors
  * Opened 83 JIRA issues
  * Closed 45 JIRA issues
  * Seen 81 messages on the dev@ list in December (before December we
    had commit messages going to dev@ as well, so those numbers are not
    indicative of dev communications)

Date of last release:

  None yet. We are addressing issues with release 1.8-incubating RC5.

When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

  No new committers or PPMC members yet.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Gaul]

== Project Status ==

We have two new providers under review: 'packet.net' and 'vagrant'.
Additionally we are reviewing a large feature for the 'oneandone' provider.

We have seen some interest in supporting OpenStack Keystone v3. jclouds
currently supports the deprecated v2, which makes it hard to use jclouds with
new OpenStack installations difficult. Adding support for Keystone v3 is an
important step to continued OpenStack support, but will be a significant
addition that will require effort and coordination. There are currently no
full-time developers dedicated to jclouds, so this will likely be challenging.

== Community ==

The project continues to receive a moderate amount of issues and pull
requests, with regular questions and responses from community members on the
mailing list.

There have been some recent contributions from new contributors, with several
questions that demonstrated good understanding of the code. Given that the
jclouds codebase is perceived to have a steeper learning curve, this is
encouraging.

There are currently 11 PMC members and 23 committers.
 
Last committer: 2016-02-05 (Reijhanniel Jearl Campos)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

  - Help progress contributions to new and existing providers
  - Work towards a plan for OpenStack Keystone v3 support
  - Prepare for 2.0.1 bug fix release in Q1 2017
  - Prepare for GSOC 2017 by creating and tagging potential projects with
    "gsoc2017"

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 1.9.3, took place on 2016-11-23. 2.0.0 was released
shortly before that, on 2016-11-14.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data
applications in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards
for RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The project released 3.1.1 on the usual 6 month-ish cycle.  This has
been the regular project tick for the last couple of years but the
feeling is now that Jena is putting too much into a release and
that a 3 month cycle would be better.

Several major new contributions are in progress.

On the users list, there has been a lot of student-level questions,
particularly of the nature "ask-before-try", leading to some
pushback. After a discussion on dev@, the consensus is that this level
of questions is something that wil happen from time-to-time and unless
it is damaging, the core user community accepts it.

The PMC added Lorenz Buehmann as a committer in recognition of the
effort he provides in patiently answering many questions on users@.

StackOverflow continues to be a second source of user questions.

## Health report:

The level of activity is normal; a slight lull for December and
post-release is not uncommon.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Adam Soroka on Mon Jun 06 2016

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 15 committers.
 - Lorenz Buehmann was added as a committer on Fri Oct 28 2016

## Releases:

 - 3.1.1 was released on Tue Nov 08 2016

## Mailing list activity:

Normal levels.

## JIRA activity:

Normal Levels

 - 33 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Johnzon Project  [Hendrik Saly]

## Description:

Apache Johnzon is an implementation of JSR-353 (JavaTM API for JSON
Processing) and a set of useful extension for this specification like an
Object mapper, some JAX-RS providers and websocket (JSR-356) integration.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Status:

Graduation out of the incubator is completed, the first non-incubator release
was done on July 21, 2016. There is ongoing work to make Johnzon JSR-367
(JSON-B) compliant with significant work done in the latest 1.0.0 release. Its
also planned to implement JSR-374 (JSON-P 1.1), the successor of JSR-353.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos]

## Description:
- A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard JEE
components (Java, servlets, JSP).
  
## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity:
- This quarter has been a silent one, with all the activity mostly happening
  on holidays (roughly, second half of December, first half of January)
  
## Health report:
- Apache JSPWiki remains as a 100% volunteer effort, so quiet periods like
  this one are not uncommon. There were commits from 2 individuals on this
  period.
  
- This quarter should have seen some movement regarding the transition of
  jspwiki.a.o from ASF's CMS to JSPWiki. I voluntereed for this task, but
  have been totally away for almost all the quarter, so no progress here...
  
- All questions on ML where answered, and there are enough people to
  provide project oversight. Finally, there weren't new blog posts on this
    quarter.
     
## PMC changes:
  
- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Mailing list activity:
  
- As outlined on the Activity section, this has been a quiet quarter, which
  reflects on ML statistics:
  
- dev@jspwiki.apache.org:  
   - 87 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):
   - 47 emails sent to list (84 in previous quarter)
  
- user@jspwiki.apache.org:

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Karaf Project  [Jean-Baptiste Onofré]

## Description: 

  - Apache Karaf provides a very modern and polymorphic container,
    multi-purpose (microservices, OSGi, etc) powered by OSGi.
   
## Issues: 

  - As requested by the board, the Karaf PMC members decided to provide this
    new report to address board comments and questions. We want to apologize a
    new time for the delay to address those comments.
   
## Activity: 

  - We are maintaining our pace in the release. The next major release is
    4.1.0 on which we are working. This release will contain lot of feedback
    and contributions from the users.
  - We also continue to improve the Karaf subprojects, especially Karaf
    Decanter and Karaf Cellar. They both received important contributions from
    users.
  - We started a discussion on the dev mailing list about a new feature: Karaf
    Boot. The purpose is to simplify writing applications running on Karaf and
    provide easy way to package applications and Karaf all together. Due to
    the releases activity, the discussion was in stand-by, but we plan to
    restart the discussion and move forward about this.
  - We are beginning the work for a full JDK9 support, we expect to achieve
    the result in release 4.2.0

## Health report: 

  Apache Karaf has been receiving issue reports, patch submissions from down
  stream projects such as OpenHab and OpenDaylight.

  These projects use Apache Karaf as their runtime environment, their
  contributions upstream to Karaf help strengthen and grow our broader
  community.

  It's also interesting to see that Karaf received contributions from other
  Apache community, like Apache Unomi.

  Last month we quickly reacted to a CVE security request that we already
  fixed in last 4.0.8 release.

  We are still watching for new potential committers and PMCs, extending our
  dev community.

  Talks related to Karaf (directly or indirectly) were present during
  ApacheCon EU, promoting the project.

  We also received new requests and feedback from new users (on the mailing
  list and/or Jira) showing a healthy user community.

  We are trying to be active on related projects (Apache Felix, enRoute, ...)
  to increase the Karaf adoption and grow the user community.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description: 

Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues: 

No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Since the last report, we've made one minor release and one bug fix release.
Additionally, we branched for Kudu 1.2 which we expect to release by the
end of January.

In addition to the features that have landed in Kudu 1.1 and the upcoming
1.2, we have also made initial progress on adding various security-related
functionality to Kudu. It is not yet usable by end users, but some
infrastructure has landed in our master branch and we expect to provide
some basic security functionality in Kudu 1.3. Many users have cited lack
of security functionality as a barrier to adoption, so we expect to see an
up-tick in usage later this year as it becomes available.

## Health report: 

- Subscriptions to the user mailing list are up 14% over last quarter, with
  a comparable growth in traffic. Subscriptions to development-related lists
  have grown at a slower rate (~5%). Questions on both the mailing list
  and our Slack channel are typically answered within a day.

- Development velocity (as measured by commits and dev list traffic) is
  is slightly down from the previous quarter, likely due to a relatively
  quiet holiday period in December. That said, absolute levels are still
  healthy (4-5 commits per day)

- This quarter, we committed code authored by 21 distinct contributors, of
  whom 9 were new to the project. Of the 9 new contributors, 7 are unaffiliated
  with Cloudera, who employs the majority of active committers. This is a good
  sign for long term project diversity, though we still need to cultivate the
  new contributors and encourage continued involvement.

## PMC/Committer changes: 

 - Currently 16 PMC members and committers (all committers are PMC)
 - Last committer/PMC addition: Jordan Birdsell was added on Nov 8, 2016.

## Releases: 
   
 - Apache Kudu 1.0.1 was released on Tue Oct 11 2016 
 - Apache Kudu 1.1.0 was released on Mon Nov 21 2016

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

Description:

  The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for
  dynamic programming languages.  The Apache Clownfish "symbiotic" object
  system pairs with "host" programming language environments and facilitates
  the development of high performance language extensions.

Issues:

  There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Activity:

  The community made maintenance releases of Lucy and Clownfish.
  Long-discussed plans to revamp Clownfish to use interface inheritance
  rather than classical inheritance (a model more compatible with more host
  languages) have materialized into a concrete proposal which has basically
  achieved consensus.
   
Health report:

  The project continues to make releases and forward progress.  The C
  bindings seem to have attracted some new users based on increased user
  list activity.  The community is doing some of the things that it should
  to attract new contributors, but could do more.  As with last quarter,
  most commits are authored by one contributor; mailing list engagement is
  somewhat more diverse.

  There are currently 14 committers and 12 PMC members.  The last committer
  and PMC member change was Timothy Wilkens, who joined in September 2014.

Releases:
   
  - Apache Lucy 0.6.1 was released on Thu Dec 08 2016 
  - Apache Clownfish 0.6.1 was released on Thu Dec 08 2016 

Mailing list and JIRA activity:

  Mail volume on the dev and issues lists fell a bit further this quarter.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build
lifecycle.

* Issues

* Activity

  It has been quite a while since we did our latest release of Maven
  (3.3.9, 2015-11-15). The number of fixed issues for 3.4.0 is over 100 and
  there are enough good improvements which deserve a new release. Now that
  we control the codebase of Maven Artifact Resolver (formally known as
  Aether), quite some changes/bugfixes have been applied regarding managed
  dependencies. The intention is good, but the results are that the behavior
  and resolution has changed. This has led to reverts, recommits and a lot
  discussions about what is right. There's still no consensus, but we need a
  solution since this is blocking a new release.
  There has been a vote to reset 3 git repositories to a previous revision,
  i.e maven.git, maven-integration-testing.git and maven-resolver.git. The
  vote has passed and actions are in progress.
  We'll drop Maven 3.4.0 and rearrange all issues marked as fixed for 3.4.0,
  starting with a subset for 3.5.0. To prevent the same situation we must
  change our commit/push-style and work more with branches.

  Jason van Zyl has resigned as member of the JSR-376 Expert Group. Robert
  Scholte has replaced his seat on behalf of the Apache Maven team.

  Regarding the Jigsaw project Robert Scholte and Brian Fox have shared
  concerns regarding the naming strategy for automodules(jars without a
  module-info; names are based on the filename). The majority of the Maven
  PMC agrees and recognizes the issue from other systems. Robert and Brian
  are working on a paper with proposals.

  Migration of Maven's EC2 instance + S3 bucket (INFRA-12729) has been
  successfully completed with great help of infrastructure: in addition to
  expected lower cost, the new service gives better performance, which
  permitted work on content analysis. Sadly, growth of data is bigger than
  expected: we've already hit a full disk (INFRA-13213) even if provisionned
  capacity looked sufficient initially. We need to work again with infra to
  find a sustainable solution.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Sathwik Bantwal Premakumar]

## Description: 
Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web services 
orchestration using flexible process definitions.

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
We have released the new AngularJS based web console as on Nov 2016. The vote
for console release can be found here (https://s.apache.org/cdtH) and the
passing vote (https://s.apache.org/capW)

The release vote (https://s.apache.org/8RKP) for 1.3.7 was initiated in the
same month and had to request to restrain from voting as the json.org
licensing issue was raised across Apache projects.

It has been found that the old web console has some implementation from
json.org. We are in the process of solving it.


## Health report: 
ODE is very mature and stable, however the interest in BPEL has 
decreased significantly. Thus ODE's development is currently 
pretty much in maintenance mode.

## PMC changes: 

- Currently 15 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Marcus Lange]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. 
There are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument 
Format (ODF) that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With 
limited support for other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, 
macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux 32-bit and in more than 40 languages.

STATUS
======

The typical year-end slow-down due to Christmas, holidays and family 
visits in general has also reached OpenOffice. Due to this the activity 
in the projects was more silent, too.

However, limitations of capacity of development is an ongoing concern. 
But plans are still active to do more releases.

Compared to the previous reports this time it's shorter by intention.

ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS
==========================

There are no current topics to be concerned with.

RELEASES
========

The current release is Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 and was published on 
2016-Oct-12.

Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4 is planned for release in 2017 Q1 for further 
maintenance.

Apache OpenOffice 4.2.0 is planned for this year - but without to name a 
specific time frame - to include new features and bigger enhancements 
but of course more bug fixes.

PMC/COMMITTERS
==============

PMC
---
The recognition and invitation of potential PMC members remains on a 
slow level. No new PMC members were added. A discussion is ongoing to 
add a former PMC member.

There are currently 27 PMC members.  

The last PMC addition was Malte Timmerman (malte) on 2016-07-14

The last PMC resignation was Kay Schenk (kschenk) on 2016-09-02

Committers
----------
There are 140 committers as of 2017-Jan-08. The recognition and 
invitation of potential committers is continuing. The following people 
were added:

2016-Nov-07	Peter Kovacs (petko)
2016-Nov-16	Matthias Seidel (mseidel)

Last previous committer addition was on 2016-Apr-26 Jan Høydahl (janhoy)

Last previous committer withdrawal was on 2016-Sep-02 Kay Schenk (kschenk)

ACTIVITY
========

Development and Release Engineering
-----------------------------------
The build system and its documentation is improving as the result of 
work by experienced developers and committers.  The number of individuals
able to replicate release builds is increasing.

The release manager for the upcoming release 4.1.4 is found and working 
on keeping the tasks together.

The hottest action at the moment is to transfer the build system from 
the old dmake to the newer gbuild (Google Build). However, with more 
than hundred sub-projects in SVN this remains a hugh task.

There are plans to work on a Apple signing service to be able to sign 
install files for macOS.

Besides this bugfixing of issues is the next action item to name.

Downloads
---------
The downloads are at a consistent rate. On 2016-Nov-18 A new record has 
been reached. OpenOffice hit the mark of 200 million downloads (source: 
http://www.openoffice.org/stats/downloads.html).

The downloads regarding to plattform and country over the last 3 months 
are spread like the following (source: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/stats/map?dates=2016-10-15%20to%202017-01-08):

76 % for Windows
  8 % for macOS
  1 % for Linux
15 % for other platforms

17 % United States
13 % France
13 % Germany
  7 % Italy
  7 % Spain
  4 % Poland
  4 % United Kingdom
  3 % Russia
  3 % Japan
  2 % Canada
27 % all other countries

Websites
--------
There is action to improve the translation and structure of webpages for 
Danish, Norwegian, German, Portuguese and Korean. The social media 
representation (Youtube, Facebook, Twitter) was improved, too.

A new list, recruitment@, was launched on September, 5th. The list is 
intended to act as a single-point-of-contact to provide a gentler on-ramp 
for newcomers without contending with the active dev@ list for guidance. 
The traffic is low but recognized. There have been 31 messages since the 
report in October.

The geral-ptbr@ list was closed with the retirement of a moderator and 
sustained inactivity.

Apache OpenOffice is represented at a few fairs and events. This is 
managed by a small but fine team. Next event is FOSDEM Feb, 4th-5th in 
Brussels, Belgium. Here we will share the booth with Apache in general.

Issue Tracking (Bugzilla)
-------------------------
The rate of new Bugzilla issues is decreasing since a few years. The 
rate at which issues remain unresolved over all that time is more than 
40%. But volunteers are managing the new issue reports that come in.

Development Capacity
--------------------
The arrival of new developers is still slow. But there are indeed people 
willing to dig into the code. But with our low number of developers 
assignments and mentoring is slow by itself.

A number of previously-active committers have returned to activity 
as part of the response to the previous-quarter public discussion
of what AOO retirement would look like.

Next Steps: Improving the mentoring of newcomers and expanding the 
capacity to address major issues as part of new releases.

Branding
--------
In average there is nearly 1 request per month for use of the marks.

The same for reports about suspected trademark misuse (or confusion 
about selling of Apache OpenOffice binaries, e.g., on eBay).

The fight against these kind of windmills is still active but seems 
endless; especially on a project like OpenOffice with a very well-known 
brand name.

Governance
----------
The discussions on the retirement of OpenOffice start in September 2016 
were very heated. Since many weeks they became silent now on our mailing 
lists.

No topics


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AW: Report from the Apache ORC Project  [Owen O'Malley]

## Description:
 A high-performance columnar file format for Hadoop workloads.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring the board's attention.
   
## Activity: 
 - There was considerable concern among the Hive committers about
   losing their ability to make changes to the ORC code base as we
   finish replacing the copy of ORC's code base in Hive with a
   reference to the ORC project's release artifacts. The ORC PMC voted
   to allow the current Hive committers to become ORC
   committers. Twenty of the Hive committers accepted the offer and
   have been added. I feel this is good for the project, but it may
   induce some short term turmoil with the large influx of new
   committers.
 - On a separate note, the ORC PMC also added Gopal Vijayaraghavan as
   a PMC member. Gopal has done a lot of great work on ORC's
   performance and is a great addition to the PMC.
 - We made two bug fix releases on the 1.2 line and will likely
   make a 1.3 release in the next quarter.
   
## Health report: 
 - We need to finish Hive's migration from its own ORC code base to
   use our release artifacts. Having two copies of the code in
   different projects is very hard to mantain.
 - We are seeing some new contributors, which is great.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - Gopal Vijayaraghavan was added to PMC on Jan 08 2017

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

After the 1.0.0 release it got a bit quiet around the project and the
community. No commit was made since November 2016.

The discussion about electing a new PMC chair who may drive the project
is also in an idle state. No one so far stood up to take the job.

We plan to start a new discussion in 2017 about the future of Stanbol.


Subscribers on the dev list: 227

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

Within the reporting period we saw reasonable community and development
activity. Both the 2.3 and 2.5 branch received further bug fixing and
feature enhancement efforts, with a clear focus on the 2.5 branch.
Adoption of the new 2.5 release line, being considered as a transition
and consolidation branch on our way towards Struts 3, is on the rise and
we might discuss dropping support for the 2.3 line later this year.

We received a few reports regarding possible security issues, one of
which led to a security bulletin and a fix found in Struts 2.5.8 [1]. In
addition we received a notice that recent releases have been signed with
unresolvable GPG keys. This issue should be resolved for upcoming releases.

Based on the feedback we received from board on the last report, we
started discussion on possible new committership candidates. We widened
a bit the scope of investigation and identified a few contributors that
might be valuable additions. The first candidate is now being
voted upon. The others are still being monitored closely.

No new committer or PMC member was added in the last quarter.
The last committership addition was on 2015-10-23 (Aleksandr Mashchenko).
The last PMC addition was on 2016-08-13 (Aleksandr Mashchenko).

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Dave Meikle]

=== Apache Tika Status Report : January 2017 ===

What is Tika?
=========================
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content
detection, analysis, and extraction. It allows a user to understand, and
leverage information from, a growing a list over 1200 different file types
including most of the major types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text,
Images, Video, Code, and science data) as recognised by IANA and other
standards bodies.

Issues
=========================
There are no issues that need the boards attention.

Releases
=========================
The last release Tika 1.14 was released on Wed Oct
19 2016. Version 1.15 is now underway with current new features such as the
WordPerfect and QuattroPro parsers, SAX based parser for Office formats, and
inline image extraction in PDFs.

Work has also continued on the new 2.X branch.

Community
=========================

Luís Filipe Nassif was added as a committer on Tue Oct 18 2016

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop has added a new committer in Robert Dale.

TinkerPop released versions 3.1.5 and 3.2.3. New developed has started on 
the follow-on releases to those versions and work for the new major line 
of 3.3.0 is under way.

It was nice to see some additional growth in the number of TinkerPop 
providers - those who implement and expand on TinkerPop interfaces. 
OrientDB, a distributed multi-model database, announced official support
for Apache TinkerPop. It was also announced that HGraphDB had been released
which provides a TinkerPop implementation over Apache HBase. This news was 
recently reported on the ASF blog[1].

As an update to brand management issues mentioned in the previous report,
recall that the TinkerPop PMC had become aware of two individuals not 
acknowledging our marks with respect to products sold with TinkerPop 
graphics. While one of the two was quick to respond to the issue and 
correct it, we found the other unresponsive. As we made several attempts at
contact via email, we aren't really sure if there is much else that we can
reasonably do. The mailing address on the website doesn't look legitimate,
there is no phone number to call. The site itself looks somewhat 
incomplete in many ways (e.g. lorem ipsum text), so perhaps this is not 
worth pursuing any further. 

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.1.5 (October 17, 2016)
- 3.2.3 (October 17, 2016)

## PMC/Committer:

- Last PMC addition was Jason Plurad - August 2016
- Last committer addition was Robert Dale - October 2016

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based on,
but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java Enterprise
Edition Specifications.

As commented in the last board report, the project has work to do on
attracting new committers.  In the last year an overwhelming majority of
commits have come from one person.  That said, since last board report in
September we’ve seen at least 7 non-committers submit a total of 21 pull
requests through the Github integration.  Some of those successfully applied,
many not and one deleted by accident.

Wearing my PMC Chair hat my concern on adding new committers in the current
climate is there is not enough discussion to match the level of commit
activity.  In particular, only 1 of the 7 faces have posted to the mailing
list.  Recalling Ken Coar’s decision to go RTC in Geronimo, I’ve put that
course of action up for discussion in the PMC.  Though Ken did it for entirely
different reasons, the benefits it brought the community could be particularly
useful here.

Work on a new website reached a point where the community was overall happy
and voted to go live with it.  The new site is largely a new landing page, a
few new quick-starts and links to many pages of the old site which has a
slightly different look and feel.  Contribution to the new site is a
definitely opportunity for those looking to get started.

Last release was 7.0.2 on 2016-11-11.  Last committer was added November 2015.
Last PMC addition, 4 new members on 2015-08-11.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Bryan Call]

## Description: 

 Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
 and Varnish in functionality and features. What makes ATS unique across the
 landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on extensibility (plugins), HTTP
 protocol conformity and performance. ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs
 in the world, delivering a significant portion of all internet traffic.

## Issues: 

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

 - We held our Fall Summit in Sunnyvale, at Linkedin.  There were over 80
   people that registered and approximately that many attended.  There were
   a number of great presentations from the ATS Community and we had two
   companies give talks on products that support ATS.

 - At the Fall Summit the ATS Community discussed moving to GitHub for issue
   tracking and at the beginning of the year (1/1/2017) we made the
   transition.

 - We are discussing having the 2017 Spring Summit at ApacheCon in May.

 - Five people from the ATS Community attended the IETF 97 meeting in Seoul in
   November.  There is an interest in the QUIC protocol in the ATS Community
   and a few of us will be attending the IETF QUIC Interim Meeting in January
   in Tokyo.

## Health report: 

 - We have branched the v7.1.0 release and are working on finalizing the
   release.

 - We expect continued increase in committers, partially thanks to the Github
   migration which we feel continues to encourage and simplify user
   participation.

 - Commits are down from the previous quarter.  We were preparing for the
   v7.0.0 release in the previous quarter and v7.0.0 had more changes in the
   release then we normally have, more than 400 issues closed.
   
## PMC changes:

 - Currently 39 PMC members.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Sagara Gunathunga]

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML
based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS,
Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web
Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixes, and
there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project
can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web
Services is no longer considered state of the art, we don't expect a major
uptick in new development efforts, new committers, etc...

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)


Releases this period:

WSS4J - implementation of WS-Security and related technologies
* 2.0.10 - December 2016
* 2.1.8  - December, 2016

Axiom  - StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model
* 1.2.20 - October 2016


Last releases for other technologies:
*  XmlSchema 2.2.1 : Feb 2015  (XML Schema model)
*  Neethi 3.0.3 : Jan 2014   (WS-Policy implementation)
*  Woden 1.0M10 : Sept 2015  (WSDL 2.0 implementation)



Note : 
There was a concern raised by the board about the last report submitted, that
suggests Oct-2016 report was identical to previous report except 2 new
releases mentioned. We have informed several times to the board about the
nature of this PMC, in fact community section of the report contains brief
summery about the nature of this PMC. Web services is no longer a hot topic
and not a area that radical innovations are happening also all the
sub-projects are pretty much stable & mature too, in this context it's hard to
expect major development efforts around these sub-projects. 

Having said these projects are not inactive, user queries are answered on
time, bug fixing and new releases are happening frequently,  maintaining good
level of committers diversity as well.  

Most of the time notable changes between 2 board reports are limited to
mention new releases, in this current report we have 3 new releases other than
that all the other aspects such as community activities, last committer and
PMC member additions are remains same as previous report.
