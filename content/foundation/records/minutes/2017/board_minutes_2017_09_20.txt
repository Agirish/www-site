 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       First, I would like to thank Brett for his 4+ years of service
       as ASF Chairman. I am both inspired and challenged by the
       example that he set.  I am also very grateful to him and Sam
       for automating a lot of administrative tasks, making that
       aspect of the role a lot easier.  Despite careful instruction
       from Brett, I nonetheless made a few administrative errors this
       month, which were resolved thanks to help from Sam, Craig and
       Brett.  Thanks to all for your help and patience as I learn the
       ropes.

       On September 11, I spoke at the Linux Foundation’s OSS Summit
       in Los Angeles, CA. The title of my talk was “Scaling OSS,
       Lessons Learned at the Apache Software Foundation."  I talked
       about historical social, financial and operational challenges
       and how we had met them.  I ended with some personal thoughts
       about the future - basically a statement of confidence in the
       resiliency of the ASF.  Many thanks to Sally for her help and
       counsel preparing the talk.

       More thanks go to Sally, Chris, Rene Gielen and other members
       of the Struts PMC for marshaling a clear and effective response
       to press inquiries associated with the Equifax breach.

    B. President [Sam]

       My current priorities: EA/TAC/Conferences, Brand Management

       Items requiring board attention:

       * Brand Management continues to face scalability issues.  See Brand
         Management reports for details.  No immediate action required,
         options and alternatives will be brought back to the board in
         upcoming months.

       * Unless directed otherwise, the ASF infrastructure leadership team
         will continue to work with the ASF Treasury team in setting up a
         location to secure and track personnel related documents, balancing
         oversight and privacy.  See January minutes for context.

       * We are still relatively early in the fiscal year, so projections will
         vary widely month to month, but for the first time this year we are
         not projected to make up for last year's underrun; which was
         attributed to timing of sponsor payments.  No cause for concern about
         this year, but does suggest that we should revisit our five year
         forecast this fall.  Input on whether this should be done bottoms up
         again, or should be done top down would be appreciated.

       * Fundraising Would like to give Fundraising Ambassadors VP Titles.
         Possible idea: VP Sponsor Relations.  This is yet another example
         of a common theme where ASF titles are important externally.

       While amply reported elsewhere, I would like to also commend the
       organization's coordinated and professional response to the Equifax
       breach.  Early reports from others on the cause of the breach were
       incorrect, and our initial response stated the known facts and
       enumerated the possibilities.  As additional facts became known, we
       provided updates.

       As others have reported, this was a total team effort, with Sally as
       usual shouldering the bulk of the load.   Not called out by others but
       Mark Cox played a crucial role in framing the initial message.

       While I have stayed on top of mailing list traffic, much of my time
       this month has been spent on converting various Whimsy tools from
       React.js to Vue.js.  Three of the four tools have been converted, and
       work has begun on the remaining tool: the board agenda.  I'll post on
       board@ with the implications of these change before they are deployed.
       Meanwhile, I will note that this would be an ideal time to look at any
       additional requirements (e.g., automating chair activities?) that
       people may have for this tool.

       Seeing if we can utilize our EA better remains on my todo list.
 

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       - Virtual Report

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s performance for
       the first four months of FY18. 

       Cash on Aug 31th 2017 was $1,684.5K, which is down $104.5K from last
       month’s ending balance (Jul 17) of $1,789K, due to the timing of some
       Sponsor payments.   The Aug 2017 cash balance is down $69.8K from the
       Aug 2016 month end balance of $1,754.3K.  The Aug 2017 ending cash
       balance of $1,684.5K represents a cash reserve of 14.4 months based on
       the FY18 Cash forecast average monthly spending of $117.1K/month. The
       ASF reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of ASF’s
       size, with an FY18 YE estimate of 11.7 month’s cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong showing
       against our FY18 Budget four months in however as you can see the
       effect of the timing of Sponsor payments, which for Aug we had
       budgeted a few but had none, leaves us with our first down month of
       FY18.  Now we need to continue to focus not only on the new but the
       existing sponsors as that was how the FY18 budget was constructed. 
       This has us for revenue, $244.6K ahead of bud through Aug 2017.  So,
       with the $607.7K of Sponsor revenue received so far in the first four
       months of FY18 we are more than 56% to our budgeted Sponsor revenue
       goal of $1,084K for FY18.  We are remaining conservative in our
       forecasting and showing a slight increase in Net income for FY18,
       which is predicated on achieving our budgeted revenue figure of $1.084
       million in Sponsor revenue and expenses staying relatively flat
       (currently YTD they are under budget) then the reserve would be 11.7
       months which is one month below our budget of 12.7 months, which is
       still an extremely healthy reserve.

       YTD expenses are under by $12.7K.  Infra, YTD, is over by $16.3K and
       the other depts. combined are under by $29K. I will be doing a more
       thorough review and will connect with Greg as there could be some
       items that are possibly miscoded.  I would caution that we are only
       four months into the current fiscal year so it is very early yet. 
       That said now that we are four months into the fiscal year I will be
       reaching out to the VP’s and Dept. heads to see if there have any
       information that could change our FY 18 forecast, for our Oct close.

       With regard to Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $169.2K NI vs a budgeted negative $88.1K NI or $257.3K ahead
       of Budget for the first four months of FY18.  With the forecasted
       revenue, ahead of budget due to the Pivotal and Microsoft FY 17
       payments as well as the Coinbase funds coming in FY18 and expenses
       close to Budget at this point we are estimating a $-148.9K negative NI
       for FY18 vs a budgeted NI loss of $167.8K.   I want to congratulate
       the entire Organization on this very positive start to FY 18, it is
       still a bit early in the FY at this point, so we do need to continue
       to keep these efforts up as we move farther into FY 18 and continue to
       give Fundraising all the support we can as we move forward, while
       keeping an eye on our expenses at the same time.

       One last note is we will be getting the Cash Basis Audit underway in
       Q4 of 2017 for FY 17.  I will keep everyone updated as to its progress
       once it starts.

       - Assistant Treasurer's Report

       CDARS discussion ongoing to confirm an appropriate amount to leave in
       the operational checking and the amounts to tie up in CDARS.

       Emirio tax issue for payment being actively worked and almost
       completed.

       GSOC Payment received

       Engagement letter received 9/15 for “FY 17 Engagement letter noting
       the capped fees of $9,500 for the Cash Basis audit and $1,500 for the 
       FY 17 990 prep as outlined in their proposal”.  Under review but
       expected to sign if it matches the proposed numbers.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       To help resolve questions about IP Clearance I updated the Licenses
       page to include discussion about Provenance and the requirements on
       projects and incubator podlings for IP Clearance. This should help
       projects clarify when a separate IP Clearance process is needed.

       In August, 77 iclas, five cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastructure

       No major items requiring board attention. No significant downtime
       during the last month.

       Some unexpected numbers in this infra related financials this month.
       Most likely misapplied cost centers. The team are investigating and
       will fix the errors and / or report next month as necessary.

       Good progress with respect to moving away from ASF owned hardware,
       though it has become necessary to replace some disks which were
       reporting a predictive failure ahead of the scheduled decommission
       date.

       Marketing and Publicity

       An Apache project was associated with a recent data breach at Equifax.
       Thanks to prompt action from the PMC and our VP Marketing and
       Publicity the foundation was able to respond constructively and to
       help identify the cause of the problem (failure to install patches
       addressing a previously identified exploit). We thank those involved
       for their prompt and efficient handling of the situation, the guidance
       provided to the Apache user community as a result should be considered
       good practice.

       Other than this item it's business as usual, where "usual" now
       includes sponsor communications.

       Conferences

       Nothing to report.

       TAC

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

* Working with JimJag re shipping of swag to All Things Open
* Coordinated w/Sally and Sharan re booth equipment (banners and table cloth)
  for European events.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

Long term, the current model for providing trademark support to our projects
is not working.  The number of questions that are either already answered by
documentation (meaning PMCs aren't aware of it) or that require trademark
expertise (meaning Shane or counsel) continues to grow, as do the number of
tasks requiring officer signature or interaction.  

Will be working over the next several months to propose potential
alternatives; this is just a heads up that major improvements are needed over
the next year.


* OPERATIONS

A busy month as various PMCs and companies (who ask us questions) return from
summer holidays.

A scam email about .cn domain registrations brings up a good point we should
consider (additional volunteer energy willing): should we consider additional
defensive domain registrations at common top level domains?  We have cases of
domain squatters using our brands to direct users elsewhere, and likely have
more cases than are reported to us.

Website Analytics still show the majority of users come to a direct link, are
from Android or Windows (curious!), and start on the home page or /list page,
and tend not to click through to many pages.

I gave a new "Who Owns That Open Source Brand" talk at OSSummit, which was
very well received and I think opened some eyes about the importance of
trademarks.

I've been invited to co-present "Trademarks in Open Source" at PLI's Open
Source Software legal training conference again in December.


* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

A large number of renewals of existing registrations as well as several other
assignments (MADLib, HAWQ) or legal agreements are still in process with
counsel.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Meetings semi-monthly with Virtual continue between KAM and Lynsey

Good progress continues on cleaning up the sponsor records.  Before the next
board meeting, we’re planning to remove unpaid sponsors off the thanks page.

G Suite instance is up and running - gsuite.cloud.apache.org  If there are
concerns about where fundraising is storing data, who needs access, etc.
please let me know.  

https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/success-at-apache-meritocracy
wristbands very successful and very well received.  

Also posted re: Equifax with official hat on at
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/act-ii-equifax-tries-fails-throw-apache-struts-
under-bus-mcgrail/

Shipments to people who requested bracelets is complete with two exceptions
and my firm is donating the labor to process everything.  

Slide deck at the 99% good to go mark. Many thanks to Sally.

Received the ASF Credit Card for KAM. 

Directed sponsorship to unify with inkind sponsors is coming along with
discussions ongoing with numerous players.  I expect to unify this and have a
policy before the November board meeting.

Attending All Things Open on ASF Behalf 

Attending FOSDEM on ASF Behalf 

Likely to attend Berlin Buzzwords & FOSS Backstage on ASF Behalf

Thanks again to Sally and Hadrian for helping pin down sponsors as well as
continued work from Virtual.  We’ve got renewals coming, invoices going and
some bronze sponsors adding as well.  We lost some sponsors, gained some and
renewed some we thought we had lost.  

Sponsor onboarding process is getting smoother with notes about sponsor
agreement and automating the process more in the works

Huawei talking to John D Ament re:incubation and potentially bringing some
projects under our umbrella.

Multi-year commit from sponsors is being well received and helping with
getting Bronze sponsors who are committed to the foundation’s long-term
success.

Passed the $10K mark in donations from Hopsie (started in March)

Would like to give Ambassadors a VP Titles like VP Sponsor Relations

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule with no vendor payments
due at this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: work with ASF Fundraising continues.
Sally Khudairi completed the new pitch deck has provided a master
document containing speaking points relevant to Sponsor
solicitation/education. She continues to lead Sponsor engagement and
outreach with the "ambassador" program, and has helped secure a
renewal at the Gold level (downgraded from Platinum), and continues to
hold budgeting/renewal/outreach meetings with existing Sponsors. Work
continues on individual giving and donor outreach. In addition, Sally
continues to work with a handful of Sponsors that are actively
involved with some projects in the Apache Incubator, mostly in the
realm of project promotions and marketing. The ASF Quarterly
Operations Summary for Q1FY2018 (May-July 2017) was published with
thanks to Rich Bowen, Shane Curcuru, Sharan Foga, Chris Mattmann,
Kevin McGrail, Sam Ruby, Greg Stein, and Tom Pappas for their
contributions.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 14 September 2017 - MEDIA ALERT: The Apache Software Foundation
Confirms Equifax Data Breach Due to Failure to Install Patches
Provided for Apache® Struts™ Exploit
- 9 September 2017 - The Apache® Software Foundation Issues Statement
on Equifax Security Breach
- 22 August 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
MADlib™ as a Top-Level Project
- 17 August 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Welcomes Phil Steitz
as Chairman

IV. Informal Announcements: 11 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 2 "Success at Apache" blog posts were published. 5
Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 165 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 35 items, and have 43.6K
followers on Twitter. We posted 11 items on LinkedIn, which garnered
more than 170K organic impressions in total. 

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 13 media queries. The ASF
received 3,239 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,599. Media
coverage of Apache projects yielded 7,634 press hits vs. last month's
1,302. We've had another instance of a project requiring crisis
communications, which, given our all-volunteer community, has proven
challenging with identifying and securing appropriate, prepared, and
available spokespeople in a very short timeframe. Having said that, we
successfully worked with the Apache Struts PMC and ASF Security team
on responding to dozens of media queries and issuing two official
statements in response to the Equifax security breach. Special thanks
to everyone who helped with escalating the issue internally, and to
René Gielen, Lucasz Lenart, Mark Cox, and Mark Thomas for their
editorial contributions and collaboration with preparing interview
responses, as well as to Chris Mattmann, who participated in same-day
broadcast media interviews.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 3 analyst queries during this
timeframe. Apache was mentioned in 10 reports and 2 Big Data Webinars
by Gartner, 2 reports by Forrester, 8 reports by 451 Research, and 1
report by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: Sally created new graphics and coordinated with Sharan
Foga and Melissa Warnkin on the production of several signage and
promotional items to be used at various conferences.

IX. Events liaison: we will continue to support VP Conferences as
ApacheCon evolves. We have been working with ComDev to meet their
promotional needs at numerous events, and have been liaising with
several Sponsors on events they are backing or participating in, as
well as external community partner opportunities.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 8 pre-paid press releases remaining with
NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017; unused announcements will
be applied towards our new contract that ends in December 2019.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infra continues to operate as expected, and there are no issues for
the President or the Board at this time.

Finances
========
There appears to be some strange numbers in this month's financials,
so some further analysis will be done over the next couple weeks. This
is likely a simple matter of misapplied cost centers. Will provide an
update next month.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Upgrade Confluence, Jira, and Jenkins. We will schedule these for
  weekends, as several hours of downtime will be required for each.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- First priority: shift towards puppet-managed cloud-based services.
- Various automation, which likely will involve working with the
  Whimsy folks to loop this into their product.

General Activity
================
- Seven machines de-racked at OSU/OSL, as part of our mission to move
  from ASF-owned hardware to cloud-based infrastructure
- Several disks at OSL were reporting a predictive failure, so we
  ordered a few more and are working with OSL to get them installed
  and looped back into the RAID system. Even though these systems are
  on a path to decommission, a disk failure would have been much more
  expensive, than the cost of the replacement.
- Towards our goal to decommission minotaur, mbox-vm has been created
  to function as our official archive of all mail content/archives.
  Minotaur is serving this function today, with mail-search.a.o and
  mail-archive.a.o slaving their content from minotaur. mbox-vm is
  still a work in progress.

Uptime Statistics
=================
The Infra team has continued its excellent uptime record. We had no
significant downtime on any system this past month.

Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

No issues to report at this time


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

The appeal vote on Director's decision to pubish the EME standard has
run. Within ASF there was more discussion on board@. Combining that with
the earlier members@ discussions, I formaly abstained, with comments
wishing to see better protection for independent developers and security
researchers.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

Facebook decided against changing the license of the React.js
framework [1] and as such React.js is not useable in any Apache
projects per Legal's original guidance and transition period.
Projects should have no dependencies on React.js. Questions should be
directed to legal-discuss@ and/or to the LEGAL JIRA system [2].

Eclipse released the Eclipse Public License v2.0, and a discussion
thread was raised wondering whether Apache legal had any comment.
At this point in time, there are no comments, and there has not be
a classification of EPLv2.0 in the Apache legal/resolved.html
classification system.

There was some confusion regarding a software grant from an external
company regarding an explicit list of third party dependencies
identified in the regular grant form. Confusion about the grant,
and information about the project is described in LEGAL-327 [3].
The resolution to this issue was that Legal told the project to go
ahead and accept the software grant and then in the future to work
with the upstream donating entity to remove such information from
future grants.

Additional conversation surrounding LEGAL-327 and Legal's role in
Incubator software grants, etc., led to the development and addition
of information on the Whimsy Roster Chart for VP, Legal [4]. The
additional information describes the process for interacting with
VP Legal, our Pro Bono Counsel and the mailing lists surrounding
them.

Other traditional legal questions (about whether License X can be
included in project Y, etc.) are being answered slowly and usually
in the order received.

enhancing previously available Apache Spark extensions and new extensions 
continue to be proposed to the project. The community continues to actively 
keep up with the Apache Spark release cadence, having recently released the 
extensions based on Apache Spark 2.2.0.

Apache Bahir has also integrated various extensions for Apache Flink analytical 
platform. Currently, the following extensions are available in Apache Bahir for 
Flink: ActiveMQ, Akka, Flume, Netty, and Redis; there has been some discussion 
about performing a release but the community seems to have decided to wait for 
the next Flink release that should be coming next month.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Davor Bonaci]

## Description:

Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:

There are no issues that require the Board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

In the previous quarter, we had achieved a major milestone for the project --
the completion of the first stable release, version 2.0.0. It signified a
statement from the community that it intends to maintain API stability with
all releases for the foreseeable future, and making Beam suitable for
enterprise deployment.

In this quarter, we continued to build on that momentum and kept
interconnecting additional execution engines and data storage/messaging
systems, and serve as a glue in the ecosystem. On the execution side, the
Apache Gearpump (incubating) runner effort has merged into the master branch
as a new component, and will be included in the next release. JStorm, Apache
Hadoop MapReduce, and Apache Tez runners are making further progress. The
Spark runner migration from Apache Spark 1.6 to 2.x is nearing completion.

A major effort to create an SQL extension, based on Apache Calcite, got merged
into the master branch as a new component, and is slated for the next release.

On the IO connector side, a connector for Apache Solr has been contributed,
and additional connectors for Redis, Apache DistributedLog (incubating),
Apache Parquet, RabbitMQ, and Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) are in
progress. Major improvements to file-based connectors have been contributed,
making them capable of handling dynamic source and sink locations.

We have published two technical blog posts regarding the recent innovation in
the project:
- Powerful and modular IO connectors with Splittable DoFn in Apache Beam
- Timely (and Stateful) Processing with Apache Beam

Beam was covered at several industry conferences over the past quarter,
including the DataWorks Summit Sydney 2017, Kafka Summit San Francisco 2017,
YOW! Data Sydney 2017, and Flink Forward Berlin 2017.

Going forward, the main focus continues to be on the user growth, with
outreach continuing across conferences and meetups. On the technical side, the
next major milestone is the completion of the portability framework across all
components of the project, which would, among other benefits, extend the
Python SDK to all Beam runners.

## Health report:

The community continues to grow steadily, as follows:
- For the first time since the top-level project was established, we have

- Cayenne 4.0 (development)
  - The release of our first 4.0 beta (4.0.B1) marked a significant
    milestone for Cayenne as the API is frozen, barring any major
    issues, and development effort is only for bug fixes and
    documentation for 4.0.B2 leading up to the final release of 4.0.

- Cayenne 4.1 (development)
  - With the release of 4.0.B1, development efforts have begun on
    the next release, 4.1, which already include compelling updates,

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description: 
- The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java components.

- The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
  Apache and without. Any ASF committer can commit to Apache Commons.

- The last report was for the meeting of June 21, 2017.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
 - The project is active with four (4) releases this reporting period.
   
## Health report: 
 - Most components in Commons are mature, but are still actively maintained
   (4 releases). The dev list is active. JIRA is active. Speed of responses
   to users is reasonable in most cases. We have 2 new PMC member, 2 new 
   committer, and Commons is still open to any Apache Committer.
 - We are still experiencing some growing pains toward Commons Math 4. There
   is a backlog of issues in JIRA (not unlike other components) but no clear
   concensus in the community. Do-ocracy is likely to prevail. There is a
   proposal on how to move the code base forward, either as a multi-module 
   project or multiple components within Commons. All of which can be read 
   on the developer's mailing list.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

 A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.
   
## Issues: 
 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

We had two platform releases - one minor release for iOS (4.5.0) and one major
release for Browser (5.0.0). The iOS release integrated the console plugin and
has updated some dependencies. The Browser release has implemented our
standard platform API and now includes basic support for progressive web apps. 

We had a major release for our cordova serve tool (2.0.0) which now serves the
web content and launches the default browser on the system. We have also had a
minor release of our cordova-common library which adds the ability to include
variables in the framework tag. 

## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green.

We have finished moving our plugin testing to AppVeyor and Travis CI. This is
the reason for all of the green badges on our status page!

We still have a huge backlog of GitHub Pull Request activity, again, same as
last quarter -- but it has improved. We now have direct access to GitHub for
platform repos. We are waiting for Infra to move over the rest of our repos to
GitBox. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-14994. Once all of our
repos are moved over, we plan on discussing the option of migrating our issues
from Jira to GitHub and what that would look like.

We are in the process of deprecating a few of our plugins which can be
replaced by official W3C specs which have been implemented in the browsers of
the platforms we support. We are also in the process of integrating a couple
of plugins back into platforms and deprecating the plugins. This will help
ease the maintenance load on the team. 

Again, our goal for plugins release is to have one per week as a cadence, and
we have failed to do so again this quarter. We have done work on streamlining
this so it will improve in the future.

We have recently removed react from our plugins serach at
https://plugins.cordova.io. We replaced it with preact. We aren't using react
anywhere else.

We have attempted to contact Cocoon.io folks multiple times about using the
cordova trademark incorrectly. We haven't received a response yet. It appears
their top executives have left the company. The company may have folded.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache FlexJS 0.8.0 was released on 6/25/17.

-Apache Flex SDK 4.16.0 was released on 3/10/17.
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.3 was released on 3/31/17.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was released on 6/23/15.


ACTIVITY 
The past three months saw the release of Apache FlexJS 0.8.0.  This
belatedly fulfilled our obligation to remove org.json dependencies from our
releases.

On 7/25, Adobe announced the end-of-life for Flash Player in browsers in 2020.
This eliminates a significant runtime environment for Apache Flex. This news
resulted in a slight increase in interest in FlexJS and some new features were
developed in response to user requests.

The drop in mailing list and commit activity reported in the prior quarter
seems to have been temporary.

The Apache Flex Installer assists users in the downloading and expanding
of the runtime prerequisites such as the Adobe AIR SDK and is having running
out of memory dealing with increasingly large artifacts from Adobe.  As such,
there is a good chance that fewer successful installs are being tracked by the
Apache Flex Installer as more folks may be opting for alternative ways to
install our releases.

COMMUNITY
-Last committer as added on 9/5/16.  A discussion started last quarter about a
new candidate but that candidate has not been very active lately so the
discussion seems to have been suspended.
-Olaf Krüger was added to the PMC on 8/28/17.
-A resolution to make Tom Chiverton the next Apache Flex chair has been
presented to the board.
-A proposal to create a new top-level project called Apache Royale has been
presented to the board.  Apache Royale will take responsibility for
what is now Apache FlexJS and related repos.
-Latest analytics include around 800 hits per day on the Website during the
work week (less on weekends).  It used to be closer to 1000 hits per day but
better than the 500 hits per day reported last quarter.
-There were more than 2700 installs of Apache Flex 4.16.0 since its release in
March 2017.

TRADEMARKS
-A company is promoting a software product called Flex that appears to be
related to themes/styles for website visuals. Despite several attempts to
contact them, they have not responded. The ASF VP Trademarks sent them an
email on 11/3/16.  I did not see a response and their website is still up.
What is the next step?

SECURITY 
Nothing to report (finally).

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The Flink community is heading towards the 1.4 release. Big
    threads in the current development are for example a major
    improvement to the deployment interoperability and elasticity,
    connectors, dependency management, Stream SQL.

  - The Flink community is reorganizing the project repository and
    dependencies, to make the life of users easier with respect to
    dependency conflicts. We created the "flink-shaded" repository
    in which we create shaded versions of several dependencies,
    relocated to a different namespace. That repository contains at
    this point no code, only build files.

  - The Flink Forward Berlin conference took place on September 11-13
    with about 350 participants, representing a mixture of committers,
    contributors, production users, exploring users, stream processing
    enthusiasts, and researchers from academia.

  - Data Artisans announced that they plan to organise two more
    Flink Forward conferences next year, similar to this year:
    One in San Francisco in April, one in Berlin in September.

  - Since the last board report, two companies publicly annouced
    hosted managed Flink services: Eventador (http://eventador.io/)
    and Huawei (http://www.hwclouds.com/product/stream.html).
    We are in touch with the later one to update their mentioning
    of "Flink" to "Apache Flink".

COMMUNITY

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Fluo Project  [Keith Turner]

## Description:

 - Apache Fluo is a distributed processing system built on Apache Accumulo.
   Fluo users can easily setup workflows that execute cross node transactions
   when data changes.  These workflows enable users to continuously join new
   data into large existing data sets with low latency while avoiding
   reprocessing all data.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Work on supporting Mesos and Kubernetes is well underway and nearing
   completion.  Completing this work will likely motivate the next release.
 - Posted an issue on ASF helpwanted site and had a student start working on it.

## Health report:

 - Since Aug 8
    - 11 GitHub issues were opened and 20 closed
    - 16 GitHub pull request were opened and 25 were closed
    - 24 commits were made by 4 authors (all commiters)
    - One new non-committer started working a issue, but did not complete

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 8 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last month

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 8 committers.
 - No changes in last month

## Releases:

 - No new releases in last month
 - fluo-1.1.0-incubating was released on Mon Jun 12 2017
 - fluo-recipes-1.1.0-incubating was released on Thu Jun 22 2017

## Answer to question

 - Craig Russell asked : "This PMC is getting very small. What can be done to
   make sure that the project stays viable?"

   - Answer :

     We need to grow the community and that should lead to more PMC members.  To
     do this we plan to continue with a few releases a year and promote them.
     Continue to write up starter issues and promote them.  Continue to speak
     at conferences.  Continue to be a welcoming community.  Continue to engage
     with other communities.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Giraph Project  [Avery Ching]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Just before the report was prepared we noticed vmgump-vm3 to not be
available, we are looking into it and will ask infra for help when
needed.

Other than that there are no changes compared to the last quarter, no
real activity by the community, the service seemed to be humming
along.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

This has again been a very quiet quarter for Gump. Gump seems to
remain useful for the projects using it.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

     Comments: Currently waiting on SGA (pinged for status, but no response yet). Little activity on mailing lists so
               far. Decision making seems to be taking place off-list (3 non-Apache releases). I concur with Dave 
               Fisher that monthly reporting should be considered (although this is report #2 in their initial monthly
               reporting cycle).

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  Dave Fisher:  It seems that with 3 non-apache releases while there is not even ay use of Apache resources that Heron ought to focus on migration. I think that they should be monthly until the code is moved.

HTrace is a tracing framework intended for use with distributed systems
written in java.

HTrace has been incubating since 2014-11-11.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Continue to grow the Apache HTrace community
 2. Continue to explore projects integrating Apache HTrace
 3. Continue to develop and release stable Apache HTrace incubating artifacts

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 In a DISCUSSION thread on our dev list [1], one of us suggested
 moving the podling htrace to the attic because of inactivity.

 A healthy back and forth suggested that we are not
 dead yet, that we cut back our scope radically, and
 that we give it another try before calling it quits.

     "...A healthy back and forth suggested that we are not dead yet, 
     that we cut back our scope radically, and that we give it another 
     try before calling it quits." I think HTrace may have a good opportunity 
     to come back to life if the above cut backs are implemented.

framework that allows client applications to execute transactions on top of
MVCC key/value-based NoSQL datastores (currently Apache HBase) providing
Snapshot Isolation guarantees on the accessed data.

Omid has been incubating since 2016-03-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Boost project dissemination in the Apache community.
  2. Collaborate/integrate Omid with other Apache projects.
  3. Get positive feedback from other projects currently in Apache.

OpenWhisk  

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able to execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) from external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional logic (Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST API-based Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support packaging and catalog services.  Additionslly, it now provides options to host the platform components as Docker containers on various Container Frameworks such as Mesos, Kunernetes, and Compose.
OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

   Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:    

    1. Est. release process for ZIP of source code
    2. Est. release process for Docker and other platform binaries
    3. Increase additional company and individual Contributors to maintain all project repos.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be  aware of?    

    - It had been our intent to have Apache host our staging (and move it out of disparate private builds within various companies). However, INFRA indicates they only typically allocate 1 VM per project for use with demos and minor things. They indicated that typically a donation is in order (ala. Spark).
      -- Note: the desire for this staging capability was expressed in the Incubator submission where we anticipated needing ~12 VMs to host each platform component and be able to load balance/schedule Functional code as part of the OpenWhisk Serverless (across multiple supported language runtimes). This would also be needed to effectively test auto-scaling/load balancing and container pools and to get accurate performance test measures.
    - Formal hand-off of OpenWhisk trademark/logo from IBM needs to be executed; need to identify process for this.

How has the community developed since the last report?    

    - First substantive design changes allowing for Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs) developed within Apache community (dev list, WIki, etc.).
    - Established bi-weekly Zoom "Technical Interchange" calls that have been well received.
        Complete videos posted to OW YouTube channel and detailed notes to our CWIKI.
    - Kubernetes on OpenWhisk work hosted a few ad-hoc to continue design discussions (CWIKI has designs and comments) 
      for how best to move away from Ansible deployments to self-configuring, autoscalable containers (for use in Kube, Mesos, Compose, etc.).
    - Increased interest/list/Slack traffic in general due to experiment Kube work, as it is applicable to Mesos, etc.
    - Increased community discussions (design topics, features) of substance moved to dev list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

    - incubator-openwhisk Github stars: 1928
    - incubator-openwhisk GitHub forks: 417
    - Movement to become more "pluggable" via Service Provider Interfaces (SPI), several PRs that are ongoing.
        - So far there are now interfaces for MessagingProvider.scala, ArtifactStoreProvider.scala 
          and proposals for others such as LogStore, ContainerFactory, LoadBalancer,

  Sig. PRs:

    - initial work on no root ansible #2669
        This allows to deploy with no sudo/root access. Significant to enable Kube/Mesos deployments.
    - Simplify Spi implementations. #2663
        Service Provider Interfaces (SPI) become more mature as patterns emerge.
        Healthy discussion/growth area for project to allow most components to become (eventually) pluggable 
        (e.g., Log, Trace, Container build, Load    Balancing, Scheduler, Routing, Message Queue, etc.)
    - Apply standard scala formatting #2650
        Coding/linting standards debated/agreed to by community (and CI automated enforcement encoded)
    - Allow multiple controllers and invokers in local environments #2633
        implement a ContainerPool which is completely independent of the underlying container driver to facilitate testing and extensibility.
        More improvements to allow different pooling of invoker containers based upon different application use case 
        (new ideas generated in community) including requirements for diff. scheduling/co-tenanting,/user responsiveness (http), etc. needs.

  Sig. discussions (dev list):

    - Release for OpenWhisk 
    - Releases and SPI plans
    - OpenWhisk shell tool
    - authentication models for openwhisk
    - Performance tests for OpenWhisk
    - Adaption of hosts-files
    - Default handling for HTTP web actions

None


How has the community developed since the last report?

In the summer of 2017, we took efforts to spread awareness about the
Quickstep project and technology. We had many talks, particularly in
the San Francisco Bay Area. The talks/venues are listed here:

  1.  SRI International in Menlo Park
  2.  A meetup hosted by H2O.ai in Mountain View
  3.  Hortonworks in Santa Clara (Thanks to our mentor Julian Hyde
      for hosting)

We had also applied for a talk at BigDataWisconsin meetup but the
proposal was not selected.

 2. Continue the momentum and become more integrated with the
    rest of the Apache community.
 3. Continue to create software releases.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 * Two of our three remaining mentors, Devaraj Das and Enis Söztutar, resigned
   on July 21.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 * Participation in the project remains healthy, with the usual small dip
   due to the summer vacation season:
   - ML postings: 106 user, 273 dev, 389 coderev, 734 issues, 341 commits
   - Twitter: 221 followers, 72 tweets, 67 likes
 * We are working towards our next release, 2.2. Ming Liu is the Release Manager.
 * Discussion regarding readiness to graduate continues. Diversity continues
   to grow.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 * 162 commits from 18 contributors.
 * 100 JIRAs filed and 63 resolved.

How would you assess the podling's maturity? Please feel free to add your own
commentary.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

Report from the Apache Jackrabbit committee

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained. 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding  
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
      
## Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Oak. 

Adobe donated the content-package-maven-plugin to us: a Maven plugin 
that simplifies the creation of content package maven artifacts. The 
content packages can later be used to install content into a JCR 
repository using the Apache Jackrabbit FileVault packaging runtime.
Filevault was contributed 4 years ago, but we never had a tool to 
create the packaged during runtime. Adobe's plugin is publicly 
available, but only in binary form. This contribution brings the 
source and development closer to the filevault core.

Retirement of Apache Jackrabbit 2.4: the Apache Jackrabbit PMC 
decided that since the 2.4 branch of the project looks like not 
being used any more to drop support and deprecate this version. 
Previous branch, tags and releases will still be available for 
future references, but will not show up on the download page 
any more.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest stable versions 
(2.14 for Java 7, 2.12 for Java 6).

We held an Oak Hackathon August 21st to 25th in Basel - 
Switzerland, which was free and open to everyone. See 
https://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/Oakathon%20August%202017.

There are various talks around Jackrabbit at this year's 
AdaptTo conference in Berlin Sept. 25th to 27th. 

## Health report: 
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
lists as well as on the various JIRA issues. 

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description

Apache Labs exists to incubate small and emerging projects from ASF
committers.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

- Another quiet period for Labs, with essentially zero activity.
  
## Health report: 

- Having managed to ascertain that there is volunteer energy amongst the wider
community, the next step will be to identify a real use case to act as a test
of any proposed changes, and to articulate a revised labs offering to the PMC,
the members and the board. 
- Given that I believe that ASF<->Github integration is
critical to the future of this project I would be pleased to have advice from
board members about how I can engage with infrastructure without generating
disproportionate workload on that critical project.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

## Description: 
Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project

## Issues: there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- OFBiz fully redesigned and released its website. The new website is designed
with bootstrap and other libraries making it modern and responsive thus
working on all devices. In addition to the facelift, the website is also
redesigned in terms of navigation and menu structure to make it easy to
  locate resources. The new design is also more SEO friendly
- Refactoring work continues on all areas of the project with more focus on
the core components
- A redesign of the user interface is underway in which all web artifacts are
removed from the framework into a separate directory called the "common"
theme. The purpose of this initiative is to decouple any web-artifacts from
the framework for better and cleaner implementations. We expect this change to
improve the ability to update the user interface by reducing the amount of
artifacts altered with each change
- A decision was made by the community to centralize the data loading process
in one component to ease development and data review [1]
- The project discontinued support for the unreleased branches 14.12 and 15.12
- An initiative is underway to improve the code and detect bugs using code
analysis tools available through the build system.
- the activity in the official blog [2] is steady with monthly blog posts that
highlight the main activities in the project; we have been also active on
Twitter [3] and other social media [4]; we have had a medium activity in our
  public HipChat room [5]
- vulnerability reports: two reports have been received by the OFBiz security
list but after investigating we realized they do not apply to any active
release branches and do not qualify as vulnerabilities; the security team
still needs to provide an official answer to the reporters

## Health report:
This has been another active quarter for the project,
despite Jun-Jul-Aug being a traditionally slow period: one new release issued,
two new committers, increased number of subscribers and email messages, a
steady number of tickets filed and resolved; the community is slowly growing.

## PMC changes: 
- Currently 19 PMC members
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Deepak Dixit on Fri Feb 24 2017
 
## Committer base changes:

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]
## Description:
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.
   
## Olingo Status
Olingo has no issues that would require board attention.
As of last week we released a new minor version of the OData V4 code line.
The OData V4.01 specification is still in the public review at Oasis so there
has been no progress on that end.

The traffic on the mailing lists and in our JIRA is on a stable rate. Most issues
that are created revolve around bugs with very little feature requests. Issues 
with contributions come in more regular now and are picked up by the community.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    We finally have released the long-awaited 2.0.5 maintenance version,
    with no new problems reported against it so far.  Development has
    continued (albeit more slowly than last quarter) on the 2.1.0 version.
    We have started discussion about removing applet support entirely
    but have not come to any firm conclusions yet.

Health Report:
    Unchanged from last report -- although the new release has not resulted
    in any net gain in interest that we can see.  There are still at least
    three PMC members listening for votes, etc.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Polygene Project  [Paul Merlin]

Description: 
Apache Polygene is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented Programming for domain centric application development.
   
Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
Activity: 
 - The quarter was a flurry of activity leading up to the long overdue release 3.0.0, which involved a massive refactoring where all our own functional and streaming was replaced with those available in Java 8.
 - Following the release, people have taken a well-deserved rest, but we are probably ready for one more release this year.
 - The JDK 9 Outreach program is nothing new other than that the release are compatible with "legacy mode" and "jigsaw mode" has not yet been attended to.
   
Health report: 
 - This remains a small project, but it is active and we have enough active PMC members to continue. We have not been able to attract new blood, one feedback seen on blog post complained that it was too difficult to understand what it is all about. Perhaps re-working the Introduction and Tutorial sections will help.
   
PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 12 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

 - No new changes to the committer base since last report. 
   
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Kent Sølvsten at Sun Jun 14 2015 

Releases: 
   
 - Apache Polygene 3.0.0 was released on Wed Jul 26 2017 
   
Mailing list activity: 
   
 - The drop in mail activity was due to last quarter's much higher traffic in the build up to finalizing the 3.0.0 release. It has now dropped down to more ordinary levels, except the last month or so, when the most active people have been taking vacation.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Portals Project  [David Sean Taylor]

## Description:

Apache Portals exists to promote the use of open source portal technology. We
intend to build freely available and interoperable portal software in order to
promote the use of this technology. With the Pluto project, we provide a
reference implementation for the Java portlet standard. The Jetspeed project
is a full feature enterprise open source portal. The Portals Applications
project is dedicated to providing robust, full-featured, commercial-quality,
and freely available portlet applications.

## Activity:

Apache Portals released 0 releases since the last report.

Developers are working daily with the Portlet 3.0 TCK as we implement Portlet
3.0 support for our portal products. We have challenged the validity of some
TCK tests and also fixed some TCK bugs. But since the TCK is not a releasable
artifact, we don't have any plans to release it in the future. 

No additional members since last report

we have transited it in EOL.
- We want currently focus on ServiceMix 7 and upgrading preparing the new
release containing the newest versions of Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.
- We have released 4 sets of OSGi bundles and a new release of ServiceMix Specs.

lifecycle (as ServiceMix Features) and provide better modularity and maintainability of
ServiceMix.
- We are going to focus more on improvement of the documentation (which was migrated lately
into the Asciidoc format) and improvement of the examples to give people easier start into
integration with ServiceMix.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for September 2017

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

There has been little change from the previous quarter. Bug reports have been
at a steady slow pace, with responses and fixes keeping up. Most technical
activity has been on the mass-check/rule update infrastructure.

The users list has been quite active and fairly technical for a user oriented
list. There is a regular presence of some committers/PMC answering questions
and participation in the discussions.

Issues:

Our mass-check system / rule update services have been migrated to its new VM.
We have been dealing with instability problems including hangs. Infra has been
responsive, increasing the RAM and number of cores in the VM. We have enabled
additional logging to better track root causes of problems if they persist
even with the increase in resources.

The mass-check seems to be operational again, leaving problems with the output
of rule update still to be resolved. Much thanks to Infra for their
assistance. We continue to debug rule updates.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.1 on 30 April 2015.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Our new	3.4.2 release is close to ready for a release candidate but that will
be held	until the the resurrection of the mass-check / rule update system on
the new platform is successful.

Committer/PMC changes:

Most recent new committers:

Dave Jones (davej) 26 April 2017

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description: 
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - A security vulnerability (CVE-2017-9799) affecting the 1.1.x and 1.0.x 
   release lines was was discovered by the Apache Storm PMC. The issue was 
   discussed privately by the PMC and patched. Versions 1.0.4 and 1.1.1 were 
   released to address the vulnerability prior to public announcement.
 - Version lines 1.1.x and 1.0.x are currently in maintenance mode with new
   feature development focusing on upcoming releases of versions 1.2 and 2.0.
 - Progress continues on the 2.0 release, which includes replacing Storm's 
   Clojure code with pure Java implementations.
 - Anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that the move from Clojure to Java has
   increased contributor activity to the 2.0 release (which was one of the 
   stated goals behind the decision).
 - An ongoing discussion is taking place around implementing a "Storm 
   Improvement Proposal (SIP)" process for major changes/efforts. Concensus
   has yet to emerge, with some worrying the process may add too much overhead
   and suggesting a lightweight experiment before adopting it as policy.
 - We have moved from a manual changelog/release notes management to a scripted
   report generation tool that pulls data from JIRA.
   
## Health report: 
 - Project activity continues to be fairly consistent, with periodic lulls and
   bursts in activity.
 - New contributors continue to engage and that engagement tends to keep up
   activity levels, even as some contributors move on.
 - The upcoming 2.0 release seems to have spurred activity, and the move from 
   Clojure to Java appears to have attracted additional contributors.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Mick Semb Wever]

## Description:
 Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for Java
 applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify
 the development of user interfaces.

## Activity:
 Apache Tiles saw more traffic project this quarter. An higher number of 
commits and traffic on the dev ML than normal.

 One meta release has passed and a public release is in progress. This will 
be followed by one more release. It looks like there will also be four more 
releases following this. There has been a few small fixes around the 
website. 

## Health report:
 There are currently two responsive PMC, other PMC help out with votes
when needed.  A recent ML discussion showed there's still a small
community of people that care. There remains a need to add another 
committer to the project.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]


## Description:
 - A Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java WebSocket and Java
   Unified Expression language specifications implementation.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
-  Continued healthy activity across multiple components and
   responsiveness on both dev and user lists.
-  The Tomcat PMC is organising a small 1 day conference to be held
   in London later this month. At the time of writing just under two
   thirds of the twenty available places have been sold and we have
   contingency plans in place to double capacity should a last minute
   rush take us over twenty.
   Thanks to the combination of generous sponsorship and ticket sales
   we are on track to have a sufficient surplus of funds after this
   event to provide seed money (e.g. to book venues, subsidize
   speaker travel) for the next event. The aim is to be able to hold a
   handful of small events a year - based nearish committers to reduce
   speaker travel costs - that are self-financing so they can survive
   without ongoing sponsorship or subsidy / financial guarantees from
   either the ASF or individual PMC members. If we are fortunate enough
   to obtain sponsorship then that will open up the possibility of
   bringing in more speakers and/or more frequent events.
   We intend to publish 'accounts' after each event so the community
   has visibility of how the events are being financed.
   If, for any reason, we decide to discontinue these events, any
   remaining funds will be transferred to the ASF.

## Security:
 - Detailed status:
   http://tomcat.apache.org/security.html

 - Important: Security Constraint Bypass CVE-2017-7675
   The HTTP/2 implementation bypassed a number of security checks that
   prevented directory traversal attacks. It was therefore possible to
   bypass security constraints using an specially crafted URL.
   Affects: 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M21, 8.5.0 to 8.5.15

 - Moderate: Cache Poisoning CVE-2017-7674
   The CORS Filter did not add an HTTP Vary header indicating that the
   response varies depending on Origin. This permitted client and server
   side cache poisoning in some circumstances.
   Affects:  9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M21, 8.5.0 to 8.5.15, 7.0.0 to 7.0.77

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description: 
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
- Development of the remaining issues regarding VCL 2.5 was finished.
- VCL 2.5 was released on August 22nd.
- Prior to the release, the steps listed on the ASF's crypto page were
  completed. [1] Apache VCL is now listed on the exports page. [2]
- Development has obviously slowed since the push to get the release out.
  Some work is being done to update documentation.
   
## Health report: 
 - Health continues to be a concern. Only 3 committers/PMC members voted in
   the VCL 2.5 release thread. [3]
 - We have recently seen involvement from new community members interested
   in contributing some features which could significantly help modernize
   the codebase. [4][5]
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Aaron Coburn on Tue Jun 19 2012 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 8 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Young Hyun Oh at Sun Dec 08 2013 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 2.4.2 on Wed Apr 15 2015 (Note: I'll work to figure out
   why the most recent release isn't being detected by the report generation
   tool)
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - Dev list traffic continued to be heavy relative to what VCL's dev list
   usually sees. This is surely due to the flurry of activity related to the
   release.
 - User list traffic has been pretty light. I hope to see an uptick as
   people and organizations (hopefully) upgrade to VCL 2.5.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Report from the Apache Wicket project [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework.

## Noteworthy items:

- 3 releases, 1 attempt at emergency fix (7.8.1, cancelled) were
  performed

- Wicket 8 is around the corner

## Issues: 

- No issues require board attention.
  
## Activity: 

- The free ride we got from OpenShift for hosting our examples
  projects (we have 3 actively maintained branches with each an
  examples project) is over, so we are pursuing an ASF hosted VM for
  our examples. Infra and the PMC are working together to get this
  completed.

- A major issue was discovered in 7.8.0, where upon a user logging
  out, the corresponding storage for its session was not cleaned up in
  Wildfly. The fix we implemented for a 7.8.1 release created problems
  for Tomcat, so 7.8.1 was not released. A more proper fix has now
  been applied and is under test. A 7.9.0 release will be forth
  coming. This was a nice example of the community working together to
  fix the issue again and again.

- We are on the cusp of releasing Wicket 8, so we'll be working with
  Sally for the corresponding press coverage.
  
## Health report: 

- The community is stable as is to be expected from a mature server
  side Java web framework. We don't anticipate a sudden large growth
  or large decline.
  
- Questions to the user list and dev list are answered, resolved and
  discussed.
  
## PMC changes:

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Sean Busbey]

## Description:

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and release
processes for software projects.

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

No new PMC additions in this period; our last PMC addition was Ajay Yadava on
Dec 1st, 2016. There are currently 8 PMC members.

No new committer additions in this period; our last committer additions were
Andrew Wang and Ajay Yadava on Sep 20th, 2016. There are 
currently 10 committers.

Community is working on 0.5.1, an emergency release to fix a critical,
non-security bug on some platforms.

## Health report: 

Apache Yetus is now two years old!

"A rising tide lifts all boats."

Contributions remain low but fairly consistent. Most contributions are related
to other Apache projects investigating or migrating to using 
Apache Yetus in their workflows.

The project is healthy given our goal of a common shared space for exactly
these kinds of common tasks, despite the appearance low activity 
level.

Our challenge remains to keep these new contributors engaged enough 
beyond getting their project up and running.

## Releases: 

- 0.5.0 was released on Mon Jul 10 2017 

## Mailing list activity:

Attachment BU: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Junqueira]

## Description: 
 Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It enables
distributed systems to implement a variety of primitives and mechanisms
that are critical for them to function, e.g., distributed locks, master
election, group membership, and configuration.
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
There has been no significant change to the project status
since the last report. There has been no addition to the
set of committers or PMC. The traffic of mailing lists has
not changed significantly, although the number of subscribers
has increased slightly and the overall number of messages
to the dev list has dropped.
   
## Health report: 
The PMC has been working with contributors and committers to
get them to the point that both committership and PMC membership,
respectively, can be offered.
 
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 13 PMC members. 
 - Michael Han was added to the PMC on Wed Jun 21 2017

## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 3.5.3 on Mon Apr 17 2017 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
Dev list traffic has dropped by ~10%. User list traffic has increases
by 15%. The traffic drop of the mailing lists is very likely due to
the summer vacation period, which is typically a bit slower.

## Description: 
Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data. Apache Marmotta was founded
in December 2012, and has graduated from the Incubator in November 2013.
  
## Issues: 
There are no major issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity: 
Another period of low activity, also caused by an extra summer-low. 
We're still struggling to ensure the midterm viability of the project.

Google Summer of Code brought us an engaged student working on the task of
upgrading from Sesame to Eclipse RDF4J. The codebase shows good progress, but
was not finished due to open issues within the codebase and third-party
libraries. More details in our wiki (https://s.apache.org/tVx6) and the
related PR (https://s.apache.org/o38k)

## Health report: 
The project was considered feature-complete in 3.3.0. The current release
cycle (3.4.0) focuses on refining and fixing bug, plus incorporation some
non-core new features. The development activities
(issues, commits, emails) have significantly come down in the last year.
  
## PMC changes: 
- Currently 11 PMC members. 
- Last PMC addition was Mark A. Matienzo on Thu Aug 18 2016 

## Committer base changes:

Attachment BX: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Bert Huijben]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library
   built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the
   default client library of Apache Subversion, Apache OpenOffice and
   mod_pagespeed.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   There hasn't been much activity over the last few months, but in the
   last few weeks a number of network test scenarios were run for
   Subversion, which found a few minor issues in older versions. The
   patches for these issues are already backported to the maintenance
   branches. We expect that we will put out a new release with these
   fixes within a few weeks.

## Health report: 
   Activity is at a normal, fairly quiet level.

   The serf project's activity is quite related to that of Subversion
   and with that projects recent affairs we slowed more than expected.

## PMC & Committer changes: 
   Currently 12 PMC members and 13 committers. We added Evgeny Kotkov
   as Committer and PMC member this April.

## Releases:
   Apache Serf 1.3.9 was released on Thu Sep 01 2016

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   Normal slow activity.

Attachment BZ: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release that integrates
Xerces-C.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

This report should have been submitted last month (August 2017).

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Most activity has been through JIRA issue tracking. The email lists
have seen little activity.

We are reviewing the background of a committer of another Apache project 
that may be willing to participate with Xalan-C activities.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.
