 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, I created a draft 5-year plan document. The document is
       under review, along with the budget projection that Sam and the
       Officers produced. I also posted a draft document retention and access
       policy. Time permitting, we will begin discussion of the 5-year plan
       at this meeting.  The draft plan and policy documents are posted in
       the Board team drive in ASF GSuite.  Any interested member can request
       access to this space.

       Many thanks to the members preparing and submitting reports this
       month. There were some very good ones, including descriptions of
       challenges and how PMCs are handling them.  We encourage and
       appreciate focus on problems like volunteers leaving, decisions about
       backward compatibility / legacy support, chair rotation and community
       conflicts.  The Beam report, for example, does a great job calling out
       both challenges and achievements.  The TomEE report includes a great
       example of a PMC addressing conflict directly and practically.

       Director comments this month repeated the themes from last month: use
       private lists only for things that need to be private, consider a
       lower bar to increase the flow of new committers into a project, and
       reminders to always include the date of last committer and PMC
       additions.  Two PMCs were reminded that in general company names don't
       belong in reports (unless there is something specific to them) and it
       was recommended to use durable message links from lists.apache.org
       (Ponymail) when these are used in reports.

    B. President [Sam]

       Items requiring board attention:

       * Budget

       Most of the areas not covered by the EVP report are covered by the
       budget.  I particularly encourage careful reading of the Brand
       Management and Fundraising reports (the later having a discussion item
       that can be deferred to the mailing list in my opinion).

       On the topic of the budget, first some overall thoughts:

       1) The five year budget is a plan, not a commitment.  As such, it
          should be based on reasonable assumptions, such as the recent
          conference investment decision won't fail spectacularly, and that
          there will be continued need to hire in areas where volunteers prove
          to be insufficient.

       2) A five year plan is where the board SHOULD in my opinion explore
          potentially radical ideas; even if those ideas had been explored
          years ago with a different conclusion.  My one caveat is that the
          expectation should be that those ideas would be executed over the
          course of five years; and this exercise SHOULD NOT be the vehicle
          for driving sudden and rapid change.

       Next for some specific thoughts:

       1) Infrastructure remains the biggest ticket item.  Given that the
          largest costs within that item are people costs, this expense is
          thought to be largely independent (at least within the five year
          horizon) of either the rate of growth of the foundation or increasing
          dependency on services hosted elsewhere.

       2) The next biggest items is labeled Marketing and Publicity.  I say
          labeled as this item really encompasses so much more - pretty much
          every operational area (with the possible exception of infrastructure)
          is directly affected by this area; as are many PMCs.  Satisfaction
          with the work done is also quite high.

       3) The next biggest area is Fundraising.  The level of incomes specified
          in the plan are thought to be achievable, but not without some risk.
          Nothing is certain, so the risk is never 0% or 100%; but it is
          thought to be highly unlikely that those numbers will be reached
          without hiring a fundraiser (probably initially part time, then
          ultimately full time) during the next 5 years.  Doing so doesn't make
          the risk 0%, but makes the income numbers comfortable in my
          estimation.  What level of risk the board is willing to undertake is
          an open question.

       4) After that comes Brand Management.  The proposal we have is based on
          what was the board majority (but not consensus) opinion at the time
          that encouraging PMCs to register their trademarks early was prudent
          and cost effective in the long run.  Since that time, costs have gone
          up, and questions have grown as to whether that approach is
          sustainable with volunteers.  It is time for the board to revisit
          this question, and either reaffirm the previous direction or start
          the planning process for a new direction.

       5) The fifth biggest item is General and Administration.  The amount
          chosen there reflects us NOT pursuing a paid position for President /
          COO / ED; but continuing to have an EA.

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first Seven
       months of FY18.

       Cash on Nov 30th, 2017 was $1,632K, which is down $78K from last
       month’s ending balance (Oct 17) of $1,710K, due to the timing of some
       Sponsor payments and Payables released.   The Nov 2017 cash balance is
       down $67K from the Nov 2016 month end balance of $1,699K.  The Nov
       2017 ending cash balance of $1,632K represents a cash reserve of 14.3
       months based on the FY18 conservative Cash forecast average monthly
       spending of $114.2K/month. The ASF reserve continues to be very
       healthy for an organization of ASF’s size, with a conservative FY18 YE
       estimate of 13.1 months of Operating cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong and
       favorable showing against our FY18 budget at this of point of the FY,
       however as I will continue to note, because we are on a cash basis,
       the timing of Sponsor payments received and Payables released plays a
       big part in how well we perform financially month to month and year
       over year.  This month we are under the FY 18 plan for Revenue, and
       over plan in Expenses again due basically to timing.  So again, I just
       want to keep this on the radar that we need to continue to focus on
       our new sponsors but we also cannot afford to take any focus away from
       our existing sponsors as that was how the FY18 budget was constructed.
       The Fundraising team continues to do an excellent job in both areas,
       servicing both new and existing Sponsors.  With total actual Revenue,
       as of Nov 30th, 2017, of $854.2K, we are 69.6% of the way to our total
       Revenue budget for FY18 of $1,226.5K, being only 58% of the way
       through FY18.  Regarding Sponsor revenue, we have received so far in
       the first seven months of FY18, $764.6K, which has us 70.5% of the way
       to our budgeted Sponsor revenue goal of $1,084K for FY18.  This is
       fantastic, only 58% of the way through the current Fiscal Year.  As
       for the third revenue category, “donations” we have received $60.3K
       against a total budget of $111K or 54% of our budget seven months into the
       FY. This is due in part to the success we have had utilizing the “Hopsie”
       donation platform for the first time.  We remain conservative in our
       forecasting, showing modest annual increases in annual Sponsorship and
       Donations, due to actual collected amounts such as those coming from
       Hopsie (which was not budgeted for FY 18).

       YTD expenses, through Nov 30th, 2017 are under budget by $60.8K.  Most
       depts. are either under budget or at budget, (Infra, YTD, is over in
       total by $7.1K due to a few budget items such as spare parts and the
       currency conversion to GBP vs what was estimated in the FY18 budget
       for the Lease web payments). We will continue to monitor the actual vs
       budget as we move through the remaining five months of FY18 and we
       will stay in contact with the dept. heads as we close each month going
       forward so that we have a clearer picture for the remainder of the
       Fiscal year.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $116.2K NI vs a budgeted negative <$179.8K> NI or $296K ahead
       of the FY 18 Budget for Net Income seven months into the FY.  With the
       current conservative forecasted revenue, and expenses for the
       remainder of FY 18, we are estimating a $-91.8K negative NI for FY18
       vs a budgeted NI loss of -$167.8K or about a $76K better NI than the
       FY18 budget.  I would also like to point out that YTD 18 vs YTD 17 we
       are $282.7K ahead in Revenue while Expenses were only $82.6K ahead
       year over year, for a $200K increase in Net Income year over year
       ($116.2K positive NI in FY18 vs <-$83.8K> NI in FY 17).  Again, I want
       to congratulate the entire Organization on these very positive
       financial results as we are now seven months through FY 18.  Though we
       do need to continue to keep these efforts up as we move through the
       back half of FY 18, and continue to give Fundraising all the support
       we can, while keeping an eye on our expenses at the same time, we
       should also recognize that the Foundation as compared to not only its
       FY18 budget but also FY 17 is in “a very good place” and we should all
       be very proud of that fact.

       The Cash Basis Audit has begun in December 2017 and we will keep
       everyone updated as to its progress as continues into 2018.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

No issues to report at this time


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD (continuing issue)

A few people have put forth specific and workable ideas for ways to improve
how trademarks@ answers incoming questions.  The specific ideas are helpful
but will take time to code as volunteers - and still relies on volunteers
showing up regularly to do the work of pushing answers.

The broader question of ensuring our project communities are aware of our
trademarks and policies around them - so that questions actually get raised to
the right place - is still outstanding.  I expect that part of the answer for
this effectively will have to come out of some of the 5 year planning.  The
root issue is better mentoring and education in the Incubation process, as
well as better support for existing TLPs.

To better understand the Brand scope, I've created a full list of tasks/topics
that the Brand Management Committee needs to perform on a regular basis, which
includes 24 distinct kinds of tasks, requiring a variety of skill levels and
timescales, including many tasks answering external inquiries.

Similarly, I've done a thorough analysis of all emails on the trademarks@ list
in the past year, trying to quantify who and how questions come in and get
answered.  This shows that over 40% of questions come from outside parties -
typically vendors or other corporations using Apache brands.  It also shows
that the majority of answers to all questions come from Shane directly,
something that is clearly unsustainable for a number of reasons.

(To be continued next month, reviewing progress on specific ideas)


* OPERATIONS

Slower month than usual as we start the holiday season, which is good since I
am spending more volunteer time working on improvement ideas than answering
daily questions.

Website Analytics shows average traffic.  Approximately half are mobile vs.
desktop.  Oddly the great majority of hits still come from direct hits, not
search results or referrals from any other tracked pages.  This makes it
difficult to understand how our readers got to our policy.


* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

Our MESOS application has been published to the USPTO Gazette and should be
moving to final stage shortly after the board meeting, and the TEZ
registration was formally granted.

Successfully finished long-running negotiations and signed a formal consent
agreement with a commercial vendor, which will now allow one of our project
registration applications to move forward.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

TL;DR, things are going well and planned mapped out at beginning of my
tenure for FY18 is being executed well.

Board Discussion: Thoughts on licensing ASF commercially if people so
desire?  Daniel Shahaf pointed out https://sqlite.org/copyright.html. 
If people will pay for it and we give them nothing extra, any
concerns?

Resolution to establish VP, Sponsor Relations [TABLED and currently
pending JimJ input, please table until Jan or Feb]

New Silver Sponsor: Union Investment w/interest in Silver or Gold
renewal next year.

3 Year Purchase order CY2018 to 2020 from CapitalOne for Silver
Sponsorship

Baidu is working with John D Ament to bring echarts to the ASF as a
project.  echarts is a Top 3 project in github data visualization
tools. https://github.com/ecomfe/echarts

New Silver Sponsor: Aetna

MSDN aka Visual Studio targeted sponsorship is working again thanks to
Ross and Microsoft.

FY23 Projected Budget Submitted -
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bd7FRaC5gmfLBYX4zBHU4vmNBVK3SRC4sKfyDRQx3fY/edit#gid=0

Audit of Sponsors considered complete.  Largely reflected at
http://www.staging.apache.org/foundation/thanks2.html

Fundraising Quarterly Report Submitted -
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o2zf-PLanwXGhX9DS3MdYgn9eqVXrDEPKRC3IyC9y8M/edit

Heavily Revised 2nd Draft of the Targeted Sponsorship Program was sent
out for comments
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JhZEcty2fSx7ZxiBs41j3qOUrqsA7TvKmQ13ZZ61lJY/edit#
NOTE: This program is already in use for non-controversial
implementations.

Reminder that the ASF G Suite instance is up and running available for
use on request.

Huwawei is also working to incubate one, possibly two projects now.

Hopsie is now over $17K in individual donations.

Have removed Yahoo! & HP from thanks page as we have not been able to
pin down a renewal for many months (that’s a platinum and a gold
sponsor)  BUT we just confirmed Oath as a platinum for 2018 at 2018
rates (125K) so just about a wash.

Some other notes: Hortonworks locked in for another year.  ARM is
renewing.  HPE is unable to renew. Facebook also sent a PO for another
year.  Google is invoiced for another year and working with Sam on IBM
for a 3 year agreement.

Applied for Pineapple Fund.  Told them if they gave us $500K in
bitcoin, we’d name a future TLP Apache Pineapple.  If it happens,
we’ll cross that bridge but feel free to flame me on that one :-)

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are closing out the calendar year on budget and on

to the ASF team at Virtual.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: work with ASF Fundraising continues.
Sally Khudairi has secured several Sponsor commitments for multi-year
sponsorship renewals, as well as Platinum and Gold Sponsor promotions
for early 2018. Our individual giving campaign for the holidays
launched late November, and we raised over $2K in individual donations
through Hopsie thus far (additional donations have been made through
other channels, which will be reported through
Fundraising/Accounting). We have also published the FY2018 Operations
Summary for Q2 https://s.apache.org/j1GJ

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. We are preparing the final “Success at Apache” blog
post for this calendar year. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with
a total of 177 weekly summaries published to date. We tweeted 26
items, and have 44.7K followers on Twitter. We posted 8 items on
LinkedIn, which garnered more than 246.8K organic impressions in
total.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 6 media queries. The ASF received
2,119 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 2,090. Media coverage
of Apache projects yielded 5,039 press hits vs. last month's 5,579.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received two analyst queries that involved
fact-checking/reviewing preview copies of two influencer report in the
Cloud and Artifcat Repositories categories. Apache was mentioned in 46
reports by Gartner, 3 reports by Forrester, 12 reports by 451
Research, and 6 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: no projects are currently in production.

IX. Events liaison: Sally has been working with Sharan Foga on the
ASF’s ComDev presence at various events over the course of the fiscal
year. In addition, we have been invited to participate in the Open
Expo Madrid eBook; spots still remain for any interested participants.

X. Newswire accounts: we have used all of our pre-paid press releases
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire for the calendar year, and have activated
our 2018-2019 contract early to issue our announcements without
interruption.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infrastructure is operating normally, and believes there are no issues
for the President or the Board.

Finances
========
The Infra budget is the largest at the ASF, and we are holding to our
FY18 goals, so all is fine here. As noted last month, the FY18 year
budget was incorrectly forecasted (though we're holding to it). That
has been corrected in the five year budget that we presented to the
President.

We've cleaned out a lot of stale virtual machines and volumes in AWS,
saving us some good money (we're currently spending against credits
that Amazon provided to us last year).

Short Term Priorities
=====================
* Get our team familiar with Azure and start using some of the credit
  donated by Microsoft.
* Wrap up our LDAP server(s) simplification plan.
* Upgrade Jira.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
* Deprecate git-wip and move all projects onto gitbox (GitHub as master)

General Activity
================
Oath/Yahoo donated a bunch more Jenkins build nodes. We've also
updated the connection mechanism so that externally-run nodes (such as
those ran by the MXnet podling) could more easily connect to our
Jenkins Master.

We've had some ongoing work to replace mail-archive.a.o and
mail-search.a.o until we get lists.a.o certified (we still need to
lay out our requirements for that).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

This month we have been in discussions with the planners of Berlin
Buzzwords and FOSS Backstage about colocating ApacheCon EU 2018 with
their event in Berlin. There are still some things to be worked out as
to what our event would look like, how we would co-market with them,
and how big our presence would be in 2018. If there were a successful
event, we would also consider pursuing a larger event in 2019.

There has also been some discussion of a North America event later in
the year. Ruth Suehle, who has worked with Flock (The Fedora
conference) for many years has been advising us on various things, and
may play a role in producing that event if we can arrive at a plan
that everyone agrees to.

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

W3C Advisory Board proposed making a public statement in support of Net
Neutrality.  Given the short notice, the W3C Team asked for any
objections, rather than a full discussion cycle.  They received 3 and
will not be making a public statement.

Bruno Kinoshita (kinow@) has joined the Art & Culture (Museums) On The Web
Community Group and the foundation has signed the W3C Community Contributor
License Agreement.

Stian Soiland-Reyes (stain@) has joined the Bioschemas for lifesciences
Community Group and the foundation has signed the W3C Community Contributor
License Agreement.

Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

Over the last month, activity slowed down a bit.

The Committee provided guidance regarding how best to include Apache license
headers in source code repositories, as explained in LEGAL-346 [1].

A contributor brought a question to the Legal PMC regarding whether or not UML
models may themselves be produced under the ALv2. The committee provided
guidance that ALv2 is allowed not just for code, but for data and models as
well, as indicated in LEGAL-351 [2].

An ASF project was concerned about the use of a dependency licensed under the
JSON-lib license, and per guidance provided in the cited thread (LEGAL-349
[3]), the project decided that the particular dependency needed to be replaced
with an alternative.

Another dependency related question, this time whether or not a dependency
licensed under BSD-3 with nuclear clause could be distributed along with an
Apache project was resolved in LEGAL-304 [4].

The EPL 2.0 license was added to Category-B in LEGAL-335 [5].

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as
Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Currently, Bahir provides extensions to multiple distributed
analytic platforms, extending their reach with a diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data
sources.

Community Activity:

Apache Bahir community has been actively working on supporting and enhancing previously
available Apache Spark extensions and new extensions continue to be proposed to the project. 

In the past couple months the Flink extension contributions saw a good level of activity, and
similar thing happened on the new extension for CounchDB/Cloudant for Spark.

Bahir should be catching up on both fronts and release extensions for Spark and Flink early 2018.

Issues:
* No known issues

Releases:
08/22/2017 - Bahir for Spark 2.2.0

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Davor Bonaci]

## Description:

Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:

There are no issues that require the Board's attention at this time.

While the project is doing well, I do want to point out that for the first
time there have been some departures from the community as noted in the Health
report below. This is to be expected with projects of this size and requires
no Board attention at this time.

## Activity:

This month we are celebrating the one year anniversary of becoming a top-level
project. Over the past year, the project has grown substantially, crossing 200
lifetime individual contributors, and nearing 500 mailing list subscribers.
The project published 7 releases, including a major one, version 2.0.0, the
first release that comes with an API stability promise.

In this quarter, the main technical focus continues to be on the portability
framework, and its adoption across all components of the project, which would,
among other benefits, extend the Python SDK to all Beam runners. A sizeable
portion of the community is working on this effort.

An SDK for Go has been contributed/donated to the project by Google, after
design and initial development stage outside of the community. The project has
accepted this contribution, and it is currently managed as a new component in
a feature branch. Hopefully, with community involvement, the component can be
merged into master sometime next year.

As usual, the project kept interconnecting additional execution engines and
data storage/messaging systems, and serves as a glue in the ecosystem. On the
execution side, runners for JStorm, Apache Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Samza and
Apache Tez are being prototyped in feature branches, but without too much
recent activity. The Spark runner migration from Apache Spark 1.6 to 2.x is
nearing completion. On the IO connector side, the healthy growth continues,
with new connectors being contributed month-over-month (Redis, RabbitMQ, and
others).

Out of the major discussions that affect the future of the project, it is
worth noting the following discussions:
- Continuing to support Java 7 vs. requiring users to upgrade to Java 8 in a
  future release.
- Continuing to support Apache Spark 1.6 vs. requiring users to have a Spark
  2.x cluster.
- Switching the build system from Apache Maven to Gradle.

In all three cases, the majority preference seem to be trending towards
upgrading, but with varying degrees of opposing opinion as well.

With respect to outreach, there have been no blog posts or press releases this
quarter. Beam was featured at Strata Data Conference New York and Singapore,
QCon San Francisco, as well as several local meetups in the Bay Area, New
York, London, Singapore, Guadalajara and Stockholm.

Outside the project, IBM launched an Apache Beam runner for IBM Streams as a
part of their cloud offering.  Enabling users to easily run Beam pipelines on
IBM Cloud is good for the overall project growth.

Going forward, the main focus should to be on the community growth,
particularly on the user side using non-proprietary engines. On the technical
side, the next major milestone is the completion of the portability framework
across all components of the project.

## Health report:

The community continues to grow steadily, as follows:
- Lifetime unique contributors grew to 215, with 19 new first-time
  contributors.
- Both PMC and committer base grew by 2 members each.
- Mailing list subscribers/activity continue the healthy growth, with over 40
  new user@ mailing list subscribers and 50% increase in dev@ email volume.
- The release cadence continues, albeit significantly slower than before.

The community diversity has decreased somewhat with the departure or
inactivity of a handful of early PMC members that were community champions.
The effects are visible in the community tone, behavior and consensus
building. This is not unexpected for a project of this size and at this point
in time, but it is something that we will work to regain over the next few
months.

## PMC changes:

Currently 18 PMC members. Two new PMC members have been added since the last
report:
- Ismaël Mejía was added to the PMC on Wed Nov 08 2017.
- Reuven Lax was added to the PMC on Wed Nov 08 2017.

## Committer base changes:

Currently 31 committers. Two new committers have been added since the last
report:
- Etienne Chauchot was added as a committer on Wed Nov 08 2017.
- Melissa Pashniak was added as a committer on Wed Nov 08 2017.

## Releases:

Since the last report, Apache Beam has published one feature release, as well
as one patch release:
- 2.2.0 was released on Sat Dec 02 2017.
- 2.1.1 was released on Fri Sep 22 2017.

Version 2.0.0 was the first release that comes with API stability guarantees.
Going forward, we expect to publish a release every 2 months.

## Mailing list activity:

Mailing list subscriptions continue to increase modestly, along with the
healthy increases in the overall email volume. It is worth noting that we saw
an increase in frequency and depth of mailing list discussions, as well as
better participation and diversity of opinion compared to the previous
quarter.

- dev@beam.apache.org
  - 467 subscribers (up 16 in the last 3 months).
  - 1499 emails sent to list (934 in previous quarter).

- user@beam.apache.org
  - 487 subscribers (up 42 in the last 3 months).
  - 483 emails sent to list (404 in previous quarter).

## JIRA activity:

While JIRA activity continues to be healthy, this is the second quarter with
decreasing participation. Earlier in the year, when the community was working
towards the first stable release, we had 650 resolved issues in the quarter,
falling first to 278, and now dropping to 171. Going forward, this is an area
for improvement for the community, as we make sure to hear user feedback.

- 449 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months (505 in the previous quarter).
- 171 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months (278 in the previous
  quarter).

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

The project can still be considered to be in a low activity mode although
there appear to be some good progress in the form of discussions. See
further information below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

With the recognition of the previous report that there was an urgent need
to discuss the ongoing inactivity with the wider community, an email was
sent to the dev list to determine what appetite there was for continuing.
The initial discussion showed up a similar desire to continue the project
instead of allowing it to move to the Attic as the last time but it was
recognised that there would need to be further changes to the project to
foster ongoing development.

One of the changes that seemed to inspire some enthusiasm was the idea
of a potential break from the use of Trac as the base of the project.
This is being explored in further detail with a proposal to migrate the
project to use the Django web framework. Whilst it was recognised that
Trac has provided a solid base, the attractiveness of Bloodhound for
potential contributors is not particularly helped by needing to learn
so much about Trac.

Progress has also been made with reinstating the main instance of Apache
Bloodhound for self-hosting of issue tracking. John Chambers has pushed
this work forward, for which the rest of the PMC are grateful. In order
to complete this work, it was requested that a VM be prepared to host
the issue tracker and in response INFRA-13255 was reopened.

Further items of note include a recent proposal to look at the use of
gitbox and github mirroring for future work.

While it is recognised by the PMC that the above represents only limited
progress, the desire of the community appears to be to continue with the
project and so the PMC wishes to defer the proposal to move Apache
Bloodhound to the Attic for another three months. The PMC will continue
to encourage the community to contribute to the direction and look at
bringing in more contributors onto the PMC at the earliest opportunity.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description:

BookKeeper is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage
service optimized for append-only workloads. It has been used as
a fundamental service to build high available and replicated services
in companies like Twitter, Yahoo and Salesforce. It is also the log
segment store for Apache DistributedLog and message store for Apache Pulsar.

Apache DistributedLog is a high-level API and service layer for
Apache BookKeeper, providing easier access to the BookKeeper
primitives. It is a subproject of Apache BookKeeper.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - We have moved to a time based schedule, releasing quarterly to
 ensure new features ship at a regular interval. 4.6.0 will be the
 first release of this kind.
 - DistributedLog is aligning its release schedule with that of BookKeeper.
 - 4.5.0 was released on 14th August 2017
 - 4.5.1 was released on 22nd November 2017
 - We are progressing towards a 4.6.0 release. The branch has been
 frozen and we expect a release in the next two weeks.
 - BookKeeper development now entirely in github. Jira has been made
 read only. All jira issues have been migrated to github issues.
 - Continued work on merging changes from yahoo's branch changes into
 apache master.
 - Active discussion on a number of projects:
   - Relaxed durability
   - New client API
   - Improved documentation

## Health report:

- Development continues at a steady pace. We are merging one PR per
day on average.
- Mailing list and slack discussions are brisk, in particularly
around the active projects.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 13 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Dave Rusek on Mon Aug 07 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 18 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Dave Rusek at Tue Aug 08 2017

## Releases:

 - Last release was 4.5.1 on November 22 2017
 - Last release of DistributedLog was 0.5.0 on September 17 2017

## Mailing list activity:

A good number of merged contributions is introducing the mailing
list activity.

Consolidate efforts coming from DistributedLog graduation as
subproject. More contributor/committer engagement cause that
increased of mailing list activities.

We switch to use "issues" mailing lists for notifications from github
discussion and make "dev" mailing lists purely for discussion. so
there is a drop at "dev" mailing list and increase at "issues"
mailing list.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 

No issues require the board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
We have released 1.5.4 release, adding Kotlin support.
We are voting on the 1.5.5 release right now.
   
## Health report: 
The activity is slow, with 2 active committers.
Little activity on the user or dev list.

# Apache Cayenne Board Report, December 2017

## Description

Apache Cayenne is a Java database persistence framework. It takes a
distinct approach to object persistence and provides an ORM runtime,
remote persistence services, and a cross-platform GUI mapping/modeling
tool.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity

Cayenne has had a busy quarter with 3 releases over 3 different
development streams.

  - Maintenance only.  Cayenne 3.1.2 is a bug-fix release for the
    current stable product line.

- Cayenne 4.0 (development)
  - The second 4.0 beta (4.0.B2) was released.  The API is frozen,
    barring any major issues, and development effort is only for
    bug fixes and documentation leading up to the final release of
    Cayenne 4.0.

- Cayenne 4.1 (development)
  - The first milestone release of Cayenne 4.1 (4.1.M1) brings many
    wanted features, including vastly improved memory utilization,
    elimination of dependencies on external frameworks, an updated
    Cayenne Modeler cross-platform GUI mapping/modeling tool, and
    Java 8 support.

- Website
  - Work is progressing on an updated website with the goal to make
    it cleaner, more modern, and mobile-friendly.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Alexander Broekhuis]

Pepijn


## Description:

 - dynamic service framework for C and C++.


## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time


## Activity:

 -The PubSubAdmin implementation is refactored, so that serializers
are nog pluggable. This means that the discovery, transport and
serialisation techniques are now all pluggable and can differente
techniques can be combined.
- The CMake add_deploy mechanisme is updated to support a more easier
use in IDE. Practically this means that an add_deploy call will result
in a executable, which can be run directly from an IDE (with CMake
support).
- A CMake add_celix_docker is added so that minimal docker images
based on Celix can be created. This CMake function will create a
minimal filesystem with only the required executable/libraries and
bundles (unstripped ~ 17 mb)

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description: 
- The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java components.

- The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
  Apache and without. Any ASF committer can commit to Apache Commons.

- The last report was for the meeting of September 20, 2017.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
 - The project is active with twelve (12) releases this reporting period.
   
## Health report: 
 - Most components in Commons are mature, but are still actively maintained
   (12 releases). The dev list is active. JIRA is active. Speed of responses
   to users is reasonable in most cases. We have no new PMC members, no new 
   committers, and Commons is still open to any Apache Committer.
 - Previous growing pains toward Commons Math 4 might see resolution with a 
   plan toward splitting off Commons Math into new components.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

 A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.
   
## Issues: 
 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

We had eight platform releases - four patch release for iOS (4.5.1, 4.5.2,
4.5.3, 4.5.4), one patch release for Browser (5.0.1), two minor and one major
release for Android (6.3.0, 6.4.0, 7.0.0). The iOS and Browser releases were
just small bug fixes. The Android release now brings our Android project
structure to based of the Android Studio project structure. 

We had many plugins gets released. Most notable is that we have deprecated
`cordova-plugin-file-transfer`, `cordova-plugin-globalization`,
`cordova-plugin-contacts` and `cordova-plugin-compat`. Due to
`cordova-plugin-compat` being deprecated, we removed it as a dependency for a
handful of plugins and gave them major version bumps. 

Cordova-cli@7.1.0 was also released. This was accompanied by releases in other
tools that the CLI is composed of.

## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green.

We still have a huge backlog of GitHub Pull Request activity, again, same as
last quarter -- but it has improved. Infra has now moved over all of our git
repos to GitHub. This allows us to properly label pull requests. We also have
the ability to merge in pull requests via the website. 

We are in the process of deprecating a few of our plugins which can be
replaced by official W3C specs which have been implemented in the browsers of
the platforms we support. We are also in the process of integrating a couple
of plugins back into platforms and deprecating the plugins. This will help
ease the maintenance load on the team.

   http://drat.apache.org/
 - Nipurn Doshi and Shivika Thapur put together another draft at
   PR #110 here https://s.apache.org/bQss
   - currently working on getting this to be the main DRAT website, by
     updating content


## Health report:
 - We have had bug reports from a community member who may be a good candidate
   for the PMC.
 - We’ve had website development from two community members who are not yet
   PMC or committers and they may also be good candidates.
  - Now that we have our demo VM up, we will turn our attention to getting the
    weekly Apache reports out there for all of ASF Github. We just need to
    write some scripts to get this done. Hopefully by next quarter and its
    report.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 10 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 10 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

## Releases:

 - None as of yet, but hopefully will release a 1.0 soon once the ASF weekly
   report is up.

## Mailing list activity:

 - Mailing list subscriptions remain stable. Increasing amount of mail coming
   for discussions surrounding The website, setting up the VM and working with
   infra, and various bug fixes related to DRAT and OODT that came out of
   standing up the demo.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Eagle Project  [Edward Zhang]

## Description:
 - Apache Eagle is an open source analytics solution for identifying security
and performance issues instantly on big data platforms.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Inspired by eagle's streaming alert engine with siddhi, Hao Chen, Eagle
   committer contributed to flink community a similar light-weight siddhi
   streaming library
 - Community users asked for Cloudera CDH support and Eagle alert engine Spark
   streaming support. Although there is one implementation of Eagle alert
   engine on top of Spark, seems there is still some gap to be addressed
   in community to make Eagle and its alert engine work on Cloudera CDH.
 - Some casual discussion is about whether Eagle should maintain so many
   use cases or just focus on Alert engine or still do both. The reason why
   this dicussion was brought up is because currently Eagle maintains both
   use cases and alert engine, which causes code complexity and adoption
   difficulty. For example some heavy use cases like Job performance
   monitoring needs a complex setup. Those discussions will be sent to dev
   mail list to discuss.

## Health report:
 - There is a drop of number of jira tickets and mails. This should be fine
   and community users are trying out Eagle 0.5.0. We see some difficulties
   in setting up 0.5.0 from community feedback, which community should
   improve the documents and add some Q/A document in Eagle site.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 16 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Deng Lingang on Mon May 08 2017

## Committer base changes:
 - Currently 18 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Jay Sen at Thu Mar 16 2017

## Releases:
 - Last release was 0.5.0 on Sat Sep 09 2017

## Mailing list activity:
 - Some emails from a few users are about how to config/install Eagle and how to
   get HDFSAuditLog monitoring case running etc. It seems that community shows
   interest in using Eagle for HDFS audit log monitoring but hard to set it up
   because it involves many steps in a distributed enironment. Community needs
   a simple document to describe one installation.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Felix Project  [Karl Pauls]

## Description: 

Apache Felix is a project aimed at implementing specifications from 
the OSGi Alliance as well as implementing other supporting tools and 
technologies aligned with OSGi technology.
   
## Issues: 

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

 - Existing implementations have been improved/enhanced based on 
   community feedback. 
 - We continued to receive patches and bug reports from various new 
   users/contributors.
 - Effort ongoing to implement the upcoming OSGi R7 specifications.
 - Busy adapting the framework to Java 9 and JPMS (framework 5.6.10 
   was an important milestone in this regard).
 - Accepted BAR file installer contribution from Intel 
   (ip-clearance pending).
 - Released 17 components (including the framework).
 - A new PMC chair was accepted by the board last month (Karl Pauls).
   
## Health report: 

 - Overall the project is in good health (but not growing atm). 
 - Questions on the user list are answered, development concerns are 
   either discussed on the mailing list or directly in the JIRA issues.
 - The project as well as the OSGi community in general is still in the 
   process of adapting to JPMS and its long term impact. 
 - We need to focus on adding a new pmc member and attracting new 
   committers (hopefully the required work on OSGi R7 will attract some).
   However, we had no issues voting on 17 releases and JIRA issues are
   generally addressed promptly.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Tom Chiverton]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
Apache Flex SDK Installer 3.3 was released on 2017-11-16 This update provides
a fix for an out of memory exception when user downloads the Apache Flex SDK
with Adobe AIR versions greater than 23 on the Windows platform.

Apache Flex SDK 4.16.1 was released on 2017-11-22 The Apache Flex SDK 4.16.1
is an update to Apache Flex SDK 4.16.0 that adds support for the latest Flash
Player and AIR runtimes and some bug fixes. For more details, see the release
notes at: http://www.apache.org/dist/flex/4.16.1/RELEASE_NOTES

Older Releases:
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.3 was released on 3/31/17.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14

ACTIVITY
Apache FlexJS was renamed to Royale and established as its own top level
project at Apache. Since the Royale project was created, the dev community
seems to be less active. The users list is still seeing questions quite often.

The board approved a change of Flex PMC chair from Alex Harui to Tom Chiverton

COMMUNITY
Apache Flex investigates use of it's Wiki to draft Board reports. This should
make the process easier and more co-operative for the community.

The last committer was elected on 9/5/16.

The last PMC member was elected on 8/28/17.

We lost Christophe Herreman and Scott Delamater from the PMC. Both felt that
they were inactive, and in at least one case no longer actively using Apache
Flex. 

TRADEMARKS
A company is promoting a software product called Flex that
appears to be related to themes/styles for website visuals. Despite several
attempts to contact them, they have not responded. The ASF VP Trademarks sent
them an email on 11/3/16.  There has not been any more signs of confusion from
the community.  Maybe we should just not pursue it any more?

SECURITY
Nothing to report.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The Flink community just released the 1.4 release and is
    now working towards the 1.5 release. The relationship between
    the releases and a list of major features has been has been
    discussed and is shared on the Apache Flink blog:
    http://flink.apache.org/news/2017/11/22/release-1.4-and-1.5-timeline.html

  - The call for papers for the Flink Forward conference is open.
    The program committee consists of stream processing experts from
    both the Flink community and other communities.

  - Flink had a pretty good conference presence in the previous
    quarter, for example at multiple Stratas, Hadoop/Dataworks Summit,
    MesosCon, QCon, Scale-by-the-Bay, and Flink Forward Berlin.

  - We reached out to Huawei to update the use of "Flink" on their stream
    product website to "Apache Flink". The original Chinese webpage was fixed,
    but has been taken down and replaced by other web pages, including an
    English one that uses the original text saying "Flink", not "Apache Flink".
    We are in touch.


COMMUNITY

No new PMC members were added since the last report.
The newest PMC member is Chesnay Schepler, joined on July 26th, 2017

Committers added since the last board report:
  - Haohui Mai was added as a committer on November 1st, 2017

Flink currently has 34 committers and 19 PMC members.


RELEASES

The following releases were made since the last board report:

 - 1.4.0 was released on December 12th, 2017 
 - shaded-2.0 was released on October 30th, 2017 

 
ACTIVITY ON JIRA / MAILING LISTS

Both user@f.a.o and dev@f.a.o lists are very active,
(1818 resp. 977 mails per quarter), with mails getting
answered by a mix of committers and non-committers.

JIRA continues to be very active, with 636 JIRA tickets created
and 607 JIRA tickets resolved over last 3 months.

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Guacamole Project  [Mike Jumper]

## Description:
 - Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway which supports
   standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH. We call it "clientless" because
   no plugins or client software are required. Once Guacamole is installed on
   a server, all you need to access your desktops is a web browser.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Now that the graduation process has completed, the project is refocused on
   completing the 0.9.14 release.
 - Most recent development work has been around adding support for TOTP, SQL
   Server, and other authentication-related integrations/enhancements.
 - Additional translations and keymap contributions from the community.
 - Decent traffic spike due to Guacamole being posted to Hacker News again.

## Health report:
 - The project is recently graduated and healthy. Development is active and
   community involvement is strong.
 - There has been increasing community engagement in discussing issues on the
   mailing lists, and turning those discussions into contributions of code.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 9 PMC members.
 - Carl Harris was added to the PMC on Sun Nov 19 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 10 committers.
 - Carl Harris was added as a committer on Thu Nov 16 2017

## Releases:

 - Last release was 0.9.13-incubating on Sat Jul 29 2017

## Mailing list activity:

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

No changes compared to the last quarter, no real activity by the
community. After a hiccup in September 2017 the service seems to be
good again. We'll ask our users whether they still need Gump in the
next quarter.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

This has again been a very quiet quarter for Gump.

Around the time of the last report we realized the runs in vmgump had
stopped for several weeks without anybody taking notice. This somewhat
challenges the notion that "Gump seems to remain useful for the
projects using it" usually stated here. By now the runs have been
stable again and are watched more closely.

In 2013 we asked the projects Gump was building back then whether they
still want to use the service. Stefan intends to do so once again
during the next quarter.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Hama Project  [Edward J. Yoon]

## Description:
 - Apache Hama is a framework for Big Data analytics based on the Bulk
   Synchronous Parallel paradigm

## Issues:
 - the PMC didn't manage to report in the last 3 board calls for reports.

## Activity:
 - the activity in the project is low. However new contributors have showed up
   in the mailing list and started creting Jira issues.

## Health report:
 - the community is not doing very good. Most of the committers / PMC members
   do not seem to have enough cycles to contribute to the project. We have
   raised awareness about the chance for Apache Hama to go Attic, calling out
   for new contributors. We have seen some positive responses from potential
   new contributors. We also have voted (submitted for this next board
   meeting) for a new PMC chair.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 10 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Behroz Sikander on Mon Feb 01 2016

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Impala Project  [Jim Apple]

## Description:

Impala is a high-performance distributed SQL engine.

## Issues:

There are no special issues the board should be aware of.

## Activity:

Impala graduated from the incubator to a TLP on 15 November 2017. The
incubator report covering August, September, and October is available at
https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/November2017.

Notable efforts in November include Hadoop 3.0 compatibility work, TABLESAMPLE
work to compute statistics more quickly, test reliability, decimal arithmetic
type changes, client connectivity bug fixes, and changing the RPC mechanism
for data stream service.

## Health report:

The project is healthy. November had 90 commits, the same as October. The dev
list had 139 emails, compared to 175 in the previous 30 days. The user list
had 31 emails, compared to 17 in the previous 30 days. 109 tickets were
resolved, compared to 101 in October. 122 tickets were created, compared to
130 in October.

Several new contributors have been active.

## PMC and committer changes:

The most recent new PMC member was added on 2017-09-27. Two new committers
were added on 2017-09-29.

## Releases:

The last release was 2017-09-14. Discussions for the next release are in
progress. Discussions of a major (compatibility-breaking) release have
occurred, but there does not appear to be much enthusiasm to do such a release
right now. Some compat-breaking changes, like DECIMAL_V2, are available
already behind feature flags.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [John D. Ament]

Incubator PMC report for December 2017

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are currently 53 podlings incubating.  In the month of November, we executed six releases, added one IPMC member and received the resignation of another (which is in flight until their sole podling retires).  We added two podlings to our roster, have a few more in the pipeline and have one podling planning to graduate this month.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Michael Semb Wever

  People who left the IPMC:

  - Upayavira (not processed in LDAP yet)

* New Podlings

  - Crail
  - Service Comb

* Podlings that failed to report, expected next month

  - Amaterasu - Activity stopped late November
  - HTrace - 0 on list activity
  - Pony Mail - Low activity, suspect just missed
  - Wave - Retiring
  - Myriad - Received report, no mentor sign off
  - Spot - Received report, no mentor sign off

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - Trafodion

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  November:

  - 2017-11-01 Apache Freemarker      2.3.27
  - 2017-11-08 Apache Netbeans HTML4J 1.5

AriaTosca

ARIA TOSCA project offers an easily consumable Software Development Kit(SDK)
and a Command Line Interface(CLI) to implement TOSCA(Topology and
Orchestration Specification of Cloud Applications) based solutions.

AriaTosca has been incubating since 2016-08-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community and enroll new committers.
  2. Have frequent Release cycles to be compliant with the Apache Way.
  3. Grow the project’s contributions from existing contributors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The project is ready for its third release as far as the code is concerned.  Considerable functionality has been added since the last release in addition to a growth in diversity of contributions.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * All project communication takes now place on either the mailing list or ASF's Slack, and is open for everybody.  We have worked hard to make this the normal operating mode of the community. There have been some hiccups, but in general the majority of discourse has taken place on the list.  Slack has been used as a secondary method.
  * Increased chatter on the mailing list including new subscribers who ask questions, make suggestions and are likely to become contributors themselves in the near future.
  * Weekly grooming meetings are now attended by the majority of the community. This is not only a forum to review the weekly work items list, but also as a place for open discussion about issues, questions as well as for the community to get to better know each other.
  * Over the last 3 months we have seen an over %50 increase in contributors and the existing group of committers voted to elect a new Committer to the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - ARIA now has a robust parser testing framework (ARIA-1)
  - Huge performance improvement (ARIA-1)
  - Significant website and documentation improvements for usability and to enhance new user Usability in terms of “getting started” instructions
  - Clearwater IMS Example
  - Package names fixed/made consistent
  - Configuration loading mechanism
  - Removed support for Python 2.6
  - 42 JIRA issues have been resolved since the last report
  - Moved project to gitbox

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

     Comments:  Activity on list is picking up over the slack conversations.  A community member is planning to write a report, however it indicates a corporate hierarchy issue within the project that needs to get solved.  In addition, the podling needs to figure out how to operate more on list (without grooming meetings) and do things more asynchronously.

Crail

Crail is a storage platform for sharing performance critical
data in distributed data processing jobs at very high speed.

Crail has been incubating since 2017-11-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finish project setup

Daffodil

Apache Daffodil is an implementation of the Data Format Description
Language (DFDL) used to convert between fixed format data and XML/JSON.

Daffodil has been incubating since 2017-08-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Obtain remaining SGA from NCSA
  2. First release as an Apache Incubator
  3. Broadening base of contributors and building the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

- None

How has the community developed since the last report?

- No additional committers or community growth, however activity on the
  dev@daffodil list has increased, with multiple design discussions,
  code reviews, and project discussions taking place.

How has the project developed since the last report?

- All tickets from the old JIRA system were successfully transferred to
  ASF JIRA
- IBM has submitted their SGA. We are now only waiting on an SGA from
  NCSA, who we believe is very close to submission. Once that is in, we
  believe all necessary SGA's and CLA's will have been submitted and we
  can begin the process of relicensing the Daffodil codebase to Apache
  v2 and switching the package namespace to org.apache.daffodil
- Development pace has increased, with multiple issues, commits, and
  pull requests having gone through the new Daffodil Code Contributor
  Workflow
- Continuous integration has been enabled via TravisCI GitHub
  Integration
- Migrated repository to GitBox
- A website has been developed based on the Apache Incubator Website
  template. Still need to enable automatic building/publishing--
  manually publishing for now.

OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able to execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) from external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional logic (Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST API-based Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support packaging and catalog services.  Additionally, it now provides options to host the platform components as Docker containers on various Container Frameworks such as Mesos, Kunernetes, and Compose.


OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

   Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

    1. Est. release process for ZIP of source code
    2. Increase additional company and individual Contributors to maintain all project repos.

   Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be  aware of?

    - It had been our intent to have Apache infra. to host our staging (and move it out of disparate private builds within various companies). However, INFRA indicates they only typically allocate 1 VM per project for use with demos and minor things.  They indicate that perhaps a corporate donation is in order (ala. Spark).
        - Goal: standup testing resources at Apache and utilize for public CI and performance testing of OpenWhisk on Kubernetes
        - Needed resources:
            Minimum 5 worker node kubernetes cluster.  Each worker nodes can be fairly modest (2-4 virtual cores; 4-8GB of memory)
    - Formal hand-off of OpenWhisk trademark/logo from IBM needs to be executed; need to identify process for this.
        Discussion started w/ Apache legal via "legal-discuss" mailing list with subject "Trademark handoff for "OpenWhisk" name and logo".

How has the community developed since the last report?

    - incubator-openwhisk Github stars: 2181 (+253 since last report)
    - incubator-openwhisk GitHub forks: 469 (+52 since last report)
    - dev mailing list activity continues to be active
    - The  bi-weekly Zoom "Technical Interchange" continues to be well received and attended.
      - Complete videos posted to OW YouTube channel and detailed notes to our CWIKI.

     trademarks and source code compliance are the
     primary issues right now. Once these are addressed
     SDAP can focus on the first Incubating release.

aware of?

  Community slow. Considering retiring, but will try one last push.


How has the community developed since the last report?

  Quite a few pull requests, but need follow ups.
  Non-PPMC committers have taken more charge in release preparation.


Email stats since 2017-09-01:

In Dec 2016, the report said "Preparing to graduate." In 2017, the dev@ list has been quiet and the last release was in 2016.

While the PPMC is large, not everyone has been active in incubation.  I am worried that pushing through graduation will only result in the same situation as a TLP.

The community needs to consider what is the best environment for Taverna.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

Report from the Apache Jackrabbit committee [Michael Dürig]

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained. 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding  
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
      
## Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

We are running up to our 4th major release of Oak (1.8). Branching
is expected to happen early January. 

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Oak. 

## Health report: 
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
lists as well as on the various JIRA issues. 

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues and the desire of the individual contributors to bring
the features in for Oak 1.8.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

## Description:
 Apache Kibble is a suite of tools for collecting, aggregating and
 visualizing activity in software projects.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 There are many voices on the dev list. In particular, we're seeing
 people from other projects who are interested in being part of our
 effort to spin up a demo instance of Kibble with live projects
 participating. We've reached out to all ASF projects, and have heard
 back from many of them. You can see these projects, and their
 metrics, at https://demo.kibble.apache.org/

## Health report:

 The project has sufficient (3+ PMC members) oversight.

 We're particularly excited about this participation from a wide
 cross-section of ASF projects, as we believe that it will result in
 steering our feature set towards functionality that is useful to
 actual projects, rather than us trying to figure that out in a
 vacuum, or based on our own academic interests. We also believe that
 this will, eventually, grow our user and developer communities as
 projects observe the benefits of the functionality we provide.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - We voted Rafael Weingärtner in to our PMC on December 6th, 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 11 committers.
 - No new committers since graduation (October, 2017)

## Releases:

 - No releases yet. We tentatively plan to have our first release within
   the next six months.

## Mailing list and bug tracker activity:

  As mentioned above, mailing list activity is encouraging for this
  point in our project's development. We are very encouraged by the
  level of conversation, and by projects jumping into our demo
  instance.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Adrien Grand]

## Description:
- Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
- Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Issues:
- There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - The 7.x branch is very active and receives many bug fixes and incremental
   improvements like finer-grained control of flushing (Lucene) or more stream
   evaluators (Solr).
 - The master branch (future 8.0) is starting to diverge from 7.x in order to
   support efficient dynamic pruning of top hits.
 - Both user and dev mailing-lists are very active.
 - Discussions are generally flowing in a good shape.
 - We produced 4 releases since the last report, including some
   security-focused releases (see below).
 - A 0-day exploit was reported on a public mailing-list on October 12th[1].
   We provided the community with mitigation steps[2], folded a fix into 7.1.0
   which was in the process of being released and did two additional
   security-focused releases: 5.5.5 and 6.6.2.
 - A new conference called "Haystack", focused on search relevance, was
   announced[3] and will take place in April 2018. Its description mentions
   Solr and Elasticsearch, another Lucene-based search engine.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and
targeted at .NET runtime users.

The PMC chairman has indicated he'd like to step down but the PMC hasn't come
up with a successor so far. Please allow us to get our act together and report
in January.

Lucene.Net is actively developed with one committer (Shad Storhaug) carrying
almost all of the load. We released 4.8.0 beta 5 on October 23, 2017 which has
been downloaded more than 1000 times from nuget. We see an average of more
than 800 downloads a day for all versions combined. So the library is used a
lot but unfortunately we haven't been able to attract new contributors.

The last committer we added was Shad Storhaug who is also the latest PMC
member elected in May 2017.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Mnemonic Project  [Gang Wang]

Description:
   Apache Mnemonic is an open-source Java library for durable object-oriented
   programming on hybrid storage-class memory(e.g. NVM) space. it comes up 
   with durable object model (DOM) and durable computing model(DCM) and 
   takes full advantages of storage-class memory to simplify the code 
   complexity, avoid SerDe/(Un)Marshal, mitigate caching for constructing 
   next generation computing platform. Mnemonic makes the storing and 
   transmitting of massive linked objects graphs simpler and more efficient.
   The performance tuning could also be mostly converged to a single point
   of tuning place if based on Mnemonic to process and analyze 
   linked objects. The programmer are able to focus on durable object 
   oriented business logics instead of worrying about how to normalize/join, 
   serDe(un)marshal, cache and storing their linked business objects
   with arbitrary complexity. 

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    Our project are just graduated from incubator so somethings are new to 
    us. we have a release since last report and one of our PMC found that 
    there are some issues caused by Java 9 compiling. we are going to get 
    insight into this problem and resolve it as soon as possible after fully 
    converted from incubating status. the major works that have been done 
    since last month are related to updating incubator associated 
    configuration, code and webpages. lastly, the adoption of storage-class 
    memory is not very straightforward and easy to integrated with existing 
    application and frameworks so we are trying to organize some other 
    Apache projects to form a joint working group for driving this technology
    are able to be integrated smoothly.

    The following people represented their project have got interested to 
    join this workgroup/program.
    
    Ignite represented by Denis Magda
    Arrow represented by Wes McKinney
    Hbase represented by Anoop John
    Crail represented by Patrick Stuedi
    Hive/LLAP represented by Gopal Vijayaraghavan
    ORC represented by Owen O'Malley
    RocketMQ  represented by Von Gosling
    ActiveMQ represented by Clebert Suconic
    Geode represented by Swapnil Bawaskar, Nilkanth Patel
    
    the advanced storage-class memory technology will fundamentally change 
    the way to construct high performance applications similar to what 
    happened when replacing tape with disk technology since the 1980s. so we 
    advocate establishing an Apache working group to enhance the 
    collaboration and synergies for storage-class memory technology-oriented 
    projects.

    To support this workgroup/program, we request to have a dedicate 
    mailing list, better if possible to be integrated with Slack.

Health Report:
    Basically unchanged since the last report.  Users are generally quiet
    in public and no new users are appearing, but development continues.

PMC Changes:

## Description: 
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specifications which are defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0), JSR-346
 (CDI-1.1 and CDI-1.2 MR) and JSR-365 (CDI-2.0).

 The OWB community also maintains  a small server as
 Apache Meecrowave subproject. Meecrowave consists of the ASF
 projects Tocmat9 + OpenWebBeans + CXF + Johnzon + log4j2.
   
## Issues:

## Health report: 
 Sadly we still found no cows to take over the project. So 
 we are doomed to run it ourselves yet - which thankfully
 is still lots of fun ;)
 Requests and community feedback for Meecrowave did increase.

Description:
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
   features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
   Java platform.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
    The small flurry of activity from the 2.0.5 maintenance release has
    quieted, but there has been a steady stream of commits to the trunk
    in preparation for a 2.1 release, possibly in the first part of 2018.
    The question of discontinuing applet support has been tabled for now.
    User mailing list activity has been non-existent, but hopefully will
    pick up some with the discussions around the 2.1 release.  Sufficient
    PMC representation still remains. Starting to build with Java 9 with
    no problems found.

Description: Apache Polygene is a community based effort exploring Composite
Oriented Programming for domain centric application development.

Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at the moment.

Activity: After the Release in July, we have been quite slow to regain the
momentum, possibly due to using the release in outside activities. But, new
features has been added and waiting for a new Release, hopefully in the next
quarter.

New logo has been designed (to tie into the new name, and cut the heritage
with the original name), but not yet deployed to the website. Additionally,
work is in-progress to upgrade the website to a more modern L&F. Hopefully
deploying that after the holidays.

Health report: Project is progressing in slow but steady pace. Some personal
issue has brought it down a bit more than ideal, but hoping that will return
back to normal soon.

Project continues to have problems to attract new blood.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

## Description:
 - The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
   software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
   to underlying platform-specific implementations.  There are three
   sub-projects: APR, APR-UTIL and APR-ICONV, of which the first two
   are the main focus of developer interest.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - This is a stable project, and new development activity is low.
 - Total activity has been at an intermediate level, including
   feedback from the initial 1.6 release in June, and a minor
   vulnerability report and fix in each of APR and APR-UTIL.
   A new set of releases on October 22nd fixed the vulnerabilities
   along with some build issues arising from the unbundling of
   the third-party "expat" library, and in the case of APR-ICONV
   to build with modern toolchains on the Windows platform.

## Health report:
 - The project remains reasonably healthy, with a number of
   developers active on-list and responsive to reports and questions.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Portals Project  [David Sean Taylor]

## Description:

Apache Portals exists to promote the use of open source portal technology. We
intend to build freely available and interoperable portal software in order to
promote the use of this technology. With the Pluto project, we provide a
reference implementation for the Java portlet standard. The Jetspeed project
is a full feature enterprise open source portal. The Portals Applications
project is dedicated to providing robust, full-featured, commercial-quality,
and freely available portlet applications.

## Activity:

Apache Portals released 0 releases since the last report.

Developers are continuing refinement and testing with the Portlet 3.0 TCK as
we implement Portlet 3.0 support for our portal products. We have challenged
the validity of some TCK tests and also fixed some TCK bugs. But since the TCK
is not a releasable artifact, we don't have any plans to release it in the
future.

Several JIRA issues were closed and bugs fixed. New features added to Jetspeed
trunk including a configurable Portlet Factory to support IOC creation of
portlets.

No additional members since last report

12 Feb 2017 - Two new PMC members added 27 April 2017 - Apache Portals Pluto
team released Pluto Maven Archetypes 3.0 to support to developing new portlets
to the new 3.0 spec

## Mailing list activity:

Not much activity. Some discussions around TCK implementation on the Pluto
list. Low volume activity on the Jetspeed lists.

## Issues:

We have no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache River Project  [Peter Firmstone]

## Description:

 - Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup search of
   network services.  Services may be implemented in a number of languages,
   while clients are required to be jvm based, to allow proxy jvm byte code to
   be provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:

 No significant issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 Minimal activity at present.

- Planned relase map:

Release roadmap:
>
>  River 3.0.1 - thread leak fix
>  River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&  binary release)
>  River 3.2 - Input validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling&  safe
   ServiceRegistrar  lookup service.
>  River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - Minimal activity at present on dev.
 - No recent commit activity, but there are plans for more work in near
   future.

 - Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required
     prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and Gadget
     attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only support IPv4
     multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so authentication can
     occur prior to downloading service proxy's, this addresses a long
     standing security issue with service lookup while significantly improving
     performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal of
     support for insecure cyphers.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses classdepandjar, a
     bytecode dependency analysis build tool.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Harbs]

## DESCRIPTION
Apache Royale is a new implementation of the principles of Apache Flex but
designed for JavaScript runtimes instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes.  Apache
Royale is designed to improve developer productivity in creating applications
for wherever Javascript runs, including browsers as well as Apache Cordova
applications, Node, etc.

Apache Royale was approved as a new TLP in the September meeting.  Royale took
over responsibility for the code related to what was known as Apache FlexJS
from the Apache Flex community. This is our second report.

## ISSUES
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## RELEASES
- Apache FlexJS 0.8.0 was released on 6/25/17.

## ACTIVITY
- The effort to set up new builds and rename code assets from FlexJS to Royale
  was/is significant and that effort is more-or-less complete. There might be
  a few loose ends that still need to be tied up.
- Related to the above, Flash should no longer be a requirement to build
  Royale.
- Some new names have appeared on the mailing lists investigating whether
  Royale is a suitable solution for migrating existing Flex applications off
  of Flash.
- One PMC member has proposed an initial web site for Royale.  There were some
  logistical issues in being allowed to use it as he created it on WordPress
  with a commercial theme.  Those issues are mostly resolved at this time. The
  web site work has stalled a bit the last few weeks. We need to renew
  momentum on finishing the website work.
- Some work is being done on a new default look-and-feel for Royale.
- There has been some progress and discussion on improving the testing
  architecture to make it easier to improve the automated test coverage.
- Discussion has started on the release process for the first Royale release.

## COMMUNITY
The community is still working through the transition from Apache Flex to
Apache Royale.  There is much documentation remaining to be transitioned from
the Apache Flex wiki to some place in Apache Royale.

Currently, users@royale has 39 subscribers (up from 38) and dev@royale has 52
(up from 47) subscribers.  We are not sure why more folks from the Flex
 mailing lists haven't subscribed to Royale, but it's likely that once we get
 our website and documentation moved over we will ask again on the Flex lists
 to see if folks want to come over.

We have not added any new committers or PMC members yet.

There is talk of possibly having a small hackathon in January.

## TRADEMARKS
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

## Description

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Issues

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

## Activity

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

- As we have transited the older ServiceMix branches to EOL, we can focus on
further development of ServiceMix 7 and development of new features.
- We have released 3 sets of OSGi bundles
- In the next period we are going to focus on documentation and examples
improvement as it's still outstanding theme.


## Health report

- Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA is on the same level like in the last
period. We have lost a lot of our momentum now that major parts of the functionality
are being maintained in related projects like Apache Karaf and Apache Camel.
- We have some new feature proposals.

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- Last release was 1.4.0 on 05-May-2017

Community & Project:

- Mailing list traffic has dipped a little, Stack Overflow has been becoming
  the preferred place to ask questions.

- There has been some community interest in translating the Shiro site into
  Chinese. (This also lines up with a perceived increased number of
  questions/forum posts seen from Chinese speaking users)

- Feature development is planned to continue against master.

- The 1.4.0 Release has been a step toward modernizing Shiro as well as retain
  backwards compatibility

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for December 2017

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

This has been a good quarter for the project.

We added one new committer and had one committer join the PMC.

There are new contributors in bugzilla, both with patches and bug grooming.
Our sysadmin team, especially davej and merijnvdk, completed the rebuild of
the mass check / rule update system.

We have a new PC online.

Work on our new release had been shelved until we completed infrastructure
work on mass check. During this time we did make progress updating the release
process, which had not worked on a modern distro, and rolled out a few
pre-release packages.

Work on the release has resumed, with hope expressed for a January release,
though a firm date has not yet been set.

The users, dev, and sysadmins mailing lists have been active and healthy.

Issues:

Mass check and rule update issues appear to have been resolved. We are
resuming work towards our next release.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.1 on 30 April 2015.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Work on a new 3.4.2 release has been resumed, with an as yet tentative goal of
releasing some time in January.

This should be the last release of the 3.4 branch before moving on with work
towards 4.0.

Committer/PMC changes:

One new committer this quarter:

Merijn van den Kroonenberg (merijnvdk) 28 November 2017

One new PMC member this quarter:

Dave Jones (davej) 28 November 2017

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

The project is in a kind of sleep mode. People are involved in other activities
and do not find that much time for Stanbol at the moment even though community
members reported to use Stanbol on a regular basis.

The board checked that at least three PMC members are still active and
available. That is still the case so there is no urgent action required by the
board.

Since the last commit was pushed in March there is no work happening towards
a 1.0.1 release.

Subscribers on the dev list: 219

Last new committer was
  Cristian Petroaca on May 7th, 2015

Last new PMC member were

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description:
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:
 - The community continues to march toward a 2.0 release. The current plan is
   to do a 1.2.0 release of the clojure codebase closely followed by a 2.0

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BU: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Issues:

The previous report noted the disagreement between committers on a
thread "Suffocating development environment" [1] which involved one
person reverting another person's commits three times in a row in the
span of 50 minutes.  Person insults and antagonism ensued on both
sides in that time.  The community had several open discussions and
the overall situation turned into a positive catalyst.  Switching to a
RTC workflow was discussed for several weeks, but ultimately the CTR
flow has remained. It is encouraging to see more discussion taking
place on the dev@ list about recent commits and proposed patches. We
are continuing to monitor this.

## Health report:

Since the incident on June 27th and subsequent open community
discussion, it appears "the fog has cleared" and we have seen a shift
in the project.  We have seen three measurable changes.

1. Commit diversity improved greatly.  Here are the stats from master
as reported by Github.  Names left off to protect the innocent.  Each
line represents a contributor.

  January 1st to June 27th

  - 127 commits  7,716 ++  2,519 --
  - 7 commits  438 ++  376 --
  - 5 commits  92 ++  62 --
  - 1 commit  42 ++  9 --
  - 1 commit  23 ++  14 --
  - 1 commit  8 ++  5 --
  - 1 commit  1 ++  1 --
  - 1 commit  110 ++  3 --

  June 28th to Dec 14th

  - 29 commits  2,148 ++  940 --
  - 26 commits  27,065 ++  252 --
  - 22 commits  698 ++  487 --
  - 17 commits  804 ++  182 --
  - 12 commits  257 ++  24 --
  - 10 commits  93 ++  38 --
  - 4 commits  70 ++  21 --

2. New committers.  After diversity increased, new committer votes
shortly followed.  Two new committers have been voted in in the last
quarter.  More have been discussed.

We continue to try to be more welcoming and nurturing to new
contributors.  Potential new contributor Matthew Broadhead has stepped
in to try and help provide some patches around JSTL, and we are keen
to help him with his contribution.

3. Code donation.  Discussion and subsequent vote has taken place to
donate two subprojects to TomEE.  Both are Java EE Connectors, one
adds an SSH shell for logging into the java process and executing
commands, the other provides means to integrate with external systems
like Gmail, Slack and Twitter.

## Activity:

Mark Struberg has started a TomEE 8 branch to support Java EE 8, and
progress is being made with this.

Master and 1.7.x continue to see maintenance patches, with some key
fixes coming in around connector support and application resource
classloading.  Project dependencies continue to be upgraded to ensure
TomEE has the latest fixes in libraries it uses.

Attachment BY: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Sagara Gunathunga]

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to
SOAP/XML based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations.
Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within
Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite
mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed,
and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure
the project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since
SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of the art,
we don’t expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new
committers, etc...

The current PMC chair (Sagara Gunathunga) has stated he no longer
has enough time to devote to the position.   The community has
voted to submit a resolution to change the chair to Daniel Kulp.
We did get 6 binding +1 votes on the vote so we DO know there
are at least 6 PMC members paying attention.

There was a brief discussion about possibly moving
Neethi/XmlSchema/WSS4J into CXF and Woden into Axis, but at this
point there are enough PMC members around that we didn't feel this
was warrented.

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)
Note: there was a problem getting Alessio onto the private@ list
as there were no active moderators.  dkulp was added as a moderator
last month after this was discovered.

Releases this period:

WSS4J - implementation of WS-Security and related technologies
* 2.1.11 - Sept, 2017
* 2.2.0 - Sept, 2017


Last releases for other technologies:
*  Axiom  1.2.20 : Oct 2016 (StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model)
*  Woden 1.0M10 : Sept 2015  (WSDL 2.0 implementation)
*  Neethi 3.1.0 - May 2017 (WS-Policy framework)
*  XmlSchema 2.2.2 - May, 2017 (XML Schema framework)

Attachment CA: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release that integrates
Xerces-C.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Most activity has been through JIRA issue tracking. The email lists
have seen little activity.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and release
processes for software projects.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

No new PMC members added in the last three months; our Last PMC addition was

Suraj Acharya was added as a committer in this quarter on Tue Nov 07 2017. 
There are currently 11 committers.

Was it a trick or was it a treat?  The day before Halloween, the community
dropped 0.5.1 and instead released 0.6.0!  This release cleaned up the rough
edges around 0.5.0, added support for the Apache Ratis project, and bug fixes.

There is some ramp up on releasing 0.7.0.  This release will mostly feature

Attachment CC: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Paiva Junqueira]

## Description: 

Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It enables
the implementation of a variety of primitives and mechanisms that are
critical for safety and liveness in distributed settings, e.g., 
distributed locks, master election, group membership, and configuration.

## Issues: 

No issue requiring board attention.

   
## Activity: 

Key points:
- There has been no addition to the set of committers or PMC;
- The traffic of mailing lists has dropped both on
user and dev;
- There has been fewer jiras created and resolved compared to
the previous period;
- We moved from CMS to gitpubsub for our website. This required
code and process changes within the community;
- We are moving our documentation to use markdown instead of xml;
- We sent to Mitre the details of the vulnerability report
with identifier CVE-2017-5637 as requested. This security
issue has been considered moderate, and we have fixed the issue
in release 3.4.10;
- We have released a new bug fix version of the 3.4 branch;
- We continue to work towards making the 3.5 branch GA. It
is still beta due to the introduction of the reconfiguration
feature in that branch. We are currently working towards
producing a 3.5 release candidate.


## Health report: 

The PMC has been working with contributors and committers to
get them to the point that both committership and PMC membership,
respectively, can be offered.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 13 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Michael Han on Wed Jun 21 2017 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 21 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Mohammad Arshad at Mon Jan 23 2017 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - 3.4.11 was released on Wed Nov 08 2017 
   
## Mailing list activity: 

Traffic on dev and user have dropped by 18% and 15%, respectively,
compared to the previous period. The number of subscribers, however,
has slightly increased. We attribute the drop on mailing list traffic
to some key contributors being busy with work outside the scope of
the community.
