 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       We had a productive face to face meeting in McLean last week, covering
       topics about the next 5 years of the Foundation, how we might best
       support the growth of healthy project communities and our own
       membership in line with the mission of the Foundation, and some key
       operational considerations.

       I will work with Craig over the next week to publish the formal
       minutes and a summary of the work done, as well as starting to track
       the action items that resulted from the meeting.

       I'd like to thank the board, officers and members who took the time
       out of their schedules to attend, including the support many received
       from their employers.

       In particular, our thanks to Capital One for hosting us at their
       McLean facilities and for sponsoring our pre-meeting dinner.

       Thank you to Craig also for driving the changes in the board list
       discussed at the previous meeting. I hope these will serve to allow
       more focused discussion on board-level items among the board, officers
       and interested members.

       I have indicated to the board that I intend to step down from the role
       as Chairman, and at the face to face we discussed a succession plan. I
       will transition the role over the following months. It has been fun,
       and I'm privileged to have had the opportunity over the last 4 years.

    B. President [Sam]

       My current priorities: Fundraising, EA/TAC, then Brand Management.

       Items requiring board attention:

         None.

       - - -

       Financially, we started off the FY strong.  I caution everybody that
       much of this is due to revenue that we should have received last year
       hitting the books this year.  And we have a one time revenue windfall
       due to converting bitcoins to cash.  That being said, all things
       considered, in one month we made up for the larger than expected full
       year deficit in FY17 and then some by over $20K.

       The Fundraising president's committee has updated its roster and divided
       up the list of sponsors and is making great progress in re-establishing
       connections.  In particular, Sally has stepped up and is leading this
       charge.

       Virtual's role in fundraising has been expanded, and the additional
       expense should be containable in the current budget.

       Fundraising has a new nofollow policy, rewarding Bronze level sponsors 
       who have a sustained committment.

       An audit of ASF sites shows that many foundation requirements for links
       to such things as sponsorship and conferences are being ignored.  Each of
       the operations areas are going to work together to determine a way to
       resolve this in a centralzed way.  See https://whimsy.apache.org/site/.

       Brand Management continues normally, including working through legal
       issues related to registrations for two projects.

       EA's focus has remained primarily on conferences.  In the upcoming
       months, I plan to get with Rich, Melissa, and others to revisit this.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Summary from Virtual:

       Here is a brief summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first
       month of FY18.  

       Cash at May 31st 2017 was $1,639.9K, which is up $124.6K from last
       month’s ending balance (Apr 17) of $1,515.3K, due to the timing of
       some Sponsor payments.   The May 2017 cash balance is down $134.8K
       from the May 2016 month end balance of $1,774.7K, however AR is up
       $100K from May of 2016.  The May 2017 ending cash balance of $1,639.9K
       represents a cash reserve of 14.2 months at the end of May 2017 based
       on the FY18 Cash forecast average monthly spending of $115.2K/month.
       The ASF reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of
       ASF’s size, with an FY18 YE estimate of 12 months cash reserve. 

       Regarding the Cash P&L, for May 2017, we are starting out very well
       right out of the gate due to some timing issues.  Revenue was $241.8K
       vs a budget of $116.6K.  This was due to the Platinum Sponsor payment
       for Pivotal Labs which had been forecasted to arrive in April but
       actually hit the bank in May as well as $21.5K of Coinbase ( Kevin did
       a fantastic job cashing out the bitcoin donation) and $2.7K from
       Hopsie.  This left us $125.2K ahead of bud through May 2017.  The
       open AR at this point is over $406K, again $100K more than last year
       at this time and with the increased Sponsorship effort and follow
       through we are well on our way to making our numbers for FY18.  In
       addition to this I would also like to point out that year over year
       for May we were $163K ahead in revenue, while only $16K ahead in
       expense for a NI for May 2017 that $147K better than May of 2016 again
       a very good way to start off FY 18.

       In May 2017 expenses were in total under Budget by $5.6K.  There were
       a few variances, which I will circle back with the respective budget
       stake holders to make sure it was just timing and will factor that
       into an updated forecast, which will include an updated revenue
       forecast based on the updated fundraising efforts over the past couple
       of weeks. 

       With regard to Net Income (NI), for May 2017 the ASF finished with a
       positive $124.7K NI vs a budgeted negative $6.2K NI or $130.9K ahead
       of Budget for the first month of FY18, as compared to the Negative
       $131K NI for April 2017 again starting off FY18 on a great note.



       Report from Assistant Treasurer:
        
       Bitcoins - We received and have effectively cashed in on all the
       bitcoins Donated to-date excepting 0.02965575 BTC which I transfered
       to Coinbase on 6/16 to zero out our multibit wallet.
        
       Corporate Service Company - Service and Annual Report - Virtual will
       be looking to switch/handle the annual report.  We are currently
       paying just under $700 annually to CSC which is exorbitant in
       comparison to the work required.
        
       Thanks to Roy Fielding, the Safety Deposit box was closed and old
       checks shredded.
        
       Executed contract addendum for a $250/mo increase in fees with
       Virtual.  This was already known and encompassed in the budget.
        
       We are discussing an Audit and vendors to perform the work with
       Virtual.  The ASF has never undergone an audit which is helpful for
       Guidestar and similar fundraising requirements.  We have had a
       successful financial review.
        
       Items Still Tracking:
       - Contribution Language for Car Donations
       - Payment Privacy changes to move away from Dropbox, etc.
       - CDARS - Virtual is working towards a method to FDIC insure our
       entire balance and is researching CDARS
       - Network for Good - Missing a $125 check
       - Credit Card with a lower foreign transaction fee still being
       researched
        
       Things should be slower for Treasurer role as I believe many of the
       tasks I’ve been working on for the past many months have been coming
       to completion.
        
       Other than that, Uli is quite busy with a new child (Congrats!) so if
       there are time-sensitive issues for the treasurer, please ping me.

    G. Motion for Licensing for a Closely Related Company

       NOTE: There is nothing in the ASF charter that prevents this concept from
       being done underneath our current 501(c)(3) umbrella; and

       Nothing that stops an external party from doing most everything here
       with the exception of using our brands and marks in compliance with
       our established policies.

       The mechanism of using a related company is chosen for political
       reasons, not technical or legal.  However, it should be noted that the
       motion has been discussed both from an internal execution and external
       licensing perspective for the purposes of documenting this information
       for the next 3-5 years.

        
       WHEREAS, the Apache Software Foundation wishes to ensure the longevity
       and success of the foundation; and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors agrees that the licensing assets of
       the organization can provide a useful and beneficial source of
       subsistence; and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors agrees that the foundation exists to
       provide free, open-source software for the public good; and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors agrees that foundation is a
       volunteer-driven charity that provides products as-is, without
       warranty or guarantee of fitness for use; and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors agrees that the foundation does not
       wish to obligate itself to provide additional, related services and
       products; and
        
       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors wishes to facilitate the provision of
       these related services and products; and
        
       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors recognizes the value of these related
       services and products but does not wish to assume the costs and legal
       liability to do so; and

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors agrees that the foundation wishes to
       license certain assets specified herein to a corporation yet to be
       formed that but shall be referred to for the purposes of this motion
       as the APACHE MEDIA CORPORATION, or AMC.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Apache Software Foundation
       shall license the following:

       1) The perpetual license to create a derivative mark and corporate
       name based on the foundation name and logos.

       2) The exclusive outside vendor rights for 2 years beginning October
       1, 2017 to certify Apache products, vendors, training, exams,
       certifications and services in North America, Europe and Asia as well
       as to claim association and support.  Such rights shall specifically
       exclude electronic or physical books; and conferences attended by more
       than 75 persons.  However, this license shall not impede the
       foundation itself from performing any actions in any manner internally
       without the use of outside parties.
        
       3) The rights in paragraph 2 shall automatically renew under the same
       terms herein unless notification from either party is received thirty
       days prior to the renewal date.
        
       BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in return for these valuable licenses, the
       following conditions shall be met:

       1) A foundation member and
       executive officer shall found the AMC in his personal capacity; and

       2) The AMC shall donate 15% of all net income with a minimum floor of
       $10,000 USD per quarter beginning on October 1, 2017 with the first
       payment necessary to fully ratify this agreement; and

       3) The founding member shall personally guarantee the
       minimum floor payments up to $80,000 USD owed; and

       4) The AMC shall be vendor neutral using processes with equivalent
       terms for all applicants; and

       5) The President & Chair of the foundation shall automatically be two
       of the five initial AMC Board of Director members to ensure that it
       best exemplifies the Apache Way.  However, should the President and/or
       Chair decline the automatic membership, the foundation shall have the
       right to appoint their replacement(s); and

       6) The foundation shall have the right to appoint an additional board
       of director member for every three additional AMC board members added;
       and

       7) The foundation shall maintain the right to replace their
       representatives to the board at any time for any reason as they see
       fit; and

       8) The AMC is solely responsible to define, ensure and defend
       materials, products, services and vendors certifications are
       sufficient to the purpose and intent of the foundation and further
       remove all liability and responsibility from the foundation; and

       9) Oversight of AMC contracts and dealings shall be provided through
       the AMC board membership granted to the foundation which shall be
       expressly permitted for discussed on the board-private@apache.org
       mailing list; and
        
       10) The AMC shall enact a strict COID policy that is incumbent on
       employees, consultants, contractors and other parties alike to require
       full conflict of interest disclosures when involved with matters of
       the foundation.  Said disclosure shall specifically NOT require
       abstention or recusal as it is expected that people may serve roles on
       behalf of the AMC and the foundation; and
        
       11) The AMC is solely responsible for expenses incurred in the
       execution of this contract up to a maximum of $2,000 USD for the
       foundation’s legal review; and
        
       12) The AMC shall indemnify the foundation from any responsibility for
       damages or other liabilities arising from this agreement; and
        
       13) In recognizing the goal of Open Source Software and the Apache
       Way, materials that are generated and in use externally such as
       coursework, books, training videos and exams shall AT A MINIMUM be
       released as “open source” materials under the Apache Software License
       v2 or greater within a period not to exceed two years from the time of
       first external use; and
        
       14) The AMC will be solely responsible for all contractual obligations
       in these matters and shall not be licensed to obligate the foundation

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.


* OPERATIONS

Presented the popular Practical Trademark Law for FOSS Projects at ApacheCon
Miami which drew some great questions; similarly the curated Apache Way track
by a number of different speakers went amazingly well and got lots of
questions throughout the day.

http://shaneslides.com/2017/05/Practical-Trademark-Law/

Using automation from Whimsy, published a comprehensive list of both
registered and unregistered trademarks claimed by the ASF, including all
software releases that projects have created DOAP files from:

https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/list/

Implemented Analytics with a vp-brand@ account for the /foundation/marks/*
portion of the apache.org website, so we can better focus improvement efforts
on how users are actually reading the documentation.

Thanks to Mark Thomas for continuing to provide great answers to a variety of
questions and for doing an excellent job with all issues around the Tomcat
brand.


* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

Finalized registration paperwork relating to the incoming IMPALA and BROOKLYN
trademarks, both donated during incubation.

Continuing to work through legal issues related to registrations for two
projects.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Tobi.com did not renew as a bronze sponsor and has been removed from the
sponsorship thank you page upon expiration.
 
New Bronze Sponsors: HostPapa and Emirio have agreed to come on board.  
 
We are working on small but high fraud issues where the consensus is that bad
actors are using our site to pre-test stolen creditcards and the billing
address.
 
Using a new Sponsor Onboard Questionnaire:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/16CpuFD6aQNs41CXSGwKUOhQRSNkCgk4Fv-Uwa-QaXd
k/edit  Well liked by Virtual and it’s had minor revisions.  Will continue
refining and move towards likely something like an automa form.
 
I have implemented this as our Official Bronze NoFollow Policy: 
The thank you link for Bronze level sponsors will contain a “NoFollow” tag. 
However, to reward sponsors committed to the long-term success of the ASF and
free, open source software, we remove this attribute on links for repeat
Bronze sponsors or for sponsors who pay for a three year Bronze sponsorship in
advance.
 
With this new policy, I’ve shelved the Bronze+ concept as OBE (Overcome by
Events, no longer needed)
 
Ambassador program has been going well.  Thanks to Sally for leading the
charge.
 
Working to get foundational issues done like contracts, audits of sponsors,
etc.  Making headway.
 
Executed contract with Virtual to increase their assistance with sponsorship
at a cost increase of $750/mo as of May 1.  This was already planned and
encompassed in the budget.
 
Will be listing Hopsie and Atlassian as in-kind sponsors. 
 
ApacheCon NorthAmerica was advertised on ~15 project sites.  It was missing
from our own www.apache.org as well as people.a.o, reporter.a.o, whimsical.a.o
(not sure whimsy.a.o counts as it's more of an app) & reference.a.o
 
The whimsy team coded up a quick script to check
https://whimsy.apache.org/site/
 
Therefore, I request board approval to Update the Navigation links
http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs.html#navigation to make it a
requirement to include an Apache overlay div to avoid design or dependency
concerns on all ASF web properties include www.apache.rg that is centrally
located/updated
 
The update of this data will fall to VP Fundraising, VP Conferences & VP
Marketing jointly.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule with no vendor payments
due at this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: after a 7-year hiatus, Sally Khudairi has
officially returned to work with ASF Fundraising, and has relaunched
the ASF Sponsor outreach program with “ambassadorial” support from
Rich Bowen, Jim Jagielski, Tom Pappas, Mark Thomas, and Hadrian
Zbarcea. She published the seventh "Success at Apache" post
https://s.apache.org/x9Be , and has confirmed authors through October
2017. Sally held Media & Analyst Training at ApacheCon, and is working
on the the ASF Annual Report for FY2017, with the aim of publishing by
the end of June.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

 - 31 May 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® SystemML™ as
   a Top-Level Project
- 17 May 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Beam™
v2.0.0
- 15 May 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
Samza™ v0.13

IV. Informal Announcements: 6 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 152 weekly summaries published to date. We actively promoted
numerous ApacheCon presentations and activities during the event. We
secured professional post-production editing services for 111
ApacheCon presentations that were successfully published onto
Feathercast within 12 days of the conference close. We posted 16 items
on LinkedIn, which garnered more than 108K collective organic
impressions over the past month.

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 8 media queries, plus a handful
of press interviews during ApacheCon. During ApacheCon, the tone of
the State of the Feather presentation triggered some misunderstandings
that led to negative press coverage. We addressed the issue directly
during Media & Analyst Training and executed a comprehensive crisis
communications plan that included publishing On The State of the
Feather https://s.apache.org/Lz3t . Our efforts successfully blocked
further media coverage, and our internal speaking points were also
used by members of the greater Apache community to address various
queries. The statement also resulted in 5x more impressions than our
usual postings on LinkedIn. The ASF received 1,223 press clips vs.
last month's clip count of 1,053. Media coverage of Apache projects
yielded 3,144 press hits vs. last month's 4,560. Sally has worked with
a small handful of organizations (including some ASF Sponsors) on
correcting misleading information in press/marketing/social media
documents and promotions.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received no analyst queries during this
timeframe. Apache was mentioned in 27 reports by Gartner, 2 reports by
Forrester, 14 reports by 451 Research, and 10 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: the ASF Identity Style Guide
(graphics/visual/branding) has been uploaded to
http://apache.org/foundation/press/kit/ . Sally is also designing
templates for ASF business cards in response to requests by several
ASF representatives/spokespeople.

IX. ApacheCon liaison: Sally will continue to support ApacheCon as the
event evolves.

X. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: we had a presence
at OpenExpo in Madrid, with booth coverage by Sharan Foga, Jan
Iverson, and Ignasi Barrera, who will be following up with those who
attended the booth, as well as a potential ASF Sponsor. Ignasi also
worked with Sally on developing localized collateral for the event,
which can be utilized by the ASF Community Development (ComDev) team
for future events.

XI. Newswire accounts: we have 13 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017; any overflow needs
will link to our new contract signed that ends in December 2019.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infra continues to operate as expected, and there are no issues for
the President or the Board at this time.

The Infra team was able to meet last month during and after the
ApacheCon in Miami. This was a chance for the entire team to get
together to discuss work and for team bonding.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Discuss and possibly perform an additional Confluence upgrade to a
  more recent version
- LDAP changes to better support project membership management, and to
  support Atlassian Crowd (a single sign-on system for their products)

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Continue retiring ASF-owned hardware, reduce technical debt, and
  update documentation/runbooks

Uptime Statistics
=================
- Confluence was taken down to perform an emergency upgrade after we
  learned of a critical CVE in the version that we are running.
- Jira was taken down for about two hours to perform a planned upgrade
- We maintained our SLA requirements, even with the upgrades


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

A month ago we ran ApacheCon North America in Miami. We had just over 500 in
attendance. Feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive.

All audio from the event has been published to http://feathercast.org/
already. Thank you Sally for arranging a contractor to handle this editing and
posting. We also have all raw audio if anybody wants to repurpose any of it.
Various interviews with speakers and sponsors are still going on on
FeatherCast at this time.

All video from the event (keynotes and three additional tracks, sponsored by
Comcast) are up on YouTube at https://s.apache.org/miamivideo and we are in
the process of obtaining all of the raw video so that we can use that for
other purposes if we wish.

We will be further promoting these videos and podcasts on both @apachecon and
@ApacheCommunity in the coming days and weeks.

While at the event, we held a meeting discussing what ApacheCon will look like
in the coming years. The full notes from that meeting were sent to the
planners@apachecon.com mailing list, and may be seen here:
https://s.apache.org/kpgw (Members only.) While you are encouraged to join
that list if you are interested in the progress of this conversation, please
understand that this is a working list, and extended philosophical discussions
are discouraged.

In the vein, the meeting at ApacheCon was very focused on actual objectives,
and how to reach them, and was very productive. An enormous thank you to
everyone who attended, and who were able to keep this away from the
traditional complaint session we have seen in past years.

We agreed to pursue three tracks:

1) Participate more actively in third-party events, providing both standalone
"Apache Way" talks, as well as Apache tracks focusing primarily on The Apache
Way ("Community > Code") and the Incubator ("Tomorrow's Software Today").

2) Run ApacheCon as a convention of project events, but attempt to do so at
much lower cost venues, focusing on University and Government facilities,
rather than fancy hotels.

3) More inward-facing events, centered around F2F board meetings and Infra
gatherings - which we will be holding anyway - and then making the space
available for project summits and, possibly, sponsor meetings. Capture
high-quality content (video, audio) for later use.

I will leave the deeper details for the planners list, and encourage you to
read the meeting notes (linked above) for many of the details that are omitted
from this report.

In the last few weeks, Apache participated in Open Expo Madrid -
http://www.openexpo.es/en/ - spearheaded by Sharan Foga. We have also been
approached by several events requesting Apache content, in line with point 1
above.

And, pursuant to point 2, we have asked the Virtual events management team to
provide a bid for such an event. Tom Pappas has notified us that, were they to
take on such a task, it would involve an up-front retainer, which would
involve Conferences making a request for budget to cover this. This would be a
change from what Conferences has ever done in the past at the ASF, and so will
no doubt involve more discussion.

At this time, we do not have any plans to run an ApacheCon event in Europe. If
you are asked about it, please stick to three points: 1) We will not be doing
an official ApacheCon event in Europe in 2017. 2) We will be participating
more actively in other conferences - please see http://apache.org/events and
@apachecon for more details as we have them. 3) Please contact Rich Bowen for
more details.

Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

* 22 applications submitted; 12 accepted; 2 (later) declined the offer (1
  couldn’t get the time off from work; the other was supported by his
  company); TAC supported a total of 10 recipients for ACNA’17
* Post-ApacheCon surveys sent to all TACers and dropped in svn
* TAC Interview Requests sent to those who agreed to answering the interview
  questions. They will also be dropped in svn and included on the website
  under the “travel stories” once received.
* Reimbursement request of $1,260 submitted for subsistence payment, which
  Melissa paid out-of-pocket (9*$125; 1*$120 (Dammina); 4*$3.75 (ATM service
  fees)). The reason I chose to do it this way was because there were several
  folks that weren’t due to hear back from the visa office until it would’ve
  been way too late to submit for a payment request, and I didn’t want to
  submit it early and have the numbers be off. Michelle and I spoke about this
  ahead of time.
* $9,200 under budget! This is primarily due to the fact that two of the
  accepted (and included in the original budget) recipients declined the
  offer.
* TACers did a fantastic job at their duties

Stats that were sent to Sally for the Annual Report, which were
provided by Nick and do not include ACNA’17 Miami:

Of the people helped by TAC at Budapest and Vancouver, 3 have become 
members since the conference they attended, 2 have joined PMCs and 2
have 
become committers.

Overall, the figures are:
* People who weren't members at the conference, and now are: 23
* People who weren't committers at application, now are: 21
* People who weren't on PMCs at application, now are: 37
* People who now help with TAC: 4 (6 now with the addition of the new members
  after ACEU2016) 
* People who have never been/become committers: 27
* Unique people helped by TAC: 131
* Total number of TAC awards: 153

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

There have been a variety of license related questions, some policy
related questions that added a license to Category-X on our resolved
page, an issue related to a separate project on Github using a
license it dubbed "Modified Apache 2.0 License", and an issue related
to whether or not a project is able to use training data licensed
under various licenses to produce new ALv2 NLP models trained on
that data. There were also questions regarding if an ASF project
could build code generation tools that were used to generate non
ALv2 and/or permissively licensed code (e.g., GPL). And finally
there was a question regarding using sample data licensed under CC0
/ Public Domain as unit testing/acceptance testing data in one of
our projects.

In addition, there was a request from the IPMC to absolve it from
the requirement of performing/managing IP clearances for projects.
Legal has decided that the IPMC is the correct place for these
clearances to continue.

In the past month, the grace period for removing software using the
JSON license from Apache products has expired, and Legal notified
PMCs of this expiration.

A PMC was found to be rerouting release oriented user data to an
external third party site. The ASF Infra Admin and infra stepped
in, along with others to rectify this situation by the ASF taking
control of the third party site domain, and working with the PMC
to make sure everything is happening on ASF servers. Legal has no
concerns with this resolution.

Legal is proposing the addition of a new member to its committee
via resolution.

More information on relevant tickets to this report is provided
below.

* LEGAL-303 RocksDB Integrations 
* LEGAL-313 Use of CC0: Public
Domain License data 
* LEGAL-310 Handling of IP Clearance for
non-incubating projects 
* Re: JRuby bundling LGPL prior to version
9.1.9.0

first stable release, version 2.0.0. It signifies a statement from the
community that it intends to maintain API stability with all releases for the
foreseeable future, and making Beam suitable for enterprise deployment.
Additionally, version 2.0.0 improves user experience across the project,
focusing on seamless portability across execution environments, including
engines, operating systems, on-premise clusters, cloud providers, and data
storage systems.

Beam continues to interconnect additional execution engines and data
storage/messaging systems, and serves as a glue in the ecosystem. On the
execution side, the work continues on the Apache Gearpump (incubating) runner,
and a new effort on the JStorm runner has started. On the IO connector side,
connectors for Apache Cassandra and Apache Hive’s HCatalog have been
contributed, and additional connectors for Redis, Apache DistributedLog
(incubating), Apache Solr, Apache Parquet, RabbitMQ, and Advanced Message
Queuing Protocol (AMQP) are in progress. Finally, we have started a major
effort to create a SQL extension, based on Apache Calcite.

We have published a press release and a blog post regarding the first stable
release:
- https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-
  announces12
- https://beam.apache.org/blog/2017/05/17/beam-first-stable-release.html
We have also refreshed the design of our website.

Beam was covered at seven major industry conferences over the past quarter,
including the "Apache: Big Data" conference in Miami, FL, where we have had 4
talks, a birds-of-a-feather session and a social event. Additionally, we
organized the first meetup in the Bay Area, hosted by Hortonworks and Future
of Data.

Going forward, the main focus continues to be on the user growth, with
outreach continuing across conferences and meetups. On the technical side, the
next major milestone is the completion of the portability framework across all
components of the project, which would, among other benefits, extend Python
SDK to all Beam runners.

## Health report:

The community continues to grow steadily, as follows:
- The number of contributors continues to increase. We are now at 179 unique
  code contributors, with 76 individuals contributing to the latest release
  alone (which spanned less than 2 months).
- Releases continue at a regular pace of 1-2 months per release.
- The activity on the user@ mailing list more than doubled.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Evans Ye]

## Description:

Apache Bigtop is a software related to a system for integration, packaging,
deployment and validation of a big data management software distribution based
on Apache Hadoop.

## Issues:

PMC spots that a company[1] is using name/trademark similar to Bigtop. We'll
get this to Apache legal team to find out our next move.

## Activity:

The community has released 1.2.0 on April 4th, 2017.

The community is working on 1.2.1 release expected to be out at the end of June,
which will mainly be a bug fixing release with minor upgrades for certain
components.

Folks had a meetup during DataWorks Summit San Jose 2017,  laying down
details of what need to be included in 1.2.1 release and what's our future
directions. We'll bring that back on mailing list to reach consensus.

There was a talk about Apache Bigtop at Apache: Big Data Miami:
Leveraging Docker for Hadoop Build Automation and Big Data Provisioning,

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]

## Description:
   Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
   (Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in Java,
   Python, PHP, .NET, Objective-C, and JavaScript (and possibly other
   languages).

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

   no further CMIS specification version, errata, or official extension.
   This will affect Apache Chemistry in the long run.
 - Our last two releases got both 5+1 votes, but not from exactly the
   same group of people.
   Out of the 35 PMC members, there are probably 10 members left that
   watch the project and vote for releases. Due to the different
   subprojects and programming languages, not everyone is interested in
   every release.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description: 

- The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java
components.

- The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
Apache and without. Any ASF committer can commit to Apache Commons.

- The last report was on April 4, 2016.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues that requires the board's attention this quarter.
   
## Activity: 
 - The project is active with four (4) releases this reporting period.

 - We are working on a new component: Apache Commons Numbers, 
   providing implementations of extended number types such as complex, 
   quaternion, and fraction.
   
 - We migrated Commons CLI, Commons FileUpload, and Commons Imaging from 
   Subversion to Git.
 
 - We are starting to add testing with IBM Java 8 to Travis-CI builds.
   
## Health report: 
 - Most components in Commons are mature, but are still actively maintained
   (4 releases). The dev list is active. JIRA is active. Speed of responses
   to users is reasonable in most cases. We have no new PMC member, and
   Commons is still open to any Apache Committer.
 - Some of the energy spent toward Commons Math 4 is being redirected on
   building a new component out of Commons Math: Apache Commons Number.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

 A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
   
## Issues: 
 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 There was one overall plugin release this quarter. An overall plugin release usually consists of all, if not most, of our 23 plugins. This number was one less than last quarter.

We had two platform releases - one minor plus three patch releases for Android (6.2.0, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.3) and one minor release for iOS (4.4.0). Android releases were to fix two consecutive major breaks in Android tools releases (deprecation of certain Android SDK tools). The minor iOS release was to support Carthage, breakage while using Xcode 8.3.2, and also dynamic frameworks.

We had a major tools release of the CLI version 7.0.0 with support for custom platforms, increased package.json support, and dropping of support for older platform versions.

We had a new plugin release - cordova-plugin-screen-orientation 2.0.0, as well as a new developer tool release, cordova-coho 1.0.0. 

## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green. Travis CI pull request times have been vastly improved versus last quarter due to INFRA enabling certain beta changes for Travis. Previously pull requests may have taken 24 hours but now it happens within 15 minutes. 

Our plugin device testing has been put on hold since a major contributor has decided to not support the server we have been testing on, resulting in a lot of "broken" build status badges on the status page. To resolve this,  we are moving the testing to AppVeyor and Travis CI, and have filed an INFRA issue for help: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-14273

We still have a huge backlog of Github Pull Request activity, again, same as last quarter -- but it has improved. We would have liked to have direct access to Github to manage these issues better and we have requested Gitbox access but there hasn't been a response so far: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-14347 

Again, our goal for plugins release is to have one per week as a cadence, and we have failed to do so again this quarter. We have done work on streamlining this so it will improve in the future.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex SDK 4.16.0 was released on 3/10/17.
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.3 was released on 3/31/17.
-Preparing to vote on Apache FlexJS 0.8.0.

-Apache FlexJS 0.7.0 was released on 9/7/16.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was released on 6/23/15.


ACTIVITY 
The past three months saw the release of Apache Flex SDK 4.16.0 and
Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.3, the latter addressing CVE-2017-5641. Apache Flex
SDK 4.16.0 contained a fix for FLEX-35123, an XSS issue reported in prior
board reports.  It is only exploitable in really old versions of Safari.  We
did not get a CVE for it.  Maybe we should?  It seems almost more academic
than actual.

Christofer Dutz organized the FlexJS Summit at ApacheCon. Several committers
met for the first time and reportedly had a great time.  A list of priorities
for FlexJS and other products we release also came out of the summit.

An attempt was made to get the Apache FlexJS 0.8.0 release out by the end of
April in order to meet the org.json deadline, but many major bugs were found
after feature freeze started on April 21 (known as "Last Call" on our dev@
list).  We next tried to get the release out for ApacheCon, but as of May 31
we are still fixing bugs.  There is something inefficient about the release
process for Apache Flex releases.  As the release manager for Apache FlexJS
0.8.0, it doesn't feel like the community focuses on trying to get the release
out, but rather, reasons to put off the release.  The Apache Flex SDK 4.16.0
only had 3 voters.  And after it went out, we found out that the installer
didn't work in some common scenarios.  We are unable to reach quality in a
timely manner.  There have been no new volunteers to be Release Manager for
several years now.  Being RM is one of the things I dread doing.  As I (Alex
Harui, PMC Chair) file this report, we still won't have a release out since a
couple of PMC members did not bother to examine the artifacts during "Last
Call", waited for the RC to be posted, and now want major restructuring of the
release artifacts.

Mailing list activity on dev@ dropped by 30% around the end of March and
remains down.  Commit activity from folks who were active in the prior quarter
is down as well.  I am hopeful that this is because one committer ran out of
time to contribute recently and the others finished most of the work on the
libraries they were working on and are now building apps for their employers
on top of those libraries.

COMMUNITY
-Last committer as added on 9/5/16.  A discussion has started about a new
candidate.
-Yishay Weiss was added to the PMC on 1/20/17.
-Latest analytics include a little less than 500 hits per day on the Website
during the work week (less on weekends).  It used to be closer to 1000 hits
per day.
-There were more than 2700 installs Apache Flex 4.16.0 since its release in
March 2017.
-More than 130,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.  Tour De Flex
is a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex applications.

TRADEMARKS
-A company is promoting a software product called Flex that appears to be
related to themes/styles for website visuals. Despite several attempts to
contact them, they have not responded. The ASF VP Trademarks sent them an
email on 11/3/16.  I did not see a response and their website is still up.
What is the next step?
-Trademarks@ notified us that a company in Europe is applying to register the
word FLEX for a software product that runs gas stations, but still might cause
confusion.  The recommendation from trademarks@ and consensus from the Flex
PMC is to have Apache counsel write them a nice letter asking them to limit
the scope of their application to their industry.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam,
Hadoop, Mesos, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and various others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - Flink is in a healthy phase of growing the committer base to handle the
    increased activity in various components. Since the beginning
    of the year, eight new committers were added.
  
  - The first time-based release happened with 1.3.0, and the feedback
    from users and committers was positive.
  
  - The discussion about modularization and possible changes to the build and
    testing setups continues, to address the very long build/test times.
    No conclusion has been reached so far. A significant build-time reduction
    would require big changes to the build setups (like organizing Flink into
    various sub-repositories) and there are concerns about the added complexity
    for users and contributors that such a setup brings.

  - There will be another instance of the Flink Forward conference in Berlin
    in September this year: http://berlin.flink-forward.org
    The program committee consists of a mix of Flink community members and
    stream processing experts from other stream and event-processing communities.
    The call for participation is currently happening.

  - The Flink Forward San Francisco conference happened in April, with
    Apache Flink training, user talks, committer talks, and a "how to
    participate in the community" tutorial.
    In addition, there were presentations about Flink at Apache Con,
    Kafka Summit, Dataworks Summit, Strata, Mesos Con, J on the Beach,
    and several other conferences.

  - Voting on bugfix release 1.3.1 is in progress at the time of writing
    this report.

COMMUNITY

PMC members added since last report:
  - Greg Hogan was added as a PMC member on March 13th, 2017.

Committers added since the last board report:
  - Theodore Vasiloudis was added as a committer on March 21st, 2017
  - Xiaogang Shi was added as a committer on May 21st, 2017
  - Dawid Wysakowicz was added as a committer on June 14th, 2017
  - Shaoxuan Wang was voted in as a committer on June 15th, 2017

Flink currently has 32 committers and 17 PMC members.

RELEASES

The following releases were made since the last board report:
 
  - 1.1.5 was released on March, 22nd, 2017 
  - 1.2.1 was released on April 25th, 2017 
  - 1.3.0 was released on May 31st, 2017

ACTIVITY ON JIRA / MAILING LISTS

Both user@f.a.o and dev@f.a.o lists are very active, with mails getting
answered by a mix of committers and non-committers.

JIRA continues to be very active 
(824 JIRA tickets created, 622 JIRA tickets over last 3 months)

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

No changes compared to the last quarter, the service is humming along.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

This has again been a very quiet quarter for Gump. Gump seems to
remain useful for the projects using it.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

Incubator PMC report for June 2017

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and codebases
wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

At the end of May, there were 60 podlings incubating.  Podlings executed six
releases this month.  The incubator brought in one new podling, and the board
has motions to graduate three podlings from the incubator.  One IPMC member
stepped down while two new IPMC members joined.

Many reports below were signed off by a single mentor.  The Incubator PMC
shall begin to plan for a way to address this.

* Community

New IPMC members:

- Bikas Saha
- Bob Paulin

People who left the IPMC:

- Par Niclas Hedhman

* New Podlings

- Superset

* Podlings that failed to report, expected next month

- HORN - No on list discussions recently.
- MRQL - No on list discussion in past 3 months, limited discussions prior to
that.
- Myriad - Discussing retirement
- Sirona - Likely to be retired or moved as a sub-project by next report

* Graduations

The board has motions for the following:

- Atlas

AriaTosca

ARIA TOSCA project offers an easily consumable Software Development Kit(SDK)
and a Command Line Interface(CLI) to implement TOSCA(Topology and
Orchestration Specification of Cloud Applications) based solutions.

AriaTosca has been incubating since 2016-08-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Grow the community and enroll new committers.
 2. Have frequent Release cycles to be compliant with the Apache Way.
 3. Move the website to apache.org

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

The project is ready for its first release as far as the code is concerned;
We're working on updating the README and ensuring compatibility with ASF's
regulations regarding creating releases. On the latter issue, we've come
across a few possible problems, that are being discussed on the project's
mailing list. For more information, see the threads "ARIA dependencies License
issues" and "A few questions about creating a release" on the mailing list
archive.


How has the community developed since the last report?

* All project communication takes now place on either the mailing list or
  ASF's Slack, and is open for everybody.
* Increased chatter on the mailing list including new subscribers who ask
  questions, make suggestions and are likely to become contributors themselves
  in the near future.

How has the project developed since the last report?

1. ARIA now has a CLI, making it usable as a stand alone tool as well as a
library. 2. Usage examples have been added 3. End-to-End tests now run on a
daily basis (as well as on CIs for every commit) 4. 93 JIRA issues have been
resolved since the last report

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

Please feel free to add your own commentary.

Joshua

Joshua is a statistical machine translation toolkit

Joshua has been incubating since 2016-02-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Release Apache Joshua incubating 6.1 (rc4) and then begin development on
   7.X branch.
 2. Identifying specific use cases that we might excel at.
 3. Attracting active developers and users.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

There is currently an ongoing VOTE thread over on general@incubator regarding
the proposed release of Apache Joshua incubating 6.1 (rc4). If this goes
through it will be a significant achievement for the podling. 

How has the community developed since the last report?

There are ongoing discussion threads on user@ regarding integration of Joshua
with Mailman. There are no new community members. Some members of the Joshua
PPMC became Apache members post this years annual meeting. Henry Yandell is
now emeritus mentor.

How has the project developed since the last report?

The community has been iterating on Apache Joshua incubating 6.1 RC's as well
as refining the release process. We have pretty much addressed all concerns
now so subsequent releases should be easier.

How would you assess the podling's maturity? Please feel free to add your own
commentary.

OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able to
execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) from
external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional logic
(Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST API-based
Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support packaging and
catalog services.

OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Moving last remaining (project website) github repo. :
         i.e., https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk.github.io
     under the Apache Github org. 
         i.e. http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/
     and automatic Jenkins build to compile the static website 
     (using current Jekyll) build and automate publishing
     to our incubator site. looking at using the “GitPubSub” tool:
     https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/git_based_websites_available
 2. Complete updating all source files with approved ASF header (incl. JS)
 3. Credentials sharing process for social media sites (e.g., Twitter, 
     YouTube, Medium, etc.) to provide access to PPMC members.
 
     Continue working through project incubation checklists on CWIKI
     Compliance Checklist for OpenWhisk.org website.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 - Travis is still taking much longer under the Apache org. within GitHub then
   it did under the previous openwhisk.org and experiencing build time-outs.
   Developers are looking to reduce build dependencies to shorten build times
   by using pre-built Docker images, as well as optimizing CI tests.

SAMOA

SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most
common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification,
clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop new
algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs).
It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on several DSPEs
such as Apache Flink, Apache Storm, Apache Apex and Apache Samza.

SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Grow the developer base
 2. Grow the user base
 3. Add some more ML techniques

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware

Mailing list activity (March 2017 - May 2017):
 * @dev: 38 messages

 Jira issues backlog (March 2017 - May 2017):
 * Created:  6
 * Resolved: 1

 - We organized a 2-day internal workshop on SAMOA at Telefonica I+D with
   researchers of Orange Labs, Telecom Paris and QCRI. Various have been
   discussed to improve SAMOA's ML and other interfaces with systems like
   Kafka, etc.

 - We submitted a proposal for funding which will help the development of new
   features on Samoa.

 - We have been working on a new release 0.5.0, probably coming up in one
   month. This release will have support for Kafka, a more well-rounded
   support for Avro and Json formats, as well as support to store predictions
   outputted from the model.

 - There was also significant work done to integrate correctly the instances
   between MOA and SAMOA, as there was a deviation of how they were defined
   and hindered the portability of new methods from MOA to SAMOA.
 
 - Early discussions to increase the committers / developers team by inviting
   new contributors to the panel.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 - We are looking into new ML techniques for development.

 - Worked on the integration of Samoa-MOA instances

 - Engaging interactions with new parties (Orange Labs) and potential

1. We added more documentation including Jupyter notebooks and Chinese
translation. 2. Debian package is improved with CPack 3. Memory optimization
is added 4. We fixed some bugs and added several new features, e.g. image
augmentation methods, L2 normalization layer and SigmoidCrossEntropy loss. 


How would you assess the podling's maturity?

We will start the graduating process after the next release with the above
issues fixed.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Apache Slider community/PPMC has voted to move portions of Slider into
    Apache Hadoop YARN as modules. It is possible that the remaining pieces
    will be moved at a later point in time or become obsolete or evolve to
    work closely with YARN. Slider PPMC will decide what makes the most
    sense as we progress through this exciting time.

 2. Getting more external users

 3. Growth of a diverse set of developers/committers/PMC members is also
    crucial towards the final state of Slider

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 Mailing list activity has been lower due to the bulk of the development
 moving to an Apache Hadoop branch. Questions on usage and issues
 encountered by end users keep coming at regular intervals, keeping the DL
 fairly active.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Work continues in parallel on the Apache Hadoop yarn-native-services
 branch and on the Slider podling. The bulk of the work has been in
 yarn-native-services, while a few Slider patches (related to critical
 issues or agent-only issues) have been committed as well.

commentary.

    Comments: Joined as a new mentor while the transition of Slider to Apache
      Hadoop project as a sub-module continues. Per feedback on general@, the
      community shall work on a concrete plan on how the project's journey in
      incubator comes to a close.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

 johndament: The IPMC still is looking for clarification on Slider/Hadoop's
   relationship.  Will follow up.

Spot

Apache Spot is a solution stack that provides the capability to ingest IT
related telemetry (network flows, domain name service DNS, and proxy server
logs) and provide unsupervised machine learning capabilities to identify
suspicious activity.  The information is organized and presented using
operational analytics so that a security analyst can investigate the most
suspicious connections. Apache Spot is built on an open data model using
Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1.  Move infrastructure and development to ASF (code, issues, mailing list,
   ...)
 2.  Build diverse community
 3.  Demonstrate ability to create releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of? Two out of the four mentors are the ones showing the most active
participation and involvement on the project so we need to discuss with IPMC
our options to get the other two replaced.

How has the community developed since the last report? By remaking the
Community section on the Project webpage and driving users on Slack to limit
the usage of the same tool just for quick interactions, the traffic over Mail
Lists has increased, we still need to continue driving usage questions to USER
list. A group of Developers from Brazil is coming with a proposal for UX and
UI, based on the merits of the proposal, and the potential that the same has
we have invited them to become Committers on the projects. 
The initial purpose of the Project on Network & Security needs to expand the
scope to IT Analytics to cover other uses cases and/or enrich content with
User and Endpoint data. While a normalization framework has been drafted to
what we call Open Data Model we still need more work and contributions on
technical delivery to make it a reality. Contributions to improve the concept
of Ingestion Pipeline & Data Lake are delivered with more cadence, there is a
recognition from Community to normalize data to open the space for other
sources of Ingestion

How has the project developed since the last report? The team has created the
epic on ASF JIRA towards the first Apache release, we’re working now including
the user stories that will be part of release, and doing checks to what can be
delivered before we do the the formal announcement on DEV for the code freeze.
Integrations for context enrichment are critical, however also the need of
bringing a plugin manager where does can be handled, the Spec was drafted, and
the team now is finalizing the last Pull requests to begin merging
functionality onto project code. Documentation is an area of focus so from May
to July committers we’ll continue improving & detailing more, architecture
definitions, deployment options, and UI usage sections. As the whole delivery
is concluded we’ll vote for a FAQ section which can be a point of reference
for common issues/situations. Being part of ASF is important Community
requests that project enables integration/consumption of other Apache
projects, one of our DEVOPS committers, for that reason having an API
framework now will open the door for more smooth integrations. 

Date of last release: N/A

When were the last committers or PMC members elected? Last committer was
elected on 06/02 

How does the podling rate their own maturity? By know we’re almost ready to do
our first Apache Release which is good, but we still need to mature Community,
the ramping of other Contributors has been slow, we have a strong base of
Consumer positive aspect as it probed consumption, however more Commits from
other interested parties will accelerate functionality delivery.

Streams

Apache Streams (incubating) unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and
online activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these
datasets accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for
streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

Streams has been incubating since 2012-11-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. Community growth and PMC maturity. 2. Demonstrate a consistent release
schedule. 3. Participation of project community within related
standards-bodies and Apache projects.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

The community has completed an internal assessment using the Apache Maturity
Model to identify gaps that should be addressed before graduation.

The community is working against a task list of graduation TODOs:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/STREAMS/Graduation+TODOs

It is likely that Streams will pursue graduation to TLP during the coming
quarter.

 2. Setup our Git repository and transition our codebase there now that our
   contributor CLAs and Airbnb SGA is complete
 3. Move the website to apache.org

Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of?
The team is working on finishing up all the items on the Incubation Checklist.
We’re working on finding a way to link Jira Issues to GitHub Issues as the
team has a preference for using GitHub Issues for tracking.

How has the community developed since the last report?
* The mailing lists have been created (dev@superset.incubator.apache.org &
  private@superset.incubator.apache.org) and all project communication now
  takes place on the mailing list and is open for everyone.
* Organic growth of our Github contributors (140), forks (1981), watchers
  (707) and stars (14 331)
* Recent talk were given by Maxime Beauchemin at DataEngConf and PlotCon

How has the project developed since the last report?
* The team has filed an executed SGA from Airbnb allowing the team to move
  forward with migrating the code base to a Git repository on ASF
* A JIRA project has been setup for issue tracking
* A healthy, constant flow of bug fixes, quality improvements and new
  features, take a look at the project’s Pulse on Github for more details

Tamaya

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. finally release 0.3 - RC vote already took place
 2. Release next artifacts after core/API 0.3-incubating is out 
 3. graduate

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

We would like to graduate after our new release is out.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Many discussions and bug reports were filed in order to see how
microprofile.io discussions match the Tamaya roadmap. In order to prepare for
the new release some people (inactive for quite a while) were moved to the
emeritus section.

How has the project developed since the last report?

New homepage is live, release candidates for 0.3-incubating are out. Waiting
to continue with extensions and further development on sandbox modules.

From the recent graduation/IP review it was agreed to skip some of the
auxiliary git repositories from the graduation process (move to GitHub) - but
this has not yet happened.

Although the community is ready, we are lacking initiative on the bureaucratic
side and need to push ourselves harder.

      Wave continues as a very small scale project. It hovers just under the
        threshold of sufficient
      participation for graduation, whilst is too active to argue for
        retirement.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

 johndament: Considering your comments, are there additional contributors who
   you think may make sense to start to invite?
 upayavira: perhaps a new mentor might bring something new, but repeated
   efforts to draw in new contributors have not brought the kind of interest
   the project needs. It remains one active PPMC member below the minimum for
   graduation. Any help warmly accepted, even if short term.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael Dürig]

## Description: 
The Apache Jackrabbit™ content repository is a fully conforming
implementation of the Content Repository for Java™ Technology API
(JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
maintained. 
Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding  
content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
is not a reference implementation. 

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are 
continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
driven by dependencies from Oak. 

The PMC resolved the impact of the recently published SHA-1 collisions 
in the development branch. Back ports to maintenance branches are under
consideration. 

The last quarter saw a much needed and anticipated refactoring of 
the Oak code base leading to an overall improved and simplified module 
structure. While some of this work is still ongoing we expect it to 
have a positive effect on the overall evolvability and maintainability 
of the code base.

We will be holding an Oak Hackathon August 21st to 25th in Basel, 
Switzerland (https://wiki.apache.org/jackrabbit/Oakathon%20August%202017). 
Attendance is open and free to everybody wanting to hack Oak. 
   
## Health report: 
The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
lists as well as on the various JIRA issues. 

Commit activity is moderate to high mirroring the activity on the 
JIRA issues.

## Description: 
 - Apache Karaf provides a very modern and polymorphic container, multi-purpose
   (microservices, OSGi, etc) powered by OSGi.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

 - We did 4 releases in the last 3 months. 3 are maintenance release, and
   Cellar 4.1.0 is the first release in the Cellar 4.1.x series bringing lot of
   new features, improvements and fully compliant with Karaf 4.1.x
 - "Large Apache Karaf cluster with Karaf Cellar and Mesos" talk has been given
   during ApacheCon NA '17 Miami. We noticed important interest during the talk
   and we got lot of questions and feedbacks from users.
 - We are preparing Karaf 4.1.2, Cellar 4.1.1 and Decanter 1.4.0 releases.
 - An important work is in progress on the documentation (mostly dev guide with
   samples). It's longer than we expected, but we did good progress and
   hopefully it should be available on our website soon. 
   
## Health report: 
 - Our user community is still growing up, and ApacheCon was a great way to meet users in person. We had several discussions and demos in the hacking area during ApacheCon.
 - We addressed the trademark issue mentioned in the previous report.
 - As usual, we are watching potential new PMC members and committers.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==
* As of last board report we had finally shipped beta 1 of Lucene 4.8.0. We
  are currently at 4.8.0-beta00004 
* Strong community involvement to get this over the line, and lots of people
  are jumping in to give feedback on the release. 

== Releases ==
* Release 4.8.0 Beta4 - May 21st, 2017
* Release 4.8.0 Beta1 - May 9th, 2017
* Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012

== Statistics ==
* Last PMC Member added May 2017, Shad Storhaug
* Last committer added Sept 2016, Shad Storhaug 

Nuget package downloads:
As we will have 17 packages for 4.8.0 release, I'll work on a new way to
present these metrics. Currently we have just over 900 downloads of the core
beta package and 50 for the various libraries that add additional features

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Metron Project  [Casey Stella]

## Description: 
Metron integrates a variety of open source big data technologies in order
to offer a centralized tool for security monitoring and analysis.  Metron
provides capabilities for log aggregation, full packet capture indexing,
storage, advanced behavioral analytics and data enrichment, while applying
the most current threat-intelligence information to security telemetry
within a single platform.
  
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - We are unincubated
 - We are in the middle of voting for a release, our first as an top level
 - Given some performance work that happened late last month motivated
   the community to hold the release for that.
   
## Health report: 

Project activity is broadly the same as in prior months.  There was
some renewed interest after graduation in user@ and it's evident that
more people are trying the product.  Also, there were a number of talks
associated with Metron in Hadoop Summit San Jose this month. I think 
we will see increased interest and traffic.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

## Description: 
Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project

## Issues:
 there are no issues requiring board attention at this time 

## Activity:
 - OFBiz has endorsed the "Support Apache" initiative by publishing
   a news item in the landing page of the website
 - refactoring and stabilization of source code is slowly progressing
 - new features, improvements and bug fixes have been contributed and
   integrated into the official code base: 147 tickets created and 121 tickets
   resolved in the last quarter
 - there are new and ongoing initiatives to improve the documentation for developers
   and users
 - mailing list activity have been on average for number of messages exchanged
   and for the number of subscriptions
 - the activity in the official blog [1] and Twitter account [2]
   is steady with monthly blog posts and tweets; we have a rather low activity
   in our public HipChat room [3]
 - the project has now an official Facebook page [4] and Vimeo account [5]
 - we are still actively tracking and following up on trademark violations

## Health report: 
 - the last quarter have been a normal one in the life of the project; the
   community is supportive and active; no new committer or PMC members have been
   invited in this quarter; we have published a new release

## Answers to comments made by Board members to our last report
  Mark Thomas: "I'd be interested in hearing in your next report what impact the
    architectural changes have had on the community - particularly
    levels of involvement and activity."
 - The main architectural changes have been the switch from Ant to Gradle as the
   project's build system and the split of the codebase into two repositories: one
   for the core framework and one for the extensions/plugins. However the latter
   is still a work in progress with active discussions [7] as infrastructure and
   code are still being developed to serve plugins to users [8]. Impact can be
   measured after publishing plugins which is expected with the next major release
   of OFBiz. On the other hand the switch to Gradle, introduced in the 16.11 series,
   has been already published since we have 2 releases in the series: 16.11.01 and
   the new 16.11.02. So far the impact has not been huge: we are getting a few
   questions in the mailing list and in Stackoverflow about how to perform
   traditional Ant tasks in the new way; the questions are promptly answered and
   documentation has been produced to assist the users [6].

## PMC changes:

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description:
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.

## Olingo Status
Olingo has no issues that would require board attention.
Since the last report no new releases were done. As of last week we got few
request regarding new releases in the 4.x code line and the 2.x code line.
As of now no release candidate has been produced but we are working on that.
The project should pick up a more steady release schedule again once the 4.01
specification is released. This specification is currently in public review at
Oasis.

Last report I said that there are individuals that contribute a lot to Olingo.
I am pleased to say that that this resulted in invites to become Olingo
committers for Archana Rai and Ramya Vasanth. Both accepted and have been
contributing since then.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description: 
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specification which is defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0) and CDI-1.1
 and CDI-1.2 (MR) specifications (JSR-346).

 The OWB community also maintains  a small server based as 
 Apache Meecrowave subproject. Meecrowave consists of
 Tocmat9 + OpenWebBeans + CXF + Johnzon.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
 
## Activity: 
 We have finished implementing the CDI-2.0 (JSR-365)
 specification. The spec and TCK are available under ALv2 thanks to JBoss.
 We are now successfully passing the TCK and expect to ship an
 OWB-2.0.0 release this month.

 Apache Meecrowave (an OWB subproject) is also progressing fine.
 We will likely ship a new version this month as well.
 After OWB-2.0 is out we will also upgrade Meecrowvave to CDI-2.0. 

## Health report: 
 The community is small but quite healthy.
 We are always keeping our eyes open for new committers.
 New people keep popping up on our lists and ticket system 
 but there is a rather big gap between using OWB and providing
 deep patches it seems.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Description:
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
   features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
   Java platform.

Issues:
   There are no board-level issues at the moment.

Activity:
   There has been a lot of activity (relatively-speaking) this quarter:
   a "show-stopper" issue showed up with the release of Java 8u131 that
   required an immediate fix, which was done within a few days; much
   work is being done in "trunk" on implement Input Method Editor
   support for text controls; and the next maintenance release is
   just about to happen.
   
Health report: 
   With the "show-stopper" issue a number of people who had been
   quietly using Pivot in the background "resurfaced" to weigh in,
   which indicated that there are more people interested in the
   project than is reflected in the mailing list statistics. This
   is heartening. The upcoming maintenance release should help as
   well, hopefully, to revive some interest.
 
PMC changes: 
 - Currently 4 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
 - Last PMC re-addition was Niclas Hedhman on Wed Jan 13 2016.
   
Committer base changes: 
 - Currently 9 committers. 
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report. 
   
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago 
   
Releases: 
 - Last release was 2.0.4 on Sun May 18 2014 
 - Next release (2.0.5) is in process.
   
Mailing list activity: 
The developer list activity is way up due to the increased
coding in "trunk" and fixing the "show-stopper" issue in the
maintenance branch. Incidentally the change in mailing list
subscribers was actually due to a user changing his email
address, and he contacted us for help.

 - dev@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 62 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 131 emails sent to list (21 in previous quarter) 
   
 - user@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 174 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 5 emails sent to list (6 in previous quarter) 
   
JIRA activity: 
 - 7 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 2 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months 
 - About 5 tickets were also changed to move them out from
   2.0.5 to 2.1 in order to expedite the 2.0.5 release.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Polygene Project  [Paul Merlin]

Description
    Apache Polygene is a community based effort exploring Composite
    Oriented Programming for domain centric application development.
  
Issues: 
    No issues that requires Board attention at this point in time.
   
Activity
    This has been a quarter much more busy than normal. We tried to 
    make a release in April, but had to pull it due to missing a 
    couple of incompatibility changes desired, as well as one feature
    not working as advertised.
    A new attempt at a release is planned for July.
    We want to change the logo, have a basic idea, but not gotten to 
    actually do it. Last outstanding issue regarding the name change.
   
Health report
    Stanislav has been voted into the PMC. Before we came to Apache, 
    he was very active, and ended up creating a C# fork/clone and 
    been working on that since. During this quarter he has assisted
    in some design decisions, by comparing what he has in the C# 
    version. Discussion is also on-going whether that C# version 
    should be brought to Polygene as well.
    Other than that, community growth is not what we wished it to be.
   
PMC changes
    - Currently 12 PMC members. 
    - Stanislav Muhametsin was added to the PMC on Mon Jun 12 2017 
   
Committer base changes: 
    - Currently 18 committers. 
    - No new changes to the committer base since last report. 
   
    - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
    - Last committer addition was more than 2 years ago 
   
Releases: 
   
    - Last release was in August 2015
   
Mailing list activity: 
    I suspect that the drop of 2 subscribers this quarter may be due 
    to the amount of email sent, both discussing the release as well
    as the many Jenkins reports of broken builds. 
   
 - users@polygene.apache.org:  
    - 19 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months): 
    - 1 emails sent to list (2 in previous quarter) 
   
 - dev@polygene.apache.org:  
    - 37 subscribers (down -2 in the last 3 months): 
    - 718 emails sent to list (231 in previous quarter)

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In
addition, the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had
a release since 2007.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Activity has been substantially above average as we have worked
   towards a new release 1.6 of APR and APR-UTIL.
   Release candidates APR-1.6.0 and APR-UTIL-1.6.0 were tagged on
   April 15th.  After identifying problems with the APR candidate,
   further work led to tagging APR-1.6.1 on May 31st, but that too
   had a problem.
   Since the end of the period, APR-1.6.2 has been tagged,
   and voted for release along with APR-UTIL-1.6.0.

## Health report:
 - The release process has highlighted the difficulty (of which
   we have long been aware) of supporting platforms outside those
   regularly used by the core team.  A proposal to help deal with
   this problem is being floated.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 40 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Christophe Jaillet on Sun Oct 30 2016

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 66 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Ivan Zhakov at Fri Oct 28 2016

## Releases:

 - Last releases were APR-1.5.2 on Wed Apr 29 2015 and APR-UTIL-1.5.4
   on Sept 22 2014.

## Mailing list activity:

 - Increased activity due primarily to release drive.
   Fewer subscribers: we can only speculate that the increased activity
   has prompted people who are no longer interested to unsubscribe.

 - dev@apr.apache.org:
    - 329 subscribers (down -10 in the last 3 months):
    - 365 emails sent to list (194 in previous quarter)

 - bugs@apr.apache.org:
    - 22 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 33 emails sent to list (29 in previous quarter)

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

## Description

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Issues

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

## Activity

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

- We have prepared 2 releases of Apache ServiceMix: maintenance release 6.1.4
  and next development release 7.0.1. We don't expect too much activity on
  ServceMix 6 and we plan to transit in into EOL soon. In the new period we are
  going to focus on the further development, stability and maintenance of
  ServiceMix 7. We are working on new releases of ServiceMix 7 upgraded to the
  new dependency versions, especially Apache Karaf 4.1.x and new Apache Camel
  versions.
- We have also released 2 sets of OSGi bundles and a new release of ServiceMix
  Specs. We are currently working on new Bundles and Specs releases.
- Thanks to a contribution we did a big step in documentation improvement. The
  documentation has been migrated into Asciidoc format and updated with the
  actual state of ServiceMix. It should be integrated soon in our website.
- We are going to make a small refactoring of ServiceMix features to give them
  a separate lifecycle (as ServiceMix Features) and provide better modularity
  and maintainability of ServiceMix.
- Jean-Baptiste Onofré has submitted a new feature proposal. The new feature
  should extend ServiceMix with ability to manage APIs. We are going to accept
  the initial contribution and work on the new feature to provide it in one of
  the next releases.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to Board for June 2017

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

Project activity has picked up quite a bit in the past quarter with work
proceeding on a new release and the addition of two new committers who are
working on our sysadmin/infrastructure needs to resurrect the mass check
facility on a new machine. We have set up a new public mailing list sysadmins@
for the latter activity,

The users list has been quite active and fairly technical for a user oriented
list. There is a regular presence of some committers/PMC answering questions
and participation in the discussions.

Issues:

The board feedback to the last report brought to our attention a private key
that was stored on a shared server. There is no reason to believe that
anything has been compromised. The key was encrypted and on a private
directory. We asked to have the file deleted. We will generate a new signing
key for our next release and make sure that we follow best practices in how we
secure it.

Our old VM was decommissioned before the new machine was running, but we
restored essential services fairly quickly and without it being a crisis
situation. Most importantly we now have better documentation and an active
sysadmin team as a subset of our committer/PMC team.

Releases:

The last release was Apache SpamAssassin version 3.4.1 on 30 April 2015.

Note that we maintain online rule updates that are continuously updated
through a combination of developer contributions and automated processing via
our mass-check facility.

Work has been steadily proceeding this year, and at a faster pace this
quarter, on the upcoming 3.4.2 release, however most work has been on
completing the migration of the ruleqa/mass-check facility to the new
infrastructure. We have completed a triage of issues and port of commits from
trunk to the 3.4.2 branch.

We expect the release to follow soon after the infrastructure work is
completed.

Committer/PMC changes:

New Committers this quarter:

Dave Jones (davej) 26 April 2017 Bryan Vest (bvest) 7 May, 2017

   The refactoring of the HTTP connectors for 8.5.x onwards, introduced
   a regression in the send file processing. If the send file
   processing completed quickly, it was possible for the Processor to
   be added to the processor cache twice. This could result in the same
   Processor being used for multiple requests which in turn could lead
   to unexpected errors and/or response mix-up.
   Affects: 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18, 8.5.0 to 8.5.12

 - Important: Denial of Service CVE-2017-5650
   The handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not
   close streams associated with that connection that were currently
   waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE before allowing the application to write
   more data. These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious
   client could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that
   would consume all available processing threads.
   Affects: 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18

 - Important: Information Disclosure CVE-2017-5647
   A bug in the handling of the pipelined requests when send file was
   used resulted in the pipelined request being lost when send file
   processing of the previous request completed. This could result in
   responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request. For example,
   a user agent that sent requests A, B and C could see the correct
   response for request A, the response for request C for request B and
   no response for request C.
   Affects: 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.42,
            8.5.0 to 8.5.12, 7.0.0 to 7.0.76

 - Low: Information Disclosure CVE-2017-5648
   While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to
   application listeners did not use the appropriate facade object.
   When running an untrusted application under a SecurityManager, it
   was therefore possible for that untrusted application to retain a
   reference to the request or response object and thereby access
   and/or modify information associated with another web application.
   Affects: 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M17, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41,
            8.5.0 to 8.5.11, 7.0.0 to 7.0.75

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Junqueira]

## Description: 
Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It enables
distributed systems to implement a variety of primitives and mechanisms that
are critical for them to function, e.g., distributed locks, master
election, group membership, and configuration.
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 We have completed two releases since March and the community is now working
 towards the first stable release of the 3.5 branch. There isn’t much to
 report other than the fact that there is work going on in the community,
 see for example, mailing list and lira numbers below.   
   
## Health report: 
 Number of subscribers and emails sent to the user/dev lists have grown
 only slightly. The size of the community has been roughly stable, although
 the slight growth is an indication of health: we still occasionally get
 new joiners and the overall numbers aren’t dropping.

 We are also working with various contributors in the community to get them
 to a stage that we can offer them committership. We also have just voted a
 new PMC member, but this PMC Chair hasn’t processed the new member yet.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 12 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Rakesh Radhakrishnan on Fri Mar 03 2017 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 21 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Mohammad Arshad at Tue Jan 24 2017 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - 3.4.10 was released on Thu Mar 30 2017 
 - 3.5.3 was released on Mon Apr 17 2017 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
 Number of dev subscribers has grown by 2%, while the number of user
 subscribers has grown by less than 1%. As I have explained in a previous
 report, typically questions on ZooKeeper are asked in the dev list. In
 fact, the number of messages sent to the user list is small compared
 to the dev list.   
   
 - dev@zookeeper.apache.org:  
    - 517 subscribers (up 10 in the last 3 months): 
    - 3774 emails sent to list (3741 in previous quarter) 
   
 - user@zookeeper.apache.org:  
    - 1200 subscribers (up 7 in the last 3 months): 
    - 131 emails sent to list (168 in previous quarter) 
   
   
## JIRA activity: 
   
 - 86 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 53 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months
