       I look forward to seeing the board in McLean next month. The agenda for
       the face to face meeting has been posted, and comments or additional
       items are welcome.

       There was discussion about creating a separate board list for traffic
       on discussions compared to the day-to-day notices, meeting preparation
       and follow up. I intend to follow through on this over the next month.

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall
       =======

       My current priorities: Fundraising, EA/TAC, then Brand Management.

       During the process of converting the FY18 budget into monthly
       allotments, Virtual identified a number of small discrepancies.
       Nothing to be concerned about, in fact the net was a small positive.

       As predicted, timining issues of payments led to a missing FY17 budget
       targets overall.  This does not seem to be a problem, but is something
       we will need to recognize and account for when accessing budget vs
       actuals for FY18.  Exceeding targets by FY18 anything less than
       fundraising shortfall should not be considered a "win".

       I plan to get with Rich and Ross to determine if conferences is
       something that I should add to my priority list and help with.


       Fundraising
       ===========

       Virtual's increased role in terms of invoicing continues to show
       results.  The bigger problems previously identified are all either
       resolved or are well on their way to being resolved.  Virtual is
       continuing to look at the entire set of sponsors to see if there are
       any other problems that need to be addressed.

       Hadrian has resigned as VP, Fundraising.  I'm naming Kevin as his
       replacement.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank Hadrian for his
       contributions which helped keep the foundation afloat all of these
       years!  And look for Hadrian's continued help.

       I'm pleased to see Kevin hit the ground running and not waiting until
       he has been officially named into this new role.  In particular, I've
       been pleasantly surprised to see Kevin revisiting two previously "third
       rail" topics, namely nofollow and certification.

       We intend to take the opportunity to meet with a number of Sponsors
       here at ApacheCon.


       EA/TAC
       ======

       While I haven't seen a final report yet for this month, I am unaware of
       any issues.


       Brand Management
       ================

       A quiet month, and no issues for the board.
       
       Thanks go out to Mark Thomas for setting up a BRAND JIRA instance.

       New members have joined trademarks@ which is good.  There has been
       little feedback on policy, which is both good and bad.

       Trademarks is continuing to look at which registrations are cost
       effective to renew.


       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Monthly Report:

       Here is a brief summary of the Foundation’s performance for FY 2017. 

       Cash at April 30th 2017 was $1,515.3K, which is down $131K from last
       month’s ending balance (Mar 17) of $1,646.3K, due to the timing of some
       Sponsor payments.   The April 2017 cash balance is down $282.4K from the
       April 2016 month end balance of $1,797.7K.  The March 2017 ending cash
       balance of $1,515.3K represents a cash reserve of 15.3 months based on
       the FY17 Cash forecast average monthly spending of $98.8K/month. The ASF
       reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of ASF’s size.

       Regarding the Cash P&L, for April 2017, Revenue was $9.1K vs a budget of
       $82.3K.  The Foundation’s total revenue YTD through April 17 was $917.6K
       which was behind the “UPDATED” budget by $171.1K.  This deficit was due
       more to timing of Sponsor payments than missing the budget.  We had
       estimated $189.8K in Sponsor payments based on the open AR as of 3.31.17
       and in May so far we have collected $105K, which will count toward FY18.
       The open AR at this point is over $626K ($105K already collected), which
       when compared to how the FY18 monthly Sponsor payments is constructed,
       if these are all collected it will cover the FY 18 Budgeted Sponsor
       revenue through Dec 2017.  So what this means is that we are well on our
       way to making our FY 18 revenue targets, as the New Fiscal Year begins

       In April 2017 expenses were over Budget by $12.2K.  This was a timing
       issue due to some publicity invoices that were paid in April vs May, as
       compared to the Budget.  With regard to YTD, we are $33.7K under Budget
       in expenses as of the end of the FY.  This is being driven by
       underspending in Prog, Fundraising, Brand, TAC, and G/A, offset by Infra
       and Publicity which were over budget, some of which again was timing.

       With regard to Net Income (NI), for April 2017 ASF finished with a
       negative $131K NI vs a budgeted negative $45.6K NI or $85.4K behind
       Budget for the month.  ASF for Fiscal 17 finished with a negative
       $267.5K NI vs a Budgeted negative NI of $130K, for a negative $137.5K
       variance to budget for FY17.  The deficit is due to a combination of
       being $171.2K under in Revenue offset by $33.7K underspending in
       expenses, to the FY 17 Budget.  So in conclusion we were very close to
       making the FY17 budgeted NI except for a few timing issues, which is a
       good way to move into FY18.

       Report from Assistant Treasurer:

       It's been a busy month with continued foundational work to change
       addresses, document accounts, improve our fundraising/accounting
       processes.  Here are some highlights.

       PayPal - We are now a registered & confirmed Charity after a long,
       arduous path.

       eBay - We are also now a member of the PayPal Giving Fund - 
       http://charity.ebay.com/charity/charity.jsp?NP_ID=1696565

       Bitcoins - Transferred from our Wallet to Coinbase.  First deposit of
       $14850 received on Tuesday, May the 16th and confirmed.  6,499.68
       expected on Thursday.  This effectively cashes in on all the bitcoins
       donated.

       Corporate Service Company - Charges us $487~ fee for service and $180~
       annual report.  This is relatively high.  Does anyone know any
       alternatives for a Delaware corporation?  Not a big spend but it tells
       me I need to start a corporate service company

       Revised Budgets for Fundraising breakdowns.  This is the amounts
       already approved just clarifying:

       Items Still Tracking:
       - Contribution Language for Car Donations
       - Payment Privacy changes to move away from Dropbox, etc.
       - We have a Safety Deposit Box still at Wells Fargo.  Working to get
       it closed out.
       - CDARS - Virtual is working towards a method to FDIC insure our
       entire balance and is researching CDARS
       - Network for Good - Missing a $125 check
       - Credit Card with a lower foreign transaction fee


    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Based on whimsy tooling, Secretary has begun to annotate accounts
       where the ICLA has gone missing and requesting infra to disable the
       accounts. If and when a replacement ICLA is filed, the account will be
       enabled.

       Secretary updated the Apache logo on the ICLA form with the new logo.
       Additionally, the options to fax or send physical mail have been
       removed from the form. These options are part of history but no longer
       have relevance.

       Secretary updated the CCLA form to remove fax and physical mail
       options, and to create a pdf form. The pdf form should be easier for
       the licensor to use than the txt document and easier for secretary to
       process.

       In April, 48 iclas, two cclas, and 64 membership applications were
       received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]



       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Business as usual this month.

       Media training returns this month at ApacheCon - our thanks go to
       Sally for offering this excellent course again.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       No significant issues this month.

       There is one open position within the team, recruiting is underway.

       There has been early progress on exploring ways to reduce the cost per
       project, this starts with a better understanding of the distribution
       of our costs across projects and services - see
       https://status.apache.org/costs/ (note this is draft data).

       Conferences
       ===========

       There are over 500 people in attendance at ApacheCon which is
       currently underway.

       Interested parties will meet to discuss the future of Apache branded
       events.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Select a replacement for VP, Legal

       With the resignation of Marvin Humphrey from VP, Legal Affairs,
       two candidates have stepped forward: Chris Mattmann and Roman
       Shaposhnik.

    B. Consider creating board-pmcs@ list
    
    C. F2F logistics in VA


    A. Select a replacement for VP, Legal

    With the resignation of Marvin Humphrey from VP, Legal Affairs, two
    candidates have stepped forward: Chris Mattmann and Roman
    Shaposhnik.

    The board appreciates that two very strong candidates for the
    position have volunteered to serve. The board came to the consensus
    that Chris Mattmann should be the next VP, Legal Affairs.

    Voting will be recorded on Resolution 7E.

    B. Consider creating board-pmcs@ list

    Several issues were raised:

    The board@ list is often used to discuss topics that while are
    relevant to the operation of the board, are not relevant to the
    majority of the subscribers.

    The board@ list is often used to discuss topics that should not be
    discussed widely and sometimes devolve into free-for-all rants.

    The board@ list should be used to solicit feedback from PMC chairs
    but in its current usage, is ineffective.

    There is consensus that splitting the board@ list into at least two
    lists is advisable: one for official board business; and one for
    discussions.

    The members@ list also suffers from a similar issue.

    @Brett: take the discussion to the board@ list (!) and recommend a
    solution.

    C. F2F logistics in VA

    Dinner on June 14 will be scheduled near the meeting venue.

    Breakfast on June 15 will be arranged at the meeting venue.

    All attendees should update their travel plans in f2f-2017.txt.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.

* OPERATIONS

A somewhat quiet month leading up to ApacheCon.

Promoted the merchandising policy approved - there is clearly interest in a
variety of places for using Apache brands on non-computer swag:

  https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/merchandise

Thanks to Mark Thomas for the new private BRAND JIRA instance, which we have
not quite started using. 

Media queries (i.e. to use our brands in television, movies, and the like)
were received for Tomcat and OpenOffice and approved.

Several new members have joined trademarks@ recently, which is great; however
sadly there is still very little feedback to policy change proposals, like one
Rich brought forth for events. 

* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

A large number of international registrations are coming up for renewal with
some project(s), in many cases with additional and more complex costs.  We
will work with the relevant PMC(s) to discuss which registrations are cost
effective to renew.

Held a telecon with a commercial company where a potential conflict existed,
and came to a satisfactory verbal agreement that allows a peaceful
coexistence.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Requests:

#1 - Confirm that Fundraising is a President's Committee.  As of this
meeting, the official members are Tom Pappas, Kevin A. McGrail & Sally
Khudairi as well as possibly Jim Jagielski & Hadrian Zbarcea.  We are looking
for more people to help give a face to sponsors with the foundation.

#2 - The ASF could benefit greatly from performing work such as
certification, training, bug bounties, etc.  However, I understand the
reticence to doing so.  Therefore, I'd like to put forth this basic framework
that I feel could meet the Apache Way and explore these opportunities.

There are numerous opportunities that have arisen concerning providing
services, training and certification.  These opportunities are not consistent
with the foundation's mission and structure.

Specifically, right now, we are evaluating a request "to A) create highly
credible course content by branding it and B) working with Apache to promote
that content."  This is difficult to do under the ASF for a variety of good
and credible reasons.

As such, I propose a related but 3rd party corporation is started with the
following minimal framework that is needed to take things further.  I would
ask the board to vote on this concept because even if it is a no vote, it
will be nice to document it at the highest level and agree to disagree!

- The creation of a new entity tentatively named Apache Media Corp (AMC).
  The naming is primarily for the purpose of this proposal.

- The new entity, AMC, will be founded by X & Y & Z.

- AMC will be seeking private equity investors.

- The President & Chair of the ASF will be automatically 2 of the 5 initial
  AMC Board of Director members to ensure that it follows The Apache Way.  

Further, the ASF Board shall have the right to appoint an additional AMC
board of director member for every 3 additional board members added.  This is
done for flexibility since investors may want a board seat as well and we
want investors not to be able to hijack things either!

- The ASF will license the rights to the ASF logo design and feather along
  with the exclusive right to AMC to certify products, training and
  certification for 2 years in the US and Europe in exchange for 15% of all
  income with a minimum of $20k / year for 2 years (silver sponsors)

NOTE: I ask for 2 years so we can gain commitments to do this.  I ask the
board consider that we are committed to the Apache Way and give us time to
explore what works or doesn't work.  If it does work, there is guaranteed
donations AND the ability to expand outside of thee territories.

- The AMC will exist to provide services, training, training material,
  documentation, and certify said materials.  It is anticipated we will be
  hiring existing committers to further their work and the foundation.  

- The close relationship ensures that the ASF is not providing any warranty
  or guarantee, maintains the 501(c)(3) status without concern and the AMC is
  solely responsible for materials and consideration are adequate to the Apache
  Way.

- In keeping with the Apache Way, materials generated will AT A MINIMUM be
  open sourced after a vault period not to exceed 2 years.

- The AMC will be responsible for all contractual obligations in these
  matters.

- Contracts and the existence of contracts with the AMC shall be considered
  confidential.  But the existence will always be available to board-private
  upon request to maintain transparency and that there is no illusion of
  backdoor deals regarding any projects.  

- A strict COID policy will be enacted at the AMC and any employees,
  consultants, contractors, etc. so if there is a conflict, it is fully
  required to disclose the conflict in dealings with the ASF.  NOTE: This will
  not REQUIRE abstention.  It will require disclosure.

- Please consult the ASF attorney.  A reputable, skilled attorney with highly
  relevant experience has reviewed this proposal and various ASF charter
  documentation and stated that there is nothing in the ASF charter that
  prevents this as well as nothing that stops a third party from doing most
  everything here.  The decision to set this up is completely political and not
  technical.

- 17 April 2017 --The Apache® Software Foundation Recognizes Apache
Innovations Integral to the Pulitzer Prize-winning Panama Papers
Investigation

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 147 weekly summaries published to date. We actively promoted
ApacheCon and Apache: Big Data with 247 items tweeted on @TheASF,
which has now grown to more than 41.7K followers. The professional
editing services for post-production of recordings of ApacheCon
presentations for Feathercast, will begin next week once Rich Bowen
hands over the files, with turnaround timeframe is within two weeks.
No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel. Sally
continues to tweet for the Apache Incubator, and has posted 23 items
on LinkedIn, which have garnered more than 114K collective organic
impressions over the past month.

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 6 media queries, as well as
several trademarks-related queries on Apache projects. The ASF
received 1,053 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,231. Media
coverage of Apache projects yielded 4,560 press hits vs. last month's
3,813. Sally has worked with a small handful of organizations
(including some ASF Sponsors) on correcting misleading information in
press/marketing/social media documents and promotions. For the first
time since ApacheCon Europe (Amsterdam 2009), we will be having a
journalist conducting the interview portion of Media & Analyst
Training, namely Susan Hall of The New Stack.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 1 analyst query during this
timeframe. Apache was mentioned in 22 reports by Gartner, 2 reports by
Forrester, 33 reports by 451 Research, and 7 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: the ASF Identity Style Guide
(graphics/visual/branding) is now complete and will be uploaded to
apache.org within the next few weeks. Production on all stickers and
signage for ApacheCon is complete.

IX. ApacheCon liaison: Sally will continue to work with Rich Bowen on
future ApacheCon planning/positioning. Work with Melissa Warnkin,
Sharan Foga, and Daniel Gruno on promotional materials and signage for
ApacheCon are complete and will be unveiled at the event next week.

X. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sharan Foga will be
representing the ASF at OpenExpo on 1 June in Madrid, and will be
accompanied by Ignasi Barrera and Jan Iverson, who will be providing
localized collateral for the event.

XI. Newswire accounts: we have 16 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017; any overflow needs
will link to our new contract signed that ends in December 2019.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infra is operating normally. Our main focus continues on retiring
technical debt.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Hire new person to fill the open position
- Team meetup at ACNA 2017 in Miami

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Finish puppetizing all services
- Decommission all ASF-owned hardware at OSU/OSL

General Activities
==================
Migration from OSU hosted VMs is still progressing. We've graduated 2 new
TLP in the last two weeks (CarbonData, Fineract). 

Uptime Statistics
=================
Overall, uptime met our SLA. We had some issues with web crawlers
abusing our services, which led to us having to block an entire /16
block from Digital Ocean. We are working with them to sort this out.

Our mail-archive.apache.org service (run on eos at OSU) had a hard drive
failure and was down for a few hours till we had the disk replaced. The
service is now up and running again.

Community Growth
================
This period, we've had one new contributor to our puppet repository,
as well as contributions from 9 people who contribute on a regular
basis. on the JIRA side of things, we had 23 new people interacting
with infra via JIRA, making it 23 new users, 102 regulars (people that
have contributed before and do so often), as well as 8 'returnees'
(people that have been absent for >2 years but are now contributing/
reporting again).

On a 3 month view, we've had code contributions from 19 people, of
which 13 were regular contributors and 9 were new. 73 people have worked
on or reported a JIRA ticket for the first time, while the other 184 who
worked on or reported issues had doen so before.

Cost-per-Project Reduction
==========================
Work has been done on estimating the cost-per-project for
Infrastructure. See https://status.apache.org/costs/ for details.
This is still at an early stage, and thus the figures are not
entirely accurate yet. We are working towards better managing
the documentation on time spent per project/component.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

We are in the midst of ApacheCon North America, with roughly 500
people in attendance.

There will be a meeting tomorrow (Thursday) about how to proceed with
ApacheCon events in the future.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

The review of the "Encrypted Media Extensions" recommendation concluded
with majority in favour of publication but a significant minority
objecting.

53 : Supports publication (some with suggested changes)
6  : Does not support publication, not a formal objection
30 : Formal objections

Nothing else to report.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Marvin Humphrey]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Now Apache is a CVE Candidate Naming Authority we're starting to clear
up old CVE names which were given to various TLP over the last 9 years
and that are either public and not yet at cve.mitre.org, or are not
public due to various reasons (still in progress, rejected, etc).

Stats for April 2017:

7 CVEs issued to projects (some may not be public yet).

e-mails to security@

6    Phishing/spam/proxy/attacks point to site "powered by Apache" or
      Confused user due to "Apache" mentioned in OSS licenses

-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Jeremy Hughes]

- Apache Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

- The PMC apologises for missing the April 2017 board report deadline and
offers this report to cover the period between the April board meeting
and now in addition to the months of the previous reporting period (mid
Jan to mid Apr).

## Issues:

- One issue for the Board to consider is how to add new committers when
the PMC lead is not available, see below in committer base changes.

## Activity:

- As a community we made 12 releases this quarter.
- Raymond Augé and Tom de Wolf have been voted in as new committers.

## Health report:

- The PMC were requested by the board to consider if there are any
potential PMC candidates among the current committers. The PMC have
invited Dominik Przybysz and will continue to consider new PMC members.
- A new contribution of CDI integration has been donated by Raymond Augé.
- The dev@ list traffic is increasing, user@ traffic has been quite low.
- The dev@ mailing list seems to be the channel most people communicate
over.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 37 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Christian Schneider on Fri Apr 10 2015
- Dominik Przybysz has accepted an invitation and is in the process of
being added

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 55 committers.
- New commmitters:
- Grzegorz Grzybek was added as a committer on Tue Feb 28 2017
- Raymond Augé was added as a committer on Mon Apr 24 2017
- Tom De Wolf was added as a committer on Wed May 03 2017
- We voted Raymond Augé and Tom de Wolf in as committers, but it took
*some time* for Raymond (already a committer) to be added to the
committer group and for Tom's ID to be created while the PMC chair was
unavailable for 4 weeks.

  In retrospect, https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newcommitter
indicates Tom could have had his ID created in the absence of the Chair:

  "...ASF member can use the same form in his/her stead. .... If the ICLA
included the PMC name, normally the account will already have been set up
in the correct LDAP group that will grant access to the project source
repository."

  But Raymond, who already has an Apache ID, couldn't be added to the
aries unix group without an action by the Chair:

  "To grant or deny access to directories in SVN, the PMC chair needs to
update the appropriate [group] entry."

  This seems like an anomaly and we'll start a discussion to see what we
can do to resolve.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description:
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data.Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Health Report:
Community activity continues to stabilize. We have added additional avenues of
test resource integration (specifically providing base Travis and CircleCI
configurations in tree) for any member in the community to take advantage of
for their personal development branches. Note that ASF Jenkins is still used
exclusively for committed code. The benefits of this have been a wider
participation from newer community members, as we are taking advantage of
"free" resources for open source projects offered by those companies for day
to day development.

Overall, we have increased our velocity over the past quarter and are closing
tickets a faster pace than the previous two quarters.

## Issues:
There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
Apache Cassandra has had the following releases:
- 2.1.17 was released on Mon Feb 20 2017
- 2.2.9 was released on Mon Feb 20 2017
- 3.0.11 was released on Mon Feb 20 2017
- 3.0.12 was released on Thu Mar 09 2017
- 3.0.13 was released on Thu Apr 13 2017

## PMC changes:
Currently 21 PMC members. No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.

## Committer base changes:

- Stefan Podkowinski was added as a committer on Sat Feb 18 2017

## Mailing list activity:
Subscriptions to the user list are off slightly but the number of messages has
increased. This could be a result of efforts to make unsubscribing from the
mail list a little easier. Dev list activity is down compared to the previous
quarter but still healthy. Note that the previous quarter can be considered an
outlier given the volume of messages during discussions of changing the
release process.

dev@cassandra.apache.org:
- 1615 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
- 515 emails sent to list (560 in previous quarter)

user@cassandra.apache.org:
- 3132 subscribers (down -10 in the last 3 months):
- 1153 emails sent to list (1115 in previous quarter)

## JIRA activity:

  The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14
  No JIRA issues opened nor resolved since last report
  No commits since last report
  There's only a little activity on both users and dev mailing-lists.

  There have been some quite interesting changes since last release, at least
  for 2.1 branch, which would deserve a release.

  In the last board report, there was concerns about the low activity and the
  community health.

  The project is actually in a very quiet state, in that there's almost no
  development activity, only bug fixes, but the project itself is very stable
  and mature and still used, according to a recent PMC discussion.

  The discussion about the future of the project periodically reappears, and it
  seems that up to now, the community is still fine with the current status.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich Stärk]

## Description:

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects



## Issues:

No issues require board attention at the moment.



## Activity:


Apache Way Track @ApacheCon
An Apache Way track has been put together for Apachecon. This is the first
time that a full track has been designed in this way and the aim is to
 have something that is portable that could be used in isolation for other
conferences or events. The 6 talks cover different aspects of the Apache Way
in a clear and logical way.

FeatherCast
FeatherCast has been re-branded as the voice of the ASF. Previously it was
informal. It is now being used Community Development as our main podcast /
news channel. In the past it has been generally used to record presentations
from events such as ApacheCon and make them available online for people who
didn't have the chance to attend, and also for general reference.  We also
share news and interviews about what is happening in our projects.

A separate FeatherCast mailing list has been setup and people that are
interested in helping are encouraged to subscribe. As part of the lead up to
ApacheCon we have been busy recording short interviews with some of the
ApacheCon and Big Data speakers. So far 10 interviews have been published
and we can follow and analyse the views to gauge the popularity of specific
topics.

A communication was sent about interviews and we have already received
feedback from people in various projects wanting an interview during
ApacheCon. FeatherCast could be a great tool to bring the projects together
and learn about each other.

Tools Inventory and Hackathon
We have started putting together a list of all the tools and applications
that the Community Development team has at its disposal. This includes what
websites (internal or external), social media accounts, or other applications
that we use, manage or are responsible for. Having this will give us greater
visibility and more flexibility to share and co-ordinate activities.

Benjamin Young has suggested a ComDev tools hackathon for ApacheCon in Miami.
The session will be used not only to get familiar with the tools and
applications, but also work on cleanup, coding and anything that can help
 make our tools more effective.

OpenExpo - Madrid
We have been offered a free booth at the OpenExpo conference in Madrid on
1st June. We have 3 volunteers including 2 Spanish speakers (Jan Iversen,
 Ignasi Barrera and Sharan Foga) who will be managing the booth. The
conference has content in both Spanish and English, though we are expecting
 that attendees will be mainly Spanish speakers. This is a new conference for
us so we will be looking to see if it is a good fit and also what we can do
to develop the Apache Spanish community.

ASF on Facebook
Raphael Bircher discovered that the ASF had an automatically generated
Facebook site with over 9000 likes. Facebook automatically generates pages
for highy requested pages that don't already exist, so highlights that we
have a significant amount of followers looking for us. We have now created
our official ASF page and are focussing on actively building our following.
We are encouraging projects already on Facebook to also link to us. Thanks
to Raphael for taking this on and getting it setup.

Committer Survey Feedback
During March the detailed comments from the Committer Diversity Survey were
posted on our mailing list. We had a range of feedback from improvements for
the structure of the survey to comments about diversity and the role of the
 Apache Software Foundation itself. Some comments referred to specific
projects and these were passed onto the project PMCs. It was good to be able
to engage with our committer group and get their feedback.

We are now looking at following up on some of the ideas for improvements,
including finding a way to better inform and engage committers across all
our projects.

Apache Way Resource
A new resource is available that simply and easily explains the main concepts
of the Apache Way. The new site put together by Shane Curcuru and breaks down
the Apache Way into 6 key concepts as in an easy understandable concepts.
This is a helpful reference resource that can be used to expand our materials.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------
No changes since the last report.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Community
---------
In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC / Commit.


Releases
--------
Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016
Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014
Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Thomas Andraschko]

## Description:

  Apache DeltaSpike is  a suite of portable CDI (Contexts & Dependency
  Injection) extensions intended to make application development easier when
  working with CDI and Java EE.  Some of its key features include:

  - A core runtime that supports component configuration, type safe messaging
    and internationalization, and exception handling.
  - A suite of utilities to make programmatic bean lookup easier.
  - A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans
    outside of a container.
  - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
  - JPA integration and transaction support.
  - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.
  - Quartz integration

  Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing of
  your CDI enabled projects.

## Issues:

   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity:

   We are still preparing the upcoming release 1.8, which mainly consists of a
   reworked configuration API and bugfixes.  We are also discussing the change
   of the PMC chair as we agreed on yearly chair rotation.

## Health report:

   The community and developers activity was a little bit higher again.

   As already stated in the last report: The activity is quite low as DeltaSpike
   is already very stable and covers many real-life usecases.  It will likely be
   higher again if we preparing our code-base this year for Java 8 / Java EE8.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
None.
Last modified: 2013-04-08
Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
None.
Most recent addition: 2009-06-09
None on the horizon.

General status:
The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.
Still requires someone to initiate the release process.

No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

On the dev list, the only activity was related to our initial contribution
received via GitHub. This brought the issue to the fore, that our mirror
was was out-of-date. Many thanks to the PMC member who followed through
with ASF Infra to solve that and apply the patch.

Two PMC members were present during the quarter.

At this report, two other PMC members responded to my draft report.
This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
Activity: Low
3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues published:
None.

Progress of the project:

Add notes about develop-time use of Cocoon "server status" plugin.

Add the "SupportApache" image and link to Contributing page.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description:
The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model
and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to column stores,
key value stores, document stores and RDBMSs, and analyzing the data
with extensive Apache Hadoop™ MapReduce support.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Gora has seen a reasonable amount of activity. We were successful
in pushing our 0.7 release which incorporates a number of GSoC
efforts from 2016 as well as some key upgrades to various datastores to
align them with other projects.

## Health report:
The project is successfully retaining interest with several PMC/community
members VOTE'ing on our 0.7 release candidate. We've added a number of new
modules as a result of continued GSoC participation. It is probably a good
time for the community to reach back out to Apache projects and see
where else Gora can/should integrate.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description:

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, first class functional programming support
and runtime and compile-time meta-programming.

## Issues:

There are no new issues arising requiring board attention at this time. There
is one outstanding issue around better aligning the Apache Groovy website with
branding guidelines. Work has now commenced on this activity and can be
tracked via the following three Jira issues:

- GROOVY-8181: Website move - step 1:
    create new repositories for user and dev sites
- GROOVY-8182: Website move - step 2:
    populate user and dev sites splitting current content
- GROOVY-8183: Website move - step 3:
    generate user and dev sites from repo content

Of these, step 1 is complete. Step 2 has commenced. Enquires have been
made about how to do step 3 and it appears we can adapt our current
site generation scripts to work with existing Apache tools in this
area (e.g. Buildbot).

## Activity:

This quarter, 126 commits were contributed from 17 contributors including 8
non-committer contributors (6 new).

## Health report:

With the progress on the build and release aspects of the project,
our release train has increased velocity, and the community seems happy to see
us being back on track with regular releases.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Eric Covener]

## Description:

   The Apache HTTP Server Project develops and maintains an
   open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems.

## Issues:

   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 * Development pace is slow with a few notable exceptions
   (HTTP/2, security investigations)
 * Some new interest/discussion in SSL config/defaults as well as
   resynching with security@a.o CVE policy.
 * Working towards a 2.4.26 release.

## Health report:

 * Security backlog is creeping back up, most issues have some
   active engagement.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 49 PMC members.
 - Steffen Land was added to the PMC on Sun Feb 26 2017

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 119 committers.
 - New commmitters:
    - Daniel Ferradal was added as a committer on Wed Apr 26 2017
    - Steffen Land was added as a committer on Thu Feb 09 2017

 * Overall things are healthy.  Routine tickets/emails
   are being addressed in a timely manner.

 * The backlog of aged security issues has been mostly cleared out with last
   reporting periods releases.

 * Currently 116 committers.

## Releases:

 * None this period. Both trees expected next period.
 * Last Stable release: 2.4.25 on December 21, 2016
 * Last Legacy release: 2.2.32 on January 13, 2017

## Issues/Bugs:

 * 73 issues created (up 21% since last period)
 * 23 issues closed (down -66% since last period)
 *  7 people closing issues, 65 creating them.
 * Around 70% of all tickets are made by newcomers, showing a steady
   interest in the project new people (was 68% in the past cycle).

   Looking over a two year timespan, the ticket activity seems to have
   been holding steady, neither increasing nor decreasing greatly.

## Mailing lists:

   Discounting commits and bugs (see above), we had around 1,000 emails
   sent to our dev and users list this past cycle, with around 250
   distinct topics being discussed. While this is a decrease from the

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache HttpComponents Project  [Asankha Perera]

## Description:
 - The Apache HttpComponents project is responsible for creating and
   maintaining a toolset of low-level Java components focused on HTTP and
   associated protocols

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - A vote was passed to move over to Git from SVN. This will thus be performed
   in the near future
 - We are currently working on adding support for HTTP/2 protocol to HttpCore
   and HttpClient.
 - We understand that our web site could be improved to migrate away from
   XML/APT and Maven generation to something like Markdown and jekyll. This
   would be something we plan to look into in the months ahead.

## Health report:
 - Overall the project remains active. Although established in late 2007
   the project remains stable and active as seen by JIRA and Emails.
 - The number of emails could be seen as low, but it is stable like the state
   of the project, and we still have interested people joining into the
   dev list hoping to contribute, and saying so on the list.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 9 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Michael Osipov on Mon Aug 24 2015

## Committer base changes:
 - Currently 18 committers.
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Julian Sedding at Fri Sep 30 2016

## Releases:
 - HttpAsyncClient 4.1.3 GA was released on Fri Feb 10 2017
 - HttpCore 5.0-alpha3 was released on Tue May 02 2017
 - HttpClient 5.0-alpha2 was released on Wed May 10 2017

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Ignite Project  [Denis Magda]

## Description:

The Apache Ignite (TM) In-Memory Data Fabric is a high-performance, integrated
and distributed in-memory platform for computing and transacting on
large-scale data sets in real-time, orders of magnitude faster than possible
with traditional disk-based or flash technologies.

Apache Ignite (TM) provides many in-memory components to improve performance and
scalability of user applications, including in-memory data grid, in-memory sql
grid, in-memory compute grid, in-memory streaming, and more.


## Issues:

 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

 - Since the latest board report Apache Ignite community released versions 1.9
 and 2.0. Both versions gave significant shift to the overall project direction
 making it usable for a variety of new use cases thanks to SQL Grid, Machine
 Learning library and reengineered memory architecture. Read more on this there:
    * Apache Ignite 2.0:
      https://blogs.apache.org/ignite/entry/apache-ignite-2-0-redesigned Apache
    * Ignite 1.9:
      https://blogs.apache.org/ignite/entry/apache-ignite-1-9-released

- Apache Ignite is thinking of accepting a huge donation from GridGain which is
one of the project’s contributors. The donation is a distributed transactional
and fault-tolerant disk store that seamlessly integrates with Apache Ignite
memory architecture and can be enabled by a couple of configuration parameters.
If the donation is accepted, Apache Ignite can be used as memory-first SQL
database with its own distributed disk memory layer.

- The community keeps blogging actively about Ignite
(https://ignite.apache.org/blogs.html) and takes part at conferences and other
events (https://ignite.apache.org/news.html).


## Health report:

The mailing statistics, project evolvement, releases delivery and overall
community engagement shows that the state of the project is in a good shape.
However, the community has not promoted contributors to committers and
committers to PMC members for a long time. There are several candidates that
might be promoted the next 3 months.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 24 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Denis Magda on Sun Sep 27 2015

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 33 committers.
 - Igor Sapego was added as a committer on Thu Mar 02 2017

## Releases:

 - 1.9.0 was released on Tue Mar 07 2017
 - 2.0.0 was released on Wed May 03 2017

## Mailing list activity:

The number of subscribers grows steadily across the dev and user lists.
The number of discussions on both dev and user lists went up.

 - dev@ignite.apache.org:
    - 267 subscribers (up 19 in the last 3 months):

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

Incubator PMC report for May 2017

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are presently 59 podlings incubating.  Podlings executed seven releases
in April, including the first release from ODF Toolkit in a long time.  One
IPMC member stepped down in April, and two new members joined.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Larry McCay
  - Ryan Blue

  People who left the IPMC:

  - Marvin Humphrey

* New Podlings

  - None

* Retired Podlings

  - Pirk

* Podlings that failed to report, expected next month

  - Gobblin
  - Horn
  - iota
  - Joshua
  - Sirona
  - Slider
  - Tamaya
  - Toree

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - None

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  April:

  - 2017-04-01 Apache Guacamole    0.9.12
  - 2017-04-02 Apache Gossip       0.1.2
  - 2017-04-10 Apache ODF Toolkit  0.6.2
  - 2017-04-13 Apache Mnemonic     0.6.0
  - 2017-04-24 Apache PredictionIO 0.11.0
  - 2017-04-28 Apache Gearpump     0.8.3
  - 2017-04-28 Apache Juneau       6.2.0

* Legal / Trademarks

  - Podlings struggle with their first releases.  There has been growing asks
    to revisit the binaries in source releases policy as a number of newer
    build tools rely on including a small JAR to ease the build process.
    Several IPMC members have voiced interest in following up with legal in
    this area.

* Infrastructure

  - There were small hiccups with the Metron graduation that may need some
    refinement between IPMC, Infrastructure and Trademarks/Press.
  - The other graduations and Pirk's retirement went smoothly.
  - In addition, thanks to some strong collaboration with Infrastructure we
    now have a podlings [AT] incubator DOT apache DOT org to better
    communicate with the podlings as a whole.

* Miscellaneous

  - The new podling logo has been announced to all podlings.  Some have
    already implemented the new logo and it looks much better on websites.
  - The new incubator website is being worked on, slowly.  We may start by
    simply porting the existing content and then refining policies.
  - We have refined our processes to communicate out that rosters should be
    maintained in Whimsy going forward.  A formal announcement should happen
    by ApacheCon.

Edgent

Apache Edgent is a programming model and micro-kernel style runtime
that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
     around the Edgent project.
  2. Checking of all items in the project's Maturity Model
     (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/EDGENT/Apache+Maturity+Model+For+Edgent)
  3. Although not required to graduate, it might be good to attract at
     least another independent committer/ppmc member.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Three speakers will present their experience with Edgent at the
    ApacheCon North America in May 2017:

    * Video Analytics at the Edge: Fun with Apache Edgent, OpenCV and a
      Raspberry Pi - Dale LaBossiere and William Marshall, ppmc members and
      committers for Edgent.

    * Having fun with Raspberry(s) and Apache Projects - Jean-Frederic Clere.

  * Since the last report, 2 individuals have subscribed to the Apache
    Edgent dev mailing list.  There were 65 subscribers as of the end of
    April 2017.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Release 1.1.0 of Edgent as part of the Apache incubator was created on
    17 March 2017. This represented 26 bug fixes and improvements,
    including more usage examples, application autoSubmit capability to
    IotProvider, support for publishing WIoTP device events using HTTP,
    and many others.
  * According to JIRA, 33 new issues were added to the project and 81
    issues have been resolved or closed between February 2017 and April 2017.

Fluo

Fluo is a distributed system for incrementally processing large data sets
stored in Accumulo.

Fluo has been incubating since 2016-05-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make an additional release of Fluo and Fluo Recipes.
  2. Vote in a new committer.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A non-committer has made multiple code contributions to the project recently.
  We are discussing a release soon.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  A few exciting new features were added that will be in the next release :

   * Writing Fluo applications is now easier.  Users only need to configure
     a single observer provider class, instead of configuring each observer
     class separately.  This change makes it possible to use Java 8 Lambdas!
   * The scalability of Fluo was greatly improved by changing how it scans for
      notifications.  The work to find notifications was decreased from O(N^2)
      to O(N) where N is the number of nodes.
   * Multiple internal performance improvements were made.

Comments:
     Fluo is comprised of ASF "veterans" -- they operate themselves
     well. That "learn the Apache way" part of incubation was there from day #1
     because they already "got it". However, they continue to struggle to
     attract new talent (it is niche software). There have been some publicity
     efforts from the devs, but growing the podling beyond themselves has not
     yet happened nor is on the horizon, IMO.

--------------------
Guacamole

Guacamole is an enterprise-grade, protocol-agnostic, remote desktop gateway.
Combined with cloud hosting, Guacamole provides an excellent alternative to
traditional desktops. Guacamole aims to make cloud-hosted desktop access
preferable to traditional, local access.

Guacamole has been incubating since 2016-02-10.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PODLINGNAMESEARCH-120
  2. Call community graduation VOTE

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has fallen into a nice rhythm with respect to releases and has
  gone through two additional releases since last report: 0.9.11-incubating
  and 0.9.12-incubating.

  The project website has been updated with documentation covering release
  procedures, the acceptance of new committers, and handling of code review
  via pull requests. Links to relevant ASF resources for PPMC members and
  committers have also been added.

  The development community continues to be engaged on the mailing lists, and
  a new committer, Nick Couchman, has been brought onto the project as of
  2017-02-09.

  Recent discussion on the mailing lists regarding graduation readiness has
  been positive. The podling status page for Guacamole has been brought
  up to date, and the suitable name search issue has been created:

  completed: The bug tracker was transitioned to issues.apache.org,
  and the documentation now describes Apache Impala specifically, not
  any non-Apache extensions. The documentation has also been posted to
  http://impala.incubator.apache.org/docs/build/html/index.html and

Apache MXNet

MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework that allows you to define,
train, and deploy deep neural networks on a wide array of devices, from
cloud infrastructure to mobile devices. It is highly scalable, allowing for
fast model training, and supports a flexible programming model and multiple
languages. MXNet allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming
flavors to maximize both efficiency and productivity. MXNet is built on a
dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic
and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of
that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The MXNet library
is portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple
machines.

*   A list of the three most important issues to address in the move
towards graduation.

1.  Migrate code(GitHub) and website to Apache.
2.  Grow the community:
2.1 Improving documentation including APIs & Tutorials.
2.2 Improving user-experience, for example improved error messages.
3   Establish a dependable, Apache-way consistent release process.
3.1 Features: New operators requested by user community.
              Accelerate performance on CPUs and GPUs.

*   Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be
aware of:

Code and website have taken time to get moving on. The plan is to discuss
these with Apache Infra at ApacheCon and then get the code migrated in May.

*   How has the community developed since the last report.

1. The community was engaged for contributions to API documentation and
tutorials.
2. Slack channels have been created for the community to contribute
discussions to (though they need to move to the ASF Slack channel that
was recently created).
3. In the last month, excluding merges, 51 authors have pushed 165 commits
to master and 180 commits to all branches. On master, 502 files have
changed and there have been 26,246 additions and 12,188 deletions. Count of
Closed Issues = 62, Count of New Issues = 146, Count of Merged Pull
Requests = 161, Count of Proposed Pull Requests = 27.

*   How has the project developed since the last report.

On GitHub:

1. The API Documentation has improved.
2. More features (e.g. operators) requested by the user community has been added.
3. Hardware acceleration like cuDDN6 integration and MKL ML package
integration was completed.
4. A new Perl language binding for MXNet was added.
5. Apache MxNet talk at Apache BigData North America on May 18, 2017

*   How does the podling rate their own maturity.

Maturity = Low. Initial setup and adjusting community to Apache-style interactions.

Date of last release:

  No @Apache release yet.

When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

  No new committers added yet.

     Comments: The podling is planning a graduation vote soon. I have expressed
         concerns regarding community growth. There are several frequent contributors
         who were not invited to become committers until I asked about it. That said,
         I think this podling is maturing and nearing graduation.

Unomi

Unomi is a reference implementation of the OASIS Context Server specification
currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical Committee. It
provides a high-performance user profile and event tracking server.

Unomi has been incubating since 2015-10-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. New releases with extended tests and updates of used/included projects
     (Karaf, Cellar, ...)
  2. Grow up both dev and user communities. Encourage new people on the
     projects, increasing mix of features and bug fixes.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We expect traction around the coming release and new updated on the
  website (factual use cases).

  Some Unomi committers will be present during ApacheCon. We plan some
  informal discussion about Unomi and next major steps.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  After the 1.1.0-incubating release, we are now preparing 1.2.0-incubating
  release.

  We improved the tests coverage, including performance benchmark (tests
  have been performed with 5M of profiles, and 35M events for instance).

  We also plan to move 1.x series on a dedicated branch and update master to
  2.x, including major third parties updates.

Weex

Weex is a framework for building Mobile cross-platform high performance UI.

Weex has been incubating since 2016-11-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Move the whole workflow and infra into Apache (not the codebase only).
  2. Develop more contributors and committers.
  3. First Release while in Incubator.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are worried that only 1 mentor is actively helping us, as this will put
  more burden on the rest of the Incubator to approve our releases.
  Especially, most of active committers are not good at dealing with
  license-related problem.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * We voted in 3 new committer:TianYi Ma, Tancy and HaiBo Song.
  * There are 90+ new forks and 700+ new stars since last report.
  * We have encouraged people to discuss more in the JIRA and dev
     mail list. Up to now, 30 issues are reported on JIRA and 25 of them
      are resovled.
  * We have redirect github's mails to the commits mail list to have a
      clear overview of our activity  in the dev mail list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * We are trying to release 0.12 this month. Both two RCs were failed due
    to the license issue. This is major issue of project.

     commits@ makes dev@ a more pleasant space. But I still have concerns that
     a lot of discussions of what to do happens in office or other channels.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3)
specification for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout.
Scout is an implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries
1.0 (JAXR).

jUDDI
- All mailing lists have had very Low traffic this quarter.
- 3.3.4 Released Feb 11, 2017, maintenance and bug fixes.

Scout
- No release this period, no development took place.
- No JAXR related questions on the mailing list.

Last PMC addition and new committer April 3, 2013 (Alex O'Ree)

Last Release jUDDI-3.3.4, Feb 11, 2017
Next Release jUDDI-3.3.5, Planned for Aug 2017

There are no issues that require the boards attention at this time.

Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in all
likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.

There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to potential
security issues. There were no issue raised since the last report.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

# Description
The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache
Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all
REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.

# Issues
None

# Status
The Apache Knox team released 0.12.0 was release on Mar 20th with some great
 enhancements and new features, some of the highlights are:
 * Proxy support for Solr UI and API
 * Proxy support for Gremlin REST API
 * KnoxToken API for acquiring a Knox Access Token
 * Proxy support for Zeppelin UI through Knox
 * New release module for KnoxShell
 * YARN RM HA implementation for REST API and UI
 * Support for pluggable validator for Header pre authentication provider

We have continued to use the KIP-# pages to drive the primary focus of each
release and feel it is working well. The 0.12.0 release was primarily
focused on the client library and programming model for consuming REST APIs
through Knox. There had been an increasing uptake of this library and it had
become clear that it needed to mature.

We have begun discussing what needs to land in 0.13.0 and what the strategy
is for a 1.0.0 release in this timeframe. KIPs have been created for security
improvements, port-mapping for simplified URLs and refactoring for package
renaming.

The current level of collaboration is healthy and encouraging within the
community on both mailing lists and JIRAs.

# Releases
* 0.12.0: 2017-03-20 Added support for new APIs and UIs, KnoxToken API,
release module for KnoxShell, and fixed a number of bugs - through
~35 commits.

# Development Activity
* Community is working toward the 0.13.0 goals and a possible 1.0.0 release
which will continue to use KIPs to drive the release themes
* Jira: 933 total, +14 -3 (last 30 days)
* Git (Source): 10 commits over last 30 days
* SVN (Site & Docs): 2 commits over last 30 days

# Community Activity
## Membership Changes
* Sandeep More was added as a committer and PMC member on 1/20/2017.
* We continue to see a growth in contributions from the community and remain
 on the lookout for new committer candidates to emerge.

## Mailing List Activity
* user@knox: ~50 messages over last 30 days
* dev@knox: ~500 messages over last 30 days (inflated due to jenkins emails)

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Ralph Goers]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to application logging.

Currently there are no issues which require the board's attention.

- Community

Log4j 2 remains an active project. The overall community is healthy
and friendly.

"CVE-2017-5645 - Apache Log4j socket receiver
deserialization vulnerability" was fixed. The same vulnerability
was reported against Logstash. After the fix was announced a
developer from a Logstash contacted us that he was not happy
with the fix we made. The vulnerability is due to the design of
how Java handles deserialization of Java serialized oobjects. We
modified our Socket Server example to implement white listing to
prevent deserializating untrusted objects. The Logstash developer
wanted Log4j to solve the problem on the sending side. We pointed
out that this would not cure the security vulnerabilty in
Logstash as they accept Java serialized events from other sources.
We then directed him to an alternate format they could recommend
to their users instead of using Java serialized objects. We are
also planning on removing the SerializedLayout as the default for
the SocketAppender.

Log4cxx has graduated back to the Logging project.More details are in
the subproject section below.

The development mailing lists were combined this quarter so that the
PMC could stop having discussions on the private list. This has resulted
in a net loss of about 9% of the subscribers from the individual various
lists. It would seem most of those unsubscribing did not like the sudden
increase in email they were now getting since most of the dev mailing
lists were very quiet. OTOH, there has been a noticeable increase in
cross-project discussions.

In general, all subprojects are still healthy although none has grown
since the last report.

- Project Branding Requirements

All components except Chainsaw meet the branding requirements. The PMC
needs to discuss what to do about this as it appears no release will be
forthcoming.

- Last three community changes

 * Curt Arnold resigned from the PMC and as a committer on May 4, 2017
 * Thorsten Schöning was added as a committer on Mar 6, 2017
 * Jonathon Davies was added as a committer on Jan 8, 2017

- Releases
 * Log4j 2.8.1 (Feb 28, 2017)
 * Log4j 2.8.2 (Apr 4, 2017)
 * Log4net 2.0.8 (Mar 10, 2017)

- Subproject summaries

Log4j 2: Active. Several new git repos have been created for additional
components related to Log4j. Initial work to support Java 9 has begun.

Log4net: Active with 1 release within the last quarter. The project
moved from subversion to git and modified the web site to reflect the
look and feel of the other Logging project sites.

Log4cxx: Log4cxx was graduated from the incubator back to the Logging
Services project. The most active committer in the podling, Thorsten
Schöning, was added as a Logging Services committer. Another individual
has been active on the mailing list and will contribute enough to also
become a committer.

Log4php: No activity this quarter.

Chainsaw: There has been some activity with questions this quarter. However,
there is great concern that that the primary individual maintaining
Chainsaw is pointing people to his private unreleased snapshot instead
of performing a release. Otherwise, Chainsaw continues to have no activity,
and continues to not conform to the ASF branding requirements.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C#
and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==
* Finally released a beta version of 4.8.0 to the community. (Vote:
  https://s.apache.org/e5mT, passed )
* We're quickly following that up with a second beta to fix some critical
  multi threading issues (Vote currently inprogress)
* Strong community involvement to get this over the line, and lots of people
  are jumping in to give feedback on the release.
* Previously we've been asked about "strong involvement". In efforts to
  quantify that a bit, mailing list message count on dev starting in Jan: 28,
  14, 58, 167, 123 (10 days into may). Additionally, we've had several
  community members look at performance enhancements and submit PR's (which
  for us is not common).


== Releases ==
* Release 4.8.0 Beta1 - May, 2017
* Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012

== Statistics ==
* Last PMC Member added May 2017, Shad Storhaug
* Last committer added Sept 2016, Shad Storhaug

Nuget package downloads:
* Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 550,874 (up from 417,307)
* Lucene.Net.Contrib 3.0.3: 141,606 (up from 109,915)
* Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial: 12,883 (up from 11,269)
* Lucene.Net Contrib Spatial.NTS: 2,347 (up from 2,079)

As we will have 17 packages for 4.8.0 release, I'll work on a new way to
present these metrics. Currently we have about 18 downloads of the core beta
package and 9 for the various libraries that add additional features

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security
policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.7 release on
April 20, 2017.  The next major release is scheduled for August 30, 2017.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Markus Schuch on December 2, 2016.  The last
PMC member was Rafa Haro, voted in on August 31, 2015.  In response to the
Board's inquiry in February, we've been looking for PMC members and there are
some potential ones among our newer committers, but it's too soon to know yet.
Generally we like to see long-term interest in the project before we offer PMC
memberships.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been high this quarter.  Major development has been
taking place around a new user interface and the 2.7 release, which turned out
to be major for a number of reasons.  Issues reported have been largely about
refinements to some of our connectors that have a short track record, such as
the email connector.  I am unaware of any mailing list question that
has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

# Marmotta Board Report for May 2017

## Description:

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012, and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.

## Issues:

There are no major issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Still very low, but a quarter with more activity in the community, specially
regarding questions and patches. The community still struggles to find its fit
to warranty midterm viability of the project.

Therefore it is critical to find new people with the time and the ideas to
keep the project alive and being a reference in the Linked Data spectrum.
Given his contributions to the project, Xavier Sumba was invited as new
committer.

Regarding that, we have proposed to Google Summer of Code the task of
upgrading to Eclipse RDF4J. Marmotta still uses the old Sesame, and this is
critical for the future technical viability. The project received two
different proposals, accepting the one by Gustavo Mora (Ecuador).
Further details at the announcement mail: https://s.apache.org/atjc


## Health report:

The project was considered feature-complete in 3.3.0. The current release
cycle (3.4.0) focuses on refining and fixing bug, plus incorporation some
non-core new features. The development activities (issues, commits, emails)
have significantly come down in the last year.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- Last PMC addition was Mark A. Matienzo on Thu Aug 18 2016

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 13 committers.
- Xavier Sumba was added as a committer on Mon Mar 27 2017

## Releases:

- Last release was 3.3.0 on Fri Dec 05 2014

## Mailing list activity:

- users@marmotta.apache.org:
   - 113 subscribers (down -2 in the last 3 months):
   - 7 emails sent to list (4 in previous quarter)

- dev@marmotta.apache.org:
   - 100 subscribers (up 5 in the last 3 months):
   - 101 emails sent to list (31 in previous quarter)

## JIRA activity:

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache MetaModel Project  [Kasper Sørensen]

## Description:
   Providing a common interface for discovery, exploration of metadata and
   querying of different types of data sources.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Initiative started (recent week or so) to get an early version of MetaModel
   5.0 out.
 - Activity on the main @dev mailing list remains lower than it was a few
   reporting cycles ago.

## Health report:
 - The low activity is still a bit concerning. The project has certainly slowed
   down and the work to make a 5.0 release seems to have lost momentum. As a
   reaction to this there is a proposal (from myself) to release it with less
   enhancements than what was sketched in JIRA, but enough to maybe spark the
   project into life a bit.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Dennis Du Krøger on Mon Sep 05 2016

 - Last committer addition was Dennis Du Krøger at Thu Oct 15 2015

## Releases:

 - Last release was 4.6.0 on Fri Feb 03 2017

## Mailing list activity:

 - As can be seen from the stats below, the trend doesn't look good and it seems
   that several core community members are spending less time on the project now
   than previously.

 - dev@metamodel.apache.org:
    - 78 subscribers (down -3 in the last 3 months):
    - 20 emails sent to list (79 in previous quarter)

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
- Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
  formats

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- There is constant activity in commits, bugfixes, feature-work and also
  user questions.
  Work happened in areas like various ways of embedding other types of files
  in Office files, support for EMF pictures, Unicode related fixes, some Asian
  date formats and (HX)SLF file format (.ppt/.pptx) improvements.

  We released 3.16 in April and are planning for a first beta for 3.17 during
    summer.

  Long-term efforts like mass-regression-testing and high unit test coverage
  seem to begin to pay off as the number of regression bugs is small despite
  code-changes in many areas.

  Unit test coverage is key for on-boarding new developers who aren't
  familiar with all the code, working quickly to develop new features or test
  contributions by developers who do have a better understanding of the code,
  greatly simplifying pre-release testing, and reducing bugs and regressions.

## Health report:
- The last few months we saw a constant stream of new bug reports/feature
  requests which indicates that the popularity of Apache POI is still very
  good, maybe even increasing.
  However also the number of open bug-reports is increasing, many users
    posting
  requests and questions with only a handful of people actively triaging
  these reports.
  On new committers/PMC: there are currently only a few users active enough to
  discuss committership to bring on new talent.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 28 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Greg Woolsey on Wed Oct 05 2016

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 35 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Greg Woolsey at Tue Oct 04 2016

## Releases:

- 3.16 was released on Wed Apr 19 2017

## Mailing list activity:

- Mainly constant membership numbers, a few new subscribers for this
  period. POI is a mature project with a stable user/developer-base.

- dev@poi.apache.org:
   - 243 subscribers (up 4 in the last 3 months):
   - 882 emails sent to list (795 in previous quarter)

# Development:

- Following prior discussion around making the AMQP 0-x JMS client and
  Java broker independently releasable components going forward, work was
  undertaken to that end. The components were then additionally migrated
  from Subversion to individual Git repositories, now aligning all project
  components on using Git. Work continues towards a 7.0.0 broker release and
  a 6.3.0 client release, as well as bug fixes in the existing 6.x lines.

- Proton-J had its 0.18.0 and 0.19.0 releases, incorporating various bug
  fixes and improvements. Proton-C and its language bindings continues to
  see significant work implementing improved support for alternate IO level
  integrations, working toward a 0.18.0 release.

- Dispatch router had its 0.8.0 release, incorporating a significant set of
  improvements and bug fixes over the prior release. Work is now well under
  way to overhaul its IO handling, based on the work for Proton 0.18.0,
  building towards a Dispatch 1.0.0 release.

- The AMQP 1.0 JMS client had its 0.21.0 and 0.22.0 releases, incorporating
  various bug fixes and improvements since the 0.20.0 release added support
  for JMS 2.0. Additional fixes and improvements continue, with the next
  release planned in the coming weeks.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache River Project  [Patricia Shanahan]

## Description:

 Apache River provides a platform for dynamic discovery and lookup search of
 network services.  Services may be implemented in a number of languages, while
 clients are required to be jvm based, to allow proxy jvm byte code to be
 provisioned dynamically.

## Issues:

 No significant issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Significant drop in activity since February (205 emails on dev), down to 6 in
  March and 8 in April.

- Proposed Release roadmap received positive responses:

Proposed Release roadmap:
>
>  River 3.0.1 - thread leak fix
>  River 3.1 - Modular build restructure (&  binary release)
>  River 3.2 - Input validation 4 Serialization, delayed unmarshalling & safe
               ServiceRegistrar lookup service.
>  River 3.3 - OSGi support

## Health report:

 - Minimal activity at present on dev.
 - Plan to update website with more recent success stories of River deployment,
   in one large scale deployment example maintenance costs are low to non
   existance while reliability is reportedly very solid in the face of external
   system failures.  There seem to be at least four recent examples that need to
   be added to our success stories.
 - No recent commit activity, but there are plans for more work in near future.
 - Future Direction:

   * Target IOT space with support for OSGi and IPv6 (security fixes required
     prior to announcement)
   * Input validation for java deserialization - prevents DOS and
     Gadget attacks.
   * IPv6 Multicast Service Discovery (River currently only support
     IPv4 multicast discovery).
   * Delayed unmarshalling for Service Lookup and Discovery (includes
     SafeServiceRegistrar mentioned in release roadmap), so
     authentication can occur prior to downloading service proxy's,
     this addresses a long standing security issue with service lookup
     while significantly improving performance under some use cases.
   * Security fixes for SSL endpoints, updated to TLS v1.2 with removal
     of support for insecure cyphers.
   * Maven build to replace existing ant built that uses
     classdepandjar, a bytecode dependency analysis build tool.

## PMC changes:

## Releases:

 - River-3.0.0 was released on Wed Oct 05 2016

## Mailing list activity:

 - Relatively quiet in comparison to recent months, however this appears as a
   result of reaching concensus after a period of discussion.

## JIRA activity:

- Nil Activity this period.

## Addendum: Response / clarification for publication of security info.

River's existing deployments are on private networks due to some limitations
with NAT and ipv4 preventing deployment on public networks, ipv6 will allow
public network deployment (end to end connectivity is required by River), the
security fixes are required before we incorporate ipv6 support.  In practice,
most readers of dev@river.a.o understand the issue.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description:
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - There were no new releases over the last quarter. A user reported a
   documentation issue relating to thread safety that was fixed. As part of
   this some code refactoring was done to remove duplicate code from an area
   of the project.

   Some work was also done on getting the forthcoming 2.1.0 release of the Java
   library ready to work with Java 9. It is anticipated that 2.1.0 might be
   released over the next quarter, or possibly the quarter after that.

## Health report:
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC. Right now there are no obvious potential new committers for the
   project.

   We had a discussion on the private list about the future of the project.
   For now it appears the forthcoming Java 2.1.0 release might be the last
   major release in the foreseeable future, unless new contributions are made.
   We anticipate several more years at least of bug fixing maintenance however.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 6 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Marc Giger on Wed Apr 03 2013

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 16 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
 - Last committer addition was Marc Giger in July 2012

## Releases:

 - Last release was Apache Santuario XML Security for Java 2.0.8 on Mon Dec
   05 2016

## JIRA activity:

 - 2 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 2 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Bert Huijben]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library
   built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the
   default client library of Apache Subversion, Apache OpenOffice and
   mod_pagespeed.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   Some minor features were added over the last few months. Distributor
   input triggered some release script updates, but we haven't created
   a new release yet.

## Health report: 
   Activity is at a normal, fairly quiet level.

   The serf project's activity is quite related to that of Subversion
   and with that projects recent affairs we slowed more than expected.

## PMC & Committer changes: 
   Currently 12 PMC members and 13 committers. We added Evgeny Kotkov
   as Committer and PMC member this April.

## Releases:
   Apache Serf 1.3.9 was released on Thu Sep 01 2016

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   Normal slow activity.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The
base of the SIS library is modelled according international standards
published jointly by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Commits continue at the same rate (a few per days on average). We got
two Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects accepted: one for porting
Apache SIS to the Android platform [1], and one for creating a JavaFX
frontend [2]. Work from previous GSoC has not yet been fully integrated
into Apache SIS; we are in the same state than previous report in this
regard. Previous report also mentioned one possible new contributor and
we asked if he could sign ICLA, but got no confirmation yet.

We will have two talks in two Free and Open Source Software for
Geospatial (FOSS4G) conferences: a talk in FOSS4G Europe (July 19-21th
in Paris) [3] and a 20 minutes talk in FOSS4G International (August
14-19 in Boston [4]). Apache SIS is also referenced in the latest draft
of W3C Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices paper [5].

Release of SIS 0.8 (possibly renumbered 1.0) is pending release of
GeoAPI 3.0.1 by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This release has
been approved a few months ago; the delay is only due to the time needed
by OGC staff for completing other tasks before GeoAPI in their queue.
For future GeoAPI evolutions, we are trying to form a new working group
at OGC and drafted a new charter to be submitted at OGC. More news will
be posted on Apache geospatial mailing list if the group creation is
approved.

## Health report:

The project is reported healthy according the Apache Committee Report
Helper, but got no new committer in the last year. Activity on the
developers mailing list has increased thanks to Google Summer of Code
projects.

## PMC changes:

  * Currently 19 PMC members.

## Releases:

Last release was 0.7 on Fri May 27 2016. We can start the 0.8 or 1.0
release train as soon as GeoAPI 3.0.1 is released.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- The community released Apache Spark 2.1.1 on May 2nd with bug fixes for
  the 2.1 branch, and is currently voting on release candidates for 2.2.0.
  This will be a major release with various new features in streaming, SQL,
  machine learning and other areas of the project.

- We have been making significant progress to publish Apache Spark in the
  standard Python and R package repositories (PyPI and CRAN) to make it
  easier to install for Python and R users.

- We documented the "Spark improvement proposal" process described
  earlier for proposing large new features on our website. It just defines
  a short format for writing a proposal and a JIRA tag to place on such
  documents so that they can all be viewed in one place.

- The Spark Summit East conference ran Feb 7th to 9th in Boston.

Trademarks:

- We are continuing engagement with various organizations.

Latest releases:

- May 02, 2017: Spark 2.1.1
- Dec 28, 2016: Spark 2.1.0
- Nov 14, 2016: Spark 2.0.2
- Nov 07, 2016: Spark 1.6.3
- Oct 03, 2016: Spark 2.0.1
- July 26, 2016: Spark 2.0.0

Committers and PMC:

- The last committer was added on Feb 10th, 2017
(Takuya Ueshin).
- The last PMC members were added on Feb 15th, 2016
(Joseph Bradley, Sean Owen and Yin Huai).

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

We started a discussion about who is using Stanbol and encouraged the
people who actively use (and depend) on Stanbol to contribute and
become part of the developer community.

Unfortunately, the technological barrier is rather high and people
are a little bit overwhelmed with the large code base and the
number of OSGi bundles. So people need time to get familiar
with that.

This may be one reason why not much happened since then. No new
contributions from people outside the PMC were made. The PMC
itself has only one active (code) contributer over the last
months.

The PMC is aware of the situation but at the moment the lack
of time and availability of persons make it very difficult
to change something fundamentally.

However, there are at least three PMC members who are active in
a way that security issues can be handled and new releases can
be published if required.


Subscribers on the dev list: 231

Last new committer was
  Cristian Petroaca on May 7th, 2015

Last new PMC member were
  Cristian Petroaca on July 28th, 2016
  Rafa Haro on July 28th, 2016

Last stack release was:
  Apache Stanbol 1.0.0 on Oct 23rd, 2016

Last component release was:
  Apache Stanbol Partial Security Release RC2 on June 5th, 2014

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Evgeny Kotkov]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  Within this quarter, the community has been working on resolving the
  previously reported SHA1 collision issues and on preparing the first
  alpha release of Subversion 1.10.  The work is not yet complete,
  but some good progress has happened on the SHA1-related issues.
  We will continue working on these tasks in the next quarter.

  In order to improve the quality of the translations and to allow more
  people to participate in the translation process, the community has set
  up an experimental system using Transifex (https://www.transifex.com)
  for these purposes.

  There is a bit of slowdown in the commit activity and in the users@
  mailing list traffic, which has received 151 messages during these
  three months, opposed to 336 in the previous quarter.  The dev@
  mailing list is active and has received 318 messages.

  There are no new faces in the community at this time, but we would be
  happy to include such people to our community if they arrive and try
  to maintain an open atmosphere with the questions being answered and
  the feedback occurring in a timely fashion.

  Last PMC addition was in February 2017 (Stefan Hett).
  Last committer addition happened in November 2015 (James McCoy).

* Releases

  Subversion 1.8.17 and 1.9.5 were released on November 29th 2016.
  The work toward Subversion 1.10.x continues.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiriccò]

## Description:

Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities in
enterprise environments.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The last months were busy with fixes, new features and enhancements for the
stable branch, which led to the release of 2.0.3.

We received 5 final proposals for GSoC 2017 (more candidates triggered
discussions on JIRA or dev@, but did not finalize any proposal): 2 were not
considered upfront because we had only 3 mentors available, 2 were discarded
by the internal ASF ranking process, 1 was reject because the proposing
student was already accepted by another organization.

## Health report:

Discussions about new features and improvements arouse in the dev@ and still
progressing.

The increase of subscribers to both dev@ and user@, and the considerably
higher number of messages exchanged are both relevant indicators of community
health.

The number of proposals received for GSoC 2017 is another indicator that the
project looks attractive. The fact that we could not accept any proposal is
instead unfortunate, partially caused by the poor quality of some proposals
and possibly also due to the timing used in the internal process for
acceptance.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Andrea Patricelli on Thu Oct 13 2016

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
 Tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information lookup
 activities

## Issues:
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## GitHub experiment:
 - No issues to report.  The Whimsy project continues to operate with GitHub
   defacto acting as master.  Unless there is a request to continue with
   this information, my plans are to cease reporting separately on this
   unless there is something worth mentioning.

## Health report:
 - Shane became active this quarter in a big way.  Contributions ran the
   gamut from documentation to styling to minor changes to existing tools
   to addition to library functions to entirely new tools.

   So the current status is that we continue to have more than adequate
   oversight, we now have three active committers, and two to three occasional
   committers.

## Development:
 - The whimsy site was moved to a new machine, with a new version of the
   operating system, new version of Ruby, and all of the various upgrades
   this implies.  Three tools (board/agenda, roster, and secretary/workbench)
   are being held back on older versions of JavaScript dependencies pending
   further testing.

 - PMC site (whimsical.apache.org) now has content, and many of the tools
   on the whimsy site now have a more common look and feel.

 - New tool has been created to scan all of the committee (PMC and otherwise)
   sites for compliance with a number of requirements and requests.
   https://whimsy.apache.org/site/

 - New tools being explored: one to scan mailing lists and to make a
   public version of organization chart.

## PMC and committer base:
  - Currently 9 committers, all on the PMC.
  - Last addition was Craig L Russell in December of 2015.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release that integrates
Xerces-C.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Oregon State University Capstone students have been invited to contribute.
None have accepted the offer at this time.

Most activity has been through JIRA issue tracking. The email lists
have seen little activity.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.
