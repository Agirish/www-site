 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       This month, we continued discussion of ASF document retention and
       review policies.  Over the course of the discussion, it became clear
       that what we needed to start with was a set of principles on retention
       and review.  I have started work on a policy draft.  I hope to
       complete that draft in the coming month.

       I also had discussions with Sam and Tom on developing the five-year
       operating plan for the ASF.  I subsequently proposed that we break the
       planning process into an analysis phase where we focus on how we
       expect the needs (and goals) of the ASF to change over the next 5
       years and then a development phase where we build an operational and
       financial plan based on this.  Sam and I hope to complete the plan by
       year-end.  I posted a proposed analysis framework to the ASF members
       list.  Thanks to all who have provided feedback and thanks in advance
       for help and input in the plan development process.

       Sam requests that the Chair (and other interested parties)
       have a phone conversation with Greg (and others) early in the
       document retention process draft.

    B. President [Sam]

       Items requiring board attention:

         * See resolution to establish the position of VP, Sponsor
           Relations.

       Overall, expenses remain under control.  Infrastructure remains an
       anomaly (slightly running over despite being under headcount), and
       Tom and Greg are working to resolve this.

       Income remains difficult to project given that it tends to come in large
       chunks, and with timings that are impossible to pin down.  I continue to
       be mindful of the fact that we we were under revenue in FY17 by $171.2K,
       which we attributed to timing issues.  We are currently over budget by
       $244.6K, which would be excellent, but it has positively benefited from
       timing issues (in both directions).

       Phil and I had a conversation regarding revisiting our five year outlook
       by year end, a conversation that has been brought back to the members@
       list.

       Conferences and TAC remain dormant.  Other areas are running normally.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


       Mark asks has there been progress with making effective use of
       the EA. Sam responds that that is still on the todo list.

       Ross asks about infra being over budget. Mark/Tom clarified
       that this is a YTD. Tom and Greg have a meeting tomorrow to
       get to the bottom of this. Greg's initial conclusions is that
       this is a matter of front loading costs.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first five
       months of FY18. 

       Cash on Sept. 30th, 2017 was $1,737.3K, which is up $52.8K from last
       month’s ending balance (Aug 17) of $1,684.5K, due to the timing of
       some Sponsor payments and Payables released.   The Sept 2017 cash
       balance is down $49.6K from the Sept 2016 month end balance of
       $1,786.9K.  The Sept 2017 ending cash balance of $1,737.3K represents
       a cash reserve of 15 months based on the FY18 Cash forecast average
       monthly spending of $116.2K/month. The ASF reserve continues to be
       very healthy for an organization of ASF’s size, with an FY18 YE
       estimate of 11.8 month’s cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong showing
       against our FY18 Budget five months in to the year, however as I noted
       last month the timing of Sponsor payments and Payables releases plays
       a big part in how we do each month.  So, while last month we had our
       first down month of FY18, we have rebounded nicely with an above
       budget month in Revenue while expenses were down leaving us with
       another above budget month for Net Income.  Again, this is why we need
       to continue to focus on the new sponsors but we cannot afford to take
       any focus away from our existing sponsors as that was how the FY18
       budget was constructed.  The Fundraising team continues to do an
       excellent job in both areas, both new and existing.  This has us for
       revenue, $304.9K ahead of budget through Sept 2017.  So, with the
       $674.6K of Sponsor revenue received so far in the first five months of
       FY18 we are more than 62% to our budgeted Sponsor revenue goal of
       $1,084K for FY18, which is fantastic for less than six months into the
       FY.   We remain conservative in our forecasting, however for
       Sponsorship we are showing a very modest $3.6K increase over the FY 18
       Budget of $1,084K.  Where we are showing increases in the forecast is
       the $7.5K of Donations coming from Hopsie (which was not budgeted for
       FY 18) as well as Interest from our Deposits which is about $1.6K
       ahead of Budget. These three are offsetting the GSOC which was
       budgeted at $28K but only $15K had been received so far.  It is the
       one-time donations, where we are showing a $29K increase over budget
       based on actuals through Sept 17 being much higher than budget.   For
       total revenue, we are 60% ahead of budget five months into FY 18
       ($739.6K/$1,226.5K).

       YTD expenses are under budget by $28.1K.  Infra, YTD, is over by
       $10.2K (about a $6K improvement over YTD through Aug 17) and the other
       depts. combined are under by $27.9K. I have completed a review of the
       Forecast for expenses and I am reaching out to the Dept. heads
       individually now that we are five months into the FY with some
       questions regarding the remaining seven months of FY18.  Based on the
       information I receive I will incorporate it into the forecast in the
       Oct 17 close if needed.  I would still add a bit of caution that we
       are only five months into the current fiscal year so it is still early
       yet. 

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $222.1K NI vs a budgeted negative $110.9K NI or $333K ahead
       of Budget for the first five months of FY18, for Net Income.  With the
       current conservative forecasted revenue, and expenses at budget for FY
       18, we are estimating a $-138.6K negative NI for FY18 vs a budgeted NI
       loss of -$167.8K or about $29K better NI than the FY18 budget.  I
       would also like to point out that YTD 18 vs YTD 17 we are $365K ahead
       in Revenue while Expenses were only $132K ahead year over year, for a
       $233K increase in Net Income year over year ( $223K NI in FY18 vs
       <-$10K NI in FY 17.)  I want to congratulate the entire Organization
       on these very positive numbers as we start to approach the halfway
       point of FY 18 ( and better than FY 17 as well), though we do need to
       continue to keep these efforts up as we move farther into FY 18 and
       continue to give Fundraising all the support we can as we move
       forward, while keeping an eye on our expenses at the same time.

       I have been in contact with the CPA and we will be getting the Cash
       Basis Audit underway around the middle of Nov 2017.  I will keep
       everyone updated as to its progress once it starts.  Also, there is a
       meeting scheduled next week for the Treasurer’s to talk to the Bank
       that has been identified as an option for CDARS (a regulated form of
       CD laddering) which will help mitigate risk of our deposits.  We will
       keep the Board updated as to the progress in this area as well.

       We had a discussion about what a conservative estimate means
       in this context. We expect to do better than the forecasted
       deficit even with a conservative estimate, but we still expect
       to be running a deficit for this year.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       In September, 71 iclas, two cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       General
       =======

       Ross undertook a Board Service Training provided by https://boardsource.org
       and funded by his employer. This was a very useful undertaking, I
       would encourage all Officers to spend some time reviewing materials on
       this site.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       No issues requiring attention this month. 

       The team still an open headcount. 

       Budget anomalies identified last month have been resolved and we can
       now confirm that Infra a currently in good shape. This will be
       reviewed again once the open headcount has been filled and the
       associated expense is known.

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       As can be expected there has been significant interest in the Equifax
       data breach and the role Apache software had in this breach.
       Consequently it has been a busy month, otherwise mostly business as
       usual.

       VP M&P led the drafting of the ASF’s response, in coordination with
       ASF Legal counsel and Board, to the US House Committee’s panel hearing
       on the Equifax data breach.

       Also published an "Apache is Open" educational blog highlighting how
       the foundation works and the responsibilities users of our software
       have.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

Travel and illness prevented much work on long-term strategy proposals yet.


* OPERATIONS

A quieter month, but one with deeper questions.  In particular, we need more
feedback from experienced users of package managers (rpm, yum, etc.) on the
"Trademark policy vs. downstream/commercial distributions" thread, so we can
create a comprehensive brand policy about specific naming of Apache-derived
software in popular packaging formats. 

Website Analytics shows that most visitors are either direct to the URL, or
are referred by a very small number of outside postings.  This seems to
indicate that most users don't think about trademarks unless some other site
specifically sends them to our pages.

In other news, one of the largest referral sites to the brand pages came from
a "Certified Developer On Apache Spark" page at a popular website.

Similarly, clarifications on non-Apache.org domain names need to be better
shared among all projects.  Infra was helpful in providing a list of all
domain registrations the ASF holds, totaling about 50 domains.



* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

Counsel has been dealing with a higher volume of either registration/renewal
paperwork, or with a handful of complex issues or agreements relating to
applications recently which is now (after a delay due to billing cycles)
showing up in the brand spending.

KAFKA was issued a US registration.  Renewals were processed for HADOOP, FLEX.
New US applications were made for IGNITE, BEAM.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

1 - Resolution to establish VP, Sponsor Relations 

As a result of discussions in the prior board meeting, a resolution has
been drafted and placed in this month's agenda.

2 - Fundraising Policy: Who Can Sponsor the ASF? 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/18xDS-IO1TG15ZsI26Wk5aXvsRhrNLMozrHYXjyvqaVA
is now considered policy.  

3 - Discovering more about the SEO / NoFollow issue and I believe it is now
headed off.  Have spoken to Google Web Spam via John Mueller about the issue,
codified our no-follow policy, audited all sponsors, and updated the thanks
page. as well as finalized our who can sponsor the ASF.  In discussions with
the more SEO interested sponsors, it seems to be an appropriate response that
is working well.

4 - Hopsie Captcha is working well to stop fraud attempts.  They are lowering
it from 3 bad attempts to 2 and I’m considering the matter closed.

5 - Fundraising Levels as of 1/1/18 will be: Bronze: 6K / Silver: 25K / Gold:
50K / Platinum: 125K

6 - Meetings semi-monthly with Virtual continue between KAM and Lynsey.  Next
on 10/26 and thanks for Sally and Tom joining the last one to complete our
sponsor audit.

7 - Directed sponsorship is moving along well.  Assembla has agreed to be a
Bronze Directed Sponsor for the SVN hackathon.  Still working on policy and
meeting with Infra to identify all their sponsors and their levels.

8 - Attending All Things Open on ASF Behalf (I have a work conflict and
haven’t been able to pow-wow with Rich since August.  Is anyone else going?)

9 - Future or Items with no Progress to Report: Attending FOSDEM on ASF Behalf
Likely to attend Berlin Buzzwords & FOSS Backstage on ASF Behalf Sponsor thank
you / fundraising event

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule with no vendor payments
due at this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: work with ASF Fundraising continues, with
Sally Khudairi handling Sponsor engagement through the “ambassador”
program, and individual giving and donor outreach. Sally led the
drafting of the ASF’s response, in coordination with ASF Legal counsel
and Board, to the US House Committee’s panel hearing on the Equifax
data breach. She also published the “Apache Is Open.” Foundation
Statement https://s.apache.org/PIRA 

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 3 October 2017 - Response From The Apache® Software Foundation To
Questions From US House Committee On Energy And Commerce Regarding
Equifax Data Breach 
- 25 September 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
RocketMQ™ as a Top-Level Project
- 14 September 2017 - MEDIA ALERT: The Apache Software Foundation
Confirms Equifax Data Breach Due to Failure to Install Patches
Provided for Apache® Struts™ Exploit

IV. Informal Announcements: 8 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 1 “Success at Apache” blog post was published. 4
Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 169 weekly
summaries published to date. We tweeted 22 items, and have 43.9K
followers on Twitter. We posted 8 items on LinkedIn, which garnered
nearly 177K organic impressions in total.

V. Future Announcements: five announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: the past month was spent mostly in extensive
crisis communications mode, due to the Equifax data breach. We
responded to 72 media queries, with thanks to the Apache Struts PMC
and ASF Security team for their assistance with the media surge. The
ASF received 4,639 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 3,239.
Media coverage of Apache projects yielded 14,364 press hits vs. last
month's 7,634.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received no analyst queries during this
timeframe. Apache was mentioned in 3 reports by Gartner, 4 reports by
Forrester, 5 reports by 451 Research, and 12 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: Sally coordinated graphics production with Sharan Foga
and Melissa Warnkin for several promotional items to be used at
various conferences.

IX. Events liaison: aside from liaising with ComDev with external
community-focused opportunities, this has been a quiet activity area.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 5 pre-paid press releases remaining with
NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017, with any balance to be
applied towards our new contract that ends in December 2019.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infra continues to operate as expected, and there are no issues for
the President or the Board at this time.

Finances
========
Following on from last month, Infrastructure's finances are in good
shape, and running under budget on many of our cost centers. However,
we still have one open headcount with an unknown impact. We will
continue to manage against the budget.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Schedule Jira and Confluence upgrades
- Complete our LDAP system upgrade from master/master/many-slaves
  to a simpler master/few-slaves layout

General Activity
================
- Major Jenkins upgrade to the latest LTS release was completed.
- Rebuilt JIRA database, in preparation for its next major upgrade.
  The upgrade date is still unschedule, as we need to do some
  additional test runs.

Uptime Statistics
=================
No significant, unschedled downtime occurred during the past
reporting month. Our systems continue to run with high availability.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Nothing to report this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

No issues to report at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

The appeal vote on Director's decision to pubish the EME standard passed
with votes split approximately 2:1 in favor.  ASF formally abstained
(with comments).  EME has been published.

Otherwise, nothing to report.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

This month, I began an effort to cull membership to our legal-internal
list which was at 84 members, and is currently at 15 members. The
criteria for inclusion in the culling was that the membership of
the list consist of the Legal PMC, Legal VP, our pro bono counsel,
and the criteria was expanded to include ASF directors & officers
who “opted in”, and three ASF members who had been longtime Legal
contributors who requested to opt-in as well.

Shortly after the last Board meeting on 9/22/17, Facebook made a
decision to relicense the React.js framework to the MIT license
[1]. This opened up the ability for its inclusion in Apache projects.
In particular, the initial LEGAL-319 [2] issue raised by Joan Touzet
for the use of React in the Apache CouchDB project and moreover for
all Apache projects was resolved and the library can be used with
React version 16+.

There were questions surrounding the ability to import the entire
VCS history of donated software that was previously licensed under
GPLv3, per LEGAL-331 [3].  Per the discussion in that issue, there
is not a problem with importing that history, however, the important
thing is to go through the provenance of the code once Imported,
and make sure that the code that the PMC releases complies with our
legal and release policies and dependency guidance per the
legal/resolved page.  A side issue arose out of this discussion
relating to whether or not images included in said prior VCS history
that were imported were useable under fair use, as specified in
LEGAL-332 [4]. The answer to that question per Legal policy is that
such use is disallowed as outlined in the comments of LEGAL-332.

A spirited discussion was raised regarding the terms of use of the
Central repository and whether they were incompatible with the
Apache License, version 2 [5]. The recommendation from Legal is
that the ASF does not have concerns about PMCs using the Central
repo as an unofficial distribution channel relating to ASF products.
Any concerns about the use of downstream unofficial distribution
channels for ASF code should be brought up with the owners of those
channels specifically.

The Universal Permissive License 1.0 was added to the Category A
list [6].

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues

The threat of moving the project to the attic is ongoing given limited PMC
input to the project over several months. With recent board feedback
suggesting it is time again to look at moving to the attic this is being
considered as described below.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

With no real progress over recent months the PMC is in the position of
having to seriously consider a move to the attic. This has recently been
brought to the attention of the dev community shortly to give an
opportunity for the wider community to take note and react if they wish
to avert this. The PMC chair remains committed to supporting any
community move to continue development.

The user email list remains quiet; prior to the message to the dev list
mentioned above, there was only one contributor to this list since the
last report.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Jesús Camacho Rodríguez]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and
planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite, and provides a framework
for building local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica
has an independent release schedule, and since April 2017, it has its
own independent repository.


## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and
its Avatica sub-project.

Since the last board meeting, there has been one Calcite release.

Calcite 1.14.0 was released at the beginning of October. The release
included more than 60 new features, improvements and bug fixes. Among
others, the GEOMETRY data type was added along with 35 associated
functions part of the OpenGIS set. Thus, projects integrating with
Calcite can benefit from this initial spatial support. In addition,
a new adapter for Elasticsearch5 was added. The adapter was an
unexpected contribution by a new member in the community, which is
representative of the benefits of open-source software development.
On top of that, a cool new feature was added: the "sqlsh" command,
which allows you to run SQL queries against your OS from your shell!

Our community continued growing this quarter, as two new committers
(Chris Baynes and Christian Beikov) were added to the project.

Finally, there was an important presence of the Apache Calcite project
in talks at multiple events, such as FlinkForward 2017 (Berlin, Germany)
and DataWorks Summit APAC 2017 (Sydney, Australia). In addition,
Calcite (as well as other Apache projects such as Flink or Kudu) was
mentioned multiple times in the media in relation with the release of
Uber's AthenaX project[1].

Attachment R: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description: Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider component
of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: Activity this quarter centered around a few efforts: 
1) Tomee requested a “security fix” off an old (long since unsupported) branch
of CXF that incorporated a bunch of CVE fixes.  They were very helpful in 
identifying the needed commits and testing so we were able to get 2.6.17 
out for them. 
2) CXF 3.2 - this was LONG overdue (2 years since 3.1) but we finally got it
out. Now we are working on “upgrade issues” that people are reporting, but
that’s a good thing as it shows people are using it. 
3) Subprojects - with 3.2 out, we’ve been working on the Fediz and DOSGi
subprojects to get them upgraded to be based on 3.2 instead of 3.1.

## Description:

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o Derby    : a relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
              testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
              persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The Derby community is working on a new release, Derby 10.14, which
is anticipated to be released this fall.

The Derby community had one student participate in the Google Summer
of Code; the project completed successfully.

## Health report:

In general, the software in the DB project is mature and reliable,
and isn't undergoing much change. Activity continues to be low, but
stable. Periodic releases occur, primarily containing bug fixes,
and are successfully voted on.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 43 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Matthew Adams on Sun Jan 19 2014

## Committer base changes:

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Stefan Seelmann]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
- ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
            written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
            compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
            Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
- LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
            replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
            and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
            with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
            servers.
- Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
            used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
            designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
            application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
- Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
            role-based access control, delegated administration and
            password policy services with an LDAP backend.
- Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
            various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
            and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
            interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
            facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
            as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
            and mobile.
- Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
            (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.

## Issues:

In response to previous report:

rb: There's a huge gap between your committer and PMC member counts.
   Is there any chance that some of those 55 committers might be
   good additions to the PMC?

We discussed this on the private ML, but there was no obvious candidate. In
general we promote people to PMC 6 month after they became committer if they
remain active.

## Activity:

General:
- We decided to move more projects to Git/GitBox

Per sub-project activity:
- ApacheDS: Low activity
- LDAP API: Low activity: Migrated repo to GitBox
- Studio:   Good activity: Release of version 2.0.0-M13
- Fortress: Low activity
- Kerby:    Good activity: Relase of version 1.0.1
- Mavibot:  Good activity: Work on transaction support and caching

## Health report:

Overall develomment activity (commits, development related mails, resolved
issues, releases) was lower than last quarter. Two new committers were added
who contribute to Kerby. One user shows interest to contribute to Studio. 2
releases were published. The project is healthy.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 18 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Chris Pike on Wed Nov 23 2016

## Committer base changes:

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Myrle Krantz]

## Description

Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core banking as
a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable solution for
entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to offer
financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.

## Issues
- Respond to the board's question: "If Mifos I/O was always intended for
Fineract, why wasn't it part of the project from its inception?"

Before I answer, first some history about Mifos I/O:

Markus has been thinking about and planning a rearchitecting of MifosX since
before it entered incubation at Apache under the name Fineract in December
2015.  Besides his other duties he spent much of the time up till March 2016
gathering stakeholder support.

In March, the Mifos Initiative sponsored Mifos Tech Days in Amsterdam to which
all Fineract committers were invited (though not all could attend).  At that
conference, Markus introduced his architecture, and early versions of some of
the command processing code.  Videos of those talks were made and put online.

Then Markus and Myrle went into heads-down mode designing the security
concept, the accounting module, and other basic building blocks for the new
architecture. In August Mark joined us and started work on a new UI designed
to be capable of being ALV2 licensed according to the ASF's constraints,
unlike the current Mifos community app. During this period we wanted to work
with just the three of us in order to develop a clear architectural vision
before we presented it to the community. We were new to Apache (Fineract was
still in incubating), and didn't realize that we were violating the spirit of
the "no off-list communications" rule. The code we were producing is not part
of Fineract, and we never planned to introduce it without community buy-in, so
it seemed a reasonable way to work to us. Early 2017, we changed the code to a
public repository.  We did a renaming and restructuring at the same time,
during which we gave up the commit history.  For this reason, you won't see
the history before that point.

In March Markus, Mark, and Myrle switched to a new employer named Kuelap,
founded as a for-profit with the intention of making the same social mission
that Mifos pursues fiscally sustainable. We have continued to work on the
source code of Mifos I/O, preparing it for deployment.  Mifos I/O currently
consists of nearly 30 github repositories.

When we first addressed this structure on our mailing list, we understood Greg
Stein's response to be a veto against spreading code across multiple
repositories for a project.  Not long after those comments from Greg, Greg
took charge of Apache Infra.  For this reason, Myrle put careful consideration
into the question of why we actually wish to work this way and produced an
in-depth explanation which she presented at ApacheCon in November 2016 in
Seville.  Before it was clear that Apache would accept a multiple repo
approach, this was a technical obstacle to introducing the code to the
community.

In April of 2017 Fineract graduated to a top-level project at Apache.

Between the funding pressures of founding a start-up, the customer pressures
involved in pilots, and the time-pressures that graduating a top-level project
have produced, we haven't had the time to campaign for community buy-in that
we'd like.

At this point the source-code is extensive.  The community wouldn't work if we
just threw this into everyone's lap and said: "here: this is your new
code-base".  Even if we got the votes, people wouldn't be able to work
effectively.

So we're slowly trying to collect the community and help them understand the
new code well enough to make an informed decision about whether they wish to
accept it. While we have done considerable development off-list, we've been
quite open about this fact.  We are not quietly introducing off-list code into
the code-base without community buy-in.  Myrle has already made clear that she
hopes to get *all* committers on board before we begin the process of IP
clearance and code moving.

## Activity

We've added three new committers and one new PMC member. We've added new
moderators to the mailing lists.

GSoC projects have finished, and are waiting to be merged. These projects
which were led by interns on the Mifos Initiative and Apache include
two-factor authentication, a notifications framework, data import tool
enhancements, credit bureau integration, GSIM/GLIM, security fixes from static
analysis, and changes made to API structure for Swagger API documentation. 

We are looking towards participating in GCI (google code in) and digital
ocean's Hacktoberfest.

We've begun discussions on bringing the Fineract CN code into the Fineract
code base.  Kuelap is hosting a demo-server for those who want to see what it
looks like.

We're also considering a point release which will contain some of these
changes.

The Mifos Initiative has engaged a number of individual volunteers who are
working across the community on the following projects but not directly
contributing code: Denila Philip, product management volunteer, has taken over
guiding requirements and product managing the mobile money gateway which is a
critical project for Apache Fineract but has dragged on for a couple of years
and through two GSoC internship cycles. 

Ramesh Padmanabhan, an executive-level network engineer, is conducting
interviews with partners across the community to document their cloud
configuration and hosting environments to help build out toolkits,
documentation containerization and hosting of forthcoming cloud-native
architectures.

Kristen Perchal, a BCG consultant, who is conducting interviews with
individuals across the community to understand their roadmap development
process and document previous strengths and weaknesses of engagement with the
community on roadmaps to help advance a collective community-driven roadmap
process with the ongoing transitions in the software and community. 

Aditya Oturkar, a project manager at Analog Devices, on documenting
requirements for Drag and Drop/Ad-Hoc style reporting in Apache Fineract. 
Mabawonku Bolarinwa, a business analyst/microfinance practitioner from
Nigeria, on documenting the credit bureau integration requirements for
Nigeria.

## Health report

The biggest threat to our project is the long list of unmerged pull requests
on the Fineract code base.  The oldest open pull request is still from March
2016. This problem is worsening with the contributions of the recent GSoC
interns added to the "pile".  We hope that the addition of several new
committers who have experience and are still actively developing on Apache
Fineract 1.0 will lead to progress on this issue.  Avik in particular has
started reviewing and commenting on older pull requests.

While adding to the backlog of pull requests a positive sign of health in the
community are the contributions of code from a number of new partners in the
community including several modifications made by the BOWPI team from
Guatemala, GSIM/GLIM changes made by the iDT Labs team in Sierra Leone, and
changes made by R116 Solutions for Mentors International in Latin America. 

The addition of the Fineract CN code base, though not yet voted in, is also
both a sign of activity, and a contributor to the problem.  We're a small
community and only about a third of the committer base are active coders. 
Those of us who are programmers have been splitting our efforts between two
code bases.  We still need more committers.  Should we vote in the Fineract CN
codebase, we cannot afford to let pull requests there linger too.

In all though, the increase in discussion around the health of our project,
and the addition of Fineract CN indicates there is a baseline of interest by
contributors in our project that can continue to drive the project.

## PMC changes
- Currently 13 PMC members. 
- Last PMC addition was Avik Ganguly last week.

## Committer base changes
- Currently 18 committers.
- New committers:
- Avik Ganguly was added as a committer on Tue Oct 03 2017
- Ippez Robert was added as a committer on Mon Aug 21 2017
- Nikhil Pawar was added as a committer on Wed Oct 04 2017
- Santosh Math was added as a committer on Fri Aug 18 2017 plus two committers
not in the Apache records: Zayyad Said (who was voted in in March, and has not
yet returned an ICLA) and Nayan Ambali (who has provided an ICLA, but has not
yet received an Apache ID).

## Releases
- Released version 1.0.0
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/fineract/1.0.0/ on June 1, 2017.
- The Mifos Initiative has issued a Mifos X release based on the current
Apache Fineract code.

## Mailing list activity
 -  Subscriber counts to dev and user have been slightly but steadily
   increasing. The number of new subscribers who introduce themselves has seen
   a slight uptick, which is nice.
- Email counts are not completely comparable with previous quarters because in
mid-September we rearranged what e-mails are sent to which lists. Those
changes may have also driven changes in subscriber count to the issues and
commits mailing lists. Hopefully, those changes will also make our dev list
more attractive for newcomers.

- dev@fineract.apache.org:  
   - 160 subscribers (up 16 in the last 3 months): 
   - 707 emails sent to list (969 in previous quarter) 
  
- issues@fineract.apache.org:  
   - 12 subscribers (up 4 in the last 3 months): 
   - 200 emails sent to list (248 in previous quarter) 
  
- user@fineract.apache.org:  
   - 140 subscribers (up 15 in the last 3 months): 
   - 106 emails sent to list (41 in previous quarter) 

## JIRA activity
- Jira activity has been down somewhat.
- 44 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
- 20 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Fluo Project  [Keith Turner]

## Description:

 - Apache Fluo is a distributed processing system built on Apache Accumulo.
   Fluo users can easily setup workflows that execute cross node transactions
   when data changes.  These workflows enable users to continuously join new
   data into large existing data sets with low latency while avoiding
   reprocessing all data.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Continued work on supporting Mesos, Kubernetes, and Docker
 - Started work on adding explicit read locks
 - Posted multiple issues to ASF helpwanted and Hacktoberfest.  Worked with
   multiple people who responded.  For each new contributor we tweeted a
   congratulation.
 - Collaborated with Eclipse and formatter-maven-plugin communities to get
   a bug fixed in this plugin we use.

## Health report:

 - Since Sep 12
   - 39 Github pull request were created and 38 were closed
   - 43 commits from 3 committers and 4 non-committers
   - 4 new contributors

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 8 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last month

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 8 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

## Releases:

 We released a new parent pom that is used by most Apache Fluo projects.

 - build-resources-2.0.0 was released on Wed Sep 13 2017
 - fluo-parent-2 was released on Wed Sep 13 2017


-----------------------------------------
Attachment X: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Alan Cabrera]

## Description:
 Apache Geronimo delivers reusable Java Enterprise components that meet
 the needs of enterprise developers and system administrators.

## Issues:

- We are planning to sunset the existing confluence based website for
a static site generation tool, but resource constraints will
potentially make this a slow process.

## Activity:

Geronimo stays active on the specification (since we are in
Microprofile and JavaEE 8 ramp up period).

We also start to see some concrete work and discussions around
Microprofile, in particular the config API but discussions are going
on around JWT and Fault Tolerance specifications.

There are some discussion "inter-communities" to ensure we don't
duplicate too much projects at ASF (this can delay a bit some projects
but should be good for ASF as a foundation).

## Health report:
 Less dicussions on the future and more work around Microprofile as
explained above (comparatively to last report).

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Hama Project  [Edward J. Yoon]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Report from the Apache HBase Project  [Misty Stanley-Jones]

HBase is a distributed column-oriented database built on top of Hadoop Common
and Hadoop HDFS.

hbase-thirdparty is a set of internal artifacts used by the project to
mitigate the impact of our dependency choices on the wider ecosystem.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

HBase had three releases during this reporting period, including two alpha
releases working toward 2.0.0.

- HBase 1.1.12 was released on August 20.
- HBase 2.0.0-alpha-2 was released on August 20 and HBase 2.0.0-alpha-3 was
released on September 17.

In addition, hbase-thirdparty had two releases.

- hbase-thirdparty-1.0.0 was released on July 4.
- hbase-thirdparty-1.0.1 was released on August 27
   
ACTIVITY

Development toward a HBase 2.0.0 release is going well, with the third alpha
released in September, a fourth alpha coming soon, and the first beta release
around the corner. There are lots of design-focused discussions on the dev@
mailing list. As momentum builds, it is increasing overall project engagement.

HBaseCon Asia was held on August 4, and was a big success. A meet-up was held
the next day at the Huawei offices. Michael Stack wrote up a summary of both
events, including photos: https://s.apache.org/mjx8
 
The HBase project has added two new PMC members and three new committers
during this reporting period. Chunhui Shen joined the PMC on July 3, and
Chia-Ping Tsai joined the PMC on September 28. Vikas Vishwakarma and Abhishek
Singh Chouhan became committers on July 24, and Mike Drob became a committer
on July 31. 

Misty Stanley-Jones replaced Andrew Purtell as Vice President on September 18.

STATS

The dev@ mailing list saw a slight increase in membership, but a marked
increase in activity. This was due to several substantial discussions about
project health, as well as increased participation in release candidate votes
and discussion of new features and design changes.

The user@ mailing list saw a slight decrease in membership at the same time as
a significant increase in the number of discussions.

The builds@ mailing list saw a 50%+ increase in traffic, due to changes in the
testing infrastructure.

The JIRA open/close rate is significantly different from the last report.
Opened JIRAs are up 36%, and closed JIRAs are up 7%.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Gaul]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We have addressed a long-standing and unpopular compatibility issue that tied
jclouds to an old version of Guava, a library that is common in many Java
environments. The change will allow users to use the latest jclouds version
with a modern Guava version.

There has been ongoing work and discussion around object tiering and
asynchronous payloads. Although the initial contributors have not been
participating in the latest conversations, some progress has been made and
concrete proposals have been pushed as pull requests for review. We hope to
come to an agreement on the desired asynchronous behaviors and to introduce
them so users can start trying them out.

We have started validating jclouds builds against Java 9. Several issues have
been identified, and we have filed corresponding JIRA tickets to enable the
community to properly plan fixes.

There has been recent interest in the Azure ARM provider coupled with external
contributions to develop a set of new features. We hope to be able to make
these features available in the coming 2.1.0 and 2.0.3 releases soon. For the
2.1.0 release, we hope to be able to promote the provider, which has been very
stable and is being used in production, out of the jclouds "labs" repo.


== Community ==

We had one GSoC student working on implementing a portable queuing
abstraction, but unfortunately the student did not complete the goals. There
was very little interaction with the community;the code, submitted late, was
insufficient. This is the first time we have had to fail a student; we still
believe that GSoC is a positive initiative that can usefully contribute to
jclouds, however - in past years, the students have completed their projects
and their code is now part of jclouds. Getting students onboard as
contributors post-GSoC remains a challenge.

The project has seen several new issue reporters of late, but unfortunately
this has not (yet) translated into new contributors. There has been some
renewed activity on IRC, although the number of regular participants there has
decreased.

The mailing list activity has slowed down over the last quarter, but we expect
to encourage people to participate with the release of jclouds 2.1.0 and
2.0.3, and by spending more time promoting the project on social media.

There are currently 11 PMC members and 24 committers. 

Last committer: 2017-02-17 (Svetoslav Neykov) Last PMC member: 2016-10-21
(Andrea Turli)


== Community Objectives ==

*  Release jclouds 2.1.0 and 2.0.3 in 4Q2017 (slipped from previous report)
*  Promote the Azure ARM provider out of the jclouds labs repo
*  Improve project outreach and promotion on social media

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.0.2, took place on 2017-07-06.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description: 

Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues: 

No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Since the last report, we've made one minor release (1.5.0).

Development continues in the same areas as the last report: operability,
stability, security, and incremental performance improvements. We plan to
continue making minor releases with no reason for a major
(compatibility-breaking) release on the horizon.

## Health report: 

- Subscriptions to the user mailing list are up slightly over last quarter,
  but traffic down significantly. It's not clear if there is anything
  to learn from this, but we'll make sure to look over recent weeks and see
  if any questions have been going un-answered.

- Website traffic (unique user count) is down about 9% since last quarter.
  Our blog continues to be rather quiet of late -- contributors have spent
  more time on code and less on publicity. A few posts are now in the queue
  and hoping they'll bring this back up next quarter.

- Development velocity is pretty constant from last quarter measured by
  review traffic and JIRA (commits slightly down, JIRA up significantly,
  reviews about even).

- This quarter (July-Sep), we committed code authored by 24 distinct
  contributors, of whom 6 were new to the project. Similar diversity and
  growth.

  Discussion continues on the private list for new committers. The latest
  discussions were positive and seems like a vote should be called soon.

- The Kudu project has been collaborating closely with the Impala incubator
  podling community. Specifically, Impala is adopting Kudu's RPC library for
  their own internal usage. This is in addition to the actual user-facing
  integration between the projects that has been ongoing for upwards of a year.
  This has resulted in a number of new Kudu contributions from committers on
  that project.

## PMC/Committer changes: 

 - Currently 16 PMC members and committers (all committers are PMC)
 - Last committer/PMC addition: Jordan Birdsell was added on Nov 8, 2016.

## Releases: 

 - Apache Kudu 1.5.0 was released on September 13, 2017.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache MADlib Project  [Aaron Feng]

## Description:
- Apache MADlib is a scalable, Big Data, SQL-driven machine learning framework
for Data Scientists.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- Community activity related to post-graduation tasks has largely been
completed (website, wiki, ASF infrastructure, etc.)

- A MADlib community call on the topic of the 1.12 release happened on Sept 7,
2017.

- The community decided to take some of the proposed 2.0 release JIRAs and put
them into a 1.13 release to do first, targeted for November 2017. The reason
is that more time is needed to plan out the proposed interface changes for
2.0. Work on 1.13 JIRAs is in flight currently.


## Health report: The community is relatively small but very engaged with
robust mailing list traffic, interest in doing frequent releases and a bunch
of new functionality being developed by contributors. 

The number of committers actively contributing to the code/documentation has
been steady and remains at a level of half a dozen active committers each
month. 

We will constantly be on a lookout for new community members to be invited
either as committers or PMC.

## PMC changes:
- No changes in PMC, currently 13 PMC members.


## Committer base changes:

- Currently 13 committers.

    pro-bono. 
  * Work is ongoing to update the way the website is built and deployed.  We
    are working with the Apache infrastructure team to move from a custom
    process to a more standardized way of deploying the website using
    pre-built deployment templates.
* Google Summer of Code - We have enthusiastically accepted Aditya Sarma’s
  proposal to add the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, and additionally an
  alternate implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm which reduces complexity
  from O(n^2) to O(log(n) * n). 
* GSoC experience [Aditya] - I proposed to add an distributed DBSCAN
  implementation on the lines of the paper “A new scalable parallel DBSCAN
  algorithm using the disjoint-set data structure” authored by Md. Mostofa Ali
  Patwary, Diana Palsetia, Ankit Agrawal, Wei-keng Liao, Fredrik Manne, Alok
  Choudhary of Northwestern University. But it turned out that the
  distribution strategy that they have adopted does not fit well with Mahout’s
  underlying framework. So, I contributed the Sequential algorithm and am
  working on completing the RTree module (which can be used by both the
  sequential as well as the distributed algorithm). In the meanwhile, I got in
  touch with a professor from the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and her
  group worked on an approximate dbscan algorithm that scaled well. (As an
  aside, I’m planning to work on making Mahout accessible to newcomers along
  with Trevor)
* GSoC Student Aditya Sarma passed with the mentoring of Trevor Grant.

## Question asked by board to clarify from March’s board report:  


* AWS has been sending emails to private@mahout.apache.org RE: a small (~16$)
  balance.  This is due to Amazon donating 1000$ of cluster time to a project
  member, who has since taken a position with a different organization.  The
  1000$ was on a now discontinued corporate card.  We are actively working on
  getting the situation worked out (the usual large corporate SNAFU keeps this
  fix at a snail’s pace), and getting more compute time donated from AWS. 

* Resolution:  Balance has been paid, and the account moved to an active
  credit card. 

## Mailing list activity: 
  
- dev@mahout.apache.org:  
   - 918 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
   - 256 emails sent to list (582 in previous quarter)   

- issues@mahout.apache.org:  
   - 16 subscribers (up 16 in the last 3 months): 
   - 84 emails sent to list (0 in previous quarter) 


We’ve moved all Jira (including Github linked) comments from
dev@mahout.apache.org to  issues@mahout.apache.org, in order to reduce noise
on dev@mahout.apache.org and to facilitate discussion on the list. 


This move however does not account for the full dip in dev@mahout.apache.org
emails over the summer  (582 to 256).   We will be monitoring the activity on
this list.
  
- user@mahout.apache.org:  
   - 1783 subscribers (down -8 in the last 3 months): 
   - 41 emails sent to list (155 in previous quarter) 
  
As well we can see a dip in user@mahout.apache.org emails.  We will also
continue to monitor this.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

* Issues

<<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

* Activity
 
  Q3 was a lot about the next release of Maven and about Java 9:
 
  - next release of Maven
 
  September 10th a vote on Apache Maven 3.5.1 was started. It contains quite
  some bugfixes and some minor improvements. However, this release also 
  contains 2 small changes related to classloading: changed isolation of
  maven extensions and access to the application classloader as required
  when using ServiceLoaderFactories. Based on results of early testers,
  we're investigating if these changes are correct and complete. We've
  noticed some broken builds which were easy to fix because these were in 
  fact wrong plugins use of classloaders, but this leads to questions if 
  these intended fixes do more harm than good. We want to be sure we're 
  making the right decision here, which delays the release right now.
 
  We were aware that changing classloaders might impact tools. We've tried 
  to reach out to IDE developers, CI server developers, etc. but didn't 
  get the  amount of feedback we were hoping for. This may become an issue,
  because with the next major release of Maven in mind, things will change.
  For example, we're thinking of introducing an extra metadata file 
  containing dependency information. It would be good if these features
  could be discussed up front with developers from the whole Maven 
  ecosystem: we need feedback and discussion to move forward in confidence.
 
  - Java 9
 
  Maven #worksFineOnJavaNine, already for a long, long time. With the date
  of September 21 in mind, we've tried to release quite some plugins in 
  order to increase Java 9 new features support.
 
  [RS] At Java One I've received quite some compliments from key players of
  the OpenJDK jigsaw team and others (e.g. Java champions) about the work
  done to support Java 9. As the defacto build management tool, we've taken
  our responsiblities, worked close with the Jigsaw team and forced changes
  in the specifications in order to get the best (not perfect) match to
  develop with Java 9.

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description: 
 - Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to
   process and distribute data.
 - Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
   integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are
   both Java and C++ implementations.
 - Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items 
   including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi 
   and Apache MiNiFi.
 - Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting
   the NiFi classloader isolation model.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Released Apache NiFi 1.4.0 which is another very heavy feature, stability,
   and bug fix release.  It includes improvements on the web UI coming from new
   contributors which is a great sign.
 - The Apache NiFi downloads have been quite large and growing for some time.
   The groundwork to solve this is the Apache NiFi Registry effort which is 
   coming along nicely and which the foundational elements of NiFi to integrate
   with it are present.  We're probably looking at two more releases for that
   to land and for which we can drop the NiFi build size down.
 - We continue to hover around the 100 outstanding pull requests number. What
   is encouraging is we've seen an uptick in contributions both in code and
   review feedback from new community members.
 - The Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ agent has rapidly matured over the past couple of 
   months and is serving as a new source for contributions and contributors.
   
## Health report: 
 - As stated in our past report, health of the community is strong and
   indicators of strength continue trending in the right direction. Mailing
   list and JIRA activity is strong. ASF Hipchat is serving as an on-ramp for
   new users to our mailing list and JIRA systems. We continue to see new
   users and contributors.
 - The PMC and committer ranks did not grow during the reporting period. This
   is a reflection of the PMC not focusing enough on the topic though as we're
   seeing a very strong pipeline to both committer and PMC. Expect both 
   new committers and PMC members during our next reporting period.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 22 PMC members. 
 - Last PMC member added Fri May 26 2017.
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 34 committers. 
 - Last committer added Thu Jun 01 2017.
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Apache NiFi 1.4.0 was released Oct 2 2017.
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - Activity on the mailing lists remains extremely high with a mixture
   of new users, contributors, and deeper more experienced users and
   contributors sparking discussion and questions and filing bugs or
   new features.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Sathwik]

## Description: Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web
services orchestration using flexible process definitions.

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: Plan on 1.3.8 release is underway [https://s.apache.org/TMhN]

Summary of the work completed
* Finished Binary compatibility interim upgrade to Java 7.
* Finally will make it to Java 8 once below mentioned library 
 upgrades are through.
* Upgraded to JPA 2 with OpenJPA-2.4.2
* Upgraded to JPA 2.1 with Hibernate-4.3.11

Future efforts will be directed towards JDK 8 complaint.
* Were are waiting for TOMEE 7.0.4 release announcement which is

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

DESCRIPTION Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorize access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014. Release Apache Oltu
Auth2 JWT 1.0.3 on 13/02/2017
 
CURRENT ACTIVITY The activity of the project is really really low. One of the
reason is also due the fact OAuth is a protocol that is pretty stable. The
other reason is that the team members that are active are busy/demotivated.

I proposed to bring new blood in the PMC by rotating the Chair position but no
one seemed to be interested. I do not know if you want to consider the option
to move to attic or not. My personal view is that nobody of the current
PMC/committer has time/interest for this project anymore. Said that I guess
that Oltu might still used by someone out there. The problem is that even if
people created issues and even proposed patches nobody of us
(included myself) reacted to it.
 
COMMUNITY Last new addition tot the team are 2 PMC members: Stein Welberg and
Jasha Joachimsthal in June 2016  (13/06/2016)

The activity within the project starts to grow again. With the new planned
release more traffic came into different mailing lists. Limitations of
capacity of development is an ongoing concern.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

There are no current topics to be concerned with.

## RELEASES

The current release is Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3.

The next release is 4.1.4 and is planned to be published in mid October 2017.
Since the last release in Oct 2016 we have again release builds for all
platforms and languages.

Apache OpenOffice 4.2.0 is now the next goal as we want to do it also within
this year - maybe for the end of the year - to include new features and bigger
enhancements but of course also bugfixes.

## ACTIVITY

Development and Release Engineering
-----------------------------------
Currently the project is busy with the upcoming 4.1.4 release. After that
is done planning and bugfixing will switch to 4.2.0, dev builds are
routinely built and testing will be started soon. Upgrades to the build
system is ongoing.

The arrival of new developers is very low. But the current committers are
willing to help where possible. Improving the mentoring of newcomers and
expanding the capacity to address major issues is a key factor for the next
time.

Issue Tracking (Bugzilla)
-------------------------
The rate of new Bugzilla issues is decreasing and on a stable level. The
rate at which issues remain unresolved over all that time is more than 40%.
But volunteers can handle and help with the new issue reports that come in.

Downloads
---------
As of 2017-Oct-08 we have more than 227,000,000 downloads and it is at a
consistent rate with ~??,000 downloads in average per day. Windows is the
most famous platform. Then macOS and Linux are following.

Downloads regarding the country over the last 3 months are spread like the
following (source:

Branding
--------
In average there is nearly 1 request per month for use of the marks - but
it's decreasing in the last months. The same for reports about suspected
trademark misuse (or confusion about selling of Apache OpenOffice binaries,
e.g., on eBay).

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Harbs]

## DESCRIPTION 
Apache Royale is a new implementation of the principles of Apache Flex but
designed for JavaScript runtimes instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes.  Apache
Royale is designed to improve developer productivity in creating applications
for wherever Javascript runs, including browsers as well as Apache Cordova
applications, Node, etc. 

Apache Royale was approved as a new TLP in the September meeting.  Royale took
over responsibility for the code related to what was known as Apache FlexJS
from the Apache Flex community. This is our first report.

## ISSUES 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## RELEASES
- Apache FlexJS 0.8.0 was released on 6/25/17.

## ACTIVITY
- Apache Royale was approved on September 20, 2017.  There some delays getting
Royale entered in committee-info.txt in order to allow Infra to start setting
up the project.  However, at the time of this report, we believe Infra has
completed all of its tasks.

- There is quite a bit of work required to deal with the rename of the project
and a lot of progress has been made towards that goal.

- One PMC member is working on a website for the project. We expect him to
have some results to show soon.

## COMMUNITY 
The community is still working through the transition from Apache Flex to
Apache Royale.  

Currently, users@royale has 29 subscribers and dev@royale has 42 subscribers.
There has been interest from the community which might lead to new
contributors.

Future reports will contain information about:

-Last committer added
-Last PMC member added
-Latest analytics and statistics:
- Website hits per day
- Number of known installs

## TRADEMARKS 
Several PMC members wanted to allow another PMC member to use royalesdk.io
and/or royalesdk.org to externally host some content to promote Apache Royale.
Trademarks denied use of that domain name. We might revisit the topic if and
when there is a concrete reason to do so.
 
## SECURITY Nothing to report.

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
Nothing really going on at the moment. STeVe remains in hiatus till the time
of the next annual members meeting. There are no current plans to release the
STeVe codebase, although there have been a few off-list inquiries about
helping out with plugins and an overhaul of the UI. Based on this, we may be
expecting development to pick up some pace in the coming months.
  
## Health report: 
I did a check of the PMC, and we have at least 3 PMC members reporting in,
which should be sufficient oversight.
  
## PMC changes:

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON. 

The Struts team made two GA releases in the last quarter.
* Struts 2.5.13 - full GA release including bug fixes, feature enhancements
  and security fixes (2017-09-05) [1][2][3]
* Struts 2.3.34 - bug and security fix release (2017-09-07) [1][2][3][4]

Furthermore we updated a security announcement that did not imply a new Struts
framework releases [5]

At the beginning of the reporting period the team could focus on improving the
Struts 2.5 release train, leading to many improvements in the Struts 2.5.13
release.

Additionally we received vulnerability reports that lead to both integrating
security fixes into 2.5.13 and to a 2.3.34 security fix release within the
Struts 2.3 release train. Besides DoS vulnerabilities, we had to fix RCE
vulnerabilities of critical severity. Dealing with these issues went smoothly
in a timely manner.

Shortly after the said security relevant releases, US company Equifax reported
a massive data breach, potentially executed by exploiting an Apache Struts
vulnerability. Additional media coverage seemed to be blaming the Struts
project for this incident. Sally Khudairi was contacted by Reuters to comment
on this, which Sally extended to the Struts PMC. We started to work closely
with Sally, the press team, the security team and board members to establish a
communication strategy and to push out an official statement of the Struts PMC
[6].

The PMC statement was well received by the public, both in media coverage and
in getting the message across that we did a proper job at dealing with
framework security issues, while Equifax potentially missed to roll out
security updates that were provided already - an assumption that rendered
correct after Equifax admitted that a vulnerability fixed by the Struts team
in March was used to conduct the exploit in May [7]. We since got a lot of
media queries which, coordinated by Sally, were tried to be covered in a
timely manner by PMC members. Additionally, the US congress formally requested
background to support a hearing with Equifax CEO. While the request was dealt
with mainly at board and legal level, the PMC provided input for the questions
posed.

We like to thank everyone involved in dealing with this massive incident and
providing time (lots of) and advice. Especially we’d like to thank Sally
Khudairi, who did an amazing and restless job as first responder, coordinator,
author and media gateway!

No committer or PMC member was added in the last quarter. We are  watching a
potential committership candidate and we are currently voting on a possible
PMC addition. 

The last committer addition was on 2017-1-30 (Stefaan Dutry). The last PMC

Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
TinkerPop released versions 3.1.8, 3.2.6, and 3.3.0, where 3.3.0 represented
a major new release with a number of new features. As part of this release
cycle, we also offered a release candidate for a .NET Gremlin Language
Variant[2], which should further expose TinkerPop beyond the Java
ecosystem.

Release 3.1.8 will be the last release on the 3.1.x line, leaving the
community to focus efforts on maintaining 3.2.x and 3.3.x areas of
development.

In the wider TinkerPop community, it was announced that Apache S2Graph[1]
implemented support for TinkerPop as part of their recent release. The
community was also pleased to see that Apache TinkerPop had won a 2017
Bossie Award in the "Best Databases and Analytics Tools" category[3] which
covered InfoWorld's picks for the "best open source software for
large-scale search, SQL, NoSQL, and streaming analytics".

Xerces-J

No development activity over the reporting period, though there was some
discussion on defects/patches in JIRA and a possible release date for Xerces-J
2.12.0. We made another appeal on the development mailing list for the
community to get more involved in the project. No one has responded to that
yet.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; roughly 65+ posts on the j-dev and
j-users lists since the beginning of May 2017.

No new releases since the previous report. The latest release is Xerces-J
2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

a new feature to support the CMake build system.

Mailing list traffic has been high; roughly 500+ posts on the c-dev and
c-users lists since the beginning of May 2017.

The latest release is Xerces-C 3.2.0 (August 28th, 2017).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

- Only that chasing the SGAs down is going to take some time, though
this may be typical.

How has the community developed since the last report?

- Users:
(1) The Open Grid Forum's DFDL workgroup mailing list has had inquiries
and questions about Daffodil - using it and creating DFDL schemas.
We will start redirecting such to our incubator users mailing list,
as soon as we're ready.
(2) A large software company has demonstrated a prototype integration of
Daffodil into their commercial product. Of note: they did this without
any support contact to Daffodil developers.

- Developers/Contributors: One new outside developer has been setup, and has
started a project modifying the Daffodil code-base. This is still in the pre-Apache
context, and we've no idea if they'll want to contribute back. But it does show
both interest and that the technical barriers to entry for new developers to be
productive are surmountable.

How has the project developed since the last report?

- A final consistent release/build of the legacy (pre-Apache) code-base
is over, all project efforts going forward can be Apache focused
once we have infrastructure setup.
- Progress is being made on obtaining the individual and organizational
SGAs.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Positive IPMC recommendation vote for graduation
  2. Address any IPMC feedback regarding graduation
  3. Continue releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  johndament: The podling is attempting to graduate, however there are some concerns raised within the discussion over how big the actual PMC is.  There have also been concerns raised over the removal of committer status.

--------------------
FreeMarker

FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text output
based on templates. FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class library for
programmers.

FreeMarker has been incubating since 2015-07-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  We have a large user base but a rather small group of committers.
  This was actually expected, given the maturity (and topic) of the project.
  While the FreeMarker 3 branch, which was started 8 month ago, will be much
  more appealing for contributors, development and growth due to that will
  certainly take a long time. In other respects the project is mature and
  ready for graduation.
  
Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are eager to graduate but we're afraid that the number of active
  contributors will prevent that in the foreseeable future. But remaining in
  the incubator for serveral years is obviosly a problem as well.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There were no changes since the last report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Most activity was in the FreeMarker 3 branch.
  The FreeMarker 2 branch was less active, but had some fixes and new features.
  At the moment we are nearing the next release from the 2 branch.

Milagro

The below report was submitted by Milagro, however not signed off.  The content and feedback is worth including.

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Improve project communication
  2. Define clear commit guidelines
  3. Building the Milagro community – engaging developers and cryptographers,
     raising awareness and helping to secure future of internet.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We moved all of the crypto code to a new organisation on GitHub called milagro-crypto ( https://github.com/milagro-crypto ).
It is hoped this will enable further engagement with the community and specifically their involvement in developing the crypto code in other languages.
  Since the last report, two new committers were added.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The development was focused on Milagro Crypto C and Milagro Crypto JavaScript. Milgaro can now support multiple curves and security levels in a single binary.

MXNet

Apache MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework that allows you to define, train, and deploy deep neural networks on a wide array of devices, from cloud infrastructure to mobile devices. It is highly scalable, allowing for fast model training, and supports a flexible programming model and multiple languages. MXNet allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming flavors to maximize both efficiency and productivity. MXNet is built on a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The MXNet library is portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.


Apache MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

The most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Establish a predictable release process consistent with Apache Way -- Ongoing.
  2. Grow the Community - Ongoing 
  3. Update project website to Apache standards - In Progress
  4. Identify remaining ICLAs and SGAs that need to be addressed - in progress

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  johndament: The podling has come under fire recently for what is perceived to be an over abundant amount of requests coming from non-committers.  If nothing else, it's a sign that they are anxious to get going here at Apache and perhaps they need to look at their communication model, moving more discussion on list, as well as potentially voting in new committers.

     Comments: Some positive steps this month, activity has certainly picked up and the SVN to Git swap will certainly help things. There were plenty of +1's on the mailing list to show people are watching, but gaining active members is clearly a struggle for the project. New PMC member will help that also.

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built on
top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and query
processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across multiple nodes.
Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through SPARQL, a conventional
query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Have more releases as part of the Apache Foundation
  2. Increase diversity of contributors.

Spot

Apache Spot is a solution stack that provides the capability to ingest IT related telemetry (network flows, domain name service DNS, and proxy server logs) and provide unsupervised machine learning capabilities to identify suspicious activity.  The information is organized and presented using operational analytics so that a security analyst can investigate the most suspicious connections. Apache Spot is built on and using Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Build diverse community
  2. Continue building a strong and diverse body of PPMC members for long term project continuity
  3. Demonstrate ability to create releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
 * Recently Facebook decided to re-license React under MIT license, to enable compatibility with Apache licensed projects and many others. If there are not other indications from Incubator board we’ll call out a vote to keep it for now: https://code.facebook.com/posts/300798627056246/relicensing-react-jest-flow-and-immutable-js/


How has the community developed since the last report?

 * Committers that are specialized on Ingest functions are merging branches for Open Data Model (ODM) development.
 * Same case for views in order to simplify the process of normalization through the UI.
 * Datasets with both benign and malicious traffic have been crafted to allow community to test/evaluate ML executions, and facilitate visualization exercises when doing Threat Hunting .
 * Number of issues and discussion have increased with both feedback/RFE and bug fixes, which probes adoption, of course Community growth also consists on continue expanding the Committer baseline. 


How has the project developed since the last report?

 * The Spot project completed the first official Apache release for Spot v1.0, approved and voted by Incubator PMC.
 * Open Data Model, development efforts continue over its branch in both directions specification and code pushes.

 Comments:

 * Completion of the first Apache release was a significant milestone. The focus now needs to be converting the large number of project observers into project committers to foster a more diverse community, creating project awareness through technology blog posts, and Meetups is a significant effort that needs to happen for project evangelization

aware of?  

None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

The community took a vote and decided to move to full GitHub for source code management and to use github for issue tracking instead of Jira.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  johndament: It's great to see a community driven in person event being scheduled.  However, the podling should be cautious and ensure that all information discussed in person is brought back to the list when complete.
