    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Welcome to Ted Dunning and Phil Steitz, our new Directors elected at
       last month's annual meeting. Thanks go again to Isabel and Marvin for
       their efforts on the board over the last year, after they opted to
       stand down at this election.

       The new board met informally over a video chat recently to
       (re-)introduce each other, raise their main thoughts for the year
       ahead. Thanks to Rich for organising the video conference.

       We are currently planning a face to face meeting, which will be held
       in McLean, VA on  June 15, 2017. The agenda and attendee list should
       be finalised shortly.

       At Sam's recommendation, I'm going to try and set up some time to
       informally catch up with a few officers over video chat before that
       meeting.

       The annual meeting proceeded as usual. There was again some brief
       difficulty ensuring we had quorum for the meeting, which has led to
       further discussion on the members list about our quorum requirements
       and the activity of the membership in the meeting and voting process.
       There was also a good amount of feedback on how to better communicate
       the procedures for the meeting. I have created some scripts and
       runbooks to help with setting up future meetings, and will update them
       with some of the feedback received.

       We currently await the final membership applications before confirming
       those that were elected at the meeting.

       The following is the report I provided to the annual meeting:

       -----

       This week, we’ve celebrated 18 years of the incorporation of the
       Apache Software Foundation! Apache projects and their communities are
       the heroes of our continued success and the longevity of the
       foundation.

       Since the last Annual Members Meeting, we have added 13 new top-level
       projects: Sentry, TinkerPop, Apex, Johnzon, AsterixDB, Bahir,
       Zeppelin, Twill, Kudu, Geode, Eagle, Beam, and Ranger; which is close
       to the same pace as prior years. The Foundation has been slightly more
       proactive in retiring projects where the community is no longer
       active, with Wookie, MRUnit, Tuscany, Continuum, Etch, DeviceMap,
       Stratos and Abdera all retired to the Attic. We have also elected 58
       new members into the Foundation.

       It has been a somewhat more tumultuous year for the Foundation’s
       governance and operations, including a number of mid-term changes to
       the Board and Executive Officer roles. However, these circumstances
       have highlighted the strength of the Foundation’s structure in that
       projects were able to continue unimpeded by the needs of our
       operations.

       In 2016, we welcomed three new directors - Isabel Drost-Fromm, Marvin
       Humphrey and Mark Thomas - the most significant number of additions in
       several years. We also welcomed Ulrich Stärk as Treasurer, and thanked
       Chris Mattmann for his service to the Foundation in that role over the
       years prior.

       Later in 2016, we saw Greg Stein step down after 15 continuous years
       as a Director, to take up the role of Infrastructure Administrator,
       and we remain incredibly grateful for the work Greg has done and
       continues to do for the Foundation.

       Sam Ruby filled the vacant directors seat, only to step down a month
       later as he took on the role of President following Ross Gardler’s
       resignation. Ross then moved into the EVP role, with us gladly
       welcoming Rich back to the board after a brief hiatus. We are thankful
       for the willingness each of these members has to serve in whichever
       capacities are needed. All of these roles have required a significant
       commitment of volunteer time over the last year.

       As we approach the upcoming meeting, we thank Isabel and Marvin for
       their time as Directors, having chosen not to stand this year, and so
       look forward to more first-time Directors for the 2017-18 term.

       The changes throughout 2016 have given the Foundation a path forward
       through a difficult stage of its growth, though certainly many
       challenges lay ahead as we seek to grow to meet the needs of the
       projects that call Apache home and to sustain the Foundation for many
       years to come.

       And we do continue to grow! Not only have we increased the number of
       top-level projects, but we have now hit the milestone of 6000
       committers to Apache projects, illustrating the reach that Apache
       software has throughout the worldwide developer community.

       Throughout, we continue to hold fast to the Apache Way, even in the
       face of difficult circumstances that face some projects from time to
       time. This remains key to maintaining the unique value of the Apache
       Software Foundation.


       Sadly, we had to bid farewell to Greg Reddin of the Apache Tiles
       project, who passed away in October last year. We express our
       condolences to his wife and children, and to his colleagues among the
       Apache community.


       I now look forward to the coming year, with great anticipation for
       what the ASF might achieve, building on the many contributions that
       have come in the past 18 years and earlier. I am incredibly humbled to
       have the opportunity to have served as Chairman for some of that time
       and thank the Board for the opportunity.

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall
       =======

       My current priorities: budget, fundraising, EA/TAC, then Brand
       Management.

       We have a distressing number of instances where invoices and checks
       have not been forwarded and lost; accordingly we are seeking to update
       all of our records in places that are sources for each to be Virtual's
       address.

       A number of income and expense items are not aligned with our fiscal
       year and (both in the present and in the past) have not been paid on a
       consistent schedule.  My guidance on each is to ignore for the moment
       the arbitrary FY17/FY18 boundary and focus on getting items paid and
       received.  As we have ample reserves, don't pay taxes, and interest
       rates are low, there is no long term impact to the foundation.  In the
       short term (both this past FY and the upcoming one) this will make
       comparing budget to actuals a bit more difficult, but I believe that
       this is manageable.  Let me know if the board sees this differently.

       My thanks to the outgoing board for providing unanimous closure on
       Brand Management Policy.  My request to the incoming board is to
       continue to focus on providing clear, stable, long term guidance.

       Budget
       ======

       A draft FY18 budget has been posted for approval.  I believe it to be
       consistent with the guidance the board provided for the five year
       outlook.

       As with last year, I encourage the board to not table this as this will
       effectively result in Virtual, Inc. and the President operating with a
       shadow budget.  Tweak it as required, but I request that larger
       questions as to priorities be deferred until the point where we revisit
       the five year outlook.


       Fundraising
       ===========

       A face to face meeting was held last month.  Thanks to Capital One for
       graciously providing facilities, and to Jim for hosting.  A number of
       TODOs were created, and a number of immediate actions were taken.

       We had a soft relaunch of the Individual Giving program with a new
       https://donate.apache.org/ site, using Hopsie as our outreach platform.
       We announced our 18th anniversary and linked to the donate page from a
       number site wide and PMC specific web pages.  This was done on short
       order, but I don't believe it quite met the expectations of an annual
       fundraising drive.  We will need to evaluate the results and make
       changes.  One option to be explored: having a few individual giving
       programs throughout the year vs. an annual drive.

       we have identified and resolved a number of invoicing issues.  Tom can
       talk to both the short term actions and long term plans to prevent
       reoccurance of these problems.

       Both Virtual and HALO are making changes to provide additional
       professional support for Fundraising.  We are working to re-establish
       Fundraising as a formal committee.  Additional organization changes are
       in the works, and should be ready to announce by the next board
       meeting.

       Letters have been sent out to the contacts we have for all Platinum,
       Gold, and Silver level sponsors asking them if there is anybody that
       they would like to meet up with at the ApacheCon and Big Data
       conferences in Miami, and taking the opportunity to once again thank
       them for their sponsorship.


       EA/TAC
       ======

       Judges made their calls, and acceptance letters were sent out.


       Brand Management
       ================

       I've asked Brand Management to take re-engaging with the PMCs that
       haven't been following the Brand Management policy slowly.  I welcome
       input from the board on my prioritization of this item.


       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Report from Virtual re: Foundation’s performance through March 2017:

       Cash at March 31st 2017 was $1,646.3K, which is UP $169.9K from last
       month’s ending balance (Feb 17) of $1,476.4K, due to collection of a
       number of open Sponsorship invoices and the $75K one time donation
       from a donor who wishes to remain private.

       The March 2017 cash balance is down $198.4K from
       the March 2016 month end balance of $1,844.6K.  The March 2017 ending
       cash balance of $1,646.3K represents a cash reserve of 16 months based
       on the FY17 Cash forecast average monthly spending of $102.9K/month.
       The “Estimated” yearend cash reserve for the ASF, based on the Cash
       Forecast tab  is  also 16 months, as we are estimating a breakeven
       month for April 2017, if the estimated sponsorship payments come in
       and spending follows the estimate.  The ASF reserve continues to be
       very healthy for an organization of ASF’s size.

       Regarding the Cash P&L, for March 2017, Revenue was $295.3K vs a
       budget of $58K or $237.3K ahead of Budget.  The Foundation’s total
       revenue YTD through March 17 was $908.4K ( up $295.2K from February
       2017) and is behind the “UPDATED” budget by $98K ( a decrease in the
       deficit by $237.1K from Feb 2017 to Mar 2017).  The VP of Fundraising
       and Virtual are working on the $189.8K that remains in the forecast,
       for the rest of FY17,  with open AR of $266.8K to support this effort.
       If we collect the $189.8K it will leave us just under $6K below plan,
       for Sponsorship income,  for FY17, but $9.5K ahead of Bud for total
       Income for FY17.  Sponsor payments and Donations collected in March
       2017 were from the following sponsors: Facebook $100K, $75K private, 
       $40K Bloomberg, $40K ODPI, $20K Auto General, $12K Blue host,
       $5K Digital Brands. It was a very good month for collections and
       really caught the organization backup to “updated” Budget.

       In March 2017 expenses were Over Budget by $13.7K.  This was a timing
       issue in that Lease Web Feb and Mar invoices were paid in Mar and TAC,
       budgeted for Apr had a portion paid out early in Mar as compared to
       the Budget.  With regard to YTD, we are $45.9K under Budget in
       expenses as of the end of Mar.  This is being driven by Infra which
       was over bud by $15.3K ( in Service, Travel and Staffing).  Prog is
       under by $27.2K as is Publicity by $16.2K which may be timing of
       spending.  Tac & Conference is under by $2.9K.  Brand is under budget
       by $8.5K and Treasury is under budget by $2.7K with G&A slightly under
       budget by $1.5K and Fundraising is under by $2.3K.

       With regard to Net Income, for March 2017 ASF finished at $169.9K vs a
       budget of Minus $53.5K or $223.4K ahead of Budget for the month.  ASF
       YTD through March 17 is under budget by just $52K,  gaining more than
       $223K in Net income from the February deficit of $275K.  The deficit
       is due to a combination of being $98K under in Revenue offset by $45K
       underspending in expenses.  At this point we are estimating being
       $9.5K ahead of Budget at Year End in Net income, and Over Budget in
       Expenses by $16K or $6.5K Under Budget in Net Income for FY 17, which
       is just about on Budget if the estimated Sponsor payments come in and
       Expenses stay at the estimate for April 2017.

       Treasurer:

       Looked into Bill.com and Expensify as more permanent solutions to our expense
       process. None of them support automated reimbursements to international
       Bank/PayPal accounts though, so we would be stuck with a slightly better
       process but not painless end-to-end.

       Assistant Treasurer:

       PayPal 
       - Still for the love of Pete trying to confirm charity status with
       PayPal - This started in 2015 and continues with repeated pinging of
       PayPal. - as of 4/10, PayPal asked for more information during a phone
       call and promised to escalate it personally. As of 4/18, still
       pending.

       - Money is not being kept in PayPal and is being periodically moved to
       FDIC backed bank as previously reported.

       - We still cannot process credit cards directly as of 4/8 "Note: Live
       credentials are disabled for direct credit card processing in your
       app. We are processing your information and will email you when live
       API credentials are enabled."  4/10 update: Auto Decline - No
       information available.  Even the paypal rep was surprised how rude the
       backend group was.  Short answer, apply for PayPal Payments Pro for
       $30 a month.  Not sure Hopsie accepts that or that we need it.  From
       testing and discussions with PayPal, we likely have enough of the
       PayPal developer section completed for Hopsie to accept paypal
       donations.

       - The account is now set to Kevin A. McGrail instead of Chris
       Mattmann.  It had to be changed for Patriot Act and verification
       purposes and could not be Uli (more information about this below).


       PayPal Giving Fund
       - We were notified someone donated us $6 to PayPal giving fund. 
       Aggravating part... You must confirm your charity status... Clicking
       that is the EXACT SAME VERIFICATION ABOVE which has been stuck at the
       1-3 days mark for eons.


       Foundation Mailing Address 
       - Changing any addresses I see to 401 Edgewater Place, Suite 600,
       Wakefield, MA 01880 c/o Virtual for the Association.


       Benevity 

       - I have re-upped our benevity causes account and confirmed it worked
       with a Googler who brought it to my attention.  

       - I have jumped through the hoops for EFT - The account is now 100%
       back working


       Contributing Tweaks

       - More tweaks to www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html post ASF
       birthday.  This includes specifying benevity under corporate sponsors.
       And now that PayPal is handled by Hopsie, that link points to
       donate.apache.org.

       - And of course, the Hopsie page launched.  Thanks to Sally for
       driving this.  Small hiccups but so far working well.


       US Patriot Act Note

       - As an American corporation, we fall under various banking laws. 
       Many accounts require home address verification including names,
       identification, etc.  This requirement will make role accounts less
       and less feasible and affects accounts like coinbase, stripe, and
       paypal.  This will be a growing concern for the foundation especially
       if a non-US resident is ever considered for treasurer. No way to sugar
       coat it.  A lot of the grief I have been dealing with for the Hopsie
       launch has all resulted from the extra security checks involved.


       FY18 budget 

       - Budget for the office of the treasurer was submitted - no numbers
       have changed from the FY22 submission but the rationale for the
       numbers was added.  A Google Sheets version is available at
       https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Eatobj9_VSYq0kOS0PmaPp2QBF2B9-
       mWWwzLwCUDp8g/edit#gid=0


       More FDIC Fun
       - In order to protect our funds, I have suggested we look at
       mechanisms like CDARS which the Treasurer and Virtual will be
       handling.

       Car Donations

       - The company that does car donations for the foundation is identified
       and for future knowledge:

       http://www.donateacar.com/

       Automotive Recovery Services, Inc. Two Westbrook Corporate Center,
       Suite 500 Westchester, IL 60154 708-492-7000

       or dba Insurance Auto Auctions Centralized Support Services 69
       Hinckley Road PO Box 280 Clinton, ME 04927 800-610-0071

       centralizedSuppsvc@iaai.com

       On 4/3/17, we changed the reports to go electronically to
       contributions@apache.org.  We have asked them to review our
       information at http://apache.org/foundation/contributing.html.  They
       confirmed the email address change on 4/3.  I have repeated the review
       question on 4/8 and asked that they change the physical address to the
       401. No update from them as of 4/18.


       Coinbase

       - Working through the identify verification hurdles - At the physical
       id verification point - I uploaded my id, they said it was too blurry,
       tried to use webcam version, failed 3 times which then triggers a 24
       hour wait.  Submitted again on 4/8 - 1-3 day review theoretically... 
       4/18, still waiting...


       Wells Fargo Safety Deposit Box
       - We still have one in Orange County. Need to likely close it.  Anyone
       live near there?  Roy?

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       When the membership applications started to come in following the
       election of new members in March, we realized that the tooling was not
       in place to handle them. But thanks to heroic efforts on the part of
       Sam Ruby, the necessary tooling was put into place to handle the
       deluge of applications.

       Based on Whimsy tooling, there are a number of committers where the
       icla has gone missing. After discussion with infra, we have decided
       that accounts for committers without an icla on file will be disabled
       until such time as a new icla is submitted. The accounts will then be
       reinstated.

       In March, 81 iclas, one ccla, and one grant  were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       There have been some discussion between President/EVP and VP PR and
       Marketing in order to clarify the role as we move forwards. For the
       most part we are looking at ensuring adequate support is provided to
       outward facing parts of the foundation while not distracting Sally
       with core internal functions. At this time Sally continues work with
       Fundraising, Brand Management, Apache Incubator,
       Conferences/ApacheCon, and ComDev, and plans to increase Fundraising
       activities, and ramp down efforts with the rest during FY2018.

       In addition to the routine "business as usual" items please note the
       following:

       Sally launched the new individual giving fundraising platform in
       conjunction with announcing the ASF’s 18th Anniversary.

       Sally is exploring possible underwriters for a future event in Europe.

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       Mostly business as usual. One catastrophic failure on the Jenkins
       master, but this has been addressed and a longer term solution is
       being explored.

       The team is currently understaffed by one FTE. Recruiting is underway.

       Conferences
       ===========

       ApacheCon US is showing lower than expected registration numbers,
       though we are still a month out.

       Options for an event in the EU are being explored.

       Travel Assistance
       =================

       Applications opened on January 25th and closed on March 8th. We have
       approved 10 TACers.

                                      1,394,386


       Income targets are based on a combination of the outcome of the F2F
       and an intent that additional fundraising expenses are recovered.

       TAC budget is based on two ApacheCon in this FY.  Should we only have
       one, $25K will be unspent.

       Special Order 7F, Approve the 2018 FY ASF Budget, was approved
       by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

    G. Terminate the Apache Wink Project

       hereby terminated; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the Attic PMC be and hereby is tasked with oversight

       approved by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

Thanks to the board for last month's resolution and a focus on the future.

* OPERATIONS

A mixed month, in that while a couple of projects had good discussions about
handling reported issues themselves, it's also clear that some projects are
not aware of some obvious and well-linked-to documentation.  Ensuring enough
of our PMCs are aware of ASF-wide policies continues to be an issue.

I'll ask one last time for any feedback on proposed policy updates

- Services naming policy: https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/services

- Merchandise use policy: https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/merchandise
(public) https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/brand/merchandise.txt
(committer-only additional permissions)

While no changes have been made in event policies, the changing landscape of
major events run around some of our popular project communities means that we
will need to consider how better to serve both per-project events as well as
our own ApacheCon.  In particular, while more new events ask to use our
project's branding, two major events are transitioning away from using our
brands.

* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

Counsel continues to work slowly through existing requests or responses.

Our CASSANDRA registration was issued in the US, a great success after a long
process to secure a simple consent agreement.

IMPALA marks a new record for incoming podling with the most pre-existing
registrations transferred to the ASF, covering applications or registrations
in 7 countries.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities continue normally.

Sam provided quite a bit of details in the President report, inclulding the
fact that I decided to step down from the VP Funddraising role.

The last thing to note is the increase in collection this month that brought
us closer to our goal.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

[REPORT] ASF Marketing & Publicity - April 2017

I. Budget: Sally Khudairi has completed the FY2018 budget, and is
preparing semi-annual vendor payments (press release distribution;
clipping; analytics services) to be distributed at the start of the
new fiscal year (May 2017).

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally continues work with Fundraising,
Brand Management, Apache Incubator, Conferences/ApacheCon, and ComDev,
and plans to increase Fundraising activities, and ramp down efforts
with the rest during FY2018. She published the fifth "Success at
Apache" post https://s.apache.org/4pjM , and has confirmed authors for
the next four editions. The ASF’s Q3 Operations Summary for FY2017 was
published. Sally launched the new individual giving fundraising
platform in conjunction with announcing the ASF’s 18th Anniversary
(special thanks to Sam Ruby, Hadrian Zbarcea, Kevin McGrail, Bertrand
Delacretaz, Greg Stein, Tom Pappas, Daniel Gruno, and the team at
Hopsie for all their help). The new Apache Incubator logo is now live
https://s.apache.org/BoYy and accompanying Press Kit at
http://incubator.apache.org/guides/press-kit.html.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 28 March 2017 --The Apache® Software Foundation Announces 18 Years
of Open Source Leadership

IV. Informal Announcements: 6 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 5 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 143 weekly summaries published to date. 62 items were Tweeted on
@TheASF, which has now grown to more than 41.2K followers. Sally has
secured professional editing services for post-production of
recordings of ApacheCon presentations for Feathercast, beginning at
the upcoming ApacheCon in May (turnaround timeframe is within two
weeks for the entire project, which will relieve Rich Bowen and the
team of volunteers who usually do the work --it took 5 exhausting
months to complete the recordings for ApacheCon Europe from this past
November). No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube channel.
Sally continues to tweet for the Apache Incubator, and has posted 17
items on LinkedIn, which have garnered more than 97K collective
organic impressions over the past month.

V. Future Announcements: four announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 6 media queries, as well as
several trademarks-related queries on Apache projects. The ASF
received 1,231 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,404. Media
coverage of Apache projects yielded 3,813 press hits vs. last month's
4,687. ApacheCon received 21 press hits, which we are hoping will
increase with media activities continuing to build.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 3 analyst queries during this
timeframe. Apache was mentioned in 5 reports by Gartner, 2 reports by
Forrester, 12 reports by 451 Research, and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: work with Fran Lukesh (one of the designers who
created the new ASF logo) is at the final stages for completing the
ASF Identity Style Guide (graphics/visual/branding). Sally has
completed production for all stickers and signage for ApacheCon, and
is mid-production for graphics for the ASF Annual Report (to be
published in June).

IX. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is exploring possible underwriters for a
future event in Europe. She continues work alongside Rich Bowen and
the Linux Foundation on marketing the upcoming ApacheCon in Miami. In
addition, she is working with Melissa Warnkin, Sharan Foga, and Daniel
Gruno on promotional materials for ApacheCon.

X. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally continues to
review conference opportunities and is liaising with Rich Bowen the
best ways to address them.

XI. Newswire accounts: we have 21 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infra is operating normally, although we are sad to see one of our
teammates depart. Our main focus continues on retiring technical debt.


Finances
========
March actuals show us running about $11k over for the FY17 year. The
FY18 budget is based on recent actuals, plus increments that were not
budgeted in prior years. In particular, costs related to staffing and
increased cloud costs due to shifting away from ASF-owned hardware in
the Open Source Labs at OSU. We continue to balance our cloud leasing
primarily between LeaseWeb, AWS, Online.Net, Hetzner, and some smaller
footprints elsewhere. Each provider has individual benefits for the
type of service that we are running.


Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Hire new person to fill the open position
- Team meetup at ACNA 2017 in Miami


Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Finish puppetizing all services
- Decommission all ASF-owned hardware at OSU/OSL


Uptime Statistics
=================
Our server running the Jenkins master (crius) experienced a hard drive
failure in its RAID array. We lost no data, but the server did become
non-responsive while the array needed to be examined. "Hands" at OSL
replaced the drive with a spare that we had on-site, and a couple days
later the RAID array was back in full operation (the array is under
heavy I/O load, so the rebuild took a surprising amount of time).

We are now looking into moving the Jenkins master to cloud hardware
sooner rather than later. The hardware failure is a perfect example of
why we want to move away from our own hardware.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

ApacheCon North America is now less than a month away, and
registration numbers are very disappointing. This will likely result
in some of our more expensive activities, such as the off-site
reception, being cut, unless we have an uncharacteristic surge in
registration in the next 2 weeks.

Meanwhile, we continue to investigate a venue for a scaled-back
ApacheCon EU event later in the year.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

VP, TAC Report:

Applications opened on January 25th and closed on March 8th. We have
approved 10 TACers.

Sent email to past TACers (ACEU 15, ACNA 16, and ACEU 16) to help
spread the word (in their words as a TAC recipient) to their community
to encourage participation.

* All flights have been secured and sent to the applicants
* All visa invitation letters have been sent to the applicants
* Conference registration info has been sent to the applicants
* All rooms have been secured
* I continue to field and respond to the applicants’ queries
* Hotel invoice received today and processing for payment
* Submitting request for subsistence payment

Preliminary numbers show we are under budget.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

The HTML Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) specification came up for
review as it moves to Proposed Recommendation, which is effectively the
last stage in the W3C Recomendation process.

This has been a very controversial specification. It has become a symbol
for much wider debate around DRM.  Both sides are still a long way
apart, at least in public.

The ASF review was the option: 
"""
does not support publication as a W3C Recommendation for the reasons
cited in comments but is not raising a Formal Objection (your details
below).  
"""

with comments asking W3C to make renewed efforts to find a compromise
between the various interests, especially for security researchers and
independent implementers.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Marvin Humphrey]

The business of addressing straightforward licensing inquiries continues as
usual.

It may be time to review our ECCN procedures.  Some inquiries have gone
unanswered and some out-of-date documentation has been flagged.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Michael Wall]

## Description: 

- The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based access
control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on Google's
BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift.

our stable release lines.  Momentum on 1.7  has dropped off over time and
1.7.3 may be the final release on that line. The 1.8.1 
release was the first bug-fix release on the 1.8 line. We'll be 
continuing to try to push users to 1.8 releases (thus, the releases 
happening in close proximity) as we try to finalize what the 2.0.0 
release will look like.  

## Health report: 

- The project remains healthy.  Activity levels on mailing lists, git and 
JIRA remain constant.

In March the community released 3.7.0 of Apex Malhar library. The release adds
a number of new operators, including S3 line reader (parallel block based), S3
output for tuples and file copy, fixed length parser, Redshift output, more
accumulations for the windowed operator and improvements for performance and
scalability of windowed state management. The release also expands the user
documentation with new sections.

The community is working towards release 3.6.0 of Apex Core, which is the
stream processing engine. The previous release was 3.5.0 in December.

The next release will contain support for user defined control tuples, which
significantly simplify batch applications and window state management with
watermarks (previously to be implemented by the user in operators and
application logic).

Apex was presented at Strata Data conference in San Jose in March and Apex Big
Data World (by DataTorrent) in April. Several Apex community members will
present at Apache Big Data in Miami in May, there are also upcoming
presentations at Berlin Buzzwords and Dataworks Summit in June.

We continue to see increase in user interest and adaption, more info can be
found on the Powered By page on the project web site.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description: 
Arrow is a columnar in-memory analytics layer designed to accelerate big data.
It houses a set of canonical in-memory representations of flat and
hierarchical data along with multiple language-bindings for structure 
manipulation. It also provides IPC and common algorithm implementations.
  
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
 - CodeBase/Format: 
   - Substantial progress and a 0.2 release since last report, close to 0.3 
   - Example additions include: Large contribution of GLIB from support from new
     contributor adding support for Ruby, Lua, Go, Enhancements to HDFS support 
     including partitioned directories, clarification & improvements to Time 
     types, Tensor Flow compatibility, support for fixed with binary types, 
     Python read enhancements, Incorporation of Feather file format, and many
     other items.
   - Spark integration (https://s.apache.org/arrowspark) looks promising and 
     will hopefully expose Arrow to a large group of additional users.

 - Awareness and evangelism:
   - Talks at conferences and meetups including:
      Spark Summit East https://s.apache.org/arrowss17
      Strata San Jose https://s.apache.org/arrowstrata17
      Dataworks Munich https://s.apache.org/arrowdataworks17
      
 - Community:
   - Continued influx of new contributors. Some PMC members have been
     especially effective at engaging new communities, through discussions on
     Twitter as well as other means.
    
## Health report: 
 - Double the number of dev and issue emails over the previous quarter mean 
   that the people who are active in the community are very active.
 - At the same time, the PMC just started a discussion about how to continue to
   grow the team. There have been various casual contributions which is good but
   the core group of prolific contributors is growing slowly. 
 - We need to continue to make a concerted effort to provide example use cases
   to help more people understand and appreciate Arrow benefits.
 - We're seeing demand for this type of solution by other groups of people, 
   some inside the foundation, some outside. We're doing community outreach to 
   try to engage others but always worry about NIH thinking. Our open and
   collaborative approach to building and extending the Arrow format and 
   software will hopefully convince more people to join the project rather than 
   creating competing technologies. Only time will tell in each case.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Jesús Camacho Rodríguez]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and
planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite, and provides a framework
for building local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica
has an independent release schedule, and since April 2017, it has its
own independent repository.
  
## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and
its Avatica sub-project.

Since the last board report, there has been one Calcite release.
Calcite 1.12.0 came over two months after 1.11.0 and included 95
issues solved by 29 different contributors! In addition to general
bug fixes and improvements in the Calcite core, major highlights in
the release include support for JDK 9 and Guava 21.0, two new
adapters to allow Calcite to read data from other systems (a file
adapter and an Apache Pig adapter), and extensions and improvements
in the supported SQL syntax and functions.

While there has not been a release of Avatica since the last board
report, development is ramping down to release Avatica 1.10.0.

We reached another milestone this quarter with the creation of
an Avatica dedicated repository. Avatica has been slowly growing
inside of Calcite for many years, and led by PMC member Josh Elser,
the community took the next step to hoist the Avatica code out of the
Calcite repository into its own. The community felt like this was the
next logical step given the maturity of the project. As a part of
this separation, the PMC is also taking this time to re-evaluate the
branding of Avatica.

Our community continued growing this quarter: a new PMC member
(Michael Mior) and three new committers (Gian Merlino, Jess
Balint, and Laurent Goujon) were added to the project.

Finally, there was an important presence of the Apache Calcite
project in multiple talks at events around the world, such as Apex
Big Data World 2017 (Mountain View, CA) and DataWorks Summit EU 2017
(Munich, Germany).
  
## Health report:

Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both
Calcite and Avatica.
  
## PMC changes:
  
- Currently 16 PMC members.
- Michael Mior was added to the PMC on Tue Apr 04 2017
  
## Committer base changes:

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]

## Description: 
- The Apache Commons project focuses on all aspects of reusable Java
components.

- The Apache Commons components are widely used in many projects, both within
Apache and without. Any ASF committer can commit to Apache Commons.

- The last report was on December 21, 2016.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues that requires the board's attention this quarter. 
   
## Activity: 
 - The project is active with seven (7) releases this reporting period.

 - We released one new component: Apache Commons Text 1.0, 
   a library focused on algorithms working on strings.

 - Commons RDF has graduated from the Apache Incubator and is now a 
   component of the Apache Commons project.
 
## Health report: 
 - Most components in Commons are mature, but are still actively maintained
   (7 releases). The dev list is active. JIRA is active. Speed of responses
   to users is reasonable in most cases. We have 2 new PMC member, and
   Commons is still open to any Apache Committer.
 - Since no development has happened for a long while, the Apache Commons 
   Modeler component has been moved to dormant. No further development is 
   expected.
 - We are still experiencing some growing pains toward Commons Math 4. There
   is a backlog of issues in JIRA (not unlike other components) but no clear
   concensus in the community. Do-ocracy is likely to prevail. There is a 
   proposal on how to move the code base forward and having Math depend on 
   Commons Numbers and Commons RNG, and then dropping the corresonding
   Math code. All of which can be seen on the developer's mailing list. 
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 36 PMC members.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description: 
 Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
 and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.
   
## Issues:  
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 Activity since the most recent release (February 2017) has been focused
 on upgrading the versions of major dependencies (especially HBase and Spark)
 in preparation for a 1.0 release, which will be synced with the latest
 and greatest from downstream projects and will allow us to clean up some
 deprecated parts of the API. 
   
## Health report: 
 Although the current focus of the project is good and useful, the question
 now is what to do after the 1.0 release is complete, which brings us back
 to broader questions about the future of Crunch and how it should relate
 to similar top-level projects like Apache Beam. We'll begin this conversation
 in earnest on the dev mailing list once the 1.0 release is finished.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
 WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider
 component of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
There was quite a lot of activity on both the CXF main codebase as we start 
to prepare for 3.2.  We resolved over 300 JIRA issues, reducing the "open" count
from over 550 to about 300.  We have also started preparing releases of both
the DOSGi and Fediz sub projects as they pick up the latest CXF releases.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

## Description:

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o Derby    : a relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
              testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
              persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Activity in the DB project was at typical levels this quarter.

The JDO project is busy finalizing the content of JDO 3.2. No ship date
yet, but we have a number of features and bug fixes being actively worked.

The Derby community is hoping to mentor a student in the
Google Summer of Code, and have had several students express interest.

The Derby community continues its long-running effort to ensure
that Derby is compatible with the upcoming Java 9 release; members
of the Derby community are engaged with the Java 9 community to
test Derby using early access builds of Java 9.

## Health report:

In general, the software in the DB project is mature and reliable,
and isn't undergoing much change, so periods of low activity occur.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 43 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Matthew Adams on Sun Jan 19 2014

## Committer base changes:

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Stefan Seelmann]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
 - ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
             written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
             compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
             Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
 - LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
             replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
             and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
             with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
             servers.
 - Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
             used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
             designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
             application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
 - Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
             role-based access control, delegated administration and
             password policy services with an LDAP backend.
 - Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
             various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
             and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
             interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
             facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
             as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
             and mobile.
 - Mavibot:  An embeddable key-value database library with MVCC
             (Multi Version Concurrency Control) support.
 - eSCIMo:   An implementation of SCIM (System for Cross-domain
             Identity Management).

## Issues:

In response to previous report:

mt: I was expecting to see some reference to the Groovy LDAP API in
    this report. Please include a brief summary in your next report.

On 2016-06-28 a security vulnerability in the "Groovy LDAP API" has
been reported. The "Groovy LDAP API" was never officially released,
it was a PoC and there was no further development after 2012. However
it somehow happened that a project page and a zip archive existed.
The page stated "We do not know, whether it will become an official
project with releases and so (no official release yet)". The version
within the "groovy-ldap.zip" file was 0.1-SNAPHSOT. The following
actions were taken:
 - The zip archived was removed from the website
 - The "Groovy LDAP" website was completely removed
 - The vulnerable source code was fixed
 - The vulnerability was published to our users and dev mailing lists
The Directory PMC does not plan to release the "Groovy LDAP API". The
source will be kept in Subversion for reference.

## Activity:

General:
 - We had a discussion about moving all projects to Java 8.
 - A project blog was started at https://blogs.apache.org/directory/

Per sub-project activity:
 - ApacheDS: Low activity: Mainly bugfixes
 - LDAP API: Good activity: Bugfixes, work on immutable schema,
             and update of documentation. Towards a 1.0.0 release.
 - Studio:   Medium activity: Upgrade to Java 8 and bugfixes
 - Fortress: Low activity
 - Kerby:    Low activity
 - Mavibot:  Good activity: Work on transaction support
 - eSCIMo:   Zero activity

## Health report:

Overall develomment activity (commits, development related mails,
resolved issues, releases) is lower than last quarter. This is
probably due to lack of time, but also due to low number of active
developers.

On the other hand activity on user mailing lists increased.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Alan Cabrera]

Special thanks to Romain Manni-Bucau for crafting this report.

## Description: 
 - Apache Geronimo is a JEE6 certified open source server runtime that 
   integrates the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server 
   runtimes that meet the needs of enterprise developers and system 
   administrators.

   
## Issues: 
 - We are concerned with the lack of community activity on the server 
   portion of the project. Other parts of the Geronimo project otoh do
   fine. 
 - We have discussed retiring the Geronimo Server and amend the project
   agenda to focus on proving a kind of 'JavaEE Umbrella at Apache'
   project (to host projects not justifying enough activity by themself
   but not specific enough to be a subproject). It appears to have
   worked well for years for Geronimo components and specs.

 We basically have two options:
   * Retire the Geronimo Server and amend the project agenda
     to focus on proving a kind of 'JavaEE Umbrella at Apache' project 
     with the still active parts.
   * Retire the whole Geronimo project and move active parts to various
     other places.  There are a few open questions: what happens with
     parts which are used in multipledifferent places? How to do this 
     while still keeping the o.a.geronimo packageand groupId?
 - The inability to obtain a AL2.0 compatible JEE TCK pins Geronimo to JEE6
 - CI/TCK setup has fallen into disrepair
   
## Activity: 
 - Last release of the Geronimo Server was 3.18 on Tue May 20 2014
 - quite a few releases for various specs, xbean, javamail, etc
   Hard to track though as they do not have separate jira version ranges
 - In progress votes geronimo-jsonp 1.1 spec API
 - In progress votes geronimo-jaxrs 2.0 spec API
 - Some PMC members mentioned that they want to retire
   
## Health report: 
 - Traffic is relatively low, until the community began pivot discussions.
 - Geronimo Server: dead
 - specs: well alive and doing fine
 - javamail: gets bugfixes
 - xBean: alive and maintained
 - transaction: alive and maintained
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 42 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Romain Manni-Bucau on Thu Aug 07 2014 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 70 committers. 
 - Reinhard Sandtner was added as a committer on Mon Feb 13 2017 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 3.18 on Tue May 20 2014 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - Not much activity but probably due to the transition period and 
   unclear state of the project.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Christopher Douglas]

Apache Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and
managing distributed applications running on clusters of commodity
computers.

The project cut a release from the long-lived 2.8 branch, iterating on its
stable series of releases. Concurrently, it is stabilizing and adding new
features to a 3.x series, anticipating one more alpha release before
stabilizing in beta. Activity in both HDFS and YARN proceeds both in feature
branches (e.g., object storage, "native task" support) and in a steady
stream of fixes and smaller features in mainline branches.

Airflow

Airflow is a workflow automation and scheduling system that can be used to
author and manage data pipelines.

Airflow has been incubating since 2016-03-31.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We are working on our second apache release 1.8.1 to get more experience
     with the process
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. We had our first official release. 1.8.0 on March 19th 2017.
  2. We elected 1 new PPMC Member/Committer: Alex Guziel (a.k.a saguziel)
  3. Since our last podling report 3 months ago (i.e. between Jan 1 and Mar
     31, inclusive), we grew our contributors from 224 to 256
  4. Since our last podling report 3 months ago (i.e. between Jan 1 and Mar
     31, inclusive), we resolved 216 pull requests (currently at 1479 closed
     PRs)
  5. Three meet-ups, one in San Francisco, CA hosted by Clover Health, one in
     New York, NY hosted by Blue Apron and one in San Jose, CA hosted by PayPal
     were held by the community.
  6. Since being accepted into the incubator, the number of companies
     officially using Apache Airflow has risen from 30 to 83.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. As noted above, 216 pull requests were merged since our last report
     (i.e. between Jan 1 and Mar 31, inclusive).

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  The Airflow community continues to grow, and we have successfully created
  our first Apache release. We want to continue on this momentum and create
  another release to solidify our  process and tools around it, but we feel
  we are nearing graduation. We are open to feedback and guidance to make
  sure we can do so.

Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Developer/community engagement/growth
  2. Research and planning
  3. Shipping a "promising demo"

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Minimal mailing list activity. Little from new people. It seems (mostly)
  that folks are waiting on "someone to code something" before they state
  opinions, get involved, etc. We've used the wiki a bit--in hopes of getting
  feedback/input, but since mailing list folks can't edit/comment by default
  there's been lag/disinterest caused by that hurdle being particularly high.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The two most active developers (randall & bigbluehat) have a plan (on the
  wiki) which they hope to deliver code for before May. There are two events
  in May (I Annotate and ApacheCon) which we hope to demo/present at to
  increase awareness/interest/contribution.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  johndament: The podling is about 9 months old, no releases, no new committers.
              Low mailing list activity.  Without starting any growth, I'm not
              sure they'll be able to survive.

DataFu

DataFu provides a collection of Hadoop MapReduce jobs and functions in higher
level languages based on it to perform data analysis. It provides functions
for common statistics tasks (e.g. quantiles, sampling), PageRank, stream
sessionization, and set and bag operations. DataFu also provides Hadoop jobs
for incremental data processing in MapReduce.

DataFu has been incubating since 2014-01-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete maturity evaluation checklist
  2. Draft graduation resolution
  3. Continue releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

  No changes

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Version 1.3.2 was released.  This addressed an issue with released
  convenience binaries not including LICENSE, NOTICE, and DISCLAIMER
  in META-INF of JARs.  This was considered an important item to
  tackle before graduation.

FreeMarker

FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text output
based on templates. FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class library for
programmers.

FreeMarker produces releases from its current stable branch since 2004 (and
is started in 1999).

FreeMarker has been incubating since 2015-07-01.


Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  The project is constantly exploring new ways to "convert" active
  users into committers, since we have a very large user base and a
  rather small group of committers. This was actually expected, given
  the age (and topic) of the project. While the FreeMarker 3 line,
  which was started quite recently, will be much more appealing for
  contributors, development on that direction will certainly take a
  long time. In other respects the project is mature and ready for
  graduation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are eager to graduate but we were hoping to increase the number
  of active contributors more before the graduation. However, since
  the community is slowly growing and we have completed all the
  Incubation tasks, we are now more inclined to discuss the graduation
  and then proceed as a top level project. One of the practical
  problems with being stuck in the Incubator is that many users stick
  to the last non-incubating release as that has no "-incubating" in
  the Maven coordinates, missing out on fixes and features done in the
  recent two years. We brought up the issue with the Maven coordinate
  on general@incubator.apache.org (saying that because our Maven
  coordinate doesn't contain "apache", "incubating" is meaningless
  there), but there was no consensus.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have welcomed a new committer (non-PMC), Woonsan Ko.

  A few new people has shown up to help out with our Twitter channel
  (such as making a new logo for it, and helping to make it more
  active), and to work on modernizing our build scripts.

  The starting of the FreeMarker 3 branch has generated more technical
  discussions than usual.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have created a Project Maturity Model page at
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FREEMARKER/Apache+Freemarker+Project+Maturity+Model

  We have started the FreeMarker 3 branch, whose goal is to get rid of
  backward compatibility burden that holds back the project quite much
  at this point, and doesn't allow us to fully capitalize on the
  experiences of the last 15 years. In our current situation it's also
  very important that the new branch, as it advances, will be
  technically far more appealing than the legacy branch for
  contributors. Also, the new branch uses org.apache packages and
  Maven coordinates (which FreeMarker 2 can't do).

  We have received a bigger contribution from Kenshoo, the source code
  of an online template evaluator service, which we plan to use on our
  home page, helping users to try and learn the template language.

  We have released a new micro version (2017-03-25, 2.3.26), focuses
  on fixes and smaller improvements. This is the third stable release
  issued during the incubation.

  We have added a How-To page for committers
  (http://freemarker.org/committer-howto.html), which gives detailed
  instructions on making releases, handling pull requests, updating
  the project home page, and more.

  We have worked some on our Twitter channel, such as we have a new
  logo and some posts.

Gossip

Gossip is an implementation of the Gossip Protocol.

Gossip has been incubating since 2016-04-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. A project leveraging Apache Gossip such as
     https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IGNITE-4837
  2. Two additional active committers to handle management tasks like code
     review
  3. Continued releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  Two students are submitting proposals for Google Summer of Code. Both have
  already contributed features which were committed to the project. We are
  hopefully they both proposals will be accepted.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The mailing list has been active with several people who were drawn to the
  project by GSOC 17 labels placed on our tickets. Two of them have
  contributed features that have been committed, and a third person (who will
  not be doing GSOC) has asked to be assigned a ticket. Our last release had
  roughly 5 different contributors, The mailing list is fairly active as we
  review GSOC proposals. We have more than 50 stars on github which shows
  that visibility is making a steady climb.

  A release 0.1.1 was completed right before our last report. We made an
  aggressive list of features for 0.1.2. We de-prioritized some of the items,
  but we completed far more than we expected. We had improvements in
  performance, testing, and features. CRDT support seemed to be the biggest
  'splash' feature.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  I am happy with the continued feature development and code/test
  improvement. We are attracting interest of some new developers who seem
  likely to stay involved and potentially be committers in the future. While
  the majority of management and reviews is done by a few, others are
  beginning to help with tasks like code reviews. As pointed out in the "move
  towards graduation" section, having a couple other highly active
  reviewers/committers would be a positive next step.

HAWQ

Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop native SQL query engine that combines the key
technological advantages of MPP database with the scalability and convenience
of Hadoop. HAWQ reads data from and writes data to HDFS natively.  HAWQ
delivers industry-leading performance and linear scalability. It provides
users the tools to confidently and successfully interact with petabyte range
data sets. HAWQ provides users with a complete, standards compliant SQL
interface.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to improve the project's release cadence. To this end we
     plan on expanding automation services to support increased
     developer participation.

  2. Continue to expand the community, by adding new contributors and
     focusing on making sure that there's a much more robust level of
     conversations and discussions happening around roadmaps and
     feature development on the public dev mailing list.

  3. Expand release artifacts to include the delivery of binary
     artifacts. We expect the project to significantly refine the
     binary release process in several key areas.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  1. Nothing urgent at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Two Meetups took place in Beijing, China:

     * HAWQ Meetup (January 12, 2017)

       - HAWQ2.X New Features - Yanqing Wen, Pivotal HAWQ Senior
         Engineer
       - HAWQ Elasticity - Huan Zhang, Pivotal HAWQ Senior Engineer
       - Data Lake and HAWQ Integration - Wenbin Lu, EMC Big Data
         Senior Engineer

     * HAWQ Meetup (March 23, 2017)

       - Apache HAWQ Exploration Step by Step - Configuration, Build,
         Deployment and Debug by Xiang Sheng, Pivotal Software
         Engineer
       - Transaction Management in Apache HAWQ by Ming Li, Pivotal
         Senior Software Engineer
       - Max Compute - A SQL engine based on Apache HAWQ by Chen Xia,
         Database Expert in Alibaba Cloud

  2. A significant push by the dev community has been made to review
     and merge the project's Pull Requests (PR). As of March 30, 2017,
     eight of the nine open PRs have been opened in the last ten
     days. The PR opened on Sep 2016 is targeted to be merged after
     the Apache 2.2.0.0 release.

  3. Community contribution highlight(s):

     * Leveraging the extensible PXF design, a JDBC PXF plugin
       was contributed by Devin Jia (github id: jiadexin). This
       contribution came from the community and not from the
       company which originally donated HAWQ to the ASF.

  4. Recent porting efforts:

     - Persistent Systems Engineers are actively engaging the dev
       community on their HAWQ porting efforts to RHEL 7.1 on S390
       platform.

     - Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS (Xenial Xerus) porting notes have been
       published on dev list.

  5. Ruilong Huo has volunteered to be the Release Manager (RM) for
     the upcoming 2.2.0.0 release

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Apache HAWQ 2.1.0.0 (source code only) has been released.

  2. Apache HAWQ 2.2.0.0 release proposed (source code and first
     binary release).  This is the 3rd release as an incubating
     project. The binaries will be Hadoop vendor agnostic providing
     support for the Apache Bigtop 1.2.0 distribution.

     Release page:

Juneau

Apache Juneau is a toolkit for marshalling POJOs to a wide variety of content
types using a common framework, and for creating sophisticated self-
documenting REST interfaces and microservices using VERY little code.

Juneau has been incubating since 2016-06-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Build up community with non-IBM and non-Salesforce contributors.
  2. Solicit user feedback/usage
  3. Grow awareness of the project

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The Juneau community has teamed with the Streams community to
  replace Jackson (and other libraries) in Apache Streams.
  Ongoing collaboration is going on between the teams.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  6.0.1 minor release delivered on Jan 3, 2017.
  6.1.0 major release delivered on Feb 25, 2017.

MADlib

Big Data Machine Learning in SQL for Data Scientists.

MADlib has been incubating since 2015-09-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to produce regular Apache (incubating) releases.
  2. Continue to execute and manage the project according to governance model
     of the "Apache Way".
  3. Continue to build community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  1. The next release v1.11 will be the 5th as an incubating project.  We
     believe this release will meet all requirements for a clean ASF release,
     based on listening to guidance from the IPMC over the previous releases.
     After that, the community would ideally like to move towards top level
     status.
  2. The licensing issues have been resolved.  Should anyone want to review,
     we have summarized the issue and resolution with relevant links on the
     MADlib wiki at
     https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MADLIB/ASF+Licensing+Guidance

Milagro

Distributed Cryptography; M-Pin protocol for Identity and Trust

Milagro has been incubating since 2015-12-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Develop MILAGRO toolbox
  2. Creating full working MILAGRO ecosystem, based on MILAGRO crypto library
     – further research and development (IoT, blockchain, fractions etc.)
  3. Building the MILAGRO community – engaging developers and cryptographers,
     raising awareness and helping to secure future of internet.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are having issues with Apache repos, and syncing two-way with Github,
  which becomes annoying, as developers reports. We’re facing issues in
  logging in to Apache Wiki page (https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/April2017
  <https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/April2017> )
  <https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/April2017)> - error messages are poping
  here and there, so it’s impossible to work directly on Apache tools (while
  users names and passwords, are 100% correct), we still can not access
  those, and we are having issues with accessing SVN.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  MILAGRO community, sadly isn’t currently growing, most likely cause of
  technical issues, few interested folks were unable to login, so they are
  working directly on Github repo, while we still can not have two-way
  syncing with Apache account.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  In past few months, MILAGRO community was focused on developing MILAGRO
  Crypto C Library, the most important parts were:

  - enabling the solution to use different curves at the same time
  - adding Golang wrappers for RSA and ECDSA
  - adding tests and working examples for the Golang wrappers
  - adding benchmarks
  - finally splitting the library into proper logical components

       I do see some ongoing development, like new repositories being
       created, but there's not a lot of discussion happening on the MLs and
       as such I do not have a clear picture where the project currently
       stands, what problems they have, and how we can improve on that. 
  [*](milagro) Nick Kew
     Comments:
       Nothing seems to have happened since last time.  This report describes
       technical difficulties: loss of certain github functionality in moving
       to apache, and others I find harder to grasp.  I will again post a
       followup to this to the project's dev list.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  Drew Farris (shepherd): I see very little evidence of project activity looking 
       at the mailing lists and repos alone. There must be more effort to move 
       Milagro development and communication to Apache infrastructure.
       Despite involvement of one mentor, I am unable to observe effort
       from the project members to resolve the problems referenced in the 
       board report. The lack of progress over more than a year of incubation
       leads me to question whether the current Milagro community is genuinely 
       interested in running an Apache project.

       Its been 4 months since this project has been proposed for Apache
       Incubator and so far nothing's been done to move the project to Apache.
       All activity is still happening on the original project github -
       http://github.com/dmlc/mxnet and all conversations still happen on the
       project's Gitter channel. Since the last report from March 2017 (which
       btw was drafted and filed by me) there's been ZERO traction on moving
       the project to Apache. There are upcoming talks in various confs like -
       https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/58186
       that make no reference to the fact that the project is now 'Apache'.
       The reason me and Hen have not filed a report yet for April 2017 is due
       to the fact we would rather one of the committers on the project took
       the initiative to do it as opposed to a mentor covering for the
       project.

Mynewt

Mynewt is a real-time operating system for constrained embedded systems like
wearables, lightbulbs, locks and doorbells. It works on a variety of 32-bit
MCUs (microcontrollers), including ARM Cortex-M and MIPS architectures.

Mynewt has been incubating since 2015-10-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Demonstrate the capability to do point and major releases that can be
     used to build downloadable RTOS images for multiple MCU architectures,
     peripherals, and network connectivity protocols. The goal of having a
     first major (1.0) release in the first quarter of 2017 was met. The
     releases are intended to demonstrate and solidify the repeatability,
     usability, and maturity of process.
  2. Continue to develop and execute policies that enable project
     contributors to achieve self-governance.
  3. Expand community - attract new project contributors, get users with
     diverse backgrounds applying project to new use cases and encouraging
     adoption, grow committer base. 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Active mailing lists with increasing numbers of subscribers. 19 new
     subscribers on dev@ mailing list since last report resulting in a total
     of 160 subscribers. 
  2. Increased participation by several new contributors through pull
     requests for new MCU support, merges by new committers, new BSP support,
     connectivity features, and test cases and test results. There is a
     measurable increase in usage of the project for 3rd-party products and
     demos. Outreach continues via conferences, exhibits, one on one
     meetings, tutorials, beta testers, prototype and performance testing
     with multiple organizations.  For example, 255 Pull Requests have been
     closed on GitHub.
  3. Vigorous discussions, feature proposals, optimizations, code behavior
     analysis, user interface improvements, and implementation debates on
     @dev mailing list. Activity on dev@ list averaged 192 msgs/month in 2016

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. The first major release (1.0) was successfully completed on March 22nd.
     Two beta releases led up to the first major release - first on December
     13, 2016, the second on Feb 24, 2017, with the final month before the
     release (between beta2 and 1.0) focusing on bug fixes, performance
     tuning, and code cleanup for a robust first release. An example of
     policy developed and executed is the Release Policy:
     https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MYNEWT/Release+and+Support+Policy
  2. Planning: Issues including bug reports, features, and wish list captured
     and tracked in ASF JIRA by members of the community. Proposals for new
     features are posted on the dev@ mailing list and voted on by community
     members. 
  3. Effort towards self governance: Voting successfully completed to grant
     committer status to five new candidates since last report. New committer
     acceptance policy defined and followed:
     https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MYNEWT/New+Committer+Acceptance+Process
     Another example of policy developed and executed is the Release Policy:

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Get companies backing up the project as part of a commercial story, to
     get a long-term momentum
  2. Do recurrent releases - some semi-automation would be helpful - for the
     3rd party users

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  How do we get people to test our release on the incubation list?

  A general issue of the project is that it 'just' a toolkit of an office
  file format, which in addition is far from leading the business market,
  so likely never being used by the mass market - a very niche product.

  Still, the toolkit seems to be working well for most common use cases, but
  is repeatedly updated by developers on changes of the ODF, like Red Hat
  developers enhancing the ODF validator as part of LibreOffice regression
  tests (e.g. out-of-the-box running on http://odf-validator.rhcloud.com/)
  most often quite ahead of one of the international ODF Plugfests -
  http://odfplugfest.org/2016-paris/programme/.

  There are some game-changing features in the pipeline (e.g.
  collaboration) which are expected to strengthen the acceptance and develop
  the community.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We received with Tom Barber a new active Mentor

    There has been discussion on list re community building and activities
    happening e.g. external hackathon but translating that into new
    committers seems hard.

    I think part of this is process (new to Apache and the way we do things)
    and perhaps PR review process / the committer bar has been set a little
    too high. Perhaps the PMC should look at voting in people that contribute
    to the project a little earlier?

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built
on top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and
query processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across multiple
nodes. Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through SPARQL, a
conventional query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Have more releases as part of the Apache Foundation
  2. Increase diversity of contributors.
  3. Continue to harden and develop core Rya features to improve user
     experience

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Talk on Rya accepted at Apache Big Data, May 18, 2017
  * PRs from non-committers (14 contributions from 6 non-committers) which
    are integrated into the repository continue to be received

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Resolved a handful of issues that users have encountered
  * Committed features: Added support for select * {?s ?p ?o} queries (select
    all triples). Implemented MongoDB based entity secondary index. Added
    MongoDB column visibility. Fixed column visibilities in Fluo. Added
    GeoWave, in addition to GeoMesa, to the optional rya.geoindexing. Added
    statement metadata optimizer so  that reified queries can be issued in an
    efficient way.

  [x](weex) Niclas Hedhman
     Comments: The Shepherd's comments fully resonate with how I feel. The 
     progress in 'getting it' is slow, and I have also asked privately how 
     people know what to work on, as I suspect that this is happening at 
     work, conf calls, or other means. I have been considering asking the 
     IPMC to put the code repository in read-only to get people to wake up. 
     There is a release attempt going on right now, and that has triggered a 
     little bit more open communications, but it is far from acceptable. Dev 
     work is remarkably strong, but community development is weak, which I 
     see as signs of a corporate-driven project.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  ptgoetz: The Weex community has shown some friction against adopting the
           Apache Way. Luckily there is one highly engaged mentor very actively
           nudging the community in the right direction. My concern is that
           other mentors have not engaged (no sign-offs to date), and if the
           primary mentor disappears for any length of time it could pose a 
           problem. I'd like to see at least one more engaged mentor for a
           podling trying to develop its initial Apache "sea legs."

  johndament: The amount of private list email vs dev list email is a bit
              concerning.  Niclas has been doing a great job helping the 
              podling move along, but without major changes I suspect 
              it will be difficult for them to progress forward.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

## Description:

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We have made 2 releases this quarter [1].

The (Asciidoc-based) website/documentation [2] has been improved, with 
capability to allow contributors to easily make small corrections.  In 
addition, an improved rich-text search has been implemented. 

A pair of article were produced for InfoQ[3][4], contrasting (modular) 
monoliths vs microservices architectures and using examples based on Apache
Isis to demonstrate one way to implement the former.

## Health report:

Everything is healthy. We have had two releases.

## PMC changes:
   
 - Currently 12 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Bilgin Ismet Ibryam on Wed Nov 09 2016

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Gaul]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

We have completed the Packet.net provider and continued to receive
contributions for providers OneAndOne, ProfitBricks, and Azure ARM. We have
also started to receive contributions from DimensionData to add support for
their cloud. Assuming the current rapid speed of progress continues, we expect
to have the DimensionData provider completed soon.

To aid users in upgrading to more recent jclouds versions, we are discussing
how to keep up to date with the latest Google Guava versions, while still
being backwards compatible with reasonably old ones. The Guava versions we
support have generally been older ones, representing a conservative choice in
terms of required dependencies, but users are now experiencing some issues we
would like to address as soon as possible.

Although we have several Karaf PMC members in the jclouds PMC, the lack of
deep knowledge of Karaf among the active contributors is causing some issues
for a jclouds/Karaf integration we maintain. Specifically, we are stuck with
an upgrade of the version of Karaf that has broken the jclouds CLI (a
convenience tool not widely used), and we are struggling to fix it. We'll
probably have to ping the Karaf dev@ list and ask for help there.

There has also been a limited amount of activity to support Java 9.

== Community ==

We have received three applications for GSoC for two projects, and some of
them are promising.

Some discussions about how to extend jclouds to natively support asynchronous
operations has been raised from the community, and a related proposal has been
discussed. We are very pleased to see community proposals such as this one
that require a deep dive into the jclouds code!

We've also seen an cluster of recent discussions and activity relating to the
OpenStack Swift provider.

There are currently 11 PMC members and 24 committers. 

Last committer: 2017-02-17 (Svetoslav Neykov) Last PMC member: 2016-10-21
(Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

* Promote Packet, B2, GCS and Azure ARM providers out of labs into the main
  repository. The cloud APIs for the latter are changing quite fast, so
  perhaps it will remain in labs a bit more until the latest APIs are more
  stable.
* Evaluate and engage GSoC students. Let's see if we can do better to have
  them stick around after the project is completed. This has not happened with
  the previous students.
* Release 2.0.2 or 2.1.0 in 2Q2017.

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.0.1, took place on 2017-02-27.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description: 

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data
applications in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards for
RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 

The project released 3.2.0 in February this year which was a faster
release cadence than usual. This release contained some new APIs and our
usual slew of bug and performance fixes.

There have been ongoing efforts involving both existing committers and
community contributions towards bringing our secondary text indexing
components up-to-date with the current versions of the Apache Lucene
libraries and we hope to be able to release that to users soon. In
addition, the unmaintained Solr text indexing backend is being replaced
by a new Elasticsearch backend.
   
## Health report: 

The project has discussed how the slow ~6 monthly release cycle has been
creating problems for users because releases often contain a lot of
change, some of which may be subtle e.g. corner case behavioural fixes,
that create issues when users upgrade. This is particularly noticeable
when users who build products on top of Jena and have their own release
cycles jump multiple versions in a single upgrade.  Also, when we
introduce bugs/regressions the long release cycle means it takes a long
time to get fixes into the hands of users for those who aren’t prepared
to use development snapshots. The project is hoping to release more
frequently this year to help mitigate this problem since we believe that
more frequent releases will limit the amount of change in each release
and make upgrades less painful.

The topic of maintaining multiple branches i.e. Multiple stable release
branches was discussed again but as in the past the consensus was that
the active contributor base is insufficient to support this.

## PMC changes: 

 - Currently 12 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Adam Soroka on Mon Jun 06 2016   

## Committer base changes: 

 - Currently 15 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Lorenz Buehmann at Fri Oct 28 2016 

## Releases: 

 - Fuseki 2.5.0 was released on Tue Feb 07 2017 
 - Jena 3.2.0 was released on Tue Feb 07 2017 

## Mailing list activity: 

Developer list traffic has seen a spike during March 2017 due to a large
pull request from a new contributor which was related to the
aforementioned Elasticsearch text indexing backend. This has generated
lots of automated notifications to the list in the form of both JIRA and
GitHub comment mirroring. The GitHub code review feature in particular,
tends to generate large amounts of notification messages.
   
## JIRA activity:

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Johnzon Project  [Hendrik Saly]

## Description:
Apache Johnzon is an implementation of JSR-353 (JavaTM API for JSON
Processing) and a set of useful extension for this specification like an
Object mapper, some JAX-RS providers and websocket (JSR-356) integration.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Status:
Graduation out of the incubator is completed, the first non-incubator release
was done on July 21, 2016. There is ongoing work to make Johnzon
JSR-367 (JSON-B) compliant with significant work done in the latest
1.0.0 release. Implementation of JSR-374 (JSON-P 1.1), the successor of JSR-353,
is finished but not yet released.

Johnzon is now also used by Apache OpenWebBeans Meecrowave.

## Releases:
Last release was 1.0.0 on Mon Dec 12 2016

## Committers and PMC membership:
The last committer we signed up was Reinhard Sandtner on April 12, 2016. The
last PMC member was Reinhard Sandtner, added to the PMC on August 30, 2016.

## Project activity:
Since the last report there was low activity.

We had 11 new Jira issues and fixed 5 of them. On the mailinglist there a no
unanswered questions left. On the dev list we have 27 subscribers currently
and 6 msg sent per week. Since last report we saw mailing list activity
from a few new people.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos]

## Description:
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
Java EE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - This quarter, dev has mostly gone on UI bug fixing and refinements; also 
there has been some more general bug-fixing.

 - Work has finally started to move away from ASF CMS to a gitpubsub based 
one. New site is already developed at jspwiki-site git repo, with a Jenkins 
job to push any changes to the site, and awaiting at INFRA-13716 for the 
switch from the ASF CMS based site to this new one.

 - Once we have moved to the new Git-based site we plan to request that
http://jspwiki.apache.org/docs should serve our wiki instead of the site, 
with the following objetives in mind:
   * as we can make main index.html perform a redirect, our wiki effectively
     turns into our main site, allowing us to further showcase JSPWiki 
     (JSPWIKI-1030 related).
   * In the case of VM failure, wiki screwed or whatever failure that renders
     the wiki unusable, we still are in control and can switch to a static 
     backup site easily and fast.
   * javadocs are still served through the git site, so they will still be 
     browseable online.
   
## Health report: 

 - There were commits from three people on the different project git repos.
 
 - No questions left unanswered on MLs

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description: 

Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues: 

No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Since the last report, we've made two minor releases: 1.2 just after
the prior report, and 1.3 a few weeks back.

Kudu 1.3 is an important milestone for the project, as it now includes
support for strong authentication (via Kerberos) and TLS wire encryption.
Based on feedback from the community over the last year, we think this
will substantially increase adoption in environments with more requirements
around data security.

## Health report: 

- Subscriptions to the user mailing list are up 8% over last quarter, with
  traffic up 14%. Subscriptions to development-related lists have grown
  at a similar rate (~9%), with traffic down 30%. The drop in dev traffic
  just seems to be natural fluctuation of design discussion vs implementation
  focus of the team.

  Questions on both the mailing list and our Slack channel are typically
  answered within a day.

- Global interest in Apache Kudu continues to increase at a good clip.
  Website traffic (by user count) on http://kudu.apache.org/ was up 73%
  this quarter vs last.

- Development velocity is pretty constant from last quarter (commits and JIRA
  traffic about constant, code review traffic +10%).

- This quarter (Jan-Mar), we committed code authored by 26 distinct
  contributors, of whom 8 were new to the project. Of the 8 new contributors, 5
  are unaffiliated with Cloudera, who employs the majority of active
  committers.

  We reported similar stats last quarter, and noted that we are happy with the
  diversity of contributors. The board noted "hopefully some of these new
  contributors will develop into committers". We are keeping an eye out for
  potential committers, but we have mostly observed a "long tail" pattern -- of
  the 37 non-committer contributors over the past year, 23 have contributed
  only one or two patches, so we don't feel that any is yet ready for
  committership.

  We'll continue to keep an eye out for potential committers over the coming
  quarter. If the above pattern persists, we will consider surveying the "long
  tail" contributors to see if there are any changes we could make to encourage
  continued participation.


## PMC/Committer changes: 

 - Currently 16 PMC members and committers (all committers are PMC)
 - Last committer/PMC addition: Jordan Birdsell was added on Nov 8, 2016.

## Releases: 

 - Apache Kudu 1.3.0 was released on March 20, 2017.
 - Apache Kudu 1.2.0 was released on January 18, 2017.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

Description:

  The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for
  dynamic programming languages.  The Apache Clownfish "symbiotic" object
  system pairs with "host" programming language environments and facilitates
  the development of high performance language extensions.

Issues:

  There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

Activity:

  To realize Clownfish's full potential across multiple programming
  languages, which is key to making Lucy's full extendability more
  available, it is necessary to tweak the inheritance model that Lucy uses.
  Plans were laid this quarter for migrating Lucy functionality that depends
  on soon-to-be-deprecated Clownfish APIs.

  An ambitious cleanup of Lucy's locking code has been completed.

Health report:

  Three long-standing PMC members continue to be active on the mailing
  lists.  Most commits continue to be authored by a single contributor.
  It is likely that the Chair position will be rotated soon.

  There are currently 14 committers and 12 PMC members.  The last committer
  and PMC member change was Timothy Wilkens, who joined in September 2014.

Releases:

  - Apache Lucy 0.6.1 was released on Thu Dec 08 2016
  - Apache Clownfish 0.6.1 was released on Thu Dec 08 2016

Mailing list and JIRA activity:

  Email traffic trended downward a bit more this quarter.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build
lifecycle.

* Activity

 Maven is moving forward again! Stephen Connolly did a great job as
 the release manager and succeeded in releasing 2 pre-releases of
 Maven-3.5.0 and improved the CI part a lot. To get there we had to
 take quite some hurdles, so Stephen did a retrospective on
 Maven 3.5.0-alpha-1.

 [SUMMARY] [DISCUSS] Retrospective on Maven 3.5.0-alpha-1, March 19 2017
 ---
 * What is working well

 Seems we have some consensus here:

 * CI is working better (not perfect)
 * We are discussing changes before pushing them to master
 * Getting a release out the door

 * What is not working well

 Slightly harder to consolidate here, but there are some themes that I can
 identify:
 * we need a better way to work with branches. There are traceability
 issues when looking at branches on the CI server. There are issues with
 continuous rebasing. There are questions about what is in flight for the
 next release vs what is in flight for a future release. (I suspect this is
 all intermingled and I'll start a thread to debate potential solutions
 shortly)
 * we need a better process to scope changes for different target releases.
 (The chaotic process for 3.5.0 was a one time attempt to deal with the
 reality of the reset, so I never expected us to repeat it... but we still
 need to come up with a process to plan what will be in each release)
 (I'll start a thread shortly to see if we can come up with a process to
 use as an experiment for 3.5.1)
 * we need to agree on some common terminology. What is a bug, what is a
 rfe, what is a breaking change. What is the severity of these things. What
 severity issues affect different release types (alpha, beta, etc) How are
 we versioning Maven and how does severity affect versioning. (I'll start a
 thread on this shortly)
 * discussion threads that go on forever without coming to a conclusion.
 (We just need to have to remember to post a [SUMMARY] or call a [VOTE] to
 close them out... I shall lead by example here)
 * ubuntu and Windows are not enough OSes to test on (the PMC needs to
 decide if we want to ask for budget to get such extra nodes... otherwise
 this is out of our hands... Michael-O should start a discussion to see if:
 1. This is what the committers want and 2. To find out how much what we
 want would cost and see about requesting off the board in our next budget)
 * how do we grow our community (I think we just have to get momentum going
 and the contributions will come... the project has looked dead, who's
 going to contribute to a dead project... if anyone disagrees please start
 up a discussion thread)
 ---

 Plans are made for the next minor and major version of Maven, now that the
 train is moving again.

 Oracle expects to have Java 9 released in the period we publish our next
 board-report. Regarding JSR-376 there is no consensus between the Jigsaw
 team and the expert group regarding the latest proposals. It is still
 uncertain what the effects will be and in which way Maven (as most
 dominant buildtool) can or must take its responsibility to save Java.
 Robert is taking part in several discussions with other large
 organizations sharing the same concerns.
 Once it is clear what Java 9 will offer and in case this collides with
 the fundaments of Maven, the Maven PMC will be informed and might need to
 vote on what to do with the new situation.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Marcus Lange]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in more than 40 languages.

## STATUS

The activity within the project is going down more and more. This can no
longer be argued with year end/year beginning, spring tiredness or whatever.
Some of the committers were busy with business and private things in the last
weeks.

Limitations of capacity of development is an ongoing concern. But plans are
still active to do more releases.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

There are no current topics to be concerned with.

## RELEASES

The current release is Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 and was published on
2016-Oct-12.

Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4 was planned to release in Q1 but this hasn't happened.
We have some pre-release builds ready but need some information about the
direction which bugfixes we still need to integrate. This is the task of the
Release Manager. Currently we are waiting since some weeks for his feedback.

Apache OpenOffice 4.2.0 is planned for this year - but without to name a
specific time frame - to include new features and bigger enhancements but of
course more bugfixes and security fixes if needed.

## ACTIVITY

Development and Release Engineering
-----------------------------------
The build system and its documentation is
further updated as the result of experienced developers and cmmitters
producing.

The release manager for the upcoming release 4.1.4, bugfixing has started, dev
builds have been done so far.

The hottest action at the moment is to upgrade further language webpages to a
new look & feel incl. a standardized download area.

Besides this bugfixing of issues is the next action item to name.

Downloads
---------
As of 2017-Apr-12 we have more than 214,000,000 million downloads
and it is still at a consistent rate with ~100,000 downloads in average per
day.

Windows is still by far the most famous platform that is downloaded. Then
macOS and Linux are following.

The downloads regarding the country over the last 3 months are spread like the
following (source:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/stats/map?dates=20
17-01-01%20to%202017-03-31):

15 % United States 14 % France 11 % Germany 8 % Italy 6 % Spain 5 % Poland 4 %
Russia 4 % United Kingdom 4 % Japan 2 % Canada 27 % all other countries

Websites
--------
There is a lot of action to improve the translation and structure of
webpages that weren't updated for a longer time. The improvement of social
media representation (Youtube, Facebook, Twitter) is ongoing.

Apache OpenOffice is represented on a few fairs and events. This is managed by
a small but fine team.

We had again a presence at FOSDEM, Brussels last quarter. We had three
presentations (including Imacat from Taiwan) and also had some good
meetings/talking with a mix of old and new people.

We are promoting the upcoming ApacheCon in Miami with a banner graphic and
text - linking to the ApacheCon homepage - on our homepage
"https://www.openoffice.org/".

Issue Tracking (Bugzilla)
-------------------------
The rate of new Bugzilla issues is decreasing since
a few years. The rate at which issues remain unresolved over all that time is
more than 40%. But volunteers are managing the new issue reports that come in.

Development Capacity
--------------------
The arrival of new developers has slowed down more than
ever. But there are indeed people willing to dig into the code. But with our
low number of developers assignments and mentoring it's slow by itself.

Next Steps: Improving the mentoring of newcomers and expanding the capacity to
address major issues as part of new releases.

Handling of Security
--------------------
To make it short: The work on security report is low.
Also because not every developer has the time to dig deep into analyzing and
fixing. However, we expect to see an increasing analysis and fixing in general
in the next months.

Branding
--------
In average there is nearly 1 request per month for use of the marks.

The same for reports about suspected trademark misuse (or confusion about
selling of Apache OpenOffice binaries, e.g., on eBay).

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Sqoop Project  [Jarek Jarcec Cecho]

## Description:
Apache Sqoop is a tool designed for efficiently transferring bulk data
between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational
databases. It can be used to import data from external structured

Hive and HBase. Conversely, Sqoop can be used to extract data from
Hadoop and export it to external structured datastores such as relational
databases and enterprise data warehouses.

## Issues:
Private third-party entity have used our trademark “sqoop” on Google adds
without properly referring to Apache Sqoop project. We’re working with
trademarks@ to resolve that.

## Activity:
Development activity continues on both trunk and sqoop 2 branches - both our
major versions that we currently support and develop.

## Health report:
Community is healthy, we see a new contributors showing up and contributing to
the project.

## PMC changes:
 - Currently 16 PMC members.
  - We’ve added new PMC member (Abraham Fine) in November 2016

## Committer base changes:

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made five GA releases in the last quarter.
* Struts 2.5.10 - full GA release including bug fixes and feature
  enhancements (2017-2-17)
* Struts 2.3.32 - maintenance release including critical security bug
  fix (2017-3-17)
* Struts 2.5.10.1 - maintenance release including critical security bug
  fix (2017-3-17)
* Struts Extras 1.0 - supporting module to help users mitigate security
  risks without the need for a full framework upgrade (2017-3-20)
* Struts Extras 1.1 - maintenance and improvements release (2017-3-20)

This was a rather busy quarter. In the beginning of February the team
pushed out a major GA release with many new features and bug fixes for
the 2.5 development line (Struts 2.5.10). Shortly after, our focus had
to shift due to a security vulnerability report received by a Chinese
reporter. This turned out to be a critical and easily to exploit issue
leading to remote code execution (CVE-2017-5638). The team worked
closely with the reporter to develop a bug fix for the said problem. In
March we released maintenance versions both for the 2.5 and 2.3
development lines to address this issue, along with security
announcements [1][2].

Unfortunately once the releases and the announcements were pushed out,
the reporter immediately disclosed the PoC for the said issue. While we
believe he did this in best intentions, this did not follow our own
policy to hold back PoCs for some time to give users a chance to update
their deployments. It turned out that the early PoC disclosure lead to a
huge impact. First exploits started hours after the release, with many
users being affected. In the following days and weeks the issue got a
lot of press coverage, and we have been contacted by quite a few users
and security researchers in regard to the vulnerability. Unfortunately
we had to learn that also a lot of high profile web sites were affected,
such as e.g. Canadian tax authorities.

We furthermore decided to provide additional help for users who have
issues with a full Struts framework upgrade in their deployments by
providing an Struts Extra module to act as a drop-in fix for
applications staying at older Struts 2 releases. This seemingly helped a
lot of users to address the vulnerability rather sooner than later.

Also within the last quarter, we were approached by IBM with an offer
for a cloud based source code scanning service for Apache Struts. We
answered with some questions on how this service is different from
existing source scanning services and what’s their take on avoiding
false positives. Unfortunately we got no feedback to our questions at
all, so we won’t be pursuing this further.

In January we were approached by the ASF Trademarks Team, pointing us to
the struts1forever project [3] and asking for our view with regards to
trademarks. We agreed that this project is a developer focused fork of
the long EOLed Struts 1 project to address security issues. It does not
seem to harm our trademark and is clearly marked as non-official fork,
serving best intentions. As such we don’t see any action required on
this topic besides establishing contact with the maintainer and possibly
help him to even more clarify the project description (TBD).

Stefaan Dutry (sdutry) was added as a new committer (2017-1-30)
No new PMC member was added in the last quarter. The last PMC addition
was on 2016-08-13 (Aleksandr Mashchenko).

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Dave Meikle]

=== Apache Tika Status Report : April 2017 ===

What is Tika?
=========================
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content
detection, analysis, and extraction. It allows a user to understand, and
leverage information from, a growing a list over 1200 different file types
including most of the major types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text,
Images, Video, Code, and science data) as recognised by IANA and other
standards bodies.

Issues
=========================
There are no issues that need the boards attention.

Releases
=========================
The last release Tika 1.14 was released on Wed Oct 19 2016. 
Version 1.15 has been the focus of the last period, with a release candidate 
to be built once the new POI release is out.

There a lots of new features such as WordPerfect and QuattroPro parsers, 
SAX based parser for Office formats, new language detectors, inline image 
extraction in PDFs, and a new tika-eval module to allow evaluation of extraction
between different systems.

Work has also continued on the new 2.X branch.

Community
=========================

The team have been actively publicising different uses of Apache Tika including
the Panama Papers Investigation which won the Pulitzer prize[1] and the new
Google / elastic cloud search offering [2].

Apache Tika is participating in the Google Summer of Code with two mentors in
Chris Mattmann and Thamme Gowda. We are looking forward to receiving proposals.

Mailing list activity on dev@ was at 235, 405 and 175 messages in Feb, Mar and
Apr 2017, respectively. user@ was at 14, 6 and 6 messages, during the same
timeframe.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
The TinkerPop PMC voted positively to add a new committer, but that 
person declined when invited, preferring instead to continue to contribute
as they have been. Also, Robert Dale, a committer, was invited to join the
PMC and he accepted.

TinkerPop released versions 3.1.6 and 3.2.5. New development has started 
on  the follow-on releases to those versions and work for the major line 
of 3.3.0 continues.

The wider TinkerPop community saw some growth with the announcement of 
the release of ChronoGraph[1], a versioned graph database that implements 
the TinkerPop interfaces. Also of note, JanusGraph[2] (formerly Titan) is 
under development at the Linux Foundation. JanusGraph continues in the 
steps of Titan in also implementing the TinkerPop interfaces.

There were also a number of talks and blog posts related to TinkerPop and 
the Gremlin language that were noted during the reporting months. The 
following list represents a sample of this type of TinkerPop content that
was produced by PMC members:

* "Enabling a Multimodel Graph Platform with Apache TinkerPop" - Jason
Plurad[3]
* "Graphoendodonticology" - Marko Rodriguez[4]

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.1.6 (February 8, 2017)
- 3.2.4 (February 8, 2017)

## PMC/Committer:

- Last PMC addition was Robert Dale - April 2017
- Last committer addition was Robert Dale - October 2016

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based
on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java
Enterprise Edition Specifications.

As commented in the last board report, the project has work to do on
attracting new committers.  Over the last quarter user and dev emails were
roughly 100-180 and 40-60 per month respectively, website traffic ~50k per
month, roughly 436 forks on github and 10 pull requests (PRs) from
non-committers. There appear to be the right ingredients for healthier
committer base.

Discussion on potentially using a RTC model on a trial basis to flush out
good communication and participation had mixed feedback and was not
conclusive.  Most achievable contributor discussions appear to be in the area
of documentation.  Turning this into action and PRs seems to be where things
fall short.  With the approach to PRs, many being commented as applied but
still remaining open in Github, it is difficult to see and track where
contributions do go.  There is some discussion needed here.  If the board is
aware of any good role models for ASF projects leveraging Github PRs, I’d
like to investigate.

Last release was 7.0.3 on 2017-03-13.  Last committer was added November
2015.  Last PMC addition, 4 new members on 2015-08-11.

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Bryan Call]

## Description: 
Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features. What makes ATS unique across the
landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on extensibility (plugins), HTTP
protocol conformity and performance. ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs
in the world, delivering a significant portion of all Internet traffic.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity:
 - We have an ATS Summit coming up next month, 2 days before ApacheCon
  (5/14 and 5/15), at the InterContiental in Miami.  There is also going to
  be a Traffic Control Summit at the same time and we are coordinating with
  registration and the schedule.

 - We switched from Jira to Github for tickets/issues on January 1st.  We
   will have a discussion about the change at the ATS Summit and ask for
   feedback.

## Health report: 
 - We are continuing to stabilize the 7.1.0 release and a couple of large
   companies are running it in production on a limited number of servers.
   We will be making the first release candidate within a week.
   
## PMC changes:
 - Currently 39 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Sagara Gunathunga]

Web Services Report for April 2017

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to SOAP/XML based 
Web Services that can be shared by different implementations. Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, 
and others use parts of the technology created within Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite mature.   
As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.  
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixes, and there are 
at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure the project can continue to produce 
releases as needed.   Since SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of 
the art, we don’t expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new committers, etc...

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)


Releases this period:

WSS4J - implementation of WS-Security and related technologies
    * 2.1.9 - Apr, 2017

Last releases for other technologies:
   *  Axiom  1.2.20 : Oct 2016 (StAX-based, XML Infoset compliant object model)
   *  XmlSchema 2.2.1 : Feb 2015  (XML Schema model)
   *  Neethi 3.0.3 : Jan 2014   (WS-Policy implementation)
   *  Woden 1.0M10 : Sept 2015  (WSDL 2.0 implementation)



Notes : 
- As mentioned during the last report in detail, WS projects are very stable and mature hence can't expect any drastic development around these project. 
- PMC and community are relatively small but active, additionally PMC is maintaining good level of diversity. 
- Releases happen frequently and there is no  issue getting required PMC votes (more than 3) on time. 
- User questions and security concerns are not very often but once they arise community act fast.
