 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       A verbal report was given:

         Significant discussion occurred around fundraising in the lead up to
         the face to face referenced in the President's report.

         Discussion also occurred around the implementation of brand policy
         as covered in earlier months. This was distilled down to 5 points to
         clarify the board's position.

         Concerns were raised over whether the board held a singular vision
         for the foundation, and that this at times posed difficulty in
         working together. Several directors voiced a need for the board to
         meet face to face early in the new term to ensure these concerns
         were addressed.

         I have observed times when individual directors are interpreted as
         speaking for the board whenever they give feedback or raise an
         issue. I've reiterated that board actions occur in the context of a
         meeting.

         Aside from these discussions, the focus has been on the upcoming
         annual meeting. I'd like to take a moment to thank the board for
         their service to the Foundation over the past year!

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall
       =======

       My current priorities remain: budget, fundraising, EA/TAC, then Brand
       Management.


       Budget
       ======

       Thanks for the input last month on the FY22 budget projections.  Based
       on that input, I am going to presume that the board is OK with
       expenditures as they are, specifically that infrastructure staffing
       levels remaining where they are, for TAC to continue for the next few
       years, that the choice of trademark attorney are all OK.

       Please let me know ASAP if any of these assumptions are incorrect.

       Otherwise, I look forward to presenting a FY18 budget in the next
       board meeting that should hopefully be uncontroversial.
       

       Fundraising
       ===========

       We continue to be under forecast for revenues; this is now a growing
       concern.

       There also doesn't seem to be a common understanding of what an
       appropriate "SLA" would be for responding for sponsor requests.  As an
       example, one sponsor provided early input into what information they
       would like to see the next time their sponsorship was up for renewal,
       that input was ACKed, and the plans were to comply with that request
       when it was time for renewal - which is not for several months.
       Apparently, this was not well communicated as a number of people were
       unhappy that a response was not sent out promptly.

       I'll work with Hadrian and others involved with fundraising to make
       this process more transparent and predictable.  The target is to make
       progress on this by the meeting in Miami in May.

       We have a F2F planned for the 23rd of March in Virginia; graciously
       hosted by Capital One.  Agenda will be to build a plan to get us to
       the fundraising targets provided by the board last month, and any
       remaining time left in that meeting will be devoted to process.


       EA/TAC
       ======

       EA continues to work on TAC and dealing with things that might
       otherwise fall through the cracks like CSC renewal.

       Last call for ApacheCon NA 2017 closed on March 8th.


       Brand Management
       ================

       Per my direction, Brand Management is continuing to defer working
       with PMCs that either don't recognize or aren't following the
       documented policy.

       I could understand if the board felt they needed to step in and
       ratify and/or give a stamp of approval if there was a history of
       Brand Management destroying communities or not accepting feedback,
       and if the President wasn't resolving this situation; but to preemptively
       require prior approval without that history doesn't make any sense to me;
       particularly coming literally one day after the board came to consensus
       that the Brand Management policy is indeed ASF wide policy. 

       Now an additional two months have gone by.  There has only been cosmetic
       feedback on the policy; and a good faith effort has been made to address
       this feedback.  What does it take to get this to closure?

       In addition to being a significant impact on morale, having policy
       that only applies to some but not all PMCs is not a sane strategy.

       My recommendation remains that the board reaffirm the position made two
       board meetings ago, and go further: namely to clearly delegate the
       setting of Brand Management policy with the understanding that (a) all
       members are welcome to contribute to the development of the policy, (b)
       early warning is provided to the board on all significant changes
       and/or potential issues, and (c) the board reserves the right to step
       in should Brand Management and the President prove to be unwilling or
       unable to successfully resolve issues with PMCs on their own.

       Unless the board comes to consensus on how to proceed in the next few
       months, I believe that it would be better for all concerned if we were
       to begin the process of shuttering Brand Management and archiving the
       current policy.  What would remain is the interface to counsel to handle
       such matters as trademark registrations; perhaps this could be folded
       into Legal Affairs?

       The consequences of such an approach would be an increase in PMCs
       inadequately enforcing their trademarks, the potential for third
       parties to be presented with different requirements from different
       PMCs, and PMCs following the lead of PMCs that chose to unfairly apply
       different policies to different third parties.

       What the board needs to balance is the demoralizing consequences of the
       delegation of responsibility without the associated authority; the
       theoretical but to date unrealized potential for an entire Brand
       Management committee composed of trusted ASF members destroying a
       community; and the consequences of letting each PMC decide how to
       approach Brand Management.

       Overall
       =======

       Adding in Bertrand's comment, Rich's ping this morning on fundraising,
       and a recent board-private thread that I won't share specifics on; and
       Chris's comment last month, there is a common theme.  But first, a
       story.

       When Geir was treasurer, he would generally make payments within a
       month of the approval.  This caused much anxiety as people would often
       worry about when a payment would go out.  When I became treasurer,
       payments would generally go out within 72 hours of approval.  To my
       surprise, the anxiety didn't go away.  On my way out, I stated to bring
       Virtual into this, and this was completed when Chris was treasurer.  One
       of the first changes made was that payments only went out at the end of
       the month unless prior arrangements were made.  For two months, there
       was confusion and anxiety... and then... calm.

       From time to time we have had individual Directors wade into
       infrastructure, TAC, fundraising, brand management, or where-ever and
       make demands.  Often times they were intended as requests, but were
       perceived as demands; and the next result was the same: context switches
       thrashes, confusion, and reduced productivity.

       Earlier this month, a single Director made a request to me, copying
       board private.  I indicated that I would evaluate the request and
       report back in May.  A number of Directors supported the original
       request, and the original individual reminded me that when the board
       asked me to do something, I had a duty to comply.  At this point, Brett
       weighed in, and stated that the board as a whole had not asked me to do
       something, and while the board could operate in that way, it should not.
       A number of Directors agreed with Brett on this, as do I.

       And I'd like to extend that response to include Bertrand's comment; yes
       the board's input was non-binding and the board can (but shouldn't!)
       change its mind at any moment.  My problem with emphasizing the CAN
       without balancing that with SHOULDN'T is that doing so has the effect
       of rendering the whole five year planning exercise as useless.  Let's
       not do that.

       I understand based on Chris's comment that he hopes that the next board
       radically changes Infrastructure's budget targets next month.  Let's not
       do that either.

       Next week, I'm bringing together some of the best talent within the ASF
       to focus on fundraising.  I will insist that the plans that they come up
       with will be published and that the board and membership in general will
       have an opportunity to comment on those plans.  I will also request
       (hopefully not futilely) that the board give this fundraising team
       something that it has to date denied of Brand Management - the
       assumption that they can operate via lazy consensus - i.e. unless their
       is a specific objection they are free to take action.

       As to how I would like to see board members operate:

         1) with respect to budget, I would prefer to only see major changes of
            direction be proposed when we discuss five year plans, and not
            out of cycle or when we review individual years budgets.

         2) we have a number of Directors productively contributing as members
            of various committees - this is welcome and encouraged.

         3) for everything else, I would prefer that the board provide its
            input during board meetings and assign and track actions to
            completion.

      Of course, if there is a true emergency or significant new information
      that comes in between board meetings or the times that we revisit the
      five year plans, I will work with the board and the relevant officers to
      address the issue.  But just like with Virtual and out of cycle payments;
      this should be the exception rather than the norm.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       * Not much changed due to short time between board meetings
       * Worked with Virtual on preparing and filing our annual 990 for FY15 and
         updated our public records
       * A first look at a long-term solution to invoice filing meeting privacy
         requirements showed that the preferred Bill.com cannot meet our requirements
         due to missing international wiring capabilities. Further discussions are
         ongoing


       Virtual Update:
        
       Here is a brief summary of the Foundation‚Äôs performance through
       February 2017. 

       Cash at February 28th 2017 was $1,476.4K, which is down $28.8K from
       last month‚Äôs ending balance (Jan 17) of $1,505.2K, due to monthly AP
       and lower than expected sponsorship pmts received for Feb 2017. The
       Feb 17 cash balance is down $194.1K from the Feb 2016 month end
       balance of $1,67.5K. The Feb 17 ending cash of $1,476.4K represents a
       cash reserve of 15 months based on the FY17 Cash forecast average
       monthly spending of $99.7K/month. The "Estimated" year-end cash reserve
       for the ASF, based on the Cash Forecast is 16.5 months which continues
       to be very healthy for an organization of ASF's size.

       Regarding the Cash P&L, the Foundation's total revenue YTD through Feb
       17 was $613.2K and is behind the ‚ÄúUPDATED‚Äù budget by $335.1K. VP of
       Fundraising is working on the $441.8K that remains in the forecast, for
       the rest of FY17, which will leave us about $34K under for the year.
       The good news is that we have enough open AR and the donation of $75K
       arrived in Mar 2017. Currently we have $332K in open AR. Sponsorship
       payment was received from ARM in Feb 17 for $40K. With regard to
       sponsorship we have the 7 sponsors we anticipate remitting payment in
       Mar and the 4 sponsors estimated to remit in April and we will be
       following up with them.

       In Feb expenses were under budget by $49.4K This was driven by under
       spending in Infra ($10K in under-spending in Staffing alone), as well
       as under-spending in Programs was under by $10K, Publicity was under
       budget by $8.4K due primarily to underspending in Press Releases
       (which we have moved forward assuming timing as the issue). Brand was
       under by $6K which we have moved forward as well and Conferences was
       under by $5K due to Hackathons which we have moved forward. With
       regard to YTD, Infra was under bud by $3K. Prog is under by $20K as
       is Publicity by $16.8K which may be timing of spending. Tac &
       Conference is under by $10.7K. Brand and Treasury are right on budget
       with G&A slightly under budget by $1.3K. Sponsorship is under by
       $1.5K and Brand is under bud by 6.3K. This leaves us YTD $59.6K under
       budget in expenses.

       With regard to Net Income, for Feb 17 we were under by $204.2K, due
       to $253.6K under in Revenue offset by $49.4K underspent in expenses. 
       From a YTD perspective we are $335K under in revenue and $59.6K under
       in Expenses so net we are under budget, for Net income by $275.4K,
       YTD. At this point we are estimating being $16K under bud in Net
       income, due to revenue being under bud by $34 and Expenses being under
       bud by $18K.

       The FY 16 990 was signed and filed on 2017-03-09.

       * More work on Hopsie and cleaning up the individual contribution page

       * PayPal re: FDIC, you can see on the summary that monies have been removed
         from PayPal.  This will continue monthly so as to protect these funds.

       * Will be Attending F2F for Fundraising 

       * At F2F will be attempting to convert our existing Bitcoins to cash using
         Bitstamp so another person can be physically present in case there are
         hiccups or complete disasters.

       * Will then sign up for Coinbase and replace any donation pages for Bitcoin
         with that.

       Mark: how confident are we in the receivables actually coming
       in?

       of Billie Rinaldi from the office of Vice President, Apache
       Accumulo, and

       WHEREAS, the Project Management Committee of the Apache Accumulo

       and discharged from the duties and responsibilities of the
       office of Vice President, Apache Accumulo, and

       death, resignation, retirement, removal or disqualification, or
       until a successor is appointed.

       Special Order 7A, Change the Apache Accumulo Project Chair,
       was approved by Unanimous Vote of the directors present.

    B. Clarify Brand Management policy

       WHEREAS recent discussions show a need to clarify how our Brand

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the following five rules apply to
       our Brand Management policy from now on and until changed by a new

       5. The escalation path for any issues (changes to policy, agreement of

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Monitoring of all email and following up with appropriate personnel when
needed.

Gearing up for ACNA‚Äô17. Collaborating with Sally and Sharan Foga on swag and
booth logistics, etc.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

Please see last month's Brand report and this month's President report.

* OPERATIONS

Short and fairly quiet month.

Lacking any significant actionable feedback, I plan to clarify and ratify the
following two policies:

- Services naming policy: https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/services

- Merchandise use policy: https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/merchandise
(public) https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/brand/merchandise.txt
(committer-only additional permissions)

A proposal to encourage (rather than prohibit) "Apache" in third party event
branding has been brought up.  As with the draft proposals above,
disappointingly little (none, so far on events) feedback has appeared.
Similarly, a call to members@ soliciting questions about Apache brands met
with resounding silence.  Will try one more time - hoping the activity around
the member's meeting helps.

* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

Still working through some complex feedback from counsel on potential issues
with registration applications.  Balancing the needs and requests of various
PMCs with limited in-house expertise and budget for counsel continues to take
effort.

A proposal for a new method of tax-deductible fundraising by licensing brands
was forwarded to fundraising@; the process is likely to take a while to come
to fruition (or to be decided against, perhaps).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities continue normally. 

Renewal invoices are sent by Lynsey on time. Besides the issue with the SLA
mentioned in the President report we have an issue with our two contact people
leaving a sponsoring company. I got a call with somebody else in the
organization and hope to be put in contact with the new person in charge.

A small group of members is currently testing a new donation channel. Thanks
Sally for taking the lead on that.

I am looking forward to the F2F meeting regarding fundraising. Thanks to
Capital One for providing the venue.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: Sally Khudairi is preparing the FY2018 budget. No vendor
payments are due at this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally continues work with Fundraising,
Brand Management, Apache Incubator, Conferences/ApacheCon, and ComDev.
She published the fourth "Success at Apache" post
https://s.apache.org/yFgQ , and has secured authors for the next five
editions. The ASF‚Äôs Q3 Operations Summary for FY2017 is in its final
edit and will be published soon. She has been actively working on the
new individual giving fundraising system and is hoping to launch in
time for the ASF‚Äôs 18th Anniversary at the end of the month. The
Apache Incubator call for a new logo is at the finishing stages, and
the winner will be announced the week of 13 March.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe: 

- 14 February 2017 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache¬Æ
MyFaces‚Ñ¢ Tobago 3

IV. Informal Announcements: 6 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 138 weekly summaries published to date. 85 items were Tweeted on
@TheASF, which has now grown to more than 40.6K followers. Nearly four
months have passed since ApacheCon Europe, and Rich Bowen and the team
of ComDev volunteers are nearing completion of uploading audio the
conference recordings onto Feathercast. Sally is closing in on
securing professional editing services to reduce production time for
future events. No new videos have been added to the ASF YouTube
channel. Sally continues to tweet for the Apache Incubator, and has
posted 18 items on LinkedIn, which have garnered more than 130.2K
collective organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: one announcement is in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing
to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success
stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at
least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 11 media queries, including two
conference speaker requests and press release reviews/signoffs by a
few companies invested in Apache projects. Additionally, Sally has
been requested to review/copyedit some articles from a couple of
projects and committers. The ASF received 1,404 press clips vs. last
month's clip count of 1,214. Media coverage of Apache projects yielded
4,687 press hits vs. last month's 3,949. ApacheCon received 21 press
hits, which we anticipate will increase with two press releases
announcing the conference program.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 3 analyst queries during this
timeframe. Apache was mentioned in 23 reports by Gartner, 8 reports by
Forrester, 9 reports by 451 Research, and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: work on the ASF Identity Style Guide
(graphics/visual/branding) continues with Fran Lukesh (one of the
designers who created the new ASF logo).

IX. ApacheCon liaison: Sally is exploring possible underwriters for a
future event in Europe. She has also been working alongside Rich Bowen
and the Linux Foundation on marketing the upcoming ApacheCon in Miami,
and has developed a new sponsorship opportunity, namely the Apache
Community Sponsor
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/sponsors/community-sponsor.
In addition, she is working with Melissa Warnkin, Sharan Foga, and Daniel Gruno
on promotional materials for ApacheCon, as well as creating new banners and a
3D version of the new Apache feather to replace the original, heritage feather
https://www.cloudsigma.com/wp-content/uploads/apache_feather.jpg

X. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally has been
reviewing several conference opportunities and is discussing with Rich
Bowen the best ways to address them.

XI. Newswire accounts: we have 22 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Highlights
==========
No Board or Executive action is requested at this time. Infrasturcture
is operating normally, without issue.


Finances
========
The Infrastructure team is working within the FY17 budget set by the
Board in December 2016. Planning for Fiscal Year 2018 has begun, based
on the five-year budget outlook prepared earlier.


General Activity
================
The Infra team has begun booking travel and hotel for ApacheCon in
Miami, in May. We will be using the conference for team education, for
interaction with the community and volunteers, and for team building
and face-to-face meetings.



GitHub as Master ("Gitbox")
===========================
Our work on enabling GitHub as the primary focal point for development
continues. As we add new projects, we've found/added several improvements
to our recording of provenance.


Cost-per-Project Reduction
==========================
Our work on reducing our per-project costs continues to be a second
priority, relative to our primary work of VM/machine migrations and
ramping-up of gitbox.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

The schedule for ApacheCon North America has been published. We have
two primary events - ApacheCon and Apache Big Data - with schedules
published at
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/program/schedule
and
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-north-america/program/schedule
respectively.

ApacheCon is further divided into mini-conferences, for the purpose of
being able to do very targeted promotion of these events to specific
audiences. To that end, we have:

Apache Traffic Server and Apache Traffic Control Summit -
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/extend-the-experience/ats-summit

BarCampApache - http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/extend-the-experience/barcamp

ApacheIoT - http://us.apacheiot.org/

CloudStack Collaboration Conference - http://us.cloudstackcollab.org/

FlexJS Summit - http://us.apacheflexjs.org/

TomCatCon - https://tomcat.apache.org/conference.html

We are depending on each of these communities to help us in promoting
these events, and driving attendance.

We announced a new type of sponsorship, where a community can band
together to put several smaller sponsorships together to create one
combined Community Sponsor. The details of this program are published
on the conference website at
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america/sponsors/community-sponsor
and we already have a few communities looking at how they might
participate in this program. We consider this critical to building
ownership of the event in our communities, even if it doesn't bring in
an enormous amount of money.

ApacheCon and Apache Big Data will be held in Miami, Tuesday May 16th 
through Thursday May 18th. BarCampApache will be held on Monday, May 
15th. The Apache Traffic Server Summit will be held on Sunday May 14th 
and Monday May 15th. These events will, all be held at the Miami 
InterContinental Hotel.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

Applications closed on schedule with 22 applications and the judges
call was held Sunday, March 12th. 

Our statistics tracking spreadsheet shows that included 6 speakers, 4
students, 13 committers, and 1 woman.

After scoring all applications, and discussing them, there are 12
applicants we'd like to bring along to Miami. That'd be 11 people
above the typical 30 score cut-off, plus 1 person only just under it.

If we brought all 12, then including OTG costs, we estimate the bill
would be around 28k. (25k plus likely contingency). This would put us
under budget, which Tom has confirmed is $32k for the rest of FY17.

12 people would a tiny bit lower than Vancouver or Seville, but about
at our long-term average. The judges didn't feel lower scoring
applicants should be brought, and there was no desire amongst judges
to lower the cut-off bar this time beyond the one "just under" score
applicant.

Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Marvin Humphrey]

After considerable debate, the ACE license has been added to "Category
A".  It is a BSD-style license with extra verbiage describing the ACE
project's history; no concerns have been voiced that the extra verbiage
materially changes the meaning of the license.

An earlier recommendation resolving a complex licensing issue with the
Incubator podling MADlib was reaffirmed.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Allura Project  [Dave Brondsema]

## Description:

Apache Allura is an open source implementation of a software forge, a web site
that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, wiki pages,
blogs, and more for any number of individual projects.

## Issues:

- No issues needing board attention.

## Activity:

- Development has been quieter this past quarter, but still moving along
  (security fix, small features added, some fixes, etc)
- Kenton Taylor added to PMC
- A few users with questions, and some potential GSOC students starting to get

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Bahir Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Bahir provides extensions to distributed analytic platforms such as
Apache Spark and Apache Flink. Currently Bahir provides extensions to
multiple distributed analytic platforms, extending their reach with a
diversity of streaming connectors and SQL data sources.

Community Activity:

Apache Bahir community has been actively working on supporting and enhancing
previously available Apache Spark extensions and also creating new ones such
as the new structured streaming extension for MQTT. The community is also
actively keeping up with the Apache Spark release cadence, aiming to provide
compatible releases with the minimum time interval.

Apache Bahir has also integrated various extensions for Apache Flink
analytical platform.  Currently, the following extensions are available in
Apache Bahir : ActiveMQ, Akka, Flume, Netty, and Redis connectors.

Also, based on some internal discussions/feedback, the Apache Bahir PMC has
sent an e-mail to all the Spark Committers that were listed in the original
Apache Bahir proposal given them the Ability to reply with any concerns that
they might have. The PMC will report if it hears anything but after a few
days, we have not received any feedback.

Last, but not least, there were couple feedbacks around the project mission,
and we will be discussing the matter and providing a more community driven
feedback on the next report.

Issues:

* No known issues

Releases:

03/05/2017 - Bahir 2.1.0
01/28/2017 - Bahir 2.0.2

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Davor Bonaci]

## Description:

Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:

There are no issues that require the Board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

Apache Beam was established as a top-level project at December‚Äôs Board
meeting. This is the third in the series of three consecutive monthly reports
for new projects.

Since last month's report, we have started work on the next release, version
0.6.0. This will be the first release with the new Python SDK, a highly
anticipated component that opens up a new user community. Pipelines built with
Python SDK currently run on a limited number of runners, but work is ongoing
to extend runner support.

Beam continues to interconnect additional execution engines and data
storage/messaging systems. Since the last report, IO connector for Apache
HBase has been contributed, and additional connectors for Redis, Apache
Cassandra, Apache DistributedLog, Apache Parquet, Apache Solr, RabbitMQ, and
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) are in progress. The work has resumed
on the Apache Gearpump (incubating) runner.

Going forward, the main focus continues to be on the community growth,
particularly users. Beam will be covered at 6 major conferences over the next
2 months, including 2 talks and a tutorial at the upcoming Apache: Big Data
North America 2017 conference.

On the technical side, the next major milestone is the availability of the
first stable release, which will include backward-compatibility guarantees.
This stabilization effort has started recently.

## Health report:

The community continues to grow steadily, as follows:

- The number of contributors continues to increase.
- Releases continue at a regular pace of 1-1.5 months per release.
- Mailing list activity continues to increase significantly.

## PMC changes:

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

The threat of moving the project to the attic is ongoing with further
concerns expressed on the long term viability of the project.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 15 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in December 2016.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

Community & Development
=======================

The addition of Dammina Sahabandu to the PMC has had a positive effect on
the development activity and, together with Ryan Ollos, there is evidence
of work going into the project.

In particular, over the last few months there has been an ongoing effort
to clean up work from previous GSoC projects for merging into the main
project. One of these, a wiki macro to manage multiple tickets creations
within the wiki view, has been completed and merged.

There is currently an expectation for further new feature branches to be
examined and brought into the project over the next few months.

The project is also looking into the possibility of involvement with GSoC
for 2017 with projects being proposed. This has led to interest from some
prospective students to get involved with the project. If this comes to
fruition it could have further benefits for the Bloodhound project if it
is possible to translate such interest to new PMC members.

Activity on the user list remains negligible.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matt Benson]

## Apache BVal Report March 2017 ##

 - The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
   specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project
   of the foundation on February 15, 2012.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

 - None to speak of this quarter, which is normal for BVal: occasionally
   there is a frenzy of activity to effect a release, but these are
   punctuated by relative silence. As mentioned in previous reports, the
   specification process for Java Bean Validation 2.0 proceeds and seems to
   be nearing completion. There will be a resumption of activity in this
   project in response to that.

## Health report: 

 - The project staff remains busy elsewhere, for the most part. BVal is
   curated on a obligation basis more than anything else at this point. It
   is perhaps not the ideal scenario for project health, but it remains
   tenable.

## PMC changes: 

 - Currently 14 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Romain Manni-Bucau on Mon Nov 18 2013 

## Committer base changes: 

 - Currently 14 committers. 
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.
 - Last committer addition was Romain Manni-Bucau on Sun Jun 23 2013 

## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 1.1.2 on Wed Nov 02 2016 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - The following statistics reflect the ebb in activity subsequent to the
   previous release.

 - dev@bval.apache.org:  
    - 44 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 7 emails sent to list (75 in previous quarter) 

 - user@bval.apache.org:  
    - 53 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months): 
    - 4 emails sent to list (3 in previous quarter)

## Description: 

   Apache CloudStack (ACS) is an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) cloud
   orchestration platform.  ACS manages many types of hypervisors, storage
   and networking devices.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Commons Project  [Gary D. Gregory]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

There were two overall plugin releases this quarter. An overall plugin
release usually consists of all, if not most, of our  22 plugins. This
number was the same as last quarter.
 
We had three platform releases - two patch releases for Android (6.1.1 and
6.1.2) and one major release for Windows (5.0.0). Android patch releases
were to fix a CI issue, and a security issue, respectively. The major
Windows release introduces a major change in resource-file behavior and adds
WinMD + C++ based DLL combination support for plugins. There was no iOS
platform release this quarter, with ongoing work to release version 4.4.0 in
the coming weeks.
 
We had a minor tools release of the CLI version 6.5.0 which updated Android
platform pinning, as well as including minor fixes. We are planning a major
release of the tools (version 7.0) in the coming months.
   
## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green. The
badges that are red are general flakiness and unreliability of the CI
environments that we use, which we are trying to track down. We are running
into roadblocks with using Apache's account on Travis CI, where pull
requests usually don't start until more than 24 hours later:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-13634 which slows down
evaluating contributions and iterative development.

We still have a huge backlog of Github Pull Request activity, same as last
quarter -- but it has improved. We would have liked to have direct access to
Github to manage these issues better, instead of the workaround we have now.
Our JIRA issue resolve rate has vastly improved as well.

Our goal for plugins release is to have one per week as a cadence, and we
have failed to do so again this quarter. We have done work on streamlining
this so it will improve in the future.

Attachment T: Report from the Apache Falcon Project  [Srikanth Sundarrajan]

ABOUT
Falcon is a data processing and management solution for Hadoop 
designed for data motion, coordination of data pipelines, 
lifecycle management, and data discovery. Falcon enables end 
consumers to quickly onboard their data and its associated 
processing and management tasks on Hadoop clusters.
 
ISSUES
There are no issues that require board's attention at this time.
 
STATUS
After months of effort, user space extensions or recipe feature is complete
and is planned in the upcoming release 0.11. Falcon 0.11 should be released 
in early Apr.
 
Backlog metrics Feature has been pushed, which enables users to view the 
backlogs on dashboards. Falcon Shell has been added giving shell utilities 
to Falcon CLI. The upcoming 0.11 release also includes some resource 
optimization fixes. Entity updates with effective time feature and feed 
retention based on instance production time are being considered for the 
release following 0.11.

As project activity had declined in the recent past (there has been a 
uptick since the last report), the PMC is looking at ways to grow the 
developer and user community. PMC discussed and agreed to adopt a uniform 
and simple committer invitation criteria (as recommended by CO50), as 
there were challenges and subjectivity in our earlier approach.  Also 
we as a project are focusing to improve documentation and promote the 
project in events to invite more developers and contributors further.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES

- Apache Flex FalconJX 0.7.0 was released on 9/7/16.
- Voting still underway for Apache Flex SDK 4.16.0.
- Preparing to vote on Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.3.

- Apache Flex SDK 4.15.0 was released on 1/9/16.
- Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.2 was released on 11/16/15.
- Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
- Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
- Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
- Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was released on 6/23/15.

ACTIVITY

The past three months saw further increase in committer activity
around FlexJS.  FlexJS is the next generation of Flex that provides
application developers with a highly productive framework and tool chain for
developing web apps, mobile apps and desktop apps.  Traditional Flex
applications require Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes (or tools to pre-compile them to
Android/IOS).  FlexJS applications output HTML/JS/CSS and can even be used to
create Apache Cordova applications.

Christofer Dutz has taken the lead on the first ever FlexJS Summit at
ApacheCon NA in Miami.  About 6 other PMC members have helped to get the word
out, and proposed talks.  One new company announced on the dev list that they
are planning to attend.  So far, no other new names have stated that they will
attend.

A few new names have appeared on the mailing list, indicating that interest is
up.  There is at least one person we are watching as a potential committer
candidate.

COMMUNITY

- Last committer as added on 9/5/16.
- Yishay Weiss was added to the PMC on 1/20/17.
- Latest analytics include a little less than 1000 hits per day on the website
  during the work week (less on weekends).
- There were more than 16000 installs of Apache Flex 4.15.0 since its release
  in January 2016.
- More than 115,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.  Tour De
  Flex is a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex
  applications.

TRADEMARKS

- A company is promoting a software product called Flex that appears to be
  related to themes/styles for website visuals. Despite several attempts to
  contact them, they have not responded. The ASF VP Trademarks sent them an
  email on 11/3/16.  I did not see a response and their website is still up.
  What is the next step?

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming
data analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine. Flink's stack contains
functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in Java and Scala and libraries
for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects in the broader
ecosystem of data storage and computing, such as Apache Beam (incubating),
Hadoop, Kafka, HBase, Cassandra, and others.

ISSUES

  - There are no issues that require board attention.

STATUS AND ACTIVITY

  - The project continues to have quite a high activity, with many
    contributions both for complex long-term features, and small usability-
    and bug fixes.  We are growing the committer base in order to keep up
    with the contributions.

  - While additional committers are helping in many of the user-facing
    components, there are still some more low-level components where
    expertise naturally takes a bit longer to spread. The committers keep
    working with more contributors on those parts to help with that.
  
  - The PMC is currently in progress of adding another member. The vote has
    passed, currently waiting for the board notice period before extending
    the invitation.
  
  - After the previous release, the community discussed and decided to
    switch to a strictly time-based release policy. That makes it
    more predictable for both users and contributors. The initial
    interval was decided to be 4 months, which would mark the next
    release at mid May.
  
  - The community has started to gather issues for the bugfix releases
    1.2.1 and probably 1.1.5
  
  - There has been a long discussion (not fully concluded) how to make it
    easier to working on Flink libraries (Graph Processing, Complex Event
    Processing, Machine Learning). Some issues are teh large code base and
    the increasingly long build times. Other discussions are how to foster
    activity in those specific components.

  - The Program for the upcoming Flink Forward conference in San Francisco
    has been announced. There will be talks by users and committers about
    use cases, technology, community participation, and ecosystem
    integration.
  
  - Aside from the talks at Flink Forward, there will be presentations about
    Flink at Strata, Dataworks Summit, Kafka Summit, and other conferences.

  - The results from a Flink survey by data Artisans have been shared in a
    two part blog post. The link to the results was was shared over the
    user/dev mailing lists.


COMMUNITY

We are in the process of adding a new PMC member.
The latest PMC addition was July 2nd, 2015 (Maximilian Michels)

Committers added since the last board report:
  - Kostas Kloudas was added as a committer on February, 5th, 2017 
  - Jark Wu was added as a committer on February, 9th, 2017 
  - Stefan Richter was added as a committer on February 9th 2017 
  - Kurt Young was added as a committer on February 21st, 2017 

Flink currently has 28 committers and 16 PMC members.

RELEASES

The following releases were made since the last board report:
 
  - 1.1.4 was released on December, 21st, 2016 
  - 1.2.0 was released on February 2nd, 2017 

ACTIVITY ON JIRA / MAILING LISTS

Both user@f.a.o and dev@f.a.o lists are very active, with mails getting
answered by a mix of committers and non-committers.

JIRA continues to be very active 
(713 JIRA tickets created, 630 JIRA tickets over last 3 months)

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Alan Cabrera]

## Description: 
Apache Geronimo is a JEE6 certified open source server runtime that integrates
the best open source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes that meet 
the needs of enterprise developers and system administrators.
   
## Issues: 
 - We are concerned with the lack of community activity

 - A large number of patches from the IBM‚Äôs WAS Liberty application server 
   product was incorporated into Geronimo's Yoko CORBA sub-project.
   Many thanks to David Jenks, Joe Chacko, and Neil Richards.
 - The community is actively discussing possible pivots for the project.
   
## Health report: 
 - Traffic is relatively low, until the community began pivot discussions.
 - There seem to be a number of very realistic viable options for Geronimo 
   that don't include a JEE7+ TCK.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 42 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added since 2014

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Giraph Project  [Avery Ching]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

No changes compared to the last quarter, the service is humming along.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

This has been a very quiet quarter for Gump. Gump seems to remain
useful for the projects using it.

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

log4cxx2

Logging for C++. N.B. This is a reboot of the Log4cxx podling which previously
graduated.

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create a release
  2. Activate some community
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There is an ongoing discussion since first quarter 2016 about how to deal
  with this project, because no release happened yet and there's only little
  activity regarding development and support. Especially no release is a
  problem for incubating projects.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  One support question, no new project members.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Robert Middleton finished his attempt to move the project to use C++
  smart pointers instead of the former used custom implementation. That
  work needs to be tested and integrated upstream, but there's no time plan
  currently on when this will be done.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  It seems this project has run its course in the incubator. The Logging PMC
  needs to decide what to do with the project.

Mnemonic

Apache Mnemonic is an advanced hybrid memory storage oriented library,
we've proposed a non-volatile/durable Java object model and durable
computing service that bring many advantages to significantly improve
the performance of massive real-time data
processing/analytics. developers are able to use this library to design
their cache-less, SerDe-less and native-direct computing high
performance applications.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Apache releases: we have release version 0.4.0-incubating
  2. Integrated with Hadoop as Mapreduce Input/Output formatters.
  3. Introduced Mnemonic to potential developers and users.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our last report was in Dec. Since then

  * Two more developers are going to contribute code.
  * We need to encourage more discussion on the dev list in the coming months

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Upgraded MemChunkHolder/MemBufferHolder to DurableChunk/DurableHolder
  * Provided mnemonic-hadoop-mapreduce module with testcases
  * and other bugfixes, features, improvements

        As project already exists in the public, this incubation is about
        moving the development over without stopping the momentum of the
        project, and then learning about the Apache development processes.
        Previous conversations were Slack/GitHub-issue based, so making
        decisions on the email list will be the first likely adaptation. A
        dependency on ZeroMQ will be the primary discussion point for a first
        release at Apache.  PPMC list is still low on subscriptions, with
        less than half of the PPMC members subscribed.

Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together on
the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both Hadoop
and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Nurture dwindling developer community
  2. Expand Myriad user base, get feedback from production deployments
  3. Release new versions (0.3 in progress) with new features

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  Participation is dropping, as developers are busy with other projects. When
  should we consider retiring from the incubator?

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * dev@ mailing list had 41 messages since the last report. 1 new user, 4

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * 1 PR and 1 JIRA closed.

ODF Toolkit

Java modules that allow programmatic creation, scanning and manipulation of
OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

ODF Toolkit has been incubating since 2011-08-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Get companies backing up the project as part of a commercial story, to
     get a long-term momentum
  2. Do recurrent releases - some semi-automation would be helpful - for the
     3rd party users

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We have a lack of active mentors. Sam Ruby resigned due to switch of
  personal focus.  Mentors have not signed the past two reports, not answering
  on direct mail. Overworked?

  A general issue of the project is that it 'just' a toolkit of an office
  file format, which in addition is far from leading on the business market,
  so likely never being used by the mass market - a very niche product.

  Still the toolkit seems to be working well for most common use cases, but
  is repeatedly updated by developers on changes of the ODF, like Red Hat
  developers enhancing the ODF validator as part of LibreOffice regression
  tests (e.g. out-of-the-box running on http://odf-validator.rhcloud.com/)
  most often quite ahead of one of the international ODF Plugfests -
  http://odfplugfest.org/2016-paris/programme/. 

  Since there are still some game changing features in the pipeline (e.g.
  collaboration) which are expected to strengthen the acceptance and develop
  the community but on the other hand the mentorship / infrastructure of the
  project could be better, a decision needs to be made on the future.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A company stated their commitment to the ODF toolkit and works on
  contribution to the project.

  We are working on the next release including the fixes and planning a
  follow-up release adding new features.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Problem with Windows build bots were solved. 

  Build tested with JDK 6 to 8 under Windows and Linux with JDK 8.

  Preparing a release after a long time to allow newcomers to rely on
  state-of-the-art features.

OpenWhisk

OpenWhisk is an open source, distributed Serverless computing platform able
to execute application logic (Actions) in response to events (Triggers) from
external sources (Feeds) or HTTP requests governed by conditional logic
(Rules). It provides a programming environment supported by a REST API-based
Command Line Interface (CLI) along with tooling to support packaging and
catalog services.

OpenWhisk has been incubating since 2016-11-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Moving github repos under the Apache Github Org (organization move,
     repository renames), first 2 repos. moved; issues identified and being
     worked.
  2. Working to redirect openwhisk.incubator.apache.org to openwhisk.org,
     update openwhisk.org to be Apache compliant (pre-req is repo. move
     completion so that we can generate site via Jenkins/Apache tooling)
  3. Working through project incubation checklists on CWIKI
     Compliance Checklist for OpenWhisk.org website

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  - Travis CI takes hours to process a PR on Apache Org; whereas it takes
    minutes under current OpenWhisk org.
    - The root cause is that Apache has 185 repos enable with Travis[1], but
      only an allocation of 30 concurrent builds. OpenWhisk typically needs 5
      concurrent build slots by itself continually.
  - Many of the OpenWhisk‚Äôs repos. have cross-build dependencies (primarily
    for Travis CI tests) this may will cause issues as repos. are brought
    over 1 at a time if forwarding links are not preserved by GitHub.
  - There may be issues with Committers in China being able
    to enable 2FA since it does not work with their cell phones and the
    alternative encryption tool seems to be blocked. Investigating with 
    infra.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Committers have begun enable 2FA for GitHub and enable cross-
    authentication to their Apache accounts using GitBox.
  - ‚Äúdev", ‚Äúprivate‚Äù email list traffic continues to be healthy; positive
    discussion of a few new code feature/change topics
  - GitHub project ‚ÄúStars‚Äù = 1144 (up from 1024 last month).
    - a few new contributors in package deployment tool repo.
    - more active discussions occurring on ‚Äúdev‚Äù list.
  - Created new public Slack Team (openwhisk-team.slack.com). includes
    channels:
    - ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù for general project questions and help
    - ‚Äúdev‚Äù channel where notifications of all OpenWhisk GitHub Issues are
      posted.
    - ‚Äúdev-pr‚Äù channel where notifications of all OpenWhisk GitHub Pull
      Requests are posted.
    - Note: all development related discussions are directed to our ‚Äúdev‚Äù
      mailing list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Updating existing project code scan tools used in Travis CI to check for
    ASF license header in files.

       slowly making progress.

--------------------
Pirk

Pirk is a framework for scalable Private Information Retrieval (PIR).

Pirk has been incubating since 2016-06-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community to establish diversity of background and expertise.  
  2. Establish a formal release process and schedule, allowing for dependable
     release cycles in a manner consistent with the Apache development
     process.  
  3. Add to and improve the Pirk user documentation and examples both on the
     website and in the codebase

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Yes. The Pirk community participation and growth has stalled over the last
  few months.  Recently, there's been discussion on the mailing lists about
  retiring Pirk for now.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The Pirk community has not developed since the last report - no new
  contributors or committers have been added

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has stalled - the existing community has not been active nor
  has the community grown.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  The podling will not be seeing any activity in the near future, and the
  consensus has been to retire the podling for now.

        As noted in the report and observed in the community contributions
        and discussion have stalled. Discussions to prompt engagement have
        revealed that availability to contribute for much of the original
        team is no longer available.  It is my opinion that retirement should
        be pursued given the range of community growth for the past few
        months and stated lack of intent to turn that around soon.

        It's sad to see the discussion about the low recent activity quickly
        change into a a discussion about retirement. I was hoping that the
        previously active podling members would have taken some steps to
        grow, but it seems like their priorities have shifted elsewhere. Pirk
        had been doing quite well and is very interesting software; it's a
        shame to see it moving to retirement.  Sounds like retirement will be
        pursued in the coming month.

  [X](pirk) Suneel Marthi
     Comments:
     
        Based on recent discussions on Mailing lists the consensus has been
        to retire Pirk for now, in large part due to unavailability of the
        full set of initial committers that can steer this project forward.

  [X](pirk) Tim Ellison
     Comments:
     
        Pirk had a very promising start, with the community exhibiting all
        the right behaviors, including being able to gain consensus on an
        early initial release.  The initial committers are critical to the
        future of Pirk due to their specialist knowledge, and there has not
        been sufficient time to fully grow new members who can cover their
        role.  With their withdrawl it is unfortunate but inevitable that
        Pirk be retired.  The discussion is taking place on the dev list as
        expected.

Quickstep

Quickstep is a high-performance database engine that is designed to exploit
the full potential of hardware that is packed in modern servers. The initial
effort targets single-node in-memory environments.

Quickstep has been incubating since 2016-03-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Building a Quickstep community.
  2. More adoption of the Quickstep technology.
  3. No releases so far.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Members of the community have become more aware about the release process.
  The details about the release process that we plan to use are well
  documented so that future releases will be smooth and more frequent.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We are working on our first release. Since the last report, we have done
  the following: 

  * We have made several changes to the code base. Some highlights are:
    Cleaning up the third party library code as per the Apache hygiene,
    improve the code performance by adding several novel features.
  * Preparation for release: Created scripts and step by step procedural
    documentation for how to make a Quickstep release.
  * Scripts have been added to the main repo while documentation is on
    confluence.
  * We went through several release candidates.
  * During this period, we identified some usability issues on our supported
    platforms and fixed them.

        Lots of effort going into the first release - it's taken a while, but
        it's very welcome! The community is getting better at having
        discussions on the list (and not just about code). Have not seen many
        potential new committers so far, but the release should change that,
        and the project is starting to become more outward looking.

Spot

Apache Spot is a solution stack that provides the capability to ingest IT
related telemetry (network flows, domain name service information and proxy
server logs) and provide unsupervised machine learning capabilities to
identify suspicious activity.  The information is organized and presented
using operational analytics so that a security analyst can investigate the
most suspicious connections. Apache Spot is built on an open data model using
Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Move infrastructure and development to ASF (code, issues, mailing
     list, ...)
  2. Build diverse community
  3. Demonstrate ability to create releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Based on initial feedback, process for issues was updated on the project
  website, with primary objective to facilitate the workflow and interaction
  with Community, and having diverse ownership of them until resolution.

  Slack channel has become very popular, however in order to adhere to ASF
  official communications channels, those conversations that involve quick
  question will be kept there, any extended discussion on code, pipeline, and
  architecture, are being ported to Dev mail list.
  
  There has been a concern to get continuous improvement of the UI on Apache
  Spot, committers have been working on process to get UX interviews that
  help to understand and address community and compliance needs.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project got a major architecture change in order to remove CSV‚Äôs,
  offload storage from the OS file system and instead leverage HDFS (for
  distributed architecture).

  Per community request through JIRA issue, and in order to facilitate the
  installation/adoption of the project for scale deployments, an installation
  script consolidating the ones that were built per pipeline component has
  been pulled to repository, it will reduce the complexity of porting files
  and configuration variables, by having a central point of deployment.

  Open Data Models, which serves as a framework for data sources
  normalization, initially for ingestion, was ported through its
  Specification to the project repository, this will bring more contributions
  to facilitate the design of the NoSQL table, and then determine technology
  selection through discussion and voting through mailing list.

        Taverna dev@ has been quiet for this reporting period. The podling
        is trying to establish which parts of the total software grant to
        take through the incubator process into a TLP. There are still parts
        that have not been released or at a minimum checked for IP.

        The active PPMC membership is low and it would be better to work on
        community growth to provide a stable PMC as a TLP.

        Activity has stalled a bit in the drive towards graduation, as some
        (perhaps tedious) IP review remains. Ambition levels might need
        adjustment, e.g. don't include all repositories in graduation to
        TLP.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  John D. Ament:

    The concerns about IP review may be valid, but there seems to be a disconnect
    on community graduation vs code graduation.

       The project from a technical point of view is doing well. I am trying
       to get the participants really grok TheApacheWay, as there is still too
       much "corporate think" in the project, and things are done seemingly
       randomly. The GitHub workflow is also something that I worry about,
       since it makes the mailing list look like a commit log and not really a
       community discussion forum. There is some who listens and trying to get
       their colleagues to understand. This doesn't seem to be a language
       (Chinese) issue as much as a GitHub culture issue. These guys love
       GitHub issues and pull requests. But I am hopeful we will get there.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Jackrabbit Project  [Michael D√ºrig]

## Description: 
   The Apache Jackrabbit‚Ñ¢ content repository is a fully conforming
   implementation of the Content Repository for Java‚Ñ¢ Technology API
   (JCR, specified in JSR 170 and 283). The Jackrabbit content 
   repository is stable, largely feature complete and actively being
   maintained. 
   Jackrabbit Oak is an effort to implement a scalable and performant 
   hierarchical content repository as a modern successor to the Apache
   Jackrabbit content repository. It is targeted for use as the 
   foundation of modern world-class web sites and other demanding  
   content applications. In contrast to its predecessor, Oak does not 
   implement all optional features from the JSR specifications and it 
   is not a reference implementation. 
   
## Issues: 
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity:
   Apache Jackrabbit Oak receives most attention nowadays. All 
   maintenance branches and the unstable development branch are 
   continuously seeing moderate to high activity.

   Apache Jackrabbit itself is mostly in maintenance mode with most of 
   the work going into bug fixing and tooling. New features are mainly
   driven by dependencies from Oak. 

   This quarter saw the 4th major release of Jackrabbit Oak (1.6). 

   There is an ongoing effort to stabilise our continuous integration 
   (Jenkins) infrastructure. The deployment of the Jira plug-in resulted
   in further insight and improvements. It also revealed that over 25%
   of the issues are caused by infrastructure problems rather than 
   our project. 

   The PMC is currently evaluating the impact of the recently published
   SHA-1 collisions on our products. 

## Health report:
   The project is healthy with a continuous stream of traffic on all 
   mailing lists reflecting the activity of the respective component. 

   There is a wide range of topics being discussed on the dev and user
   lists as well as on the various JIRA issues. 

   Commit activity was moderate to high this quarter with a plunge around
   the Christmas break.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Karaf Project  [Jean-Baptiste Onofr√©]

## Description: 

 - Apache Karaf provides a very modern and polymorphic container,
   multi-purpose (microservices, OSGi, etc) powered by OSGi.
   
## Issues: 

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 

 - We released first version in our new main serie: 4.1.0. It's a new major
   version. A 4.1.1 fix release is in preparation.
 - New release of Karaf Cellar and Decanter are in preparation.
 - We are beginning the work for a full JDK9 support, we expect to achieve the
   result in release 4.2.0

## Health report: 

We can note an increase in user community recently, probably due to new Karaf
adoption in products or other projects.

We are watching new potential PMC members, a format discussion and vote will
stand on the private mailing list pretty soon.

Talks have been proposed at ApacheCon NA. As several committers will be at
ACNA, we plan to organize an informal event (like a dinner).

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description

Apache Labs exists to incubate small and emerging projects from ASF
committers.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

In the past few weeks I have started a series of actions intended 
to determine whether there is any interest from committers or a section of the
committers in reforming Labs to make it relevant. If this activity comes to
nothing the project will be closed down.
  
## Health report: 

Lack of activity does not imply a lack of health, the PMC and 
committers include experienced and active members and committers, however
prolonged inactivity coupled with limited visibility and an offering that is
not fit for purpose do raise questions about the viability of the project.

I have recently started some activity to identify volunteers and 
gauge whether or not there might be any value in revising the service. 
If there is not enough volunteer activity generated by this to 
sustain the project it will be retired.

My own opinion is that a vibrant Labs community could be an asset 
to the ASF, and to our committers, but as with all things ASF this 
will require volunteer energy.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache OFBiz Project  [Jacopo Cappellato]

## Description: 

Apache OFBiz is an open source enterprise automation software project

## Issues:

there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

 - the project made a major design change by splitting OFBiz into two
   products: OFBiz framework and plugins. The two products are placed in two
   repositories with the intention of having different releases and support
   cycles for each. The purpose of this change is to reduce the complexity of
   the core product by providing a uniform extension mechanism through
   plugins. This allows for more functionality without the need for a
   monolithic code-base. More details can be found in this thread [1]
 - new features, improvements and bug fixes have been contributed and
   integrated into the official code base
 - refactoring and stabilization of source code repository is ongoing
 - the activity in the mailing list, official blog [2] and Twitter account [3]
   is steady with a monthly blog post and frequent tweets
 - the PMC has defined and published a policy to govern and limit marketing
   messages operated by third parties on the OFBiz lists [4]
 - the PMC is addressing specific trademark violations with good results;

## Health report:

the project is stable and active: users questions are answered in the
users list and proposals and design are discussed in the dev list; the PMC
is monitoring the community to identify potential committers and PMC members

## PMC changes: 

 - Currently 19 PMC members. 
 - Deepak Dixit was added to the PMC on Fri Feb 24 2017
   
## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 42 committers.
 - New committers:
   - Swapnil Shah was added as a committer on Mon Feb 13 2017
   - James Yong was added as a committer on Fri Mar 03 2017
   
## Releases:

 - Last release was 16.11.01 on Sun Nov 27 2016

## Mailing list activity:

mailing list traffic is relevant as usual

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description:
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0. The latter is
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC.
   
## Olingo Status
Currently Olingo has no issues that would require board attention.
As stated within the last board report a release for the 4.4.0 code line
was scheduled for the end of December. Since there have been no major 
feature updates the release was not produced.
This is mainly due to the library being mostly feature complete and the 
fact that the new OData 4.01 specification is not yet released. Once the
new specification is out there should be an increase in commits again.

The V2 code line had a 2.0.8 patch release in January. There the work is
in an ongoing maintenance mode. No new features have been introduced. The 
changes where mostly bug fixes or convenience methods.

We have seen more JIRA issues with patches lately that follow the guidelines
the PMC specified on the hompage. Those patch contributors could be potential
new committers. I will include an update on this in the next board report.

Overall the Olingo project can still be considered healthy. The number of
users on the mailing list is steadily growing and questions get answered 
by other community members. 

Questions/Remarks from last report:
  mt: It has been a while since the last new PMC member or committer
      was added. Does the PMC have any thoughts on growing the
      community?
New contributers, committers or PMC members are always welcome. Yet they 
should also show a certain knowledge of the specification before they 
are given commit rights. I personally could not point out someone like 
this for now. Once a person like this appears the PMC will certainly 
invite him. In the last board report I gave my personal opinion on 
why I think that we see such few people. 

idf: Thanks for addressing the previous board report comments.
rb: Thanks so much for explicitly responding to questions from your
      last report. This is hugely appreciated.
Thanks from my side as well. This feedback mechanism is very valuable 
for me to see what kind of information the board needs.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Tom Barber]

DESCRIPTION

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

- Last release was 1.0 on Wed Jun 29 2016

We resolved 0 issues for this release.

Development on Apache OODT has been pretty quiet over the last 9 months, but 
we have recently accepted a large new feature into our code base and are 
currently working at incorporating that into the mainline branch so that we 
can run a release with the new features in place.

On top of that there has been renewed discussion over the last week or so 
over the state of Apache OODT development and what we need to do to move 
forward with the 2.0 roadmap. This has been organised and we should be 
seeing increased development activity over the coming quarter.

COMMUNITY

Latest committers and PMC members
Radu Maonle(radumanole) on 11th Oct 2015 as committer and PMC member

Last committer and PMC member added on 11th October 2015.

No new users have spoken up on the mailing list recently, but there 
has been some interest and patches committed by a volunteer via Jira 
so we will be working at bringing them into the project.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

HEALTH REPORT

The project activity is pretty quiet, but there are still on going efforts 
in place to help drive wider adoption.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description: 
 Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
 "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
 specification which is defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0) and CDI-1.1
 and CDI-1.2 (MR) specifications (JSR-346).

## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
 We released a few maintenance versions plus a small OpenWebBeans 
 + Tomcat + CXF + Johnzon based Micro server called Apache Meecrowave.
 Aside from that it was a rather unhasty month. 
 We expect high activity again when finally kicking off the work on
 CDI-2.0.
 We also supported the HotswapAgent community with creating ha-OWB support.
 This happened mostly on IRC. I would have preferred to channel this via
 the mailing list, but there was a lot of Questions back%&forth which
 was easier to do on IRC. I'll ask the involved guys to also create
 a bit of documentation on the mailing list and probably on our web 
 page.

## Health report: 
 All fine I think.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Description: 
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability
   features of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the
   Java platform.

Issues: 
  There are no board-level issues at this time.
   
Activity: 
  Activity remains low, but there was a bit of an uptick this quarter from
  last.  A familiar user returned asking about a new release, which has still
  not happened, but definitely could happen this quarter.
 
Health report: 
  Definitely a "stable" product looking for new blood.  I think there are
  several directions we could go, but I have no significant time to devote.
  I will start some discussions soon on the "dev" list about these ideas.
 
PMC changes: 
 - Currently 4 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

  in activity. As noted above, one long-time user returned asking for a
  new release; that discussion is ongoing.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Polygene Project  [Niclas Hedhman]

## Description:
Apache Polygene is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented
Programming for domain centric application development.

## Issues:
Apache Zest has successfully transitioned its name to Apache Polygene, and all
interactions with infra team was smooth and went much better than expected. All
tasks related to the name change were captured in
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/POLYGENE-195 for future reference.

## Activity:
The name change spurred a lot of code activity, intersected with remaining
issues for the 3.0 release, which has been a bigger chunk of changes than we
were prepared for, hence the delays. But we will get there eventually. With one
of the most capable build systems at ASF now in place, we expect that future
releases will be frequent (by our standards).

We have also been participating in the JDK 9 Outreach program from Oracle,
where we have been asked to test against Early Releases. Our 2000 tests run
well in "legacy mode", but in "jigsaw mode" we are not compatible and have
not enabled the CI build.

## Health report:
The http://reporter.apache.org tool went a little bit bananas after the name
change, and we had some fairly high negative number of health in it. Quite
amusing in itself. Development activity was normal for our project, with a
small, typical slowdown over the holidays.

We are aware that we need to be better at capture the few interested parties
that shows up on occasions and convert them to contributors.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Kent S√∏lvsten on Tue Sep 22 2015

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 18 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

## Releases:

 - Last release was apache-zest-java-2.1 on Fri Jul 31 2015

## Mailing list activity:
The two emails on users@ is still our good old friend Rich making
announcements. We don't list that mailing list anymore, as infra suggested
to keep it for symmetry reasons.
Many mails on dev@ lists are Jira tickets related to the name change.

 - users@polygene.apache.org:
    - 19 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 2 emails sent to list (0 in previous quarter)

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Nick Kew]

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In
addition, the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had
a release since 2007.

## Issues:

   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - There has been above-average activity (for this project), as reflected
   in higher-than-usual traffic on the dev list.  This has comprised
   several substantive technical discussions, and a brief discussion
   on the (legacy) problems of bundling a third-party library (expat).

## Health report:

 - Nothing to report, except as above.  Health is unchanged.
   A new release of APR-1.x is needed to bring a backlog of activity
   into a released version, including unbundling expat.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 40 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Christophe Jaillet on Sun Oct 30 2016

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 66 committers.

 - Last committer addition was Ivan Zhakov at Fri Oct 28 2016

## Releases:

 - Last release was 1.5.2 on Wed Apr 29 2015

## Mailing list activity:

 - The increased traffic to dev@ is a modest spike in regular activity:
   several extended technical discussions.  There is no reason
   to suppose it predicts future activity levels.

 - dev@apr.apache.org:
    - 339 subscribers (down -9 in the last 3 months):
    - 219 emails sent to list (41 in previous quarter)

 - bugs@apr.apache.org:

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

### Issues

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

### Activity

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

During the last period we have released the final release 7.0.0 of ServiceMix
7, which is based on Karaf 4.0.x and includes numerous new features. In the
new period we are going to focus on the further development, stability and
maintenance of ServiceMix 7.

We have also released the version 5.6.3, which was the last scheduled version
of ServiceMix 5, which has been transited to EOL.

We're not expecting too much dependency updates to become available for the
6.1.x, which is currently the only active branch of ServiceMix 6, but we do
plan to keep our release schedule going with the 6.1.x releases.

During the past period we have also released 4 sets of OSGi bundles and a new
release of Depends Maven Plugin.

We plan to keep a steady release schedule and keep up with new fix releases of
our dependency projects.

Our goal for the next months is also to improve the documentation and
examples, which is our still outstanding theme.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Sidney Markowitz]

Apache SpamAssassin report to board for March 2017

SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. The project provides a
framework/engine and regular rule updates that reflect the changing nature of
spam email seen in the wild. Updated rules are generated through a combination
of hand crafted contributions and automated processing of spam and anonymized
processed non-spam that are contributed by volunteers.

Health report:

The status of the project is basically unchanged from the last report, a 
mature project that is not in rapid development. The users mailing list is
active with user level questions and responses from people with expertise in
SpamAssassin. There is moderate activity on the developer mailing list and
Bugzilla. Questions are answered in a timely fashion and bug reports are being
addressed.

We have had a modest increase in the number of volunteers who submit sample
mail to our mass-check rule generation system.

Issues:

Two computers that the project has been using to support our mass-check rule
generation and updates are scheduled to be shut down soon (mid-March). Kevin
McGrail (KAM) has been working on getting the replacement VM ready and moving
data and processes to it. We expect a report from him soon on the
de-provisioning of the old machines.

Releases:

KAM has volunteered to be release manager for SpamAssassin 3.4.2. We will
start the formal release process after he has completed the machine migration
and de-provisioning that we mentioned in the previous section.

Committer/PMC changes:

There were no changes in membership in committers or PMC in the last quarter.
However we are very pleased to welcome Kevin McGrail back to active
participation in the project.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description: 
 - Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system.
 
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
   
## Activity: 
 - The community continues to advance toward a 1.1.0 release. That release
   has been delayed due to a number of necessary bug fixes and packaging
   changes aimed at reducing the file size of the distribution. We expect
   the packaging changes to be completed soon and followed by a release.
 - Discussions regarding a roadmap for the 2.0 release are beginning and are
   expected to pick up once the 1.1.0 release is out.
 - Developer interest in the Apache Beam runner for Storm seems to have 
   waned a bit. There is interest in a Storm runner from the Beam community,
   so we may persue moving that effort to the Beam community similar to how
   the Flink and Apex runners were developed. 
 - There are a number of presentations covering Storm at the upcoming 
   Hadoop/DataWorks Summit Munich in April.
   
## Health report: 
 - Overall the project continues to be healthy and we are seeing new 
  faces show up and contribute.
 - Activity on the dev@ list has picked up as the community works toward the
   1.1.0 release.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Mick Semb Wever]

## Description:

 Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for Java
 applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to simplify the
 development of user interfaces. 

## Activity:

 Apache Tiles remains a stable but low traffic project. 

 This quarter there has been a little more public activity. A couple of
 small fixes. A couple of improvements and upgrades. And more community
 involvement. No releases were cut, but one is now warranted.

 Responsiveness on the ML dropped this quarter.

## Health report:

 There are currently two responsive PMC, other PMC help out with votes when
 needed.  Everyone is aware of the how little momentum the project has, but
 it does not feel abandoned by members, nor not in use by the public. There
 is room to add another committer to the project.

## Issues

 Further effort is required to increase health to the project.  Previous
 board report received feedback on what such effort might be.  This remains
 unaddressed by the community, although a new individual is contributing
 patches.

 Past ideas remain: from including the StackExchange traffic, following up
 on some of the development ideas, to publicity and engagement with other
 communities that have more momentum in the UI space.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description: 
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 
- Code for the upcoming release is just about complete.
- The most significant new feature is support for automatically joining an
  Active Directory domain when a Windows image is loaded. This is complete
  but needs a bit of testing.
- Work continues on documentation. We are starting fresh using a VCLDOCS
  Confluence space created long ago but never really used. This is making it
  easier to keep track of what has been reworked rather than trying to
  update and sort out all of the old, disorganized pages. Pages will be
  moved en masse once enough content has been updated and organized to
  surpass the old docs.

## Health report: 
Overall, the health of the project is fair but could be improved. I think
there are a few factors that have limited the appeal of potential
contributors:
- Poor documentation. Hopefully our updated documentation will increase
  interest. This alone, however, won't likely make a huge difference. There
  are other projects with poor documentation that draw a respectable amount
  of development contributions.
- Staleness. The codebase does not use any of the modern frameworks of the
  month. It's basicly old fashioned PHP and Perl. There are some JavaScript
  components, but these mainly use the Dojo Toolkit which seems to be losing
  popularity. We could think about a significant rewrite and use things such
  as Angular, Laravel, etc.
- Marketing. The project began at NC State University and still has a strong
  NCSU relation. Years ago, leaders at NCSU along with colleagues at IBM did
  a great job spreading the word about VCL to other universities and
  contacts. Many of these people have either retired or moved on to other
  roles. Regardless, NCSU's past marketing is appreciated but this is the
  PMC's responsibility. We need to work to think of ways to make the project
  more attractive to contributors and to communicate it. Someone recently
  mentioned VCL in a thread on a higher education list hosted by Stanford. I
  have alerts set up for such occurances and responded with additional
  information. We should do a better job monitoring other lists and venues
  including other ASF projects for opportunities. VCL also integrates with a
  number of other technologies. There may be opportunites to have the
  project included on other website's such as the "Applications using
  libvirt" page. [1] This will be discussed by the PMC members.

## PMC changes: 
   
- Currently 7 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Releases: 
   
- Last release was 2.4.2 on Wed Apr 15 2015

## Mailing list activity: 
   
- Mailing list traffic is essentially flat. Dev list traffic increase is
   due to the final tasks to prepare the release. User list traffic is down.
   This could partially be due to the holidays.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Wicket Project  [Martijn Dashorst]

Report from the Apache Wicket project [Martijn Dashorst]

Apache Wicket is an open source Java component oriented web application
framework.

## Noteworthy items:

- Andrea del Bene is now a release manager
- 8.0 inches closer to a final release
- CVE-2016-6793 Apache Wicket deserialization vulnerability solved

## Releases this quarter

We have issued the following releases: 1.5.17, 7.6.0, 6.26.0, 8.0.0-M3 and
8.0.0-M4.

## State of the project

The project has gained a new release manager: Andrea del Bene who has
performed the last couple of releases since ApacheCon EU.

Discussions regarding our 8.0 release are ongoing, respectfully and based on
technical exchanges on the dev list. While no date has been set for a final
8.0 release, it seems we are getting closer to do so.

We keep an eye on our community for new committers, but as the project is
quite stable not many new developers are joining the ranks.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Sean Busbey]

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and
release processes for software projects.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD'S ATTENTION

Last report we were asked if we had identified candidates for
committers and PMC additions, and specifically if we were being too
conservative. The PMC has slowly been discussing candidates; we are
probably still being too conservative. As chair I'll be pinging on
this issue again this month.


RELEASES

The community released version 0.4.0 on January 9th, 2017.

ACTIVITY

No new PMC additions in this period; our last PMC addition was Ajay
Yadava on Dec 1st, 2016.

No new committer additions in this period; our last committer
additions were Andrew Wang and Ajay Yadava on Sep 20th, 2016.

The community has had roughly the same low level of activity during
this period as last. Working through the 0.4.0 release revealed some
gaps in our process documentation that caused us to lose some energy
that could have been put towards being responsive to our contributors.

As previously mentioned, I'm looking to rotate the PMC chair some time
in the next reporting period.

STATS

- Currently 8 PMC members
- Currently 10 committers
- dev list has 41 subscribers (flat from previous period)
- 22 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 9 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache ZooKeeper Project  [Flavio Junqueira]

## Description: Apache ZooKeeper is a system for distributed coordination. It
enables distributed systems to implement a variety of primitives and
mechanisms that are critical for them to function, e.g., distributed locks,
master election, group membership, and configuration.

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity: 
The community has been very active on the discussion of issues as we can
observe by the number of messages sent to the dev list. This number is
actually larger compared to the previous period.

We have also been receiving a few security reports over time (one in the last
period) and have needed to act upon them. Our community is still a bit
immature with respect to dealing with security, which mainly stems from the
fact that Apache ZooKeeper has traditionally assumed that it runs behind
secure boundaries, and only recently security has become of greater interest
to our users. We are making progress on learning how to deal with such
security issues and reports, though.

As for releases, we have been discussing two releases for a while, 3.4.10 and
3.5.3, but unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt happen in this period. The PMC expects
at least one release to happen in the upcoming period.
 
## Health report: 
We have added two new committers and one new PMC member. The dev activity is
high, while the user activity is steady. We have not had high activity on the
user list in the recent past, mainly because of the nature of the project.
Users of Apache ZooKeeper tend to be interested in its internals and questions
are often sent directly to dev.    


## PMC changes: 
  
- Currently 12 PMC members. 
- Rakesh Radhakrishnan was added to the PMC on Fri Mar 03 2017 
  
## Committer base changes: 
  
- Currently 21 committers. 
- New commmitters: 
   - Mohammad Arshad was added as a committer on Mon Jan 23 2017 
   - Michael Han was added as a committer on Tue Dec 20 2016 
  
## Releases: 
  
- Last release was 3.4.9 on Sat Sep 03 2016 
  
## Mailing list activity: 
  
The dev list activity has increased compared to the last period. There is no
special reason for it to happen other than interest of contributors and
committers being more available to interact with the community. As we
mentioned above, the traffic of the user list has been steady for quite a
while. Members of the Apache ZooKeeper community tend to ask questions
directly on the dev list as they are often interested in the internals and
contributing as well.
