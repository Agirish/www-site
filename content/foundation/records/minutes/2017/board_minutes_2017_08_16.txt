 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       I spent some time this month writing up some details about scripts and
       running meetings that the Chairman needs, and spoke with Phil about
       transitioning over to him. I'll be working with him over the next
       couple of weeks to ensure everything is handed over, as I'll be
       travelling for two weeks at the beginning of September.

       I still need to send some follow up material from our face to face in
       that time as well.

       I'll be speaking at DataWorks Summit in Sydney on the Apache Way in
       September.

       Thanks for having me as chair for the last 4 years, it's been great!

    B. President [Sam]

       My current priorities: EA/TAC/Conferences

       Items requiring board attention:

         Fundraising is planning to revisit the idea of Directed Sponsorships.
         Perhaps we can have a brief discussion on the topic at the board
         meeting, take the discussion to the fundraising mailing list, and
         return back to the board at a later date with a complete proposal?

       - - -

       Financially, we continue to be on track.  FY18 looks great, but again I
       remind everybody that the amount we are projecting to be over almost
       exactly matches the amount that we missed in FY17 due to timing issues.
       It has taken a lot of work to get us here (and both Sally and Virtual
       have been instrumental).  We continue to find low hanging fruit in terms
       of unbilled sponsors; but at some point further growth in revenue is
       going to depend on the harder (and longer lead time) problem of
       attracting new sponsors.

       Quiet (in terms of questions) but busy (in terms of renewals, etc.)
       month for Brand Management.  Lack of volunteers is an ongoing issue.

       Seeing if we can utilize our EA better remains on my todo list.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a brief summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first
       three months of FY18. 

       Cash on July 31th 2017 was $1,789K, which is down $53K from last
       month’s ending balance (Jun 17) of $1,842K, due to the timing of
       Sponsor pmts vs payables.   The July 2017 cash balance is up $35K from
       the July 2016 month end balance of $1,754K.  The June 2017 ending cash
       balance of $1,789K represents a cash reserve of 15.4 months based on
       the FY18 Cash forecast average monthly spending of $116.5K/month. The
       ASF reserve continues to be very healthy for an organization of ASF’s
       size, with an FY18 YE estimate of 13.3 month’s cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong showing
       against our FY18 Budget.  Revenue YTD is $604.4K vs a budget of
       $240.2K.  This was due to the Platinum Sponsor payments for Google,
       Comcast (upgraded to Platinum from Gold) and Microsoft which had been
       forecasted to arrive later in the year.  This has us for revenue,
       $364.3K ahead of bud through July 2017.  So with the $604.4K of
       Sponsor revenue received so far in the first three months of FY18 we
       are more than 55% to our budgeted Sponsor revenue goal of $1,084K for
       FY18.  We are also now forecasting with the remaining sponsorships,
       and the Coinbase base revenue to be about $176.8K ahead of the $1,084K
       FY18 budget, if the sponsors that were budgeted for the last 9 months
       of FY18 all renew and pay.

       YTD expenses are under by $23.9K.  Infra is over by $4K and the other
       depts. combined are under by $27.9K. I would caution that we are only
       three months into the current fiscal year so it is still early yet. 
       In our forecast we have pushed some expenses that have not been spent
       yet, “ahead” in the year and we will follow up with dept heads
       accordingly.

       With regard to Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $273.4K NI vs a budgeted negative $114.7K NI or $388.1K ahead
       of Budget for the first three months of FY18.  With the forecasted
       revenue ahead of budget due to the Pivotal and Microsoft FY 17
       payments as well as the Coinbase funds coming in FY18 and expenses at
       $23.9K under Budget at this point we are estimating a $31.7K positive
       NI for FY18 vs a budgeted NI loss of $167.8K.  While it is a fantastic
       start and we should very pleased with all the hard work that everyone
       has put into the FY so far, it is still a bit early in the FY at this
       point and this forecast could change if we take our eye off the ball.

       KAM NOTE: Discussed with Tom and this report and the financials
       reflects accrual for payments authorized in July but paid Aug 2
       because of the approval process.

       Asst Treasurer Report:

       - A few more bitcoin monies donated.  Was able to easily convert to
       cash. $1005 confirmed received yesterday.

       - DMCA Filing for ASF Agent is Done.

       - Requested an Engagement Letter to Move forward with the Audit.  This
       will be for FY17 because I forgot we are already in FY18 as discussed
       at the last board meeting.  Thanks to Tom for reminding me.

       - Payoneer Signup was completed by Uli for GSOC

       - Benevity continues to pay dividends and we got an $800 donation
       unsolicited

       - CDARS - Virtual has gotten the information and it is perfect.  See
       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEiVU1Kyl14 for more info about CDARS.
       Uli, Tom & I will confirm an appropriate amount to leave in
       operational checking and the amounts to tie up in CDARS but they can
       be done at very short, revolving intervals so liquidity can be
       maintained.

       - Greg Stein identified some oddities with Spare Hardware cost center.
       Virtual is working with him to fix how it’s recorded.

       - We are renewing the NPO Management Liability policy currently in
       force.  This covers Directors and Officers Insurance and Employment
       Practices.  

       - Credit Card with a lower foreign transaction fee - Lynsey got
       Citizens to lower the Foreign fees on the current card, and is working
       on changing the current cards to Small Business cards in the next
       month or so.  UPDATE: Citizens is now waiving all the foreign fees 
       and that they will be crediting April-July on the Sept statement.
       Kudos to Lynsey.


       Previously Reported Items Still Tracking:

       - Contribution Language for Car Donations - No update 

       - Payment Privacy changes to move away from Dropbox, etc. Virtual will
       be documenting what they do now which is working - No update since
       last meeting.

       - Network for Good - Missing a $125 check - Will ask for a reissue. No
       Update

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       I am looking to improve the IP Clearance process documentation which
       has raised a few questions recently.

       In July, 84 iclas and one grant were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastructure

       In process of renewing our binary signing service with Symantec,
       requires a new "authentication" of the business. This has highlighted
       that while our D&B records reflect our new Wakefield postal address,
       but many other third-party records are out of date. If anyone sees an
       incorrect listing please notify our EA to have them corrected.

       Gitbox usage is being expanded to more users. Edge cases still being
       discovered so mass migration is still a long term, rather than short
       term, goal.

       Marketing and Publicity

       Starting to see immediate results from having VP Marketing tasked with
       assisting in sponsorship activities. 

       Business as usual with respect to press and analyst engagements.

       Conferences

       We have a booth at All Things Open. Conversations are ongoing with
       respect to involvement in other events / meetups. Conversations also
       ongoing with respect to alternative conference producer arrangements.

 8. Discussion Items
    
    A. Appointment of Chairman

    At the face-to-face meeting in June, succession of the chair was
    discussed and Phil Steitz agreed to accept the position. 
    By general consent, Phil Steitz is appointed Chairman.

    B. Appointment of Vice Chairman

    By general consent, Jim Jagielski is appointed Vice Chairman.

    C. Article about Apache OpenOffice https://lwn.net/Articles/729460/

    Bertrand: do we want AOO to make public statements about the level
    of activity on the project?

    Rich: it would be good for them to make a public statement

    Chris: no strong opinions about this, but this is not the normal way
    the board interacts with PMCs

    Ted: the issue is the difference between user activity level (downloads)
    and code activity level

    Shane: most of our projects have technical users but AOO users won't
    necessarily know e.g. that security questions may an issue in
    the future

    Bertrand: maybe we should ask them to publish a blog post about the
    status of the project

    Brett: what is our objective? discourage downloads?

    Ted: is either a blog or a disclaimer going to accomplish the
    objective?

    Bertrand: we should have a public statement to make people aware

    Jim: no matter what we do, some people will want more. we should go
    public; ask the PMC to make a statement of direction so end users
    understand what is happening with the project

    @Jim: follow up with the PMC to get a public statement out

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.


* OPERATIONS

A quiet month in terms of specific trademarks@ questions, although there are
still some open questions to address.  We still have not succeeded in
attracting sufficient (or much at all, really) new volunteer energy or
assistance in answering questions.

Website Analytics show an average of about 120 users per day, the vast
majority from direct URLs, not from links or referrals.


* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

A *very* busy month in terms of registration renewals and other legal
paperwork related to registrations (more than a dozen issues), including
several questions involving counsel about specific agreements around
individual project marks.

One bit of good news is our opposition to a conflicting FLEX mark in the EU
was successful, with the other party deleting conflicting claims.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

-Meetings with Virtual continue semi-monthly while we sort out foundational
issues and continue the transition to KAM as the VP.  As reported previously,
we have identified large sponsors that have not been billed.  If those
sponsors had renewed and paid, we are easily in excess of ½ million missed
potential revenue.  It should be easily defendable that the expense of having
Virtual onboard solely based on these missed sponsorships. 

- Launching a fundraising website similar to treasurer to help things be more
transparent

- Launched a fundraising-private committee mailing list so sensitive
information can be discussed with appropriately accessible archives.

- Have gone through the data in SVN foundation/Fundraising and archived old
stuff and created a plan for other items

- Have audited with Virtual the list of sponsors that they have vs what we
have on the sponsors page.  As noted anecdotally, we’ve missed a LOT of
sponsorship over the years by simply failing to invoice.  But we’ve been doing
a good job of recapturing sponsors and in some case even getting some back
monies.

- Using Google Apps NPO edition for Apache for Fundraising work but will
implement so any project or initiative can use it.  Planning for
gsuite.cloud.apache.org for flexibility for things like aws.cloud.apache.org
or huawei.cloud.apache.org to be added down the road.

- Working on identifying inkind sponsors

- Revised Slide deck is coming along.  Sally has been instrumental as always. 
Targeting 8/21 for Ready to Send.  

- Support inclusion in tech in concert with Media -
https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/success-at-apache-meritocracy

- Monitoring the spam messages for fundraising continues to identify potential
sponsors being blocked.

- I'll be attending All Things Open on ASF behalf

- I’ll be merging Infra Sponsors into a Directed Sponsors tier as the start of
the directed sponsorship idea and to more fairly and equitably recognize
different in-kind sponsors.  Infra is looped in.

- Requested ASF Credit Card with 5K limit in process.

- For directed sponsorship, Sam, please ask the board to individually give
ideas to me of:

Things that shouldn't/should be done and a sentence of why/why not
& 
Things that shouldn't/should be done and a sentence of why/why not

Examples: case studies, coding, bug bounties, speeches, sysadmin work, legal,
trademarks, infra NOTE: Please do not assume historical knowledge such as "the
ASF doesn't pay for programming".  It'll be codified in this policy so mention
it.

With this feedback, I'll prepare a proposal for the board for directed
sponsorship to then discuss from there.

- I'm gelling that the sponsor thank you event will be good in new york.  I
was thinking about asking Google to host because I know them and they might
cater as well.  And I can use the opp to leverage Justin's offer to help meet
/ invite with some wall street sponsor candidates.  As discussed on
fundraising, I think the thank you will be for sustaining benefactors who have
given more than 500K to the foundation over the years.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule with no vendor payments
due at this time.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: work with ASF Fundraising continues, with
Sally Khudairi reworking the pitch deck and leading Sponsor
engagement. She has helped bring one Gold Sponsor up to term, and has
had budgeting/renewal meetings with four Sponsors. One Platinum
Sponsor’s billing and payments have been made current with
invoicing/accounting support from Virtual. Rich Bowen and Mark Thomas
have been supporting Sally with the “Sponsor Ambassador” program; a
total of 22 Sponsors have been engaged thus far. Work continues on
individual giving and donor outreach. Sally has also been working with
some Sponsors that are actively involved with some projects in the
Apache Incubator, much of which has involved project promotions and
marketing.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 1 August 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation announces Apache®
Polygene™ v3.0
- 26 July 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
Fluo™ as a Top-Level Project 

IV. Informal Announcements: 6 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 160 weekly summaries published to date. We tweeted 30 items, and
have 43K followers. 6 items were posted on LinkedIn, which garnered
more than 28K organic impressions in total.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 7 media queries. The holidays
have been challenging in coordinating a few press interviews, some of
which were still not scheduled despite being requested weeks or months
before. The ASF received 1,599 press clips vs. last month's clip count
of 765. Media coverage of Apache projects yielded 1,302 press hits vs.
last month's 2,870.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 3 analyst queries during this
timeframe, including an ongoing Cloud briefing that we have been
involved with over the past 3 years. We also had an inadvertent
timezone glitch with a podling briefing a top-tier analyst firm; this
proved problematic as 26 other analysts and researchers were invited
to participate in the call. Sally has taken on a more active role in
coordinating briefings and interviews to minimize such occurrences.
Apache was mentioned in 58 reports by Gartner (including 4 Magic
Quadrant and 50 Hype Cycle reports); 3 reports by Forrester; 17
reports by 451 Research; and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: Sally finalized the design templates for ASF business
cards, which were printed for VP Fundraising. The templates will be
added to ASF Committer-accessible resources.

IX. ApacheCon liaison: we will continue to support VP Conferences as
ApacheCon evolves.

X. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: we are exploring
participating at various events as exhibitors and/or community
partners.

XI. Newswire accounts: we have 10 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017; any unused
announcements will be applied towards our new contract that ends in
December 2019.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
No Board-level issues at this time.

Finances
========
The InfraAdmin has been working with our Accounting team to clear up a
workflow and invoice issue with one of our vendors. Our vendor will
now sending invoices directly to Infra for review and approval.

Operations Action Items
=======================
We have a service contract with Symantec for signing binary releases.
That contract expired in June, and we are working to re-up signings
for the next year. This has been hampered because we need to
"authenticate" our business according to new rules from the CA/Browser
Forum. We are also switching the primary contact point to the
InfraAdmin and our VP Infra email address, to provide backstop points
on contract/renewal issues. The authentication process is involved,
but is progressing. With some hope, it will be solved by end of
August.  This service is primarily used by our Apache OpenMeetings and
Apache Tomcat PMCs.

Per above, our D&B records reflect our new Wakefield postal address,
but many other third-party records are out of date. These need to be
updated to ease verification of our business.

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Complete our LDAP schema changes, and server layout.
  - The schema changes have been performed in conjunction with the
    Apache Whimsy development team to provide tooling, and design
    thoughts on our updated schema. The goal is to provide a unified
    view of Incubator podlings and TLPs.
  - Our LDAP servers are configured as a multiple-master system with
    multiple slave replicas. We will be winding this to a simpler
    single-master and a few replicas layout.
- Expanding gitbox usage to more projects.
- Improved/automated monitoring via DataDog.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Moving all projects over to gitbox. We are still discovering some
  edge cases in our tooling, so the mass-migration is not "now".
- Upgrades to our Confluence and Jira installations, along with moving
  them to use Atlassian's Crowd product for single-sign-on.
- Revamp of our DNS management; see below.

General Activity
================
Over the past few weeks, we've done a lot of work with the domains
that we manage. As domains are coming up for renewal, we've been
moving them to Namecheap. However, this process will likely accelerate
as Namecheap provides API-based facilities that can help our DNS
management. After some testing, it appears that we can defer/diminish
our DNS work by shifting those functions over to Namecheap.

Lots of work has been done to ensure that our historical/archival
mailing list content is correct. Thanks to Sebb and Gavin for the
grunt work to make this happen. In addition, the team is now reviewing
what remains to declare lists.apache.org as the only service for
archive access (and turning off mail-search.a.o and mail-archive.a.o).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

We will have a table/booth at All Things Open, and have had a good response
from people willing to staff that presence.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

No issues to report at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

There was a request from EFF to appeal the directors decision to have
EME (Encrypted Media Extensions) in HTML proceed to REC status. In W3C
process, an appeal is heard if it passes an initial vote where 5% of
the member organisations vote in favour of hearing the appeal.

The Foundation voted to hear the appeal (discussion on members@).

The request for appeal passed comfortably.  The appeal is being held
over 16 August - 13 September and is a vote on the original directors
decision.  ASF support for hearing the appeal is not expressing a view in
W3C on the appeal itself.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

A handful of issues highlight the report this month.

First, Facebook changed the license on RocksDB to dual-licensed
ALv2 and GPLv2 [1]. As such Legal has updated the Legal/resolved
page [2] to reflect this. Despite this specific reclassification
for RocksDB, many Facebook developed projects are still licensed
under the BSD+patents license, and as such several ASF projects
using Facebook dependencies such as BigTop have questions related
to the Facebook BSD+patents license Category-X classification. For
example, BigTop was concerned about packaging code that was licensed
under BSD+patents. Legal's recommendation is not to include such
code in Apache products as described in LEGAL-322 [3].

The discussion on RocksDB evolved into a discussion of another
popular webapp framework developed by Facebook, ReactJS [4]. Several
ASF projects use React including (but not limited to), CouchDB,
Superset (in the Incubator [5]), and other projects. If ReactJS
continues under the BSD+patents license, Legal's opinion has not
changed, and the license itself is now disallowed in ASF projects.
There is an open GitHub issue and ongoing discussion at Facebook
considering changing the license [4] initially driven by a question
from one of the Apache CouchDB PMC members.

In other news, VP Legal has agreed to take on a role as DCMA agent
for the ASF as described in LEGAL-164 [6].

Other major discussion was surrounding if binary artifacts are
officially part of a release, as asked in LEGAL-323 [7]. Clarification
from Legal is that source code is the only artifact that is actually
released by a PMC, and that existing requirements as specified on
[1] are sufficient, so documentation will not be updated.

A question asking for confirmation that 4-clause BSD being is in
category-X was confirmed.

Attachment 10: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Stats for July 2017:

We contacted Mitre to start working on the CVE backlog (where a CVE
was assigned but the information is not yet available on the Mitre
site).  Part of the backlog (where issues were public before Oct 2016)
relies on Mitre writing up the description.  The rest depends on our
projects filling in the missing information, and we started contacting
projects to get them to do that.  We'll give metrics on how that is
going in future reports.

11 CVEs issued to projects (some may not be public yet).

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Matèrne]

## Description: 
Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools. It consists
of 3 main projects:
- Ant - core and libraries (AntLibs)
- Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
- IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse Additionally Ant
provides several extensions to Ant (antlibs).

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
Set up Github integration (Jenkins-GithubPullRequests) according to infra's
blog post (use of Cloudbees Enterprise plugin). Fixed some Ivy issues.
Introduced Jaikiran Pai as new committer. Start introducing Gintas Grigelionis
as new committer. Change documentation for Ivy from Xooki to Asciidoc. Plans
started for cutting a release of Ivy. But we haven't any release date yet.

## Health report: 

For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done. But
basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development.

The Ivy-call-for-help brought two developers in our focus. They helped
bringing Ivy back to life and are willing to help further. 
The first one we invited in June 2017 and he accepted the second on end of
July 2017 and he accepted too.

## PMC changes: 
- Currently 21 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
- Last PMC addition was Jean-Louis Boudart on Thu Dec 12 2013 

## Committer base changes: 
- Currently 29 committers. 
- Jaikiran Pai was added as a committer on Wed Jun 14 2017 
- Gintas Grigelionis will be added as a committer in these days.

## Releases: 
- Compress Antlib 1.5 was released on Tue Jun 13 2017

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Deepal Jayasinghe]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description 
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing 
   
Issues
======

The threat of moving the project to the attic is ongoing. Further concerns
have been expressed about the long term viability and a further suggestion
from a current PMC member that the project moves to the attic.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was towards the end of 2014:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 14 PMC members on the project. The last changes were
in April 2017.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

The last addition to the PMC was in January 2017 (dammina)

Ryan Ollos resigned from the PMC in April 2017.

Community & Development
=======================

Work on the project has once again stagnated and the positive effect of
the last addition to the PMC has worn off. Since the last report we have
had one further resignation from the PMC with Ryan Ollos noting his lack
of time to contribute towards the project. There has also been a further
suggestion from a current PMC member that the project should move to the
attic due to the lack of community interest. This has not provoked any
further discussion.

Some limited activity has been attempted with Gary Martin's attempt to
restore the salt provisioning for the development environment which had
hampered previous efforts. Additionally with INFRA's requirement for the
migration of bloodhound vms, including the main issue tracker from old
hardware, a new vm was requested and migration to this is in progress,
albeit rather slower than desired. The initial plan of migrating to a
puppet based setup has been postponed with the intention of getting the
tracker up faster but an unexpected issue with upgrading the database
to use the latest version of Bloodhound has further delayed this work.

Activity on the user list remains negligible. The dev list is similarly
quiet with a few messages from Gary Martin discussing ideas of making
greater use of git mirrors to reduce barriers to contribution to the
project and of puppet configuration.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Sijie Guo]

## Description: 

BookKeeper is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage service optimized for append-only workloads.
It has been used as a fundamental service to build high available and replicated services in companies like Twitter,
Yahoo and Salesforce. It is also the log segment store for Apache DistributedLog and message store for Apache Pulsar.

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

- Apache DistributedLog graduates as a subproject of BookKeeper. We are consolidating the development efforts around
    log stream library over bookkeeper.
- BookKeeper moves the development including issue reporting and tracking to Github. It reduces the barrier for people
    to make contributions to bookkeeper.
- The 4.5.0 release which aims at merging 3 main branches is ready to release. The first release candidate is out on August 07.
- BookKeeper moves the website from CMS to Git. A new bookkeeper website along with tons of documentation improvements are made from contributors.
   
## Health report: 

- After a year of development among develops from multiple different organizations, release 4.5 is almost complete. The first release candidate is out for vote on August 07. It includes exciting features like security support, netty 4 upgrade, weight-based placement policy.
- We moved the git repo to gitbox and are using Github for both issue management and pull request management. It reduced the gap for new contributors to engage with the community.
- DistributedLog graduates as a subproject.
- There are a few promising candidates based on the growth of the community and contributions from joining developers.
  
## PMC changes:

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Brooklyn Project  [Richard Downer]

## Description:

- Apache Brooklyn Project is a software framework for modeling, monitoring and
managing cloud applications through autonomic blueprints.

recently. There is a regular turnover of pull requests and commits, and JIRA
tickets, showing that development is at a healthy pace and that users are
feeding back their problems and feature suggestions.
- The mailing list has been slightly quieter in the last month or two; this
is probably due to the holiday season and I assume will only be temporary.
- We continue to monitor our community for potential new committers and PMC
members with the aim of regularly adding individuals.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description: 
Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
   
## Issues: 
In progress: we are discussing the board feedback from the last board
meeting in which the board underlined the lack of activity and the
small PMC.
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6b7216eaf9ed5287461cc6355b71d2cb7141b4414c80477fd96f24ab@%3Cprivate.buildr.apache.org%3E
We're still discussing this and welcome any feedback.
## Activity: 
We have made some inroads towards a 1.5.4 release, adding Kotlin support,
better packaging capabilities and sorting through our addons.
   
## Health report: 
The activity is slow, with 2 active committers.
Little activity on the user or dev list.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description: 
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data.Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.
  
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
  
## Activity and Health: 
Overall the project is healthy. It's been about a year since the inquiry from
the board and we've continued to make progress expanding the committer base
and PMC membership while moving forward with development. 

We very much appreciate the involvement of the management, membership and
community with the resolution of LEGAL-303. The paves the way for a first
implementation of new functionality around pluggable storage engines. 

The cassandra-dtest project made it through the ASF code donation process.
This has removed a small bottleneck and source of occasional test errors by
allowing committers to commit distributed test suites at the same as code
commits to the core project. 
  
## PMC changes: 
There are currently 21 PMC members. No new PMC members added in the last 3
months. The last PMC addition was Sankalp Kohli on Mon Oct 24 2016. Note that
there are currently open votes for four additional PMC members. They should be
resolved by the time the board meets. 
  
## Committer base changes: 
There are currently 46 committers. Philip Thompson was added as a committer on
Fri Jun 23 2017. 
  
## Releases: 
The final release of the 2.1.x series was done this quarter. Maintenance
releases were done on the 2.2.x, 3.0.x, 3.11.x branches. We anticipate a
release of 4.0 in the next quarter. 
- 2.1.18 was released on Mon Jun 26 2017 
- 2.2.10 was released on Mon Jun 26 2017 
- 3.0.14 was released on Fri Jun 23 2017 
- 3.11.0 was released on Fri Jun 23 2017 
  
## Mailing list activity: The participation on the dev list was down this
quarter, perhaps attributed to summer holidays and the lack of anything 
contentious. However, user list participation was up slightly which is a good
sign of positive community engagement. 

dev@cassandra.apache.org:  
- 1625 subscribers (down -2 in the last 3 months): 
- 320 emails sent to list (474 in previous quarter) 
  
user@cassandra.apache.org:  
- 3112 subscribers (down -18 in the last 3 months): 
- 1112 emails sent to list (1107 in previous quarter) 
  
## JIRA activity:
- 230 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Cédric Damioli]

## Description:
  Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Issues:
  there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

  The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14
  A few JIRA issues opened since last report
  There's only a little activity on both users and dev mailing-lists.

  There was a final point given to an old security report (rejected as a security issue by the PMC).

  There have been some quite interesting changes since last release, at least for 2.1 branch, which would deserve a release.

  The last board feedback recommanded us to plan a release. This is definitely something we should think about, for each of our 3 branches, 2.1.x, 2.2.x and 3.x


## PMC changes:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2012-07-06

Attachment P: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
 - Seamless multi-master sync, that scales from Big Data to Mobile,
   with an Intuitive HTTP/JSON API and designed for Reliability.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time 

## Activity:
 - Released version 2.1.0, details on the blog:
   https://blog.couchdb.org/2017/08/07/2-1/ (tl;dr: a major new feature
   for users at scale, tons of post 2.0.0 bugfixes, and: 
 - Massively overhauled test suites, jenkins setup, worked with Infra around
   lots of little and gnarly issues; all this resulting in being able to
   make more reliable release in quicker succession from now on. We haven’t
   settled on anything yet, but are discussing a release per quarter plus
   security ad bugfix releases as needed. Special shout out for PMC member
   Joan “wohali” Touzet, for primarily driving this effort to success.
 - Currently awaiting Facebook’s decision on licensing their React & adjunct
   JavaScript frameworks, which are in use in our admin UI Fauxton:
   https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191 — We have discussed
   alternatives, but made no contingency plans just yet.

## Health report:
 - The project is doing fine overall. We’ll be doing a dedicated drive for
   JavaScript contributors for our admin UI after the licensing discussion
   is over, and we have more certainty about future direction. Current
   contributors are moving towards other areas of the projects, and it’s
   a great place for people to get into the project without having to
   learn Erlang.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------
No changes since the last report.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Community
---------
In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC / Commit.


Releases
--------
Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016
Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014
Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Stefan Seelmann]

## Description:

The Apache Directory TLP consists of the following sub-projects:
 - ApacheDS: An extensible and embeddable directory server entirely
             written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3
             compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports
             Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol.
 - LDAP API: An ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a
             replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap
             and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a "schema aware" API
             with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP
             servers.
 - Studio:   A complete directory tooling platform intended to be
             used with any LDAP server however it is particularly
             designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP
             application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins.
 - Fortress: A standards-based access management system that provides
             role-based access control, delegated administration and
             password policy services with an LDAP backend.
 - Kerby:    An implementation of Kerberos v5 protocol and contains
             various tools to access and manage kerberos principals
             and keytabs. It provides a rich, intuitive and
             interoperable implementation, library, KDC and various
             facilities that integrates PKI, OTP and token (OAuth2)
             as desired in modern environments such as cloud, Hadoop
             and mobile.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Rainer Döbele]

## Description: 
 - Apache Empire-db is a relational database access engine that takes an 
   SQL-centric approach in comparison to traditional OR-Mappers
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
 
## Activity: 
 - This quarter we have created new tickets for improvements in order 
   to make our the code more robust and to support new features in the 
   latest version of the SQL-Server DBMS and have already partially 
   resolved some of those issues. 
 - Additionally some bugs reported by users or committers have been
   resolved and user questions have been answered.
   
## Health report: 
 - The project remains healthy. Activity levels on mailing lists, git and 
   JIRA are low but constant among the existing community. 
 - However it is acknowledged that in order to attract new user and 
   committers an overhaul of the website and the documentation is necessary.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Fineract Project  [Myrle Krantz]

## Description: 
 - Apache Fineract (\’fīn-,ә-,rakt\) is an open source system for core 
banking as a platform. Fineract provides a reliable, robust, and affordable 
solution for entrepreneurs, financial institutions, and service providers to
offer financial services to the world’s 2 billion underbanked and unbanked.
   
## Issues:
   
## Activity: 
- Feature work includes additional reports, blocks and holds for savings 
accounts, rescheduling bulk loans, pre-defining customer sms and e-mails 
notification, improvements in credit bureau integration, support for 
surveys, and support for two factor authentication.
- GSOC interns on Apache Fineract and the Mifos Initiative are making good 
progress on their projects related to the platform.
Alex Ivanov is ahead of schedule on the Two Factor Authentication project 
under mentorship of Avik Ganguly
Thisura Philips has been making multiple pull requests to fix issues found 
during his static analysis of the code base under mentorship of Mark 
Reynolds
Sanyam Goel is continuing to integrate the APIs with Swagger for live API 
documentation under the mentorship of Aleksandar Vidakovic
Nikhil Pawar is finalizing integration with the Equifax Credit Bureau as 
part of his project under the mentorship of Nazeer Sheik.
Courage Angeh is adding in additional back-end support for our 
notifications framework to deliver staff notifications across various apps 
powered by Apache Fineract with the guidance of Pranjal Goswami.
Vladimir Fomene is implementing a brand new database design for a mobile 
money bridge integrating with Apache Fineract with support from Ayuk Etta 
and Antony Omeri

Developers from R116 with support from Mentors International have built and 
added in enhancements to building reports directly via SQL queries in the 
platform.
- The community has begun discussing taking over the Mifos I/O code base 
(https://github.com/mifosio).  This code has, from its inception, been 
intended for Apache Fineract. Still, there are a few issues that need to be 
resolved before we're ready for this.
- Adoptions and deployments of Apache Fineract in Guatemala, Germany, and 
Nigeria are proceeding along smoothly and beginning to scale on the 
platform. Members of those terms are working with the community on their 
implementations.

## Health report: 
 - The project remains healthy. Activity levels on mailing lists, git and 
JIRA remain mostly constant, or have very slight upticks.
 - Many community functions are filled by only one person.  The mailing 
list has only one moderator; all merges are being performed by one 
committer; only one committer is serving as a release manager.
 - We have 38 open pull requests stretching back over a year. We need to do 
a better job of reacting to pull requests.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Fluo Project  [Keith Turner]

## Description:

 - Apache Fluo is a distributed processing system built on Apache Accumulo.  Fluo
   users can easily setup workflows that execute cross node transactions when data
   changes.  These workflows enable users to continuously join new data into large
   existing data sets with low latency while avoiding reprocessing all data.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - Released versions of Fluo are tightly coupled with YARN+Twill for launching
   services on a cluster.  Work is currently under way to break this tight
   coupling inorder to support YARN+Twill, Mesos, and Kubernetes.
 - Fluo implements an immutable byte array wrapper in its API.  Work on moving
   this to its own sub-project is underway.  The goal of this is to create
   something analogous to String for bytes that is suitable for use in other APIs.
   This goal was discussed on an OpenJDK list and there was agreement Java needs a
   library like this until Java defines a bigger story for immutability.
 - Still working through a few gradutation task with INFRA, this is mostly done.

## Health report:

 - Within the past three months
    - 46 GitHub issues were opened and 23 closed
    - 64 GitHub pull request were opened and 56 were closed
    - 69 commits were made by 6 authors, 2 authors were not committers

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 8 PMC members.
 - Chris McTague was added to the PMC on Wed May 31 2017, after our last report to IPMC.
 - PMC and Committers are the same.

## Releases:

 - fluo-1.1.0-incubating was released on Mon Jun 12 2017
 - fluo-recipes-1.1.0-incubating was released on Thu Jun 22 2017

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description: 

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, first class functional programming support 
and runtime and compile-time meta-programming.
 
## Issues: 

There are no new issues arising requiring board attention at this time. 

On the website front, we are tracking this topic along with those 3 tickets:

- GROOVY-8181: Website move - step 1: 
   create new repositories for user and dev sites
- GROOVY-8182: Website move - step 2: 
   populate user and dev sites splitting current content
- GROOVY-8183: Website move - step 3: 
   generate user and dev sites from repo content

Of these, step 1 (previously reported) and 2 are complete. 
Step 2 involved splitting the site in two:

The developer focused site, on the typical Apache domain:
http://groovy.apache.org/ The community site (domain also owned by ASF): 
http://www.groovy-lang.org/

Some early work has begun on step 3. We are exploring how to adapt our 
current site generation scripts to work with existing Apache tools in this
area (e.g. Buildbot). As well as automating some manual steps taken to
complete step 2, part of step 3 completes the move of the website fully 
onto Apache infrastructure.

## Activity:

This quarter, 147 commits were contributed from 19 contributors including 14
non-committer contributors (12 new).
 
## Health report: 

With the progress on the build and release aspects of the project, 
our release train has increased velocity, and the community seems 
happy to see us being back on track with regular releases.

This quarter also took place two Groovy focused conferences: 
GR8Conf Europe, in Copenhagen, and GR8Conf US, in Minneapolis, 
gathering developers of the Apache Groovy Ecosystem from everywhere 
around the world.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
- The Apache HTTP Server is an open-source HTTP server for modern
  operating systems including UNIX, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS/X and
  Netware.
  
## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity: 
Three releases (two for 2.4 and one for 2.2) were cut. A lot of great
improvements in the codebase were made alongside some herculean tasks in
cleaning up old code/designs and keeping HTTPd at cutting edge. The 2.2
release also marks the last release of the 2.2 branch, save whatever
security patches may be released from now and through December 2017[1].

Among the plethora of activities in this cycle, I wish to point out a few:

At ApacheCon North America 2017 in Miami, a total of four talks were
held about HTTPd. Thanks go out to the speakers for the time and effort
put into this.

The HTTP/2 support in HTTPd 2.4 has been changed from "experimental" to
stable in future releases[2], in part to avoid confusion over the
projects use of the term "experimental" to denote modules and/or
features whose API may change but are otherwise considered stable, as is
the case with the mod_h2 and mod_lua modules.

Work has also begun[3] on a new module, mod_md, that enables on-the-fly
acquisitions and integrations of web site certificates via Automatic
Certificate Management Environment (ACME) providers such as ISRG's
LetsEncrypt.

## Health report: 
The project remains in superb health. Mailing lists are full of active and
engaged people, with many simultaneous discussions going on. The number of
committers actively contributing to the code/documentation has been steady
throughout the past two years and remains at a level of 15-20 active
committers each month. HTTPd is also seeing increased interest on GitHub even
though the project is only mirrored there. Looking at user/support activity,
HTTPd can boast a very vibrant and alive user sphere in terms of interactions
on mailing lists and IRC, as well as other fora. While we have not invited new
committers or PMC members in the past 3 months (summertime being a bit of a
lull), we are always on the lookout for new people to bolster our ranks and
help make HTTPd one of the best pieces of open source software out there.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [John D. Ament]

Incubator PMC report for August 2017

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are currently 53 podlings incubating.  July was a quieter month for the incubator, summer holidays and what not.  We executed seven podling releases this month, one podling retired but otherwise no other changes.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - None

  People who left the IPMC:

  - None

* New Podlings

  - None

* Podlings that failed to report, expected next month

  - MRQL
  - Ratis

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - None

* Retirements

  The following podlings retired this month:

  - HORN

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  July:

  - 2017-07-06 Apache Gearpump 0.8.4
  - 2017-07-06 Apaceh Traffic Control 2.0.0
  - 2017-07-08 Apache Aria Tosca 0.1.0
  - 2017-07-11 Apahce HAWQ 2.2.0.0
  - 2017-07-18 Apache Griffin 0.1.5
  - 2017-07-18 Apache Aria Tosca 0.1.1
  - 2017-07-31 Apache Guacamole 0.9.13


* IP Clearance

  - We have begun work to clean up IP Clearance policies.  First is to make it clear that the preference is ICLAs and CCLAs over SGAs.  We have also seen better responsiveness after reasserting that the IPMC owns responsibility for all incoming code donations.

* Legal / Trademarks



* Infrastructure



* Miscellaneous

  - A general issue of VPs within other cross functional areas of the ASF reaching out to podlings has started to surface.  Specifically, I would like to request that the board supports a request that those areas should be reaching out to podlings directly with issues, escalating to the IPMC due to lack of follow through, rather than approaching the IPMC first.  The Security team's model is a perfect example of what to do.

BatchEE

BatchEE projects aims to provide a JBatch implementation (aka JSR352) and a
set of useful extensions for this specification.

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase the community probably?
  2. -
  3. -

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No

How has the community developed since the last report?

Not much as expected being in between "spec" releases.

How has the project developed since the last report?

BatchEE is quite stable and therefore should probably head to graduation soon.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

     Comments: I think we should graduate indeed. 
     It seems we had some confusion with the LDAP when we added rsandtner as committer. 
     We need to scan our mailing lists and check what is missing on the official status page.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
team-list.html - this page shows no members or committers.
I checked private and it looks like the last committer/ppmc add was in Dec 2015.
User ML had questions from only one person at two different times in 2015.
There is activity and it looks like a new release may happen soon.

DataFu

DataFu provides a collection of Hadoop MapReduce jobs and functions in higher
level languages based on it to perform data analysis. It provides functions
for common statistics tasks (e.g. quantiles, sampling), PageRank, stream
sessionization, and set and bag operations. DataFu also provides Hadoop jobs
for incremental data processing in MapReduce.

DataFu has been incubating since 2014-01-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Positive IPMC recommendation vote for graduation
  2. Address any IPMC feedback regarding graduation
  3. Continue releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

* Community voted positively for graduation from Incubator.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
Project is ready to graduate. I noticed a problem with their answer to QU30 on the Maturity model.
It was in part a documentation issue. Raised it with the project and they are addressing the way that
they are asking for security issues. Raised the documentation issue with ComDev and we fixed it.

Edgent

Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime 
that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of 
all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in 
conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides 
efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the 
center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
     around the Edgent project.
  2. Attracting at least another independent committer/ppmc member.
  3. Finding further real world users of Edgent

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

    * Total, we have 70 subscribers to our mailing list, an improvement
        of 5 since the last report.     
        * We have had a noticeable increase in the number of information-seeking
        emails on the mailing list from new Edgent developers.
        * A San Francisco meetup has been scheduled for the 20th of September
    to demonstrate an Edgent video analytics application which was
        initially presented at ApacheCon 2017 (Video Analytics at the Edge: 
        Fun with Apache Edgent, OpenCV and a Raspberry Pi).
        * In addition to Chris Dutz, we have had one non-committer PR merged.
        

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * With the contributions of Christoper Dutz and Dale LaBossiere, the
        Edgent build system is undergoing an overhaul to Maven from Gradle.
        Maven provides benefits over Gradle, including a more rigid build 
        structure, and the Maven package system.
  * According to JIRA, 13 new issues were added to the project and 6 
    issues have been resolved or closed between May 2017 and August 2017.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Edgent is making slow but consistent progress towards graduation. While we
don't yet meet the diversity requirements, we put emphasis on community 
growth through outreach which will ultimately pave the way for additional
committers and contributors.

Additionally, before we graduate it is important that we find users 
outside of IBM. As most Edgent committers are employed by IBM, external 
stakeholders help ensure long term contribution to the project.

   https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@impala.apache.org:dfr=2017-2-1|dto=2017-4-30:%22has%20invited%22

Impala has done a third release with a second release manager. Two CVEs were issued, our first ones under the Apache security guidelines.

How has the project developed since the last report?

There have been big changes to the buffer pool, as outlined in https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f573698455bf2ff9ac2073c778802d0d5c9f3c8be43ede80614259cb@%3Cdev.impala.apache.org%3E . There have also been big changes landing to the RPC layer to improve scalability. Impala now has TABLESAMPLE to allow running queries on only a small percentage of the table for experimenting with queries quickly, and it now works on ADLS.

iota

Open source system that enables the orchestration of IoT devices.

iota has been incubating since 2016-01-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. An initial release of iota 
2. Building a more active community
3. Consistency in the discussions on mailing lists/ steady flow of source code
contributions

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None

How has the community developed since the last report?

@crostofolini and @rafaelweingartner are working on integrating the 
Spring framework into iota (pull request 35)

We are waiting on a jar file to be removed from the test suit so that 
an initial release of the software can be produced. (The jar file is related to 
iota tests - need committer to publish the source code - enabling us to remove the
jar artifact enabling the initial release of the software).

The initial release will proceed without the Spring Framework 
Integration. We will add this in a future release.

Ticket's are in place for the initial release.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Interest in using iota (including the Spring Framework) outside the committer group

The email reflectors for dev and users have become more active.

New functionality was added to iota - global performers.

None

How has the community developed since the last report?

The community mailing lists have seen a few new users.
Questions have been answered in reasonable time. Community 
building is probably the biggest challenge for Joshua right
now.

        The release was well organized and delivered thanks to Lewis and Tommaso, it feels to me like the Joshua developers need to be a little more proactive. As the report points out, community building is the biggest issue, I'm going to spend some time in the near future working with the PPMC to see what integrations, tutorials and demos we can do to drive developers and adoption which will hopefully expand the community.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Apache Slider community/PPMC has voted to move portions of Slider into
    Apache Hadoop YARN as modules. It is possible that the remaining pieces
    will be moved at a later point in time or become obsolete or evolve to
    work closely with YARN. Slider PPMC will decide what makes the most
    sense as we progress through this exciting time.

 2. Getting more external users

 3. Growth of a diverse set of developers/committers/PMC members is also
    crucial towards the final state of Slider

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 Mailing list activity has been lower due to the bulk of the development
 moving to an Apache Hadoop branch. Questions on usage and issues
 encountered by end users keep coming at regular intervals, keeping the DL
 fairly active.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Work continues in parallel on the Apache Hadoop yarn-native-services
 branch and on the Slider podling. The bulk of the work has been in
 yarn-native-services, while a few Slider patches (related to critical
 issues or agent-only issues) have been committed as well.

    Comments: More work happening in Apache Hadoop YARN project to finish the module move of Slider but it is opaque. Will prod the community to send periodic dev-list updates demonstrating the current progress in this process.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:

  johndament: Based on the description, as well as the little bit of information I've been able to get out of the Slider community, it seems that while there is a Slider community they're not actively working on Slider's codebase.  My recommendation is probably to retire the Slider community if they cannot be absorbed into the Hadoop TLP.

Superset

Superset is an enterprise-ready web application for data exploration, data
visualization and dashboarding.

Superset has been incubating since 2017-05-21.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community and enroll new committers.
  2. Plan and execute our first Apache release 
  3. Address the challenge that React is no longer allowed in Apache projects

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
* Superset is heavily reliant upon React, however React has the same patent clause as RocksDB, which ASF had condoned use of until RocksDB backtracked and removed that clause. Our team is concerned about the implications and we are looking for guidance (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-320)
* The team is working on finishing up all the items on the Incubation Checklist.


How has the community developed since the last report?
* Organic growth of our Github contributors (148), forks (2,153), watchers
  (770) and stars (15,075)

How has the project developed since the last report?
* The code repository now lives at https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset on Apache’s infrastructure
* We have migrated the project website to the Apache website: http://superset.apache.org/
* A healthy, constant flow of bug fixes, quality improvements and new features, take a look at the project’s Pulse on Github for more details

Unomi

Unomi is a reference implementation of the OASIS Context Server specification
currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server Technical Committee. It
provides a high-performance user profile and event tracking server.

Unomi has been incubating since 2015-10-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. During the three last months, we did bunch of bug fixes and we are preparing new maintenance release. We also working on a feature branch with major dependencies update (Apache Karaf 4, ...) and refactoring on some Unomi internals (like the tags).
  2. If we did good improvements on the user community front, we would like to increase the developer community and see more contributions.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The user community grew up (according messages and feedback we go). We think that we are getting close to graduation and we will define an action plan with the topics to address for this.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We are still preparing 1.2.0-incubating
  release including more bug fixes. 

  We also started a 2.0.0-incubating branch with major dependencies update (Apache Karaf 4.x, Elasticsearch 5.x, ...) and refactoring of some internals.

  johndament: Just for clarification, Unomi has PPMC members, not a PMC.  In addition, their website continues to use the old incubator logo.  On the flip side, activity is high on the mailing lists so I'm a bit surprised it took extra effort to get a report submitted.  Keep up the activity levels.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3)
specification for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout.
Scout is an implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries
1.0 (JAXR).

jUDDI
- All mailing lists have had low traffic this quarter with some additional out of band email traffic from one user.
- 3.3.4 Released Feb 11, 2017, maintenance and bug fixes.

Scout
- No release this period, no development took place.
- No JAXR related questions on the mailing list.

Last PMC addition and new committer April 3, 2013 (Alex O'Ree)

Last Release jUDDI-3.3.4, Feb 11, 2017
Next Release jUDDI-3.3.5, Planned for Dec 2017

There are no issues that require the boards attention at this time.

Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in all
likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.

There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to potential
security issues. There were no issue raised since the last report.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

## Description

The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache
Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all
REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.

## Issues

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity

The Apache Knox team is in the process of an active VOTE for our 0.13.0 release.
While we were going to also try and make this our 1.0.0 release there were a
couple reasons to delay this milestone. We discovered a couple issues
that required a good bit of investigation and will require rigorous testing from
the community before they can be considered properly complete and ready. We also
took a good bit of time to try and pull in contributions from the community that
many users have been looking for. Most notably in the service definitions for proxying UIs.

## Health report: 

We have continued to use the KIP-# pages to drive the primary focus of each
release and feel it is working well. The 0.13.0 release was primarily
focused on the addition of the port-mapping feature and extending UI proxying
capabilities. It also fixes a number of bugs.

The current level of collaboration is healthy and encouraging within the
community on both mailing lists and JIRAs.

## Releases

  - Last release was 0.12.0: 2017-03-20 Added support for new APIs and UIs, KnoxToken API,

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Ralph Goers]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to application logging.

Currently there are no issues which require the board's attention.

- Community

Logging Services remains an active project. The overall community is healthy 
and friendly.  
 
After combining the dev mailing lists the number of subscribers has 
continued to decline, however the amount of email traffic appears to
have increased although it is hard to tell how much since GitHub and
Jira generate a lot of noise.  
 

In general, all subprojects are still healthy.

- Project Branding Requirements

All components except Chainsaw meet the branding requirements. As noted
below, work has begun to address these issues.

- Last three community changes

 * Curt Arnold resigned from the PMC and as a committer on May 4, 2017
 * Thorsten Schöning was added as a committer on Mar 6, 2017
 * Jonathon Davies was added as a committer on Jan 8, 2017 

- Releases
 * Log4j-Scala 11.0 (Jul 23, 2017)
 * Log4j 2.8.2 (Apr 4, 2017)
 * Log4net 2.0.8 (Mar 10, 2017)   

- Subproject summaries

Log4j 2: Active. Work to support Java 9 has continued. A new release
should be available prior to Java 9 being released. A few individuals
have recently started contributing and the PMC continues to monitor
their progress towards becoming committers.

Log4J-Scala: The Scala support was moved out of Log4j into its own 
sub-project so that its needs could be better supported. While a release
has been created the web site for the project still needs to be integrated
into the Log4j and/or Logging sites.

Log4net: Moderately active with 1 recent release. Effort is being put into 
automating the build process aiming for a pipeline to automate as much as
possible.

Log4cxx: Log4cxx still has not had a new release but discussion continue
on the dev list.

Log4php: No activity this quarter.

Chainsaw: The PMC has begun to address the branding issues. A new version
of the site was generated that addresses the missing copyrights. However,
the latest artifacts (from 2006) are embedded in the web site and must
be moved to the proper distribution location. A new release will be
created to address that. Discussions have also taken place with regard to
providing better integration with Log4j 2.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache MADlib Project  [Aaron Feng]

## Description:
- The Apache MADlib is a scalable, Big Data, SQL-driven machine learning framework for Data Scientists.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- The bulk of the community activity is now focused on post-graduation tasks of promoting MADlib to the ASF's TLP status. This includes working on code base, website, wiki, and ASF infrastructure.
- We expect to finalize the trademark transfer from Pivotal to ASF within the
month of August, 2017.
- Ed Espino volunteered to drive the first TLP release of MADlib 1.12 which is expected to happen within the next couple of months.

## Health report:
The project has just graduated to the status of a TLP at ASF. The community is small but very engaged with robust mailing list traffic, interest in doing frequent releases and a bunch of new functionality being developed by contributors. The number of committers actively contributing to the code/documentation has been steady and remains at a level of half a dozen active committers each month. Since the project has just graduated we haven't had a chance to actively grow our PMC roster, but it must be noted that at this point all of our active committers are also PMC members. Of course, we will constantly be on a lookout for new community members to be invited either as committers or PMC.

## PMC changes:
- PMC has been just formalized as part of the graduation resolution
- Currently 13 PMC members.

## Committer base changes:
- Currently 13 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security
policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.7 release on
April 20, 2017.  The next major release is scheduled for August 30, 2017,
and is on track.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Markus Schuch on December 2, 2016.  The last
PMC member was Rafa Haro, voted in on August 31, 2015.  In response to the
Board's inquiry in February, we've been looking for PMC members and there are
some potential ones among our newer committers, but it's too soon to know yet.
Summer has impacted both the contribution rate to the project and the rate
of engagement.  Generally we like to see long-term interest in the project before
we offer PMC memberships.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been moderate this quarter.  Major development has been
taking place around a set of new output connectors.  Issues reported have been
centered on the Documentum connector, which surprisingly remains active without
significant modifications for most of a decade now.  I am unaware of any mailing list
question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

OCW successfully pushed out v1.2 at the end of April and is working towards our
next release. Discussion started towards the end of July on which features we
would like to see integrated, so I expect we'll see a release upcoming in the
next month or two.

Activity on the lists "bathtubbed" a good bit during this last quarter. We saw
a good amount of development in May and into June which went to near nothing in
July. Activity has started picking up a bit more in August so far, but it's
something we should keep an eye on.

We have had a few new faces over the last quarter show up. Most have gone as
quickly as they showed up, but we are keeping an eye out for people who are
sticking around so we can reach out and ask them to join the PMC/Contributors.

Issues for the Board:

 None

When was the last committer or PMC member elected:

 - Ibrahim Jarif - 26 April 2016
 - Omkar Reddy - 20 January 2016

When was the last release:

 - 1.2.0 - 24 April 2017
 - 1.1.0 - 27 July 2016

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description: 
- Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
  formats

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
- There is constant activity in commits, bugfixes, feature-work and also
  user questions. 
  Work happened for handling broken files better, found via fuzzing-efforts
  done by Tim Allison, HPSF improvements, bugfixes, removing deprecated code, 
  and general improvements.
  Discussions about depending on commons-math for some functionality are
    ongoing.

  We released 3.17-beta1 in June and are planning a 3.17 at the end of summer.

  We are planning to target a 4.0 release after that which will require JDK 7
  (compared to JDK 6 now) and might remove some more deprecated APIs.

## Health report: 
- The last few months we saw a constant stream of new bug reports/feature 
  requests which indicates that the popularity of Apache POI is still very 
  good. Questions via email or on Stackoverflow usually get answers quickly,
  regularly even from people not actively involved in Apache POI development.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache River Project  [Patricia Shanahan]

## Description:
- Apache River software provides a standards-compliant JINI service.

## Issues:

The River PMC seeks advice and guidance from the board on the following issue:

River has had difficulty transitioning from a solid platform inherited from
Jini into a more modular and active development. Parallel development has
occurred outside the project in JGDMS, while trying to find a resolution.

At this point, there is an opportunity to bring in that code from parallel
development and, hopefully, move forward with a modular build architecture
that supports broader participation and better velocity.


  1. JGDMS is a fork of River on github.
  2. JGDMS has security features, improved IPv6 support and a Maven
     modular build.
  3. There are a couple of developers actively working on JGDMS, one is
     also an active River PMC member, the second has participated for a
     long time in River, but isn't a PMC Member or committer at this
     time, and recently received enough votes to be invited to the PMC.
  4. It was a goal of JGDMS to influence River's roadmap and donate the
     work to River.
  5. No code from JGDMS is included in River at this time.
  6. The JGDMS fork has features that are aligned with River's roadmap.

## Activity:
- We are in the process of voting on a possible PMC member
- The main activity has been discussion of the JGDMS issue.
- We currently have a River 3.0.1 release candidate under review.

## Health report:
- It is difficult to make progress without resolving the JGDMS import issue.
- The PMC chair intends to resign effective the September board meeting. This
is a routine change - I have been chair for over 3 years, and strongly believe
the role should circulate among the PMC members. There is a volunteer for
successor.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 11 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Bryan Thompson on Sun Aug 30 2015

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 15 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Bharath Kumar at Mon Mar 13 2017

## Releases:

- Last release was River-3.0.0 on Wed Oct 05 2016

## Activity:
 - The core Roller community is small and with low activity levels.
 - There is ongoing work to create a modernized UI using Bootstrap with Struts.
 - A new Roller 5.2.0 release is being prepared to fix I18N and other issues on blogs.apache.org
   
## Health report:
 - Community is made-up of part-time volunteers with very limited time to devote to Roller.

## Releases:

- Last release was 5.1.2 on Tue Mar 24 2015
   
## Mailing list activity:
   
 Subscriber counts could be taken to mean there is still some interest in
  Apache Roller. The low email counts reflec the low level of development
  and user-support activity.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description: 
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - It was a quiet quarter for the project with no new releases. A couple of
   user bugs were reported and fixed. More work was done to get the Java
   library working with Java 9. A discussion was initiated on the mailing
   list to release a new major release (2.1.0) supporting Java 9 - work on
   getting this release out will start shortly.
   
   Over the next quarter it is planned to release V1.8 of the C++ library to
   add OpenSSL 1.1 support.

## Health report: 
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC. Right now there are no obvious potential new committers for the
   project.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Bert Huijben]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BI: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The
base of the SIS library is modelled according international standards
published jointly by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).


## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

A 20 minutes talk about geospatial international standards and their
implementation in Apache SIS was done in the Free and Open Source
Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) European conference in Paris, July 19th
[1]. About 20~30 attendees were in the room. A similar conference will
be done in the international FOSS4G conference in Boston, August 14-19 [2].

The two Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects are progressing. Branches
have been prepared for integration, but the codes themselves have not
been merged yet. Those merges may require a significant amount of work
because of code review needed. We will try to use the last students days
for refactoring their code in order to ease merge.

One contributor signed ICLA and donated an upgrade of XML metadata
format to latest revisions of ISO standards. This contributor does not
wish to have commit right for now. We will merge his work (currently on
a GitHub clone) as soon as time allow. A related but smaller work was
done on JIRA [3] and is also pending time for integration in Apache SIS.
In this case too, the contributor did not wished commit right.

Apache SIS 0.8 release is blocked by GeoAPI 3.0.1 release by the Open
Geospatial Consortium (OGC). We are working with OGC for helping them to
make this release. We hope to have it by the end of August.


## Health report:

The project is reported mostly okay according the Apache Committee
Report Helper, but got no new PMC in two years. However activity on the
developers mailing list has increased significantly, from 46 emails in
previous cycle to 147 emails in this cycle. This activity is due not
only to Google Summer of Code, but also to discussions and contributions
from peoples of other horizons.


## PMC changes:

  * Currently 19 PMC members.
  * No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
  * Last PMC addition was Marc Le Bihan on Wed Dec 10 2014.


## Committer base changes:

  * Currently 21 committers.
  * No new committers added in the last 3 months.
  * Last committer addition was Johann Sorel at Thu Mar 31 2016.

We do not have new committer candidate yet. We do not know what will be
the GSoC students intend after their project, and the other contributors
declined (for now) the proposal.


## Releases:

Last release was 0.7 on May 27 2016. The 0.8 release will start as soon
as GeoAPI 3.0.1 release is available (hopefully this month).


## Mailing list activity:

  * dev@sis.apache.org: 
      o 65 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months):
      o 147 emails sent to list (46 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- We released Spark 2.2.0 on July 11th, with 1100 patches since the last
  version. Some of the major features released included a cost-based
  optimizer for Spark SQL / DataFrames, PyPI publishing, and the first
  production version of the new high-level Structured Streaming API (losing
  the experimental tag because the API has been stabilized). More details
  are available at spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-2-0.html.

- The Spark Summit conference ran in June with around 3000 attendees.

- Work is under way for Spark 2.3.0, with the current target to close the
  new feature window and cut a release branch in November 2017.

Trademarks:

- We are continuing engagement with various organizations.

Latest releases:

- July 11, 2017: Spark 2.2.0
- May 02, 2017: Spark 2.1.1
- Dec 28, 2016: Spark 2.1.0
- Nov 14, 2016: Spark 2.0.2
- Nov 07, 2016: Spark 1.6.3

Committers and PMC:

- The last committers were added on July 27th, 2017
  (Hyukjin Kwon and Sameer Agarwal).
- The last PMC members were added on June 16th, 2017
  (six new PMC members from the existing committers).

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Evgeny Kotkov]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community has finished the work on resolving the prior-reported
  SHA1 hash collision issues.  This resulted in preparing two new patch
  releases, Subversion 1.8.18 and 1.9.6, with the corresponding fixes.
  These releases were simultaneously made available to our users on July 6th.

  Apart from this, we also finished the work on the first alpha release of
  the upcoming Subversion 1.10 series, 1.10-alpha3 ("alpha1" and "alpha2"
  were not released for various technical reasons).  While we continue
  moving towards the first GA release of Subversion 1.10, such pre-
  releases should allow for more widespread testing by the community.

  There hasn't been any visible benefits from the previously reported
  experimental integration with the Transifex (https://www.transifex.com)
  translation platform at this time.   We will, however, continue to monitor
  how this experiment works out.

  During this quarter, there is a major increase in commit activity and
  in both dev@ and users@ mailing lists traffic.  For instance, our dev@
  mailing list has received around 547 messages, opposed to 318 in the
  previous quarter.  We have seen new people actively participating in
  the discussions of some of the upcoming and developed features in
  Subversion 1.10, and this may partly explain the increased amount
  of traffic.

  Last PMC addition was in February 2017 (Stefan Hett).
  Last committer addition happened in November 2015 (James McCoy).

* Releases

  Subversion 1.8.18 and 1.9.6 were released on July 6th, 2017.

  Subversion 1.10-alpha3 was released on July 26th, 2017.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Thrift Project  [Jake Farrell]

Apache Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

Project Status
---------
The Apache Thrift community is currently working on our 0.11.0 release
candidate which will include a number of stability and performance
enhancements to our Go, Node and Python client libraries [1]. We 
have also started auditing our codebase to ensure that  recent
category-x licensing changes [2] that occurred due to the Facebook
BSD+patents license changes do not impact Apache Thrift.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
  Tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information lookup
  activities

## Issues:
  Four tools (board/agenda, secretary/workbench, roster, and test/icla) make
  use of React.js, which has recently been reclassified as Category X by
  Legal Affairs.  It would be helpful if VP Legal Affairs and/or the ASF Board
  reach out to Facebook to help convince them to relicense React.JS, just like
  they did with RocksDB.

## Health report:
  - John D Ament was added as a committer this month.

  The current status is that we continue to have more than adequate oversight,
  we now have two to three active committers, and two to four occasional
  committers.

## Development:
 - Worked closely with the infrastructure team to update and modernize a
   a number of tools including: new account requests, roster, and mailing list
   requests.  These tools are now all hosted on whimsy's VM.

 - Progress continues towards enabling all PMC members (as well as all
   ASF members) to maintain PMC rosters (something that already is supported
   for PPMC rosters).

 - Significant improvement was made to the podling roster pages.

 - Stylistic improvments continue.

 - Deployment is now triggered by gitpubsub; speeding development.

 - The final three applications were migrated to the new machine, and the
   process of decomissioning whimsy-vm3 has begun.

## PMC and committer base:
  - Currently 10 committers, all on the PMC.
  - Last addition: Thu Jun 2017 (John D. Ament)
