 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Thanks for everyone's patience due to my low availability over the
       last 3 weeks. I'm catching up.

       While there have been a number of directors traveling, the focus of
       the board list was on a fairly short burst of activity around the
       budget and fundraising, as noted in the President's report and
       discussion items. We have some work to do to bring this together in
       the next month.

       Following the last meeting, I sought to clarify the understanding of
       board voting in the case of abstentions, given the current wording of
       the bylaws. It has been the consistent understanding of the board that
       abstentions are not considered "present" at the meeting and do not
       contribute to the majority requirement.

       I'd like to thank the directors that started capturing some central
       pointers to ASF policy.

       I propose that we hold the Annual Members Meeting on March 28-30,
       2017, however welcome input from any directors or officers -
       particularly President, Secretary, Treasurer and vote monitors - as to
       whether later dates in April would be more suitable. I will start
       preparations immediately this week.

    B. President [Sam]

       Overall
       =======

       My current priorities: budget, fundraising, EA/TAC, then Brand
       Management.  Input from the board on budget will likely affect my
       priorities going forward.


       Budget
       ======

       A draft FY22 budget has been posted as a discussion item.  It contains
       the approved FY17 budget, and three projections for FY22.  

       Feel free to challenge assumptions, pick from the available options, or
       even come up with an entirely new target.  If the board can provide
       quick feedback on these numbers, we may have time for a total of three
       iterations; otherwise the next numbers the board will see posted is a
       FY18 budget for approval.  

       I encourage the board to come up with targets for a balanced FY22
       budget.  Clearly the intervening years won't be balanced, but with both
       a target and enough time, we can define a path to get there with
       minimum disruption.

       The biggest single lever under the board's control that would affect
       multiple expense categories is to find a way to significantly limit the
       rate of growth of the foundation; more specifically to throttle the
       arrival rate of accepted podlings by the incubator.

       On the expense side, I'm most concerned about infrastructure as this
       one item is simultaneously (1) the largest expense, (2) the least
       discretionary, and (3) the item with the most inertia in that it will
       take the most time to make a change without substantial disruption.
       For this reason, I request that the board make a priority of setting a
       FY22 target for this item.  Once this target is set, I will ask David
       and Greg to prioritize building a plan to get us there.  This plan may
       include a temporary increase followed by a drop off - which would be OK
       as we have the funds.

       On the income side, I don't see any magic bullets that we can rely on
       to provide us with significant year over year compound growth UNLESS we
       manage to identify something of significantly more direct value to our
       sponsors than what we have offered to date.  A part of this may be a
       willingness on our side to be more accommodating when a sponsor makes
       requests (e.g., for a Privacy Shield amendment) that would make selling
       the sponsorship easier by those within the potential sponsor.


       Fundraising
       ===========

       Input has been provided into the budget process, and work is being done
       to identify the list of sponsors that we need to follow up on in order
       to meet our FY17 targets.


       EA/TAC
       ======

       EA has resumed work on TAC preparations for Miami.  Nick Burch has been
       most helpful.


       Brand Management
       ================

       Brand Management is continuing to work with the Podlings and PMCs that
       are willing to work within the constraints of the published ASF
       Trademark Policy, and per my direction is deferring activity related to
       the remainder of the projects.

       Less than a day after I thought I had closure from the board on whether
       or not the published Trademark Policy was a policy or set of best
       practices, multiple board members indicated that this Policy needed to
       be ratified and/or given a stamp of approval from the board.  So, for
       now, I've moved on.  I've not added any discussion items or resolutions
       related to this matter to this month's agenda.  While I will continue
       to ask for actionable feedback to be sent to trademarks@, I am no
       longer optimistic.

       So, to be clear, we currently have a policy that applies to most.  At
       this time, all it takes for a PMC or PPMC to be excluded is to simply
       state that this policy doesn't apply to them.  That will mean that PMCs
       are free to continue to come up with their own criteria and apply it
       unfairly to one third party but not another.  Or for one PMC to apply a
       different policy than other PMC does, perhaps even to the same third
       party.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


       @Brett: pursue resolution of Brand Management Policy issue

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]
        
        Virtual Update:

        Cash at January 31st 2017 was $1,505.2K, which is down $92.8K from
        last month's ending balance (Dec 2016) of $1,598K, due to monthly AP
        and lower than expected sponsorship pmts received for Jan 2017.   The
        January 2017 cash balance is down $53.2K from the January 2016 month
        end balance of $1,558.3K.  The January 2017 ending cash of $1,505.2K
        represents a cash reserve of 14.8 months based on the FY17 Cash
        forecast average monthly spending of $101.9/month. The "Estimated"
        yearend cash reserve for the ASF, based on the Cash Forecast tab  is
        16.1 months and the reserve continues to be very healthy for an
        organization of ASF's size.

        Regarding the Cash P&L, the Foundation's total revenue YTD through
        January 2017 was $571.2K and is behind the "UPDATED" budget by $81.3K.
        VP of Fundraising is working on the $433K that remains in the
        forecast, for the rest of FY17,  to make it to the updated budget
        number.  Currently we have $375K in open AR, which is $58K short to
        the updated budget, remaining revenue in the forecast to make it to
        the FY 17 Budget.  However there are some sponsors who have not been
        billed yet as their renewal is not up until April.  Sponsorship
        payments were received from the following Sponsor in January 2017:
        WANdisco for $20K.

        In January expenses were over budget by $1.7K This was driven by over
        spending in Infra ( $16K due to overspending in Staffing, Hardware,
        and particularly the timing of the Carbonite payment of $10K vs a Bud
        of $6K for a 2 yr service agreement).  Programs was under by $10K
        which helped to offset this.  Publicity was over budget in Dec by $4K
        due to an additional Meltwater invoice paid in Jan. Brand and G& A
        were under budget as was Fundraising, with Treasury being right on
        budget for the month.  With regard to YTD, Infra was over bud by $15K
        ( $5K in staffing, $5K in Service contracts, due to timing of
        carbonite and Travel is also over by $5K).  Prog is under by $10K as
        is Publicity by $8.5K which may be timing of spending.  Tac &
        Conference is under by $5.7K.  Brand and Treasury are right on budget
        with G&A slightly under budget by $.8K.  This leaves us YTD $10K under
        budget in expenses.

        With regard to Net Income, for Jan 2017 we were under by $45K,  due to
        $43K under in Revenue and $2K over in expenses.  From a YTD
        perspective we are $81K under in revenue and $10K under in Expenses so
        net we are under budget, for Net income by $72K, YTD.

        We have a first draft of the FY 16 990 that is out for review with the
        Treasurer and we anticipate it being signed and submitted to the IRS
        before the final due date of 3.15.17.

        * Re: PayPal.  I recently learned that PayPal is NOT FDIC Insured
          https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full - Any
          PayPal balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against PayPal
          and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
          (FDIC).   

          As such, I Requested Transfer of $106900 to another appropriate ASF
          FDIC insured account.  Virtual created a Money Market Account at
          Citizens for this on Monday the 6th of February.

          I‚Äôve also added a task to move all funds out of paypal monthly into
          an appropriate ASF FDIC-backed account

        * Please note my continued thanks to Virtual.  It is a joy to work with
          them.

        * Request board discussion and consensus re: Bitcoins as there is a
          risk to association funds.  Specifically, here is my recommended plan:

          - use Bitstamp to convert existing current bitcoins to cash.  There
            is a risk I could mess this up and lose our bitcoins.  I am not an
            expert in cryptocurrency and the technology is far from user
            friendly.

          - Stop accepting what are effectively investment vehicles as
            donations and switch to Coinbase so we aren‚Äôt receiving effectively
            ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù but rather cash via bitcoins.  This will reduce risk
            of loss of money from Bitcoins, simply accounting (because Bitcoins
            simply aren‚Äôt tracked right now) and simplify donations.  


       Kevin asked that the board authorize him to convert current
       Bitcoin assets to cash and immediately convert future Bitcoin
       contributions to cash going forward.

       The board agrees.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary continues to run smoothly. In January, 81 iclas, four cclas,
       and two grants were received and filed.

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       Infra team have had to rescind an offer to maintain a VM, CPU and
       storage for a private copy of Maven Central as a precaution. Storage
       growth rate indicates that the offer is not sustainable. Maven PMC
       have been encouraged to seek specific budget support from the Board
       for their needs.

       The team are conducting an experiment with a small ($525) unbudgeted
       expense on unlimited online coursework for three months. If successful
       the next budget will include staff training as a budget item.

       There is an effort to accelerate the decommissioning of ASF-owned
       hardware and the adoption of the Gitbox service 
       (Git as a canonical ASF code repository, http://gitbox.apache.org).

       Some progress on a new web area for the Directors to create an

       A recent focus on the ASF LinkedIn page results in expanded reach for
       our news announcements, 

       Exploring plans for professional editing of ApacheCon recordings as
       volunteer efforts, though very much appreciated, are not producing
       timely results due to the volume of recordings available.

        Notes:
        1) Units are thousands of US dollars
        2) Cash projections are based on linear change in budgets for FY18-FY21

    Discussion:

    First, a clarification that the first column is the approved budget for FY17
    and the next three columns are possible fy22 budgets:

    Second column is minimal FY22 budget
    Third column is ‚Äúnominal‚Äù, linearly projecting the FY17 budget to FY22
    Fourth column is if we expand the services in many areas

    Jim: looks like brand management and publicity are the most malleable parts

    Sam: there are several areas that could be changed

    Jim: we should try to see what a reasonable budget should be and then see
    if we can adapt sponsorship to match our needs; thinking we could really
    get more sponsorship

    Sam: but e.g. should we even have a TAC?

    Marvin: Those areas (TAC etc) are investments that we believe are wise,
    but which we might choose not to make in slim times

    Ross: some of the expanded publicity could lead to more sponsorship

    Marvin: going for minimal budget also implies shutting down incubator

    Jim: we should go for the middle column and see if we can figure out how
    to get there

    Shane: we should set a target about halfway between the minimal and
    expanded budget

    Bertrand: could we consider a really minimal ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù budget? 

    Jim: that was supposed to be the minimum column

    Sam: survival is a bit less than the first column; would prefer not to
    pursue survival budget

    Brett: it‚Äôs worthwhile to try to be ambitious about the budget; at least
    meet the nominal budget

    Sam: recommend a f2f meeting in March to resolve direction on fundraising;
    maybe in Washington or Boston; with a follow-on meeting in Miami

    Sam: sounds like we have consensus to try to strive for the nominal budget
    and see if we can achieve income to meet it

last month).  As directed by the President, I am prioritizing available
efforts on projects and podlings that are clearly and actively accepting of
the relationship with brand policy.

* OPERATIONS

Slightly slower month than usual on crises and questions, which let us spend
some time focusing on adding to the documentation.

Two draft proposals are awaiting more feedback:

- Services naming policy: https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/services

- Merchandise use policy: 
https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/merchandise (public)
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/brand/merchandise.txt
(committer-only additional permissions)

A proposal to encourage (rather than prohibit) "Apache" in third party event
branding has been brought up.  As with the draft proposals above,
disappointingly little (none, so far on events) feedback has appeared. 
Similarly, a call to members@ soliciting questions about Apache brands met
with resounding silence.

Met with trademark counsel to improve operations around registration
processing and timelines and to bring new counsel on our account up to speed
on our objectives.

* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

Several project registration requests have gotten change suggestions from
counsel to better provide the best chance at registration without conflicts or
office actions.  I don't know yet if this is a trend at the USPTO or just a
factor of some specific project names that are more common words being
popular.

New applications for COUCHDB, MESOS, and BIGTOP have been submitted.  

We responded to an overly-broad potential conflict on our TEZ application made
by an overzealous examiner.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities continue normally.

Hadrian and Lynsey got into a good working pattern. We have weekly status
meetings to follow up on outstanding tasks. One of the main focuses is getting
in touch with sponsors to ensure that we meet the targets.

Last month we got a request from one European sponsor to sign a statement that
we comply with European data privacy laws. The request implied that continued
sponsorship is contingent on the ASF signing said document. There was a thread
on fundraising@ to that effect, I had a phone conversation with one of our
lawyers where we agreed that it is ok for us to sign. VP Legal stated that
he's against us signing so I did not. I asked the sponsor for clarifications
regarding the relevace of that document for us but didn't get a reply yet.

This cycle we experienced intense debates about the future of fundraising.
There were a number of opinions, nothing conclusive yet but the convesation
continues.

One task in progress was updating the ASF profile on guidestar [1]. Guidestar
has a ranking algorithm and after my updates it went to 'bronze', then
'silver'. One goal we have is to bump it up to 'gold' before the end of April
(fiscal year). Lynsey engaged the guidestar staff and is trying to organize a
meeting to see how we could better use guidestar to reach out to potential
sponsors.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: Sally Khudairi is reviewing final quarter vendor
requirements in preparation for FY2018. No vendor payments are due at
this time. As requested by ASF President Sam Ruby, she also created a
projected budget for FY2022.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: Sally continues work with Fundraising,
Brand Management, Apache Incubator, Events/ApacheCon, and now ComDev.
She has published 1) the third "Success at Apache" post
https://s.apache.org/23CB ; 2) new positioning for ApacheCon
https://s.apache.org/F7Hy ; and 3) The ASF asks: Have you met Apache
Ignite? https://s.apache.org/Slah , among our usual activities. In
addition, she has begun publishing news on the ASF‚Äôs LinkedIn page
https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-apache-software-foundation and is
beginning to compile the ASF Q3 Operations Summary. The Apache
Incubator‚Äôs call for a new logo http://s.apache.org/rFii continues,
with more than 3 dozen submissions received thus far. The Incubator
has also added a ‚ÄúPress Releases for new TLPs‚Äù section under their
Graduation guidelines at
http://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.html per Sally‚Äôs
request.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe: 

- 8 February 2017 -- The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache¬Æ
Ranger‚Ñ¢ as a Top-Level Project
- 11 January 2017 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache¬Æ
Zest‚Ñ¢ Renamed to Apache Polygene

IV. Informal Announcements: 8 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 134 weekly summaries published to date. 53 items were Tweeted on
@TheASF, which has now grown to more than 40,000 followers. Rich
Bowen‚Äôs team of ComDev volunteers continue uploading audio recordings
from ApacheCon Europe onto Feathercast. Sally is exploring options for
future professional editing services, as it is now three months since
the event and the job is still not finished. No new videos have been
added to the ASF YouTube channel. Sally continues to tweet for the
Apache Incubator account, and has posted 10 items on LinkedIn, our
newest outreach channel.

V. Future Announcements: one announcement is in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing
to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success
stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> with at
least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 2 media queries. The ASF received
1,214 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 973. Media coverage
of Apache projects yielded 3,949 press hits vs. last month's 1,014.
ApacheCon received 18 press hits.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 1 analyst query during this
timeframe. Apache was mentioned in 24 reports by Gartner, 5 reports by
Forrester, 8 reports by 451 Research, and 5 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: we‚Äôve been working on the ASF Identity Style Guide
(graphics/visual/branding) with Fran Lukesh, one of the designers who
created the new ASF logo. Sally has also been working with several ASF
Sponsors and corporates involved with various Apache projects on
various assets, including ‚ÄúPowered By‚Äù logos. The ASF Infrastructure
team, specifically Daniel Takamori and Chris Thistlethwaite, have been
helping with migrating the apache.org favicons to the new feather
graphics.

IX. ApacheCon liaison: Sally published new positioning for ApacheCon
and is exploring possible underwriters for a future event outside of
North America. She is also working alongside Rich Bowen and the Linux
Foundation on marketing the upcoming ApacheCon in Miami.

X. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally worked with
Sharan Foga and Daniel Gruno on the ASF‚Äôs presence at FOSDEM 2017. The
promotional products that were arranged by Daniel were a tremendous
success: according to Daniel the event had ~6,000 attendees --we could
have easily given away 4-5x the amount of items offered. The Apache
projects banner (similar to the listings at https://s.apache.org/Ccml
) was very helpful with generating conversations. Sharan had also
conducted several ‚Äúfrom the conference floor‚Äù interviews that have
been posted to https://feathercast.apache.org/ . Huge thanks to
everyone for their help in staffing the booth during the event. In
addition to FOSDEM, Sally secured a community partnership exchange
with the IoTFuse annual conference. 

XI. Newswire accounts: we have 23 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Recent Issues
=============
Nothing is needed from the President, or the Board. These are reported
as an FYI only.

We have seen issues regarding SHA-1 vulnerabilities, supporting the
Apache Maven project, and changes in our build systems. Details are
provided below, in the "General Activity" section.


Finances
========
We spent $525 to purchase several months of online training. This is
an unbudgeted amount, but we believe its unlimited coursework for the
entire team, for three months, was worth the experiment. At the end of
the period, we will evaluate whether an extension is warranted.  Costs
for ongoing staff education will be included into our next budget
request.


Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Decomission ASF-owned hardware at an accelerated rate, in favor of
  cloud-provided servers
- Continue ramping up the Gitbox service
- Balance our datacenter usage for cost efficiency
- Gitbox/Jira integration


Long Range Priorities
=====================
- As reported before: continued migrations of our legacy servers and
  services into new puppet-based services that we can efficiently
  deploy to cost-effective cloud providers.
- Automation to reduce the incremental cost of regular Infra tasks
- Migration from Puppet V3 to $nextgen system for providing services


General Activity
================
We set up a new web area for the Directors to create an authoritative
set of pages for Board-approved policies and commentary. Some initial
work by Directors has populated some data/pages, but the site design
and content is still in its infancy. The plumbing appears to work, so
we're "done" and will follow with continued support.

There has been a lot of Internet discussion about Google and CWI
finding and publishing a SHA-1 collision, and their statement that it
is now possible to construct additional collisions. They will be
releasing further data in a few months.

From our initial analysis, this issue only affects our Subversion
services as a limited denial of service, instituted by an Apache
committer (NOT by a third-party attacker). The Apache Subversion
community has been discussing and analyzing the issue, including the
extent of the problem and appropriate mitigations. We have already
deployed a script developed by their community, to prevent a committer
(or a compromised account) from pushing either collision documents
into our repository.

We have confirmed that our website certificates DO NOT use the SHA-1
algorithm. This has been in place for quite a while.

This past month, we discovered that we cannot support the growth of
Apache Maven's private copy of the Maven Central repository. We
previously offered the PMC a VM to keep a copy (should M.C go dark,
we'd retain all necessary data for the ecosystem), along with CPU to
perform analysis against that copy, but looking at the storage growth
rate, we determined that this offering was not sustainable within the
current Infrastructure budget. We notified the Apache Maven PMC that
we needed to retract the offering, and for them to seek specific
budget support from the Board for their needs.

Over the past year, the Infrastructure Team has moved to a policy of
"Ubuntu Only" for our machines, to lower our costs. In the past, we
had a lot of time to support multiple operating systems, services, and
customized software deployments. With the rapid growth of the ASF, and
the resulting demand for Infra support, we have pulled back on the
edge cases to focus more strongly on ROI of our staff's work
effort. That has resulted in the Ubuntu policy, which then resulted in
the decommissioning of Solaris, Mac OS, and FreeBSD build slaves in
our buildbot service. Needless to say, that has raised concern within
several probjects who relied on the availability of those platforms.
We have made it clear that the Infra Team will integrate third-party
custom build slaves into our system, so that projects can use those
slaves for their non-Ubuntu builds.


Uptime Statistics
=================
Overall uptime reached 'three nines' with 99.9% uptime. The 'worst
offenders' this period were writeable git repositories (due to a TLS
bug) and Jenkins, though none of the critical or core services went
below 99%.

For more information, please see http://status.apache.org/sla/


Community Growth
================
This period, we've had one new contributor to our puppet repository,
Jitendra Pandey, as well as contributions from 9 people who contribute
on a regular basis. on the JIRA side of things, we had 29 new people
interacting with infra via JIRA, making it 29 new users, 93 regulars
(people that have contributed before and do so often), as well as 5
'returnees' (people that have been absent for >2 years but are now
contributing/reporting again).

On a 3 month view, we've now had code contributions from 22 people, of
which 13 were regular contributors and 9 were new. 94 people have worked
on or reported a JIRA ticket for the first time, while the other 187 who
worked on or reported issues had doen so before.


GitHub as Master ("Gitbox")
===========================
Our Git services are planned to land on gitbox.a.o, so we generally
refer to this as "gitbox". In the past month, we start moving the
OpenWhisk podling over to the gitbox service. That has been a very
slow move, so Tika and Nutch have recently been added to gitbox. It is
too soon to remark on problems and SLA for these communities using
GitHub as their master/primary focal point of development. These
communities have enough activity to help us surface and pinpoint
problems. We've made several improvements based on feedback, and still
need to implement some Jira integrations.

We will likely add more projects before the next Board meeting, and
will report on such additions.


Cost-per-Project Reduction
==========================
An important, needed clarification arose this past month, regarding
the definition of this effort. Reducing the cost-per-project is about
managing the marginal/incremental cost each time a project is
introduced to the ASF infrastructure. This effort is not about the
*overall* Infrastructure bottom line (eg. staffing, training, travel
costs) as those costs have *very* tenuous connections to the
incremental cost of a new project.

There is certainly a mild connection to hardware/hosting costs, as we
offer VM services to projects. Those VMs create a very real cost to
the ASF, and we are in-process on a way to track and allocate those costs.

The more direct costs appear to be related to the work that
Infrastructure performs when a podling is accepted, and when a podling
graduates. These events create a lot of work around managing mailing
lists, repositories, Jira, wikis, etc. This is the incremental costs
that we hope to reduce, through automation, once we are done with the
higher-priority work of VM migrations.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

The Call for Papers for ApacheCon Miami closed on February 11th, and
we are now in the process of selecting the schedule.

We have been working on splitting the CFP into topics and tracks, for
easier consideration by our content committee. The distribution of the
ApacheCon CFP was as follows:

* Standard Content (Key signing, BarCamp, State of the Feather, Apache Way, Lightning Talks) 5 sessions
* Apache IoT - 26 sessions, plus 7 OpenWhisk sessions
* TomcatCon - 20 sessions
* Flex Summit - 1 session (They're actually handling their call for content separately, so this isn't cause for concern)
* CloudStack - 43 sessions
* Cassandra - 6 sessions
* Community - 15 sessions (Plus Apache Way goes here, too)
* Containers - 10 sessions
* Incubator - 5 sessions
* Solr/Lucene - 4 sessions
* HTTP Servers - 9 sessions
* Big Data - 25 sessions (Looks like most of these are filed in the wrong CFP, while just a handful were submitted both places)
* Other/Uncategorized - 56 sessions (This is the part that's going to be the hardest work)

Total: 232 sessions

The Apache: Big Data CFP attracted 193 submissions.

The schedule should be announced on March 9th.

The event has been restructured, as we have been talking about doing
for years, into a convention of mini-conferences. This year, we will
be holding the following events, each of which has its own web
presence and marketing:

Apache: Big Data 
Apache: IoT (Internet of Things)
CloudStack Collaboration Conference
FlexJS Summit
TomcatCon
Apache Traffic Server and Traffic Control Summit (Monday)
BarCampApache (Monday)

All other topics and projects will be run under the general heading
of ApacheCon, so that smaller projects are still represented.

Admission to any of these events (with the exception of the Traffic
Server event) also grants you access to all of the others.

Further details about this event layout have been elaborated in a
blog post at
https://blogs.apache.org/conferences/entry/final-notice-cfp-for-apachecon

It is hoped that this approach will be much easier to sell tickets
(because the event is about something definable) and acquire
sponsorship (for the same reason).

It is also hoped that other project communities will be watching,
and see the benefits of being part of a larger gathering, and bring
us their conferences next year.

We continue to investigate the possibility of doing an ApacheCon in
Europe later in 2017, but have no concrete plans as yet.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

Applications opened on January 25th. To date, we have six applications and two pending submission. These numbers are just shy of the ACEU ‚Äô16 numbers for this time. Keep in mind that we had a total of 27 applications at the closing for ACEU ‚Äô16. Most applications come in at the last minute.

TAC open emails were sent to committers@, members@, dev@, announce@, discuss@apachecon, and to pmcs@.

Apps close on March 8th
Judges call planned for March 10-12th
Budget approval by March 13th

Sent email to past TACers (ACEU 15, ACNA 16, and ACEU 16) to help spread the word (in their words as a TAC recipient) to their community to encourage participation.

Everything is on track as of this date.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

EME (Encrypted Media Extensions) has been a controversial area in W3C. It
provides a standard browser interface to DRM. The Advisory Committee
review late 2016 has 69 responses with 23 objections, and 46 in favour
of advancing the work to recommendation status.

The main concern is for protection of security and privacy researchers.
A proposal from the Electronic Freedom Foundation was a "covenant" which
required signatories to waive rights of US DMCA for circumvention of DRM
by anyone.

W3C have failed to find a compromise and have undertaken to publish
(March 2nd) guidelines to protect security and privacy researchers.
Initially this is voluntary with a further possibility of being a
requirement for joining future Working Groups.

    ----

Stian Soiland-Reyes has joined the WebID Community Group, Schema
Architypes Community Group, Schema.org Community Group and Permanent
Identifier Community Group.

His previous membership of these groups was through the the University
of Manchester, but the University is withdrawing from W3C membership.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

Some discussions regarding whether or not a project can depend on a
codebase with a non-OSI/FSF approved license currently not in the Cat-A
classification. My opinion is that we want our software to be used and
consumed with as little fuss and muss as possible, and a dependency on a
non-OSI approved license is a detriment to that philosophy. Also, it
implies that the ASF is in the business of determining what is, and is
not, OSD compliant. My point in that regard is that that is NOT the ASF's
job; it is clearly one of the key functions of OSI, and always has been.
This is somewhat of a "hard-line" approach, and the board should be
aware of this.

It appears that this is not a popular point-of-view and that others
disagree. I cannot in good conscious agree with a decision and
an action in which we, basically, become authorities on what does
and what does not comply with the OSD. As such, I tender my resignation
and ask the board to assign a replacement at this meeting.

Attachment D: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Mat√®rne]

## Description:

Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools.  It
consists of 3 main projects:

 - Ant - core and libraries (AntLibs)
 - Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
 - IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

For "project cleanup" we finalized the process of retiring a subproject or
reactivating it [1].  Basically we just place a marker file in the correlating
git repositories, make specific resources read-only and add the name to an
archive-list [2].

With that we voted to archive EasyAnt and all its subcomponents [3]. Archiving
EasyAnt is done.  We also voted to archive IvyDE. During that vote few users
came and brought new energy into that project. So we decided to keep it alive
[4].

With Stefan Bodewig as release manager we released two versions of Ant: 1.9.8
and 1.10.0.  The 1.10-branch is current development with Java8 as requirement
while 1.9.x is a backport to Java5 - if possible.

Due two important bugfixes the next two releases 1.9.9 and 1.10.1 are in the
pipeline. At time of this writing (2017.02.02) Stefan wants to start to cut
new release candidates.
Update 2017.02.09: Both versions were released on 2017.02.06.

There was a security vulnerability report, passed to us via the Security Team.
Because key of that vulnerability is write access to the buildfile, the Ant
PMC doesn't accept this report as vulnerability, as you could do whatever you
want anyway (<delete>, <ftp>) - access rights by the running user provided.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Beam Project  [Davor Bonaci]

## Description:

Apache Beam is a unified programming model for both batch and streaming data
processing, enabling efficient execution across diverse distributed execution
engines and providing extensibility points for connecting to different
technologies and user communities.

## Issues:

There are no issues that require the Board's attention at this time.

## Activity:

Apache Beam was established as a top-level project at December‚Äôs Board
meeting. This is the second in the series of three consecutive monthly reports
for new projects.

Since last month's report, we have:
- published the second post-graduation release, version 0.5.0,
- added 3 new committers from two different organizations,
- promoted the Python SDK to the master branch with support for two runners.

Over the last month, Apache Beam graduation has been covered in more than a
dozen technical publications and received endorsements from multiple
organizations.

Beam continues to interconnect additional execution engines and data
storage/messaging systems. Since the last report, IO connectors for
Elasticsearch and MQ Telemetry Transport have been released, and additional
connectors for Redis, Apache Cassandra, Apache DistributedLog, Apache Parquet,
RabbitMQ, and Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) are in progress.

Going forward, the main focus continues to be on the community growth. On the
technical side, the next major milestone is the availability of the first
stable release, which will include backward-compatibility guarantees.

## Health report:

The community continues to grow steadily, as follows:
- The number of contributors continues to increase.
- Releases continue at a regular pace of 1-1.5 months per release.
- Mailing list activity continues to increase significantly.

## PMC changes:

Currently 14 PMC members. No new PMC members have been added since graduation
two months ago.

## Committer base changes:
 
Currently 20 committers. Three new committers have been added in the last
month:
- Ahmet Altay was added as a committer on Tue Jan 31 2017.
- Pei He was added as a committer on Tue Jan 31 2017.
- Stas Levin was added as a committer on Tue Jan 31 2017.

## Releases:

In the two months following graduation, Apache Beam has published two
releases:
- 0.4.0 was released on Sun Jan 01 2017.
- 0.5.0 was released on Mon Feb 06 2017.

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Buildr Project  [Antoine Toulme]

## Description:

Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including
support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and
tools. We wanted something that‚Äôs simple and intuitive to use, so
we only need to tell it what to do, and it takes care of the rest.
But also something we can easily extend for those one-off tasks, with
a language that‚Äôs a joy to use. And of course, we wanted it to be
fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Our activity has slowed down. We have one interesting discussion
slowly going to fix the biggest flaw of Buildr by providing
dependency resolution.

## Health report: 

The activity is slow, with 2 active committers.
Very little activity on the user or dev list.
 
We do see that the project is used at large. For example, the latest
version has been downloaded over 57000 times since last September.
Last time I reported we have started discussing on the dev list
how to improve participation, and have detailed several items
for the next release to engage better our users.
This effort is still ongoing.

## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 7 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Peter Donald on Tue Oct 15 2013 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 9 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Tammo van Lessen at Fri Aug 08 2014 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 1.5 on Fri Sep 23 2016 
   
## JIRA activity: 
   
 - 2 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months 
 - 6 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description:
Since the last report, things have stabilized a bit in the community and we
are getting down to business.

After several long conversations on the dev list, we have agreed on the best
way forward of streamlining our release process. Specifically, we have moved
away from the TicTock scheme used throughout the 3.x releases. Though it had
the benefit of creating a better culture of testing, this process proved to be
both incredibly confusing for users as to the current stable version and
overly difficult to maintain for developers for the number of active branches
required.

Our development velocity is lower than I would like. We are still recovering
from the pull out of a large commercial vendor in the space, but independent
activity is increasing and we are steadily adding committers.

It took five voting rounds to release 3.10, but that is more a function of our
agreement to insist on a green test board and being more stringent on blocking
for known issues. I see this particularly as a positive sign of higher
community involvement in the development process as three of the vote vetoes
were a result of end-user discovered issues.

## Issues:
There are no new issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Release Activity:
Apache Cassandra has had the following releases:
- 3.0.10 was released on Wed Nov 16 2016
- 3.10 was released on Fri Feb 03 2017

We are currently working towards an alpha of 4.0 that is a cleanup and
refactoring of some major components.

## PMC changes:
Currently 21 PMC members. No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.

## Committer base changes:
Three new committers have been added in the past quarter:
- Branimir Lambov was added as a committer on Tue Nov 08 2016
- Paulo Motta was added as a committer on Wed Dec 07 2016
- Stefan Powkowinski was voted in, but is pending an ICLA review by his
employer

## Mailing list activity:
Subscriber increases on both mailing lists are marginal, but they are
increases. Activity on the user mailing list is down, but we see that as a
function of not having any new releases before and during the holiday period.

dev@cassandra.apache.org:
- 1613 subscribers (up 28 in the last 3 months):
- 573 emails sent to list (611 in previous quarter)

user@cassandra.apache.org:
- 3135 subscribers (up 30 in the last 3 months):
- 1142 emails sent to list (1548 in previous quarter)

## JIRA activity:
The ratio of closed to created tickets is high, reflective of previous
comments regarding velocity.
- 302 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 190 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich St√§rk]

## Description:

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects

## Issues:

No issues require board attention at the moment.

## Activity:

Community Development Strategy

A key discussion topic this quarter was looking at the refining or re-defining
the goal of Community Development. The project was established with a very
flexible description of 'helping people become involved with Apache projects'
and the discussions highlighted that this was no longer enough and that more
detailed goals, strategies or plans are needed to focus efforts on various
areas. No one has a clear picture of what community development activities are
planned, in progress or completed, or how they fit in any other greater
initiative. By having at least an outline this would allow Community
Development to co-ordinate activities and give potential contributors clear
guidance on what tasks need to be done.

An outline, based on the mailing list discussion, has been created in the
documentation, and we will work towards fleshing that out over the coming
weeks. This is (temporarily) at http://community.staging.apache.org/about/

One comment on the strategy thread highlighted that Community Development as a
mailing list was not very well known (so this links in with some of the
proposed strategy ideas to improve the awareness with the ASF communities
about the role of ComDev and what it does).

Committers Diversity Survey

The Committer Diversity Survey was run in November / December. In total we
received 765 responses (out of a 5861 committer base at the time the survey
was run) which was approx 13% response rate. The survey also got 111 feedback
comments some of which did not give their permission to share or from quote
their comments. A key condition for respondents providing the data was that


The data collected will be used to generate consolidated and aggregated
statistics for the Apache Community Development team and the Apache Software
Foundation. These details may be published as part of Apache presentations and
reports, and made publicly available.

The data from individual responses will not be released.

The survey also got 111 feedback comments some of which can be quoted from.
Those that cannot be quoted will be raised as a general discussion theme.

Next steps will be:

Continue to analyse the information and identify any potential Community
Development related actions Start discussion threads on the various themes and
topics raised to see if they will result in additional actions Discuss
feedback and diversity ideas and if necessary, integrate into diversity
strategy

FOSDEM

A lot of activity this quarter was focussed on preparing for FOSDEM 2017 in
Brussels. The ASF was allocated a booth for the second consecutive year with
the main focus of building awareness of Apache and its projects to the FOSDEM
attendees. An email message was sent out to all ASF projects dev mailing lists
asking if projects wanted to use the opportunity to promote their projects.
Four projects signed up to be present at the booth (Mesos, OpenOffice,
Zeppellin and Lucene/Solr) and 20 presentations at FOSDEM were from ASF
community members.

Daniel worked together with Sally to get some new banners were produced
including one with all the current logos for all ASF projects. This was very
useful for raising ASF brand awareness as many attendees knew many project
names but had not associated them with Apache.This means that there is more
work to be done in reinforcing the ASF brand externally.

Daniel Gruno and Sharan Foga were present at FOSDEM thoughout the weekend at
the ASF booth and received support from other ASF community members.

 
Relaunch of ComDev Blog

The Community Development Blog was relaunched in November and currently has 2
monthly updates published. A third will be published in February. The aim is
to continue to provide simple regular updates to keep people informed about
key things that have happened or are planned in Community Development.


Google Summer of Code

Another big discussion topic discussed this quarter month was around ASF
involvement in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and how we might be able to gather
data and statistics that show more clearly how GSoC benefits our projects and
communities.

Apache Community Development's main goal is about developing Apache
communities so it would be good to have actual data about the GSoC program
within the ASF and how it supports us in achieving this.

Addition of Statistics on Projects Directory

A new "Projects Statistics" page has been added to Projects Directory:
https://projects.apache.org/statistics.html

Global ASF statistics on code and discussions evolution are published using
Snoot.io service data.


## PMC changes:

The PMC currently features 22 members. The last addition has been Sharan Foga
on 2016-11-15

Currently 22 PMC members.

Sharan Foga was added to the PMC on Tue Nov 15 2016

## Committer base changes:

Currently 23 committers. Sharan Foga was added as a committer on Tue Nov 15
2016

## Releases:

None.  

## Mailing list activity:

Mailing list activity has been high despite a slight drop off over the holiday
period. Many interesting topics have been raised that have resulted in
significant discussions and it is a good sign that mailing list traffic is
increasing because people want to join discussions.

dev@community.apache.org:

728 subscribers (up 9 in the last 3 months): 557 emails sent to list (321 in
previous quarter)

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------ 
Same as the last report, email and commit activity continues to move along
slowly.  There has been not much other activity.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Community
--------- 
In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC / Commit. 


Releases
-------- 
Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016 
Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014

Attachment P: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

 WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider
 component of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
There was quite a lot of activity on both the CXF main codebase and the Fediz 
subproject.   3 separate security advisories were made public, 2 in CXF and 1 
in Fediz.  Those were a main driver for releases late in 2016.  We‚Äôve also 
released 3.1.10 with hopes of being able to concentrate on 3.2.0 and get that 
out this quarter.  In addition, almost 100 JIRA‚Äôs have been resolved this
period as we try and wrap up some of the new ideas and stabilize things for
3.2.0.

  - A plugin for Java SE to bootstrap both JBoss Weld and Apache OpenWebBeans
    outside of a container.
  - JSF integration, including backporting of JSF 2.2 features for Java EE 6.
  - JPA integration and transaction support.
  - A Data module, to create an easy to use repository pattern on top of JPA.
  - Quartz integration

  Testing support is also provided, to allow you to do low level unit testing
  of your CDI enabled projects.

## Issues:

   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

   Currently we preparing the upcoming release 1.8, which mainly consists of a
   reworked configuration API and bugfixes.

## Health report:

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09
  None on the horizon.

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.
  Since then there have been some changes, but it will need someone to
  initiate the release process.

  No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

  There was a little activity on the dev mail list via the issue tracker. One
  PMC member encountered and commented on an old issue. No further comments.
  The same PMC member made a few enhancements to the new "fleece" skin.

  Two PMC members were present during the quarter.

  At this report, two other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

  At the last quarter's report, there were some board comments:

  It was discovered that "svn" commit messages were not shown on the
  lists.a.o service. I followed up that. Many thanks to Seb for the excellent
  investigation. It revealed that the problem was much wider than Forrest.
  Initial configuration and loading of the lists.a.o archive was lacking.
  Now fixed.

  The other matter is that we should be making a release. Yes, i have noted
  this in each of our board reports. The procedure is documented, but it
  requires someone to commence it. The board prompt did not encourage any
  discussion by the project.

Project status:
  Activity: Low
  3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues published:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  Some enhancements to the new "fleece" bootstrap-based skin.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description:

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers‚Äô
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, first class functional programming support and
runtime and compile-time meta-programming.

## Issues:

The area we still haven‚Äôt managed to find time to tackle is with regards to
our website hosting. The community facing and developer facing aspects
are still merged into one single website, which is still hosted on the
groovy-lang.org domain, which although belonging to the Apache Software
Foundation is not under the *.apache.org namespace. As agreed previously, we
intend on keeping the community facing side under the familiar
groovy-lang.org website, while separating the developer oriented part
under the groovy.apache.org website. But the focus on the release process
was higher on our priority list and we haven‚Äôt had time to dig deeper in
this area unfortunately. It‚Äôs next on our priority list.

## Activity:

We made a lot of progress with our release process automation, and the 2.4.8
release was made thanks to the new process. So the community is very happy
to see us moving forward with newer releases, with a clearer vision of the
roadmap of upcoming versions, as well as with the upcoming new features.

In addition to the treatment of the vulnerability issue that got solved and
released in 2.4.8, and the usual bug fixing to continue to stability the
platform, the big key area of work has been with the new Antlr v4 parser, in
the ‚Äúparrot‚Äù branch, which brings Java 8 syntax elements, some new
Operators, as well as some missing elements from previous versions of Java.
Groovy has historically been adopted by Java developers for its
familiarity in terms of syntax with Java, so these new developments continue
along that theme.

## Health report:

We closed the year 2016 with our record number of downloads, across Maven
Central and JFrog Bintray, with 23 million downloads, up from 12.7 millions
the previous year. The last four months of the year, the monthly downloads
exceeded 2.2 millions every month.

The @ApacheGroovy Twitter account gained more followers, totalling 2266
followers, compared to last report‚Äôs sub 2k. On the TIOBE programming index
the project left the top 20 after several months in -- fluctuations in
search rankings are pretty high. The LinkedIn Groovy group moved from 4717
members to 4755. And the community-driven Slack channel went from 400 to
535 members.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 9 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Andrew Bayer on Wed Nov 18 2015

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 18 committers.
- New commmitters:
- Sergei Egorov was added as a committer on Thu Dec 08 2016
- Daniel Sun was added as a committer on Thu Nov 03 2016

We‚Äôre very happy to have added those two new committers who are contributing
two key new aspects to Apache Groovy: the new language parser that adds Java 8
syntax constructs (among other things), and a macro system to help make
AST code transformation even more easier to implement.

This quarter, 79 commits were contributed from 12 contributors including 7
non-committer contributors (5 new).

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache HttpComponents Project  [Asankha Perera]

## Description:
 - The Apache HttpComponents project is responsible for creating and
   maintaining a toolset of low-level Java components focused on HTTP and
   associated protocols

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - We are currently working on adding support for HTTP/2 protocol to HttpCore
   and HttpClient.
 - We understand that our web site could be improved to migrate away from
   XML/APT and Maven generation to something like Markdown and jekyll. This
   would be something we plan to look into in the months ahead.
 - Our builds now appear on Travis CI.
 - The team also plans to migrate away from svn into git sometime after a
   few more releases related to HTTP/2.

## Health report:
 - Overall the project remains active. Although established in late 2007
   the project remains stable and active as seen by JIRA and Emails. 
 - The number of emails could be seen as low, but it is stable like the state
   of the project, and we still have interested people joining into the 
   dev list hoping to contribute, and saying so on the list.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Ignite Project  [Denis Magda]

## Description:

The Apache Ignite (TM) In-Memory Data Fabric is a high-performance, integrated
and distributed in-memory platform for computing and transacting on
large-scale data sets in real-time, orders of magnitude faster than possible
with traditional disk-based or flash technologies.

Apache Ignite (TM) provides many in-memory components to improve performance
and scalability of user applications, including in-memory data grid, in-memory
sql grid, in-memory compute grid, in-memory streaming, and more.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- The community worked hard and managed to release Apache Ignite 1.8 on Dec 8,
  2016.  The release encompasses a brand new In-Memory SQL Grid component that
  allows to work with an Ignite cluster as with an in-memory database fully
  relaying on SQL syntax.  In addition, the release introduces support of
  Redis compliant client, improvements in Ignite.NET and deadlock detection
  mechanism.  More details:
  https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-asf-asks-have-you

- Presently the community is approaching the next major release - Apache
  Ignite 2.0.  The new version will be based on new memory architecture that
  will keep down an impact of Java Garbage Collectors. Also there will be many
  core and SQL related performance.

- The community refined the technical documentation making it clearer and
  actively maintains the blogging list - https://ignite.apache.org/blogs.html

- Apache Ignite enrolled in Google Summer of Code 2017 program
  (https://goo.gl/4SpTzK) and submitted a bunch of talks to upcoming ApacheCon
  conference.

## Health report:

The mailing statistics, project evolvement, releases delivery and overall
community engagement shows that the state of the project in a good shape.
However, the community has not promoted contributors to committers and
committers to PMC members for a long time. PMC members are willing to motivate
and support the most active contributors and committers during the next
quarter so that they can get to the next level.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 24 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Denis Magda on Sun Sep 27 2015

* Miscellaneous

  - An updated format of the Incubator report will be rolling out in the
    March report.  A preview based on the February template can be found at
    https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/testpage
  - We have begun pushing a hard review of both active podlings and mentors
    associated.  A number of mentors have stepped down from their roles, and
    a few podlings have been contacted to begin thinking about retirement.
  - Report formatting continues to be an issue until a fix is applied to
    whimsy.
  - Report contents are much more robust this month, likely due to increased
    requests for input in podling reports.

Blur

Blur is a search platform capable of searching massive amounts of data
in a cloud computing environment.

Blur has been incubating since 2012-07-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Greater community involvement.
  2. Produce releases.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  Lack of community involvement has brought the topic of retirement to the
  blur-dev list.

  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-blur-dev/201702.mbox/%3Cpony-4f6911432c0e56d59d8abe5b65087e9956a6af1e-bfe4bfa9a663176fde9c80c2d11c9dc3c6e81311%40blur-dev.incubator.apache.org%3E

  We feel that the board should be aware of a potential retirement to the
  project.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Subscriptions: user@ - 61[-1]; dev@ - 77[-1]
  The community involvement has not really changed over the past few
  months.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Nothing has changed since the last report.

Date of last release:

  2014-07-29

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John D. Ament:

    Sent a note to the podling RE lack of change in status.  Asked to
    contemplate retirement.

--------------------
Apache CarbonData is an indexed columnar data format for fast analytics on
big data platform, e.g.Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, etc.

CarbonData has been incubating since 2016-06-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Already finished 4 apache releases and all driven by different release
     managers. 
  2. The community is growing well: 
     a. There are more than 60+ contributors from different organizations,
        increasing the diversity. 
     b. Increased mailing list activity, the solutions be discussed by
        mailing list and users can get efficient helps to quickly solve
        their issues by mailing list
  3. Finish all INFRA built:  github, CI, website, Cwiki and so on.

  We think we are very close to the graduation and we are focused on the
  last steps for the graduation.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Increased mailing list activity: solutions be discussed and decided in
    mailing list.
  - More than 20+ new contributors from different organizations since
    November.
  - Organized two meetup, the attendees was more than 100+.
  - There are more than 10+ organizations decided to use Apache CarbonData
    and 6 of them already formally deployed in business system.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Since November 1,306 issues+ have been reported on JIRA site and 294
    have been resolved or closed. Since November 1,282+ pull requests have
    been created and 268+ pull requests have been closed.

    The project has been progressing well despite the absence of a release.
    The community has put a release candidate together, but unfortunately we
    didn't that it was missing a few important additions and changes (e.g.,
    DISCLAIMER and license header). I'm happy with the community development.
    There is interest and new contributors are continuously joining.

    Checking of the Maturity model is not yet complete and is just being
    used as an aid to help assess our progress.  Hopefully now that we have
    a release and with the meetup we will have more people get interested
    and involved. The active development community, while still small seems
    to be communicating well on the list and it was great to see the
    release.

  Justin Mclean:
  
    Great work on the release, project progressing along well.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Josh Elser:
  
    The current podling members are all rather experienced in running
    (other) TLPs and this has been obvious in their actions as a podling.
    They are doing a very good job, but the group still struggles with
    attracting new committers to the project. They are making efforts here,
    but not seeing any result from those actions yet. This is the biggest
    barrier to graduation, IMO.

--------------------
Guacamole

Guacamole is an enterprise-grade, protocol-agnostic, remote desktop gateway.
Combined with cloud hosting, Guacamole provides an excellent alternative to
traditional desktops. Guacamole aims to make cloud-hosted desktop access
preferable to traditional, local access.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Identifying contributors with merit warranting committership
  2. Engaging mentors to assess podling status and provide guidance
  3. Ensuring mentors are subscribed to the lists and are generally aware of
     podling status/activities

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Not at present.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Frequency and complexity of contributions seem to be increasing. Community
  presence and activity on the mailing lists has also increased due to the
  use of Nabble to provide a forum-like interface.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project has succeeded in producing its first release under the
  Incubator, 0.9.10-incubating, and the process is already underway for
  producing the next, with the IPMC vote for release having been started on
  2017-01-26.

  With the first release out of the way, development is finally moving
  smoothly again. We have adopted a branching workflow which allows
  development to continue unhindered, with only the release scope being
  frozen.

Date of last release:

  2016-12-29 (0.9.10-incubating)

iota

Open source system that enables the orchestration of IoT devices.

iota has been incubating since 2016-01-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Getting a release out based on the current code base - will will commit
     to do that this quarter

    I find it frustrating that after a year in incubation, dev activity and
    decisions still appear to be happening away from the dev list.
    Consequently there is little community activity beyond sporadic
    questions and answers which, while good, could equally be served by
    github alone.  I have discussed this with some of the team and
    understand there are good intentions for a push, and intend to post a
    critique of this report to try and 'nudge' the project.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Justin Mclean:
  
    Project is off to a fast start and will have a release out and is likely
    to have committers voted in before next report. There's been IMO a few
    teething issues re development outside the project and PRs being closed
    with explanation but on-list discussions have resolved these issues
    amicably.

SensSoft

SensSoft is a software tool usability testing platform

SensSoft has been incubating since 2016-07-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Moving towards the first Incubating release of the source code and other
     release artifacts.
  2. Grow the Apache SensSoft (Incubating) community.
  3. Complete the issues highlighted at the SensSoft Roadmap

Sirona

Monitoring Solution.

Sirona has been incubating since 2013-10-15.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Justin Mclean:
  
    No report and very little activity on list, last releases in late 2015.
    Probably time to ask if there 3 active PMC members and think of ways to
    attract committers.

  John D. Ament:

    Emailed podling, retirement is likely.

--------------------

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Apache Slider community/PPMC has voted to move portions of Slider into
     Apache Hadoop YARN as modules. It is possible that the remaining pieces
     will be moved at a later point in time or become obsolete or evolve to
     work closely with YARN. Slider PPMC will decide what makes the most
     sense as we progress through this exciting time.
  2. Getting more external users
  3. Growth of a diverse set of developers/committers/PMC members is also
     crucial towards the final state of Slider

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There has been one new contributor since the last report. Mailing list
  activity has been lower due to the bulk of the development moving to an
  Apache Hadoop branch, but the lists are still active.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Work continues in parallel on the Apache Hadoop yarn-native-services
  branch and on the Slider podling. The bulk of the work has been in
  yarn-native-services, while a few Slider patches (related to critical
  issues or agent-only issues) have been committed as well.

Spot

Apache Spot is a solution stack that provides the capability to ingest IT
related telemetry (network flows, domain name service information and proxy
server logs) and provide unsupervised machine learning capabilities to
identify suspicious activity.  The information is organized and presented
using operational analytics so that a security analyst can investigate the
most suspicious connections. Apache Spot is built on an open data model
using Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop.

Spot has been incubating since 2016-09-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1.  Move infrastructure and development to ASF (code, issues, mailing
      list, ...)
  2.  Build diverse community
  3.  Demonstrate ability to create releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  IPMC this point has been posted on the last two report, we have not
  received any feedback in terms of how it goes, please comment.

  Please elaborate on the process for code scanning and IP reviews. On the
  last report this was brought to attention but no communication was
  received. 

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Community is pushing more aggressively on project interaction which is
  good, by opening issues on ASF JIRA, some of them have been closed with
  their respective PR for bug fixing. Also developers in Brazil are
  proposing a new UI schema by their own, which once is voted will
  incorporate as contribution/new functionality towards our first Apache
  release.

  Adoption rate and popularity of the project has been recognized by
  Industry receiving an award from Infoworld as Technology of the year and
  also finalist on Edison Awards.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The Spot team  launched a new project webpage version which incorporate
  the long term vision and objectives of Apache Spot, and also includes a
  new documentation package which is similar in structure to other ASF
  projects.

  Two new processes were published to explain on commits and how to open
  issues, providing a structured frame that Community in general can follow
  up in order to facilitate follow-up in combination of technology tools,
  that can facilitate the life cycle continuity.

  During this period 14 pull request were merged over different pipeline
  components , as committers work also on the new design for data storage
  through non-relational database technologies.

  Also facilitating a quick demo of the project, we have updated our
  container demo, and added automation in order to reflect those changes as
  commits to UI are pulled to ASF Git repository.

flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid
runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to distributed
computations running on Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

SystemML has been incubating since 2015-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow SystemML community: increase mailing list activity, increase
     adoption of SystemML for scalable machine learning, encourage data
     scientists to adopt DML and PyDML algorithm scripts, respond to user
     feedback to ensure SystemML meets the requirements of real-world
     situations, write papers, and present talks about SystemML.
  2. Continue to produce releases.
  3. Increase the diversity of our project's contributors and committers.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  NONE.

How has the community developed since the last report?

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Extend Community
  2. Improve Documentation / finish new homepage
  3. Start graduation after 0.3 is out

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are thinking about graduating after the next release since our new
  homepage contains information about many new features and we do have a new
  module structure.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  On conferences and after Oracle dropped the configuration JSR many
  conversations started about Configuration in the Java world.  Apart from
  bugfixes the main new features is basic OSGi support (currently still in
  development in sandbox module).

  Weekly hangouts (monday 8pm Berlin time) take place to have shorter
  feedback cycles, minutes are communicated via mail.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The infrastructure runs much more smoothly with the new module structure:
  core, extensions, sandbox and a separate project for the homepage based on
  jBake.

  OSGi support is a big thing since different OSGi containers have their
  problems. Good contact to Apache Karaf developers.

  New homepage with new structure and more information available as
  prototype via: https://tamaya.apache.org/jbake/ Homepage is connected to
  its repository via gitpubsub.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache jUDDI Project  [Alex O'Ree]

jUDDI (pronounced "Judy") is an open source Java implementation of the
Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI v3)
specification for (Web) Services. The jUDDI project includes Scout.
Scout is an implementation of the JSR 93 - Java API for XML Registries
1.0 (JAXR).

jUDDI
- All mailing lists have had very Low traffic this quarter.
- 3.3.3 Released Sept 12, 2016, maintenance and bug fixes.

Scout
- No release this period, no development took place.
- No JAXR related questions on the mailing list.

Last PMC addition and new committer April 3, 2013 (Alex O'Ree)

Last Release jUDDI-3.3.3, Sept 12, 2016
Next Release jUDDI-3.3.4, Planned for Feb 2016

There are no issues that require the boards attention at this time.

Low development activity is a factor for low mailing list volume, but in all
likelihood, it's from a general lack of interest in the protocol.

There are enough active PMC members to approve releases and respond to potential
security issues. There was a bug was report 2 Feb 2017 and a fix is already in
the works. A release is planned shortly.

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for efficiently storing and
processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========

We released 0.10.1.1, which fixes 30 critical issues. We are in the process of
releasing 0.10.2.0, which includes new features such as session window and
global table in streams, client compatibilty, multiple listeners in the same
security protocol and SASL/SCRAM.  This is our second time-based release and
we expect it to be released on time as well.

We are actively working on new features such as exactly-once semantic, admin
apis, and better JBOD support.

Community
===========

Lots of activities in the mailing list. We have 2324 subscribers in the user
mailing list, up 79 in the last 3 months. We have 1954 emails in the user
mailing list in the last 3 months, up from 1630 in the previous cycle. We have
912 subscribers in the dev mailing list, up 44 in the last 3 months. We have
6537 emails in the dev mailing list in the last 3 months, up from 5156 in the
previous cycle.

We elected one new committer, Grant Henke on Jan. 10, 2017. We last elected a
new PMC member Gwen Shapira on Aug. 17, 2016.

We had several Kafka meetups in various cities in this quarter.

One feedback from the community is that it's a bit hard to find an answer by
searching the Apache mailing list. We are wondering if Apache has considered
some sort of integration with things like Stack Overflow that does a better
job at Q/A.

Releases
===========
0.10.1.1 was released on Dec. 19, 2016.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

# Description

The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache
Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all
REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.

# Issues

None

# Status

The Apache Knox team released 0.11.0 was release on Dec 28th with some great
enhancements and new features, some of the highlights are:

- Metrics collection capabilities for the gateway server
- Basic administrator UI
- New REST API support for Druid, SOLR, Avatica
- Hadoop group mapping support.

We have continued to use the KIP-# pages to drive the primary focus of each
release and feel it is working well. The 0.12.0 release is primarily focused
on the client library and programming model for consuming REST APIs through
Knox. There has been an increasing uptake of this library and it has become
clear that it needed to mature.  We are discussing what really needs to land
in 0.12.0 as the number JIRAs has pushed the date out beyond our target and we
want to be able to maintain our release cadence but not at the expense of
addressing our goals. The current level of collaboration is healthy and
encouraging within the community on both mailing lists and JIRAs.

# Releases

* 0.11.0: 2016-12-28 Added Metric collection, Basic admin UI, new API support,
  hadoop group lookup and fixed a number of bugs - through ~35 commits.

# Development Activity

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Ralph Goers]

The Apache Logging Services Project creates and maintains open-
source software related to application logging.

Currently there are no issues which require the board's attention.

- Community

Log4j 2 remains an active project. The overall community is healthy 
and friendly.

Log4cxx is still active in the Incubator. They have been sporadic
discussions regarding performing a release but little real progress
has been made. 
 
In general, all subprojects are still healthy although none has grown 
since the last report.


- Project Branding Requirements

All components except Chainsaw meet the branding requirements.
We will fix the Chainsaw branding with the next release.

- Last three community changes

 * Jonathon Davies has accepted an invite to be a committer on Jan 8, 2017 
 * Mikael St√•ldal joined as a PMC Member on June 20 2016
 * Ralph Goers was voted to be the next Chair on Nov 01 2015

- Releases
 * Log4j 2.8 (Jan 24, 2017)
 * Logging Parent 1.0 (Jan 25, 2017)
 * Log4net 2.0.7 (Jan 4, 2017)
 * Log4net 2.0.6 (Dec 24, 2016)    

- Subproject summaries

Log4j 2: Active. Several new git repos have been created for additional 
components related to Log4j. 

The number of emails on the developer mailing list has increased by about 
30% in the last 3 months although the number of subscribers has decreased
slightly. The increase may be due to github now sending emails to the dev
list.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security
policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.6 release on
December 30, 2016.  The next major release is scheduled for April 30, 2017.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Markus Schuch on December 2, 2016.
The last PMC member was Rafa Haro, voted in on August 31, 2015.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been moderate this quarter.  Issues reported have been
mainly garden-variety bugs.  We've had several feature requests but few
contributions.  Dev list comments for this period have also been light, with
occasional user questions.  I am unaware of any mailing list question that
has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012, and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.
  
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity: 

A very quiet quarter in the project, both in terms of development and mailing
lists activity.

The project struggles to find new challenges and people to activelly work on
the project. This issue has been discussed several times, still looking for a
sustainable solution.

A release is long overdue (now more than two years since the last!). After the
last report in November there was some small and short-lived development
activity to resolve the remaining issues, but without much progress.

## Health report: 

The project was considered feature-complete in 3.3.0. The current release 
cicle (3.4.0) focused on refining and fixing bug, plus incorporation some 
non-core new features. The development (issues, commits, emails) has 
significantly come down in the last year.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Description:

Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away
from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic
distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

Issues:

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

Activity:

  The project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features, reviews
  and releases. The mailing lists, slack and IRC channels are also very much
  active with healthy discussions.

Current plans:

  Mesos 1.3 is being released this month.

New committers:

  Haosdent Huang and Neil Conway were voted in as committers and PMCs. 

  Another contributor is close to becoming a committer and we are actively
  working to nominate them.

Committer diversity:

  We are excited about our newest committer Haosdent because he adds diversity
  in terms of organization (independent) and geography (China).

  We need to identify more diverse potential committers from our contributor
  pool.

Releases: (since last board report)

  1.1.0       Nov 10th
  1.0.2       Nov 15th
  1.2.0       In progress

   Providing a common interface for discovery, exploration of metadata and
   querying of different types of data sources.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

Apache Oltu Oauth2 module version 1.0.2 was released June 20th 2016.

Apache Oltu Parent v4 was released June 20th 2016.


CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard. A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014 and some minor
releases are going out regularly for bug fixing. Updated modules contained bug
fixing were released June 20th 2016 . Vote for releasing JWT 1.0.3 is in
progress.

At the moment we are working on JSON Web Encryption support ( OLTU-80 -
Implement JWE support for JWT IN PROGRESS ).  
In a recent mail thread in private@ some important things have been pointed
out:

The last few months it has been awfully quiet (this might also be due the fact
the OAuth spec is stable). But not only, since we have some patches laying
around for a while

The release has not been finished. It seems some of the artifacts are not
synched correctly in https://www.apache.org/dist/oltu

The builds keep failing 

One of the outcome was that embracing the Apache way of having new blood from
time to time we are going to rotate the VP for the project. Hence I proposed
to step down from my role of chair. Unluckily at the moment nobody seems to be
keen  to take this responsibility. For this reason I will keep my role of
chair for now.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

Activities on the task have slowed down in December and January due to the
holidays and a large number of science conferences that many of the project's
committers attend.  This is expected and we look forward to an uptick soon.
The project released v 1.1.0 late in July which provides a number of key
features required of the tool in addition to many quality-of-life
improvements. The team is working towards 1.2 and a number of new features.

Issues for the Board:

  None

When was the last committer or PMC member elected:

  - Omkar Reddy - 20 January 2016

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe M. Chiasson]


--- mod_perl --

No new mod_perl 2.x releases since 2016-10.

-- Activity --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
fixes are applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

The genral activity is low, but the recent release of mod_perl 2.0.10 has
caused some renewed movement on the development side, even if somwaht minor.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, with a bump in activity
following the 2.0.10 RCs and the final release.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.

-- Commiters --

Currently 22 committers. 

No new changes to the committer base since last report. 

-- PMC --

Currently 11 PMC members. 

No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

  improvements.
- Work progressing on a 5.0 release leveraging Apache Calcite.

## Health report:
 - The project is healthy and continues to grow as users look for easy
   ways to gain insight over and manage their ever-increasing Hadoop
   data through standard SQL and JDBC APIs.

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

## Description:
- Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
  formats

## Issues:
- there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
- There was work in some areas, notably parsing/reading of WMF/EMF files which
  can be used for pictures in Office documents. Also initial support for
  extracting text from embedded files was added and some improvements to
  handling of Unicode characters have landed. Additionally a number of
  Findbugs/SonarQube reports were fixed.

  On the build-automation-side the Gradle build was enhanced some more and the
  Jenkins builds are now fully version-controlled as part of the core source via
  the Jenkins DSL plugin.

  We release 3.16-beta1 in November and just released 3.16-beta2.

  Additionally a number of users posted questions on the user-list which were
  discussed.

## Health report:
- the last few months we saw a bit less bugfix-activity, the number of open
  bug-reports is unfortunately increasing. However this is partly due to the
  nature of Apache POI and the inherent complexity of the Office formats, which
  means there is a constant influx of bug-reports, some with fairly high
  complexity and needed amount of work to resolve.

  On new committers/PMC: there are currently only a few users active enough to
  discuss committership to bring on new talent.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 28 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Greg Woolsey on Wed Oct 05 2016

## Committer base changes:

## Releases:

- 3.16-beta1 was released on Sun Nov 20 2016
- 3.16-beta2 was released on Thu Feb 02 2017

## Mailing list activity:

- Mainly constant membership numbers. POI is a mature project with a stable
  user/developer-base.

- dev@poi.apache.org:
 - 238 subscribers (down -4 in the last 3 months):

- There were no new committer additions in this quarter.
  The most recent new committer is Ganesh Murthy, added on 29th Feb 2016.

# Development:

- The AMQP 1.0 JMS client had its 0.20.0 release adding support for JMS 2.0,
  and moving to requiring Java 8. Various bug fixes and improvements have
  been made since, and a followup release is planned in the coming weeks.

- Following previous discussion around future direction for Proton, its
  C (+language binding) and Java components have been made independently
  releasable, and each has since undergone a new 0.17.0 release. Work now
  continues toward their respective 0.18.0 releases.

- Development on the Java broker and AMQP 0-x JMS client continues, with
  discussions undertaken around moving the broker to require Java 8 and
  separating the AMQP 0-x JMS client out as an independently releasable
  component going forward as more emphasis is placed on AMQP 1.0 support,
  with work on these changes now under way.

- Work is ongoing towards a 0.8.0 release of the Qpid Dispatch router
  incorporating numerous improvements and bug fixes.

Roller 5.0.3 Tomcat and MySQL.
   
## Issues: 

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 

 - The core Roller community is small and with low activity levels.
 - Roller website was switched over from Apache CMS to Git PubSub with JBake
 - There is ongoing work to create a modernized UI using Bootstrap with Struts,
   but it has slowed a bit since our last report.
   
## Health report: 

 - Community is made-up of part-time volunteers with limited time to devote to Roller.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description:
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - There was one release over the last quarter - Apache Santuario XML Security
   for Java 2.0.8. This was a minor bug fix release. We have only had one
   issue fixed since the last release, so at this point we don't anticipate
   another release in the next quarter.

   An image was added to the Santuario web page pointing to the Apache
   "current event" to help promote ApacheCon.

## Health report:
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC. Right now there are no obvious potential new committers for the
   project.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 6 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Marc Giger on Wed Apr 03 2013

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 16 committers.
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial
objects for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The
SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and enables the
creation of metadata objects which comply with the model of
international standards. The SIS referencing module enable the
construction of geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing such
as axis, projection and coordinate reference system definitions, along
with the associated operations which enable the mathematical conversion
of coordinates between different systems of reference.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

### On items cited in previous SIS report:

The previous report (November 2016) listed Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
work that we were integrating into trunk. Since that report, integration
has been completed for the metadata part of LANDSAT and GeoTIFF formats.
Work has not yet started for integration of MODIS and Catalog Web
Services (WCS) parts. In relation with this work, the board provided the
following feedback:

    rb: "Remi Marechal is continuing Hao's work on GeoTIFF" ... does
    that mean that Hao went away at the end of the GSoC effort? (I'm
    curious about the long-term benefits of GSoC in growing communities.)

Hao went back to the university after GSoC and did not have much time
for SIS anymore. She is still in touch with the Vietnamese Space Agency
(VNSC) which provided GSoC data, and contacted us in October about the
HDF format. We presume that her contribution will depend on Apache SIS
relevance for VSNC, but do not know if they are still using it.

The previous report cited the recent JSR-363 final approval and its
implementation in Apache SIS. We need the Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC) to release GeoAPI 3.0.1 before we can release Apache SIS 0.8
(unless we rollback our JSR-363 support). This release has been approved
in OGC meeting in Taiwan in December and is now in the hands of OGC staff.

### Integration of new work:

A work has been submitted for the GPS Exchange (GPX) format. This
integration has been completed, but raise questions about its API that
have been submitted on the mailing list [1].

Recently, a new possible contributor upgraded the XML metadata file
format supported by Apache SIS to the latest revision of the
international standard [2]. His company seems willing to share their
work, but we are still checking if they agree to sign ICLA.

### Meetings

Presented Apache SIS to some Hitachi and AIST peoples in Tokyo. The
presentation was similar to the "Apache SIS for Earth Observation" talk
done at ApacheCon in Seville [3]. We discussed about conceptual issues
encounter while implementing the Moving Feature standard in Apache SIS
(some authors of that standard were in the room), and the next steps for
collaboration.

## Health report

Commits continue at the usual pace, but are still mostly from the same
committer. Project is reported as healthy by the Apache Committe Report
Helper. Issues requiring a decision that could have a wide impact are
posted on the mailing list [1], but trig few discussion at this time. I
would like to post an email about the above-cited issue with the "Moving
Features" implementation, but I'm not sure what would be the most
appropriate list (dev@sis...? geospatial@...?, OGC mailing list?) since
the issue is quite abstract and require familiarity with some ISO standards.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Evgeny Kotkov]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  During this quarter, the community has finished the work on two
  bugfix/security releases addressing the CVE-2016-8734 vulnerability.

  Apart from this, we have been working on changes planned for Subversion
  1.10.x.  Overall, these changes include different minor improvements,
  and two new features: the interactive tree conflict resolver, and
  the reimplemented authorization mechanism with a support for wildcard
  rules.  There are plans to release an alpha version with these features
  in the nearby time.

  Our dev@ and users@ mailing lists are active and have received 292 and
  336 messages during the past three months. (This is roughly the same
  amount as in the previous quarter.)  The commit rate remains on the same
  level as well.

  Stefan Hett was added to the Subversion PMC in February 2017.
  Last committer addition was November 2015 (James McCoy).

* SHA1 Collisions and Subversion

  With the recent publication of the first known SHA1 collision by Google
  and CWI, we have identified a couple of related issues.

  While Subversion is designed to not rely on SHA1 for content indexing, we
  found a few bugs in the implementations of particular features.  The most
  severe issue is caused by an oversight in the data deduplication feature.
  It can result in inability to access files with colliding SHA1 values or
  result in data loss for such files.

  We are now working on resolving these issues.  It is likely that we
  will need to prepare new 1.8.x and 1.9.x patch releases, and schedule
  additional changes for Subversion 1.10.x.

* Releases

  Since the last report, Subversion 1.8.17 and 1.9.5 were released on
  November 29th.

  The work toward Subversion 1.10.x continues, and we hope to prepare a
  1.10.0-alpha1 release soon.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can help with integration builds for a new release that integrates
Xerces-C.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Oregon State University Capstone students are now working hard on the
Xalan source code and Apache web server integration to prototype
a high-performance XML transformation service. Student activity is
being tracked on GitHub as part of their classwork.

Most activity has been through JIRA issue tracking. The email lists
have seen little activity.

There has been sparce build activity toward patch releases.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.
