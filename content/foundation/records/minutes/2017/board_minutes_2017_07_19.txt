 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       I've had an unusually busy month personally, which means I'm well
       behind on follow through from the minutes and actions from the face to
       face.  This will be a priority for me next week.

       I have completed a basic run book for board meetings, annual meetings
       and other Chairman's duties, and intend to commit these and walk Phil
       through them over the next month.

    B. President [Sam]

       My current priorities: EA/TAC/Conferences

       Items requiring board attention:

         None.

       - - -

       Financially, we continue to be on track.  Timing considerations make
       us look like we are ahead on fundraising, but this is primarily due
       to a number of large FY17 sponsorship payments hitting the books
       this calendar year.  We currently project to be $185K over budget vs
       being $171K under last year.  Similarly, we are $11K over budget for
       infrastructure, again this primarily timing considerations.

       Marketing an Publicity collected and published the FY2017 annual
       report: https://s.apache.org/FY2017AnnualReport

       The infrastructure team continues to migrate machines to the cloud.
       The team is also working with the Whimsy community to automate
       worklfows.  It is also looking to fill one open headcount.

       Conferences is awaiting a bit for ApacheCon 2018, and is exploring a
       greater presence at other conferences.

       Things seem to be settling down in both Fundraising and Brand
       Management.  In the upcoming months, my focus will turn to seeing if we
       can utilize our EA better, which will involve discussions with each
       officer in operations, starting with Conferences.  If people have any
       ideas along these lines, please let me know or reach out to Melissa
       directly.

    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a brief summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first
       two months of FY18. 

       Cash on June 30th 2017 was $1,842K, which is up $202.1K from last
       month’s ending balance (May 17) of $1,639.9K, due to the timing of
       some Sponsor payments (Google, Comcast and Microsoft Platinum sponsor
       payments arrived in June 2017).   The June 2017 cash balance is up
       $82K from the June 2016 month end balance of $1,760K.  The June 2017
       ending cash balance of $1,842K represents a cash reserve of 15.7
       months based on the FY18 Cash forecast average monthly spending of
       $117.1K/month. The ASF reserve continues to be very healthy for an
       organization of ASF’s size, with an FY18 YE estimate of 13 month’s
       cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong showing
       against our FY18 Budget.  Revenue YTD is $555.8K vs a budget of
       $167.2K.  This was due to the Platinum Sponsor payments for Google,
       Comcast (upgraded to Platinum from Gold) and Microsoft which had been
       forecasted to arrive later in the year.  This has us for revenue,
       $388.6K ahead of budget through June 2017.  So with the $555.8K of
       Sponsor revenue received so far in the first two months of FY18 we are
       more than 50% to our budgeted Sponsor revenue goal of $1,084K for
       FY18.  We are also now forecasting with the remaining sponsorships,
       and the Coinbase base revenue to be about $181K ahead of the $1,084K
       FY18 budget,  if the sponsors that were budgeted for the last 10
       months of FY18 all renew.

       YTD expenses are over by $11K.  Infra is over by $13K and the other
       depts. combined are under by $2K. I would caution that we are only two
       months into the current fiscal year so it is very early yet.  That
       said I have included all of the VP’s and dept heads on this email and
       will follow up with them to make sure that the forecast looks
       accurate.

       With regard to Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $383K NI vs a budgeted negative $55K NI or $383K ahead of
       Budget for the first two months of FY18.  With the forecasted revenue
       ahead of budget due to the Pivotal and Microsoft FY 17 payments as
       well as the Coinbase funds coming in FY18 and expenses close to Budget
       at this point we are estimating a $2K positive NI for FY18 vs a
       budgeted NI loss of $168K.  While it is a fantastic start and we
       should very pleased with all the hard work that everyone has put into
       the FY so far, it is still a bit early in the FY at this point.

       Assistant Treasurer:

       Audit and Tax Quote: See
       https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7wNkTj2wH_Tamc1dmR1Mmw3b3c for the
       full information but here’s the most relevant information:

       “Based on our experience and the information furnished to us, we
       anticipate our fees for this engagement to be as follows: Fees Hours
       The Apache Software Foundation modified cash basis financial statement
       audit as of April 30, 2017. $9,500 
       Preparation of Form 990 for the Apache Software Foundation as of April
       30, 2017. $1,500 
       Note: The above fees include all out-of-pocket expenses and a 15%
       discount for non-profit organizations.”

       KAM: Based on Tom's recommendations* and our past work with this firm,
       I believe it's a good choice.  And from reviewing the budget, we have
       this already in the approved FY18 budget.

       Board’s thoughts on waiting 4.5 more months and do the audit for 2017
       rather than 2016?  Seems like it might be a good use of the
       association funds to do that.

       * Tom: “attached please find the updated proposal from Overton
         that includes a full FY 17 Audit, as well as FY16 balance
         review and the FY 17 990 prep ( which at $1,500 is discounted
         from the FY16 version).  So at $11,000 combined with what
         they need to do in an audit vs a Review, i.e doing walk
         through etc , is reasonable as Accrual audits alone we
         typically see $16K plus 990 prep. “

       - Bitcoins complete.  All “dust” converted to USD - $120.14 USD
       deposit confirmed

       - PayPal is now set to accept Euros.

       - Overall things are becoming more routine so my reports as Asst
       Treasurer should be much shorter while I continue to backstop Uli as
       needed.


       Previously Reported Items Still Tracking:
       - Contribution Language for Car Donations - No update and I’m guessing
       we might not get feedback.
       - Payment Privacy changes to move away from Dropbox, etc. - UPDATE:
       Virtual will be documenting what they do now which is working so we
       can discuss if change is needed.
       - CDARS - Virtual is working towards a method to FDIC insure our
       entire balance and is researching CDARS - Virtual is meeting with the
       bank to discuss.
       - Network for Good - Missing a $125 check - Will ask for a reissue.
       - Credit Card with a lower foreign transaction fee still being
       researched - no update

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       In June 88 iclas, six cclas, and three grants were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastructure
       --------------

       Confirms that after evaluation of workload it is indeed necessary to
       employ a sixth team member (this is not additional headcount, rather
       the filling of an open position).

       Good progress on reducing dependency on OSU/OSL with the replacement
       and puppetization of Jenkins.

       Conferences
       -----------

       Exploring options for future events.

       TAC
       ---

       ACNA’17 was $9,200 under budget. Evaluation surveys and interviews are
       underway.

    F. Vice Chairman [Phil]

       I have nothing to report this month.

       interests of the Foundation and consistent with the
       Foundation's purpose to establish a Project Management
       Committee charged with the creation and maintenance of
       open-source software, for distribution at no charge to the
       public, related to a scalable, Big Data, SQL-driven machine
       learning framework for Data Scientists.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a Project Management
       Committee (PMC), to be known as the "Apache MADlib Project",
       be and hereby is established pursuant to Bylaws of the
       Foundation; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the Apache MADlib Project be and hereby is
       responsible for the creation and maintenance of software
       related to a scalable, Big Data, SQL-driven machine
       learning framework for Data Scientists.

       RESOLVED, that the office of "Vice President, Apache MADlib" be
       and hereby is created, the person holding such office to
       serve at the direction of the Board of Directors as the chair

       responsibility of the Apache MADlib Project; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the persons listed immediately below be and
       hereby are appointed to serve as the initial members of the
       Apache MADlib Project:
         Sarah Aerni <saerni@apache.org>

       or until a successor is appointed; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the initial Apache MADlib PMC be and hereby is

       Special Order 7A, Establish the Apache MADlib Project, was
       approved by Unanimous Vote of the directors voting, with
       Shane Curcuru abstaining. 

       As the MADlib trademark hasn't been transferred to the Foundation yet:
	   
       1) MADlib is required to include a disclaimer on their homepage and in
       their releases, indicating that the mark doesn't belong to the ASF so
       far, until the trademark is transferred.

       2) The expectation is that the trademark handover will be completed
       before the end of 2017.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

No issues to report at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]


* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

None.


* OPERATIONS

Surprisingly quiet month overall, fewer than normal incoming questions. 
Issues with some podlings approaching graduation without completing
PODLINGNAMESEARCH processes were raised, and hopefully the IPMC will be
working to ensure the incubating policies are clear and easy to follow. 
Thanks to John D. Ament for starting work on this.

Worked with counsel to review a podling's trademark transfer agreement.

Held a call with a large company to clarify a serious trademark request we
had previously made to them, with a good conclusion.

Website Analytics show that while the /foundation/marks page is the most often
visited, the /list page of all trademarks is the second most visited page,
surprisingly.  Not enough data yet to see other notable trends, other than a
fairly low number of hits overall.

Thanks in general to the Accumulo, JMeter, and OFBiz PMCs who have each been
doing a good job of managing some brand questions on their own recently.


* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

IMPALA's incoming transferred registration in Brazil was issued.

A large number of renewals are coming up over the next 6 months, including
many international registrations (which are notably more expensive to renew,
typically).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

Continue working to document and improve fundraising processes but I think
things are moving in a good direction thanks to a lot of people’s efforts.  

Much of the groundwork in the past few months is working well without too much
help.  Specifically, Hopsie, Benevity and monitoring fundraising has helped
with a number of fundraising items that would have been previously missed.

Some new bronze sponsors are in the works.

Some potential sponsors to reach out to it seems mentioned by a Gartner
Analyst: https://twitter.com/merv/status/885616674631593984

Continue to uncover additional sponsors where invoicing was missed.  Continue
making strides in fixing this with better procedures as well.  Big thanks to
Lynsey, Tom and Sally for lots of help on this matter.

Sally has spearheaded using mailchimp to notify individual sponsors of our
annual report and similar items The Sponsor Ambassadorship program continues. 

Working to get access to TechSoup for ASF.  Ross Gardler is on Vacay so expect
that to be solved soon.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule with no vendor payments
due at this time. We are working with Virtual to sort out an
overcharge from the Intercontinental Hotel incurred during ApacheCon.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: work with ASF Fundraising continues, with
Sally Khudairi leading Sponsor engagement with support from Rich
Bowen, Jim Jagielski, Tom Pappas, Mark Thomas, and Hadrian Zbarcea.
She also continues work on individual giving and donor outreach. The
ASF Annual Report for FY2017 was published at the end of June as
planned https://s.apache.org/FY2017AnnualReport

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcement was issued via
the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 29 June 2017 - The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Annual
Report for 2017 Fiscal Year

IV. Informal Announcements: 5 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total
of 156 weekly summaries published to date. We tweeted 14 items, and
now have 42.7K followers. 5 items were posted on LinkedIn, and
garnered more than 39K collective organic impressions.

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 3 media queries. The ASF received
765 press clips vs. last month's clip count of 1,223. Media coverage
of Apache projects yielded 2,870 press hits vs. last month's 3,144.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received 2 analyst queries during this
timeframe. Apache was mentioned in 23 reports by Gartner (including 2
Magic Quadrant reports), 6 reports by Forrester, 18 reports by 451
Research, and 8 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: Sally continues to design templates for ASF business
cards and related promotional materials.

IX. ApacheCon liaison: we will continue to support ApacheCon as the
event evolves.

X. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: we are exploring
participating at various events as exhibitors and/or community
partners; details will be shared as they become available.

XI. Newswire accounts: we have 12 pre-paid press releases remaining
with NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017; any unused
announcements will be applied towards our new contract that ends in
December 2019.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infra continues to operate as expected, and there are no issues for
the President or the Board at this time.

Operations Action Items
=======================
- Continue discussions with the Whimsy community on Foundation
  workflows, and how Infra can support their work (more below)

Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Fill the open headcount. The past few months have been an evaluation
  of the team with five FTEs, and it is (now) clear that our workload
  demands all six allocated/budgeted positions to be filled.

Long Range Priorities
=====================
- We continue to reduce technical debt by puppetizing services (which
  reduces manual configuration) and moving to cloud-based hosts and
  VMs (reducing reliance on our own hardware, and offering flexibility)
- Automation of Infra tasks is on our long-range planning, but has
  been placed at a lower priority relative to puppetizing services and
  migration to cloud-based VMs. However, the Whimsy community has
  engaged with the Infra community to add various tooling/services to
  their tool. Several workflow improvements have occurred, with more
  planned and/or waiting to be rolled out.

Jenkins Upgrade
===============
Jenkins was migrated to a new VM and VM host on Saturday, July 15.  At
the same time, Jenkins was upgraded to the latest 2.60.1. Work had
been done in preperation in writing a new jenkins_asf Puppet Module
and Yaml in readiness for this and a builds-test soaked in and allowed
tweaks to the puppet config.

A fair amount of downtime (over 10 hours) was due to a final rsync of
data after turning off Jenkins, the installation of upgraded plugins
before the overall upgrade, and another round of plugin upgrades after
the upgrade (for those plugins not compatible until new version was
installed). All nodes also had to be updated to use a JDK1.8
connection. This has consequences for those projects using Maven type
jobs and want to build with JDK1.7 and earlier, but this has been
discussed and workarounds noted.

The builds@apache.org mailing was notified many weeks ago about the
upcoming upgrade and migration, and again shortly before the upgrade
happened. During the upgrade, Twitter, builds@ and operations@ were
also kept in the loop every few hours until completion.

At this stage, builds.a.o is operating smoothly with just a few
non-infra owned nodes needing to reconnect. We may bump the VM memory
after a few days of stats collecting, but we'll see.

In terms of technical debt, this allows us to retire physical hardware
(crius) which is located at OSU/OSL. Our new Jenkins Puppet Module
also gives us much more flexibility to move, restore, and otherwise
manage the Jenkins system.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

This month we have had discussions with various other conferences
about Apache presence at their event.

We continue to await a bid for ApacheCon 2018, possibly in Canada, so
that we can determine whether that option is worth pursuing.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]


* Results from the Post-ApacheCon surveys are still trickling in
* TAC Interviews also trickling in and will be dropped in svn and included on
  the website under the “travel stories” once received.
* As stated previously, ACNA’17 was $9,200 under budget due to two folks
  dropping out after being approved/budgeted for. This will be carried forward
  for future events.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Andy Seaborne (andy@) has joined the "Declarative Linked Data Apps" Community
Group. ASF has already joined this CG so no further commitments are made.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

The top level item to report this month is the movement of Facebook's
BSD+patents license to Category-X as documented in LEGAL-303 [1].
We provided a similar transition period as was given during the
JSON license decision arrived at earlier.  The decision has caused
much discussion on Reddit, Hacker News, and there have been a handful
of news articles published about it. Legal requests that discussion
occur on the legal-discuss@a.o list for any follow-ups and there
have been a few already (e.g., from Hadoop, and other projects).

Other legal questions are being answered as quickly as possible.
There have been a few decisions related to the use of data to train
models in Apache projects.  In LEGAL-313 [2], we decided to disallow
use of the Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset in Apache Projects,
whereas in LEGAL-309 [3] we decided to allow use of the Universal
Dependencies (UD) datasets to train models for Apache OpenNLP whereas
in LEGAL-317 [4] we affirmed prior discussion that OntoNotes corpus
data and LDC data are not useable in Apache projects.

Ongoing discussion also revolves around the use of system dependencies,
e.g., autoconf generated header files as in LEGAL-300 [5], and header
files licensed under LGPL in LEGAL-316 [6].

Another question raised this month is Legal's opinion on the
collection of usage statistics during running/execution of ASF
products, e.g., collecting anonymous usage data when code is running.
Discussion is ongoing.

In LEGAL-164 [7] the issue of Apache deriving a DCMA Safe Harbor policy
was revisited by Kevin McGrail. Discussion is ongoing.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Arrow Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:

Arrow is a columnar in-memory analytics layer designed to accelerate big data.
It houses a set of canonical in-memory representations of flat and hierarchical
data along with multiple language-bindings for structure manipulation. It also
provides IPC and common algorithm implementations.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

- Heavy development activity and growing community since the last board
  report. We have made 3 releases, with the next release 0.5.0 coming soon.

- The Arrow 0.3.0 release on May 2 included C and Ruby bindings for the Arrow
  C++ libraries. We have also seen a native JavaScript (TypeScript)
  implementation appear for use.

- The TurbODBC C++ and Python project released version 2.0.0
  which included support for converting ODBC data to Apache
  Arrow. This was enabled by an internal C++ API to the Python
  Arrow bindings, and will help provide a blueprint for future
  thirdparty Python libraries that use Arrow.

- The Ray project for machine learning from the UC Berkeley RISELab contributed
  a large software component, a shared memory object store ("Plasma"), to the
  Apache Arrow project.

- We have made significant progress toward completing compatibility between the
  Java and C++ implementations of the Arrow memory format. As soon as we
  achieve reasonable completeness, we should consider leaping to Arrow 1.0.0 to
  communicate to the rest of the open source world that Arrow is no longer as
  much of a work-in-progress and ready for more widespread use.

- We have created the arrow-dist git repo to assist with cross-language and
  cross-platform packaging.

- Apache Spark has merged its first Arrow integration, SPARK-13534

- The external GPU Open Analytics Initiative is using Apache Arrow as its data
  interchange format

## Health report:

- Arrow is seeing an uptick in community interest and adoption. The increase in
  activity reflects the project's scope expanding (i.e. more programming
  languages) and increase in use in other projects. We expect this trend to
  continue as Arrow's perception changes to be deemed more production-ready and
  stable.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Jesús Camacho Rodríguez]

## Description:

Apache Calcite is a highly customizable framework for parsing and
planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

Avatica is a sub-project within Calcite, and provides a framework
for building local and remote JDBC and ODBC database drivers. Avatica
has an independent release schedule, and since April 2017, it has its
own independent repository.
  
## Issues:

- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity:

Development and mailing list activity is steady for both Calcite and
its Avatica sub-project.

Since the last board meeting, there has been one Calcite release
and one Avatica release.

Avatica 1.10.0 was released at the end of May. As the Calcite and
Avatica projects become more separate, this was the first release
since Avatica’s git repository separated from Calcite’s repository
during the previous quarter. The release added support for JDBC Array
data, Docker, and JDK 9 (it continues to run on JDK 7 and 8).
In total, there were over 20 new features and bug fixes.

In turn, Calcite 1.13.0 was released at the end of June. The release
included more than 75 resolved issues, comprising a large number of
new features as well as general improvements and bug-fixes. Among
others, Calcite was upgraded to use the recently released version of
Avatica.

Our community continued growing this quarter: three new committers
(Slim Bouguerra, Kevin Liew, and Zhiqiang He) were added to the project.
In addition, we seem to be attracting a more diverse set of contributors
than usual. While typically each 100 commits has around 20 distinct
contributors, the last 100 commits had 29 distinct contributors.

Finally, there was an important presence of the Apache Calcite project
in talks at multiple events, such as Apache: Big Data North America 2017
(Miami, FL), PhoenixCon (San Francisco, CA), and
DataWorks Summit USA 2017 (San Jose, CA).
  
## Health report:

Activity levels on mailing lists, git and JIRA are normal for both
Calcite and Avatica.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you
build and develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as
HTTP, JMS or JBI.

There are also two sub-projects that leverage CXF:

Fediz - Fediz helps you to secure your web applications via the standard
 WS-Federation Passive Requestor Profile.

DOSGi - is the reference implementation of the Distribution Provider
 component of the OSGi Remote Services Specification

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
 -  There was quite a bit of effort this quarter to get 3.1.12 out.   There 
    were several fixes in 3.1.12 that users were waiting for.   With 3.1.12 
    now out, efforts are shifting to getting Fediz and DOSGi subprojects 
    updated to 3.1.12 and getting those releases out.  Also, a request was 
    made from Tomee project to back port some security fixes to 2.6.x 
    branch (long unsupported) which we have decided to work with them to 
    get a new release from that branch for them.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

Report from the Apache DB Project  [Bryan Pendleton]

## Description:

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o Derby    : a relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO      : focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility
              testing of Java Data Object implementations providing data
              persistence.
 o Torque   : an object-relational mapper for Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

The JDO community is busy working on release 3.2. There are a number
of JIRA issues with bug fixes and new features included.

The JDO specification is led by Oracle with Craig Russell acting as
Oracle's representative. With Craig's retirement from Oracle, the JDO
project will need to find a new specification lead. There are a few
alternatives, including finding another specification lead from the
active JDO contributors and Craig continuing to serve as specification
lead as an individual. Craig is working with Oracle to resolve this.

The Derby community has begun work on a new release, scheduled
for the fall, and has proposed that this will be the last Derby release
that will support Java 8.

The Derby community is mentoring a student in the Google Summer
of Code; he has passed his mid-term project evaluation successfully.

## Health report:

In general, the software in the DB project is mature and reliable,
and isn't undergoing much change, so periods of low activity occur.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Alan Cabrera]

## Description: 
 Apache Geronimo delivers reusable Java Enterprise components that meet 
 the needs of enterprise developers and system administrators.
   
## Issues: 
 There is still a discussion going on about the future of Geronimo
 and whether to shut down the project or continue as 'EE commons'.
 The Community can roughly be split in 4 parts: 
  * Inactive PMCs. More of half of the PMC didn't show up since 2 years
  * Active PMCs but only interested in the G server (which is dead) 
  * Active PMSc which are are interested in the 'common' parts
  * Active contributors which are not PMCs. We now made a few of them committer
 It's most likely that the PMC can handle those discussions well,
 but we don't want to hide this from the board.
  
## Activity: 
 G server remains dead. 2 or 3 mails from users droping in per quarter, but
 there is no maintenance going on.
 Due to the JavaEE 8 release is near, the spec part gets lots of active love.
 We even started a new geronimo-config Module which is an implementation of
 the Microprofile Config specification. It already attracted contributors.
   
## Health report: 
 Tons of discussions regarding the future as explained above.

2.0.0-alpha-1 was released on June 09, 2017 under the supervision of
co-RMs Michael Stack and Stephen Yuan Jiang.

Andrew Purtell volunteered to branch for and stabilize a new 1.x code
line - 1.4.x - with the release of 1.4.0 tentatively planned two months'
time from now.

ACTIVITY

I am pleased to report we have added two members to our PMC in this
reporting period: Devaraj Das joined us on June 29, 2017, and Chunhui
Shen joined us on Jul 3, 2017. We now have 37 PMC members.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [John D. Ament]

Incubator PMC report for July 2017

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are currently 57 podlings incubating.  Three podlings joined us this
month, two podlings have retired, one has graduated to a sub-project and the
board has resolutions for one (three?) podlings to become TLPs this month.
Podlings executed eight releases this past month.  We have added two new IPMC
members, neither an existing foundation member.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Steve Blackmon
  - Benjamin Young

* New Podlings

  - Heron
  - Livy
  - Pulsar

* Podlings that failed to report, expected next month

  - BatchEE  - Low on list activity
  - DataFu   - No on list activity, will follow up with a status request and
               potentially retirement
  - Gobblin  - No on list activity, will follow up with a status request
  - HORN     - Actively voting on retirement, no report expected
  - MRQL     - Discussing retirement, single developer mode
  - Netbeans - Moderate on list activity, no one stepped up to do report

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - Fluo
  - MADlib
  - Streams

  The following podlings graduated into subprojects:

  - DistributedLog (BookKeeper)

* Retirements

  The following podlings retired this month:

  - Blur
  - Sirona

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  June:

  - 2017-06-09 Apache Weex 0.12.0
  - 2017-06-13 Apache TrafficControl 1.8.1
  - 2017-06-15 Apache Impala 2.9.0
  - 2017-06-17 Apache RocketMQ 4.1.0
  - 2017-06-18 Apache Tamaya 0.3
  - 2017-06-22 Apache Fluo Recipes 1.1.0
  - 2017-06-23 Apache Mnemonic 0.8.0
  - 2017-06-28 Apache Juneau 6.3.0

* Infrastructure

  - We need to continue to ensure that podlings are bootstrapped in proper 
    sequence.  Recent changes to Whimsy have caused new steps to be added,
    but not communicated.  We will need infra help to support some of these
    new steps.
  - Thanks to the infra team, the Incubator website has been migrated to a
    new technology and has received a needed facelift.

* Miscellaneous

  - With the website migrated, work will begin to refresh the Incubator
    documentation.

* Credits

  - Special thanks to Dave Fisher for rejoining the shepherd community

Airflow

Airflow is a workflow automation and scheduling system that can be used to
author and manage data pipelines.

Airflow has been incubating since 2016-03-31.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We are working on our third apache release 1.8.2 to get more experience
     with the process
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
None

How has the community developed since the last report?
  1. We had our second official release. 1.8.1 on May 9th 2017.
  2. Since our last podling report 3 months ago (i.e. between Apr 1 and July
     5, inclusive), we grew our contributors from 256 to 280
  4. Since our last podling report 3 months ago (i.e. between Apr 1 and July
     5, inclusive), we resolved 151 pull requests (currently at 1630 closed
     PRs)
  5. A new meet-up group formed in Tokyo, Japan - they held their first
     meet-up on May 11.
  6. Since being accepted into the incubator, the number of companies
     officially using Apache Airflow has risen from 30 to 98, 15 new from
     last podling report.


How has the project developed since the last report?
See above : 151 PR resolved, 24 new contributors, & 15 new companies
officially using it.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

Annotator

Annotator provides annotation enabling code for browsers, servers, and humans.

Annotator has been incubating since 2016-08-30.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. grow the participation of folks with commit bit
  2. unblock community "waiting" on founders
  3. ship some code

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Not at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  May was a busy "in person" engagement month. Members of our community
  participated at http://iannotate.org/ and ApacheCon NA 2017 in Miami--where
  there was an Annotator specific presentation:
  https://apachecon2017.sched.com/mobile/#session:f8889fb0de17e3b2fec61e068889e06b
  There was great interest in the project and it's future.

  Additionally, documents were signed by members of The Hypothes.is Project
  http://hypothes.is/ There is interest from Hypothesis in depending on and
  eventually contributing to Annotator.

  We also added tbdinesh http://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=tbdinesh
  as a core committer--he was in the list of initial committers in our
  original proposal.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have successfully setup Gitbox (thanks Infra!), and moved our
  development to GitHub https://github.com/apache/incubator-annotator
  We have processed a couple PRs (from core committers), and intend to work
  in a PR-first, discuss, merge pattern to encourage more involvement from
  the community in code review.

How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

FreeMarker

FreeMarker is a template engine, i.e. a generic tool to generate text output
based on templates. FreeMarker is implemented in Java as a class library for
programmers.

FreeMarker has been incubating since 2015-07-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  We have a large user base but a rather small group of committers.
  This was actually expected, given the maturity (and topic) of the project.
  While the FreeMarker 3 branch, which was started 5 month ago, will be much
  more appealing for contributors, development and growth due to that will
  certainly take a long time. In other respects the project is mature and
  ready for graduation.
  
Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We are eager to graduate but we're afraid that the number of active
  contributors will prevent that in the foreseeable future. But remaining in
  the incubator hurts the project as well. One problem it causes is that many
  projects are stuck with the last non-Apache release of the project, from
  two years ago, since they won't depend on an artifact whose version contains
  "-incubating".

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There were no changes since the last report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Most activity was in the FreeMarker 3 branch; most notably, FreeMarker was
  modularized and switched to Gradle.
  The FreeMarker 2 branch was less active, but had some fixes and new features.
  During the last report period we have received a code donation, the source
  code of an online template evaluator service, which was since then cleand up,
  and is now running on Apache infrastructure (http://try.freemarker.org/).
  The build of FreeMarker and of the template evaluator service was added to
  Travis CI.

Gossip

Gossip is an implementation of the Gossip Protocol.

Gossip has been incubating since 2016-04-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase the number of active committers/reviewers
  2. Gossip used in a downstream apache application
  3. Keep making releases 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?



How has the community developed since the last report?
We have two students in the GSOC program and some new active bodies. A majority of 
admin bandwidth was spent organizing and helping with proposals.


How has the project developed since the last report?
We have added new Crdt types. We have completed event listeners and callbacks. 
We made it easier to run the examples. 

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

Software is solid. Current GSOC students will hopefully remain active after
the GSOC period.

HAWQ

Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop native SQL query engine that combines the
key technological advantages of MPP database with the scalability
and convenience of Hadoop. HAWQ reads data from and writes data
to HDFS natively.  HAWQ delivers industry-leading performance and
linear scalability. It provides users the tools to confidently
and successfully interact with petabyte range data sets. HAWQ
provides users with a complete, standards compliant SQL
interface.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards
graduation:

  1. Continue to improve the project's release cadence. To this
     end we plan on expanding automation services to support
     increased developer participation.

  2. Continue to expand the community, by adding new contributors
     and focusing on making sure that there's a much more robust
     level of conversations and discussions happening around
     roadmaps and feature development on the public dev mailing
     list.

  3. Starting with Apache HAWQ 2.2.0.0 release, the project will
     expand release artifacts to include the delivery of
     convenience binary artifacts. We expect the project to
     significantly refine the binary release process in several
     key areas. The team is limiting scope to HAWQ Core and PXF
     components.  The appropriate LICENSE, DISCLAIMER and NOTICE
     files are included in the binary release artifacts.

     FYI: The team has decided to move Ranger (optional
     component) support into a subsequent binary release. It
     remains supported in the source release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need
to be aware of?

     Nothing urgent at this time.

                public communication.  While we've opened up Slack as a
                communication channel and it has led to some external
                contribution, we need to figure out how to get more
                communication happening on list and how to get more outside

MXNet

MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework that allows you to define,
train, and deploy deep neural networks on a wide array of devices, from
cloud infrastructure to mobile devices. It is highly scalable, allowing for
fast model training, and supports a flexible programming model and multiple
languages. MXNet allows you to mix symbolic and imperative programming
flavors to maximize both efficiency and productivity. MXNet is built on a
dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic
and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of
that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The MXNet library
is portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple
machines.


MXNet has been incubating since 2017-01-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Migrate code (GitHub) and website to Apache Infra.
  2. Grow the community
  3. Establish a reliable Release process consistent with Apache Way.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?
  
   None

How has the community developed since the last report?

 a)  On 5/27 MXNet published a comprehensive edit and makeover of the
       documentation including tutorials, how-to’s, APIs and architecture guides.
       This was a broad effort that involved over 40 contributors.

 b)  The PMC voted in a new committer who has been helping with the code
       migration and setup of the test infrastructure. We are making slow but
       steady progress towards getting the GitHub code migrated. The target date
       for migration is 7/17. Website migration will happen after that.

 c)  Slack and dev@ are being used more actively.

 d)  Two presentations/workshops on Apache MXNet at the O’Reilly AI Conf on 6/27 and 6/28

 e)  A new blog post published on 6/23 showing users how to Build a
     Real-time Object Classification System with ApacheMXNet on Raspberry Pi.
     https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/build-a-real-time-object-classification-system-with-apache-mxnet-on-raspberry-pi/

How has the project developed since the last report?

 a) Since the last report 42 authors have pushed 326 commits to master.

 b) Documentation- Architecture guides, How To’s, Tutorials, and APIs have been improved.

 c) More features (e.g. operators) requested by the user community have been added.

 d) A new Perl language binding for MXNet was added.

How would you assess the podling's maturity? 
  
   Podling's still getting established in Apache - so maturity == Low.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Many existing committers finding it difficult to give dedicated time
     to the project as they are busy with other projects
  2. Talk of retirement. No consensus
  3. Need for a road map for 0.3 release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

  Discussions on weather the project should be retired. No consensus.
  Interest from committers to vet releases (multiple), contribute features
  (at least couple of committers), return to active contributions (at least
  couple of committers)

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built on
top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and query
processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across multiple nodes.
Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through SPARQL, a conventional
query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Have more releases as part of the Apache Foundation
  2. Increase diversity of contributors.
  3. Continue to harden and develop core Rya features to improve user
     experience
     
Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Adina Crainiceanu presented two Rya talks at Apache Big Data North
    America on May 16-18 in Miami:
    1. a 10 minutes presentation at the Podling Shark Tank, and a 
    2. full presentation on Apache Rya - A Scalable RDF Triple Store.

  * Pull Requests and issue reports from non-committers which are integrated
    into the repository continue to be received

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Resolved a handful of issues that users have encountered
  * GeoTemporal Indexing
  * Expanded reasoning capabilities by implementing owl:hasValue inference
  * Added construct query support, aggregation support (sums, counts,
    averages, max, min), and geo temporal filtering to Rya Fluo Incremental
    Updater
  * Mongo backed entity centric index
  * Merged pull request for singleton AccumuloMinicluster to speed up
    integration tests

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Kevin Meyer]

## Description:

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven applications
in Java.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

We have made no releases this quarter.

We had a mini-conference/users meeting on the 9th and 10th of June in 
Amsterdam that was attended by 15 people. The event was an opportunity for
users and members of the PMC to meet face to face and share experiences. To
keep things inclusive to our community, we explicitly documented the
presentations and the ideas that were raised in a Wiki page [1]. The page link
and description were posted to the users and dev mailing lists.

Most of the talks featured on possible changes to the framework, especially to
simplify it and lower barriers to entry.

Other items of interest were:
- identifying target audiences for a marketing strategy
- Renaming the project [2][3]

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Gaul]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

== Project Status ==

Ongoing improvements to set of supported providers and APIs have
characterised the past few months, with continued welcome support from a
variety of sources:

* As suggested in the board response to a previous report, we asked the
  Apache Karaf community for help with a blocking issue regarding the jclouds
  Karaf integration. The response time and the feedback was great, and the
  contributions allowed us to unlock our master branch.
* We promoted the Packet, B2 and Google Cloud Storage providers from the
  jclouds labs repository for "incubating" providers to the main jclouds repo.
  This means that we start providing backward compatibility for their
  respective APIs.
* We've started receiving contributions from DimensionData. They are
  contributing an API and provider for their cloud, which we expect to be
  completed by the next release if the contributions continue to arrive at
  the current pace.
* We have started to plan the implementation of the OpenStack Keystone v3 API,
  which is a major issue in terms of providing continued support for
  OpenStack. So far, we have received very little feedback from the community,
  though. We will be starting the effort but have not been able to engage
  (yet) active users of the OpenStack features, so progress will likely be
  slower than desired, given the lack of in-depth knowledge of the target API.

We have also completed some housekeeping by removing the essentially
unmaintained jclouds Clojure bindings, after receiving no responses
indicating active use or interest in the community.

== Community ==

We are continuing discussions around async APIs that have been proposed by
several community members. The proposal is exciting but will require careful
consideration, given that the previous jclouds async API ended but being
removed due to its complexity. The contributors of the proposal are doing
very well, and we are thankful for their patience and collaboration.

We were very happy to have received such quick help from the Apache Karaf
community in response to a request for assistance on a blocking issue - a
great expression of collaboration between projects.

There is ongoing work on a GSoC project to create a Message Queue
abstraction. This will allow us to offer a portable API for queue operations
across providers, with Azure Queues being the reference implemented by the
student.

The community composition is largely unchanged, with no new committer or PMC
member additions. We have not seen the kind of contributions from the
community recently that would put someone "on the radar".

There are currently 11 PMC members and 24 committers. 

Last committer: 2017-02-17 (Svetoslav Neykov)
Last PMC member: 2016-10-21 (Andrea Turli)

== Community Objectives ==

* Resolve our compatibility issues with Guava 21 and Java 9. The former will
  require us to drop support for some previous Guava versions, and we want to
  make sure users have a smooth upgrade path.
* Release 2.1.0 in 3Q2017

== Releases ==

The last jclouds release, 2.0.2, took place on 2017-07-06.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

Jena is a framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
in Java. It provides implementation of W3C standards for RDF and SPARQL.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

Jena 3.3.0 was released 2017-May-2017, roughly in-line with the desired
increased release cadence.

The project has received external contributions, including a significant one
that extends support for Lucene text analyzers. In addition, existing some
committers have worked closely together on language-sensitive collation while
maintaining compatibility with the W3C standard and existing releases.

## Health report:

The development activity for the project is at normal levels.  The slight drop
on the users list may be due to a small number of users asking large numbers
of basic questions on long threads. This has caused some push back by other
users on the list which the PMC has noted. The project has before gone through
such cycles before. We can hope that any users put off by the perceived noise
will become active again.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 12 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Adam Soroka on Mon Jun 06 2016

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 15 committers.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Kudu Project  [Todd Lipcon]

## Description: 

Apache Kudu is a distributed columnar storage engine built for the Apache
Hadoop ecosystem.

## Issues: 

No issues requiring the board's attention at this time.

## Activity: 

Since the last report, we've made one minor release (1.4.0) and one patch
release (1.3.1).

Development continues to focus around operability, stability, security,
and incremental performance improvements. We plan to continue making
minor releases with no reason for a major (compatibility-breaking) release
on the horizon.

## Health report: 

- Subscriptions to the user mailing list are up 9% over last quarter, with
  traffic up 20%. Subscriptions to development-related lists have grown
  at a similar rate (~9%), with traffic about even.
  
  Questions on both the mailing list and our Slack channel are typically
  answered within a day.

- Website traffic (unique user count) is down about 20% since last quarter.
  We attribute this to two factors: (1) less regular postings on our blog,
  and (2) a big spike of traffic due to some vendor announcements falling in
  Q1.

- Development velocity is pretty constant from last quarter (within 10% on
  reviews and commits, JIRA a bit down due to natural fluctuations)

- This quarter (April-Jun), we committed code authored by 21 distinct
  contributors, of whom 8 were new to the project. Of the 8 new contributors, 5
  are unaffiliated with Cloudera, who employs the majority of active
  committers. This follows the pattern over the previous several quarters.

  We are continuing to keep an eye out for committer candidates -- some of the
  newer contributors are getting close to the thresholds at which we have
  previously invited new contributors. The PMC expects to discuss and likely
  add new committers this coming quarter.

## PMC/Committer changes: 

 - Currently 16 PMC members and committers (all committers are PMC)
 - Last committer/PMC addition: Jordan Birdsell was added on Nov 8, 2016.

## Releases: 
   
 - Apache Kudu 1.4.0 was released on June 13, 2017.
 - Apache Kudu 1.3.1 was released on April 19, 2017.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Labs Project  [Danny Angus]

## Description

Apache Labs exists to incubate small and emerging projects from ASF
committers.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

There was some activity generated by posts to members@ and committers@ early
in the period. This died down without reaching a critical mass. It is my
intention to try to build on this in the next period. I have had a personal
drama which has prevented me from making more headway and delayed this report
by a month, please accept my apologies for that. 
  
## Health report: 

Subscribers are steady and mailing list activity is almost nil in this period.
Following the response to the outreach activity I have some further activity I
would like to pursue regarding the future of the project in the next period,
which I will propose to the PMC. In short I want to test whether the interest
is a just bike-shed thing or whether anyone will actually propose a lab.

## Question asked by board to clarify from last quarter’s report:  

 - AWS has been sending emails to private@mahout.apache.org RE: a small
 (~16$) balance.  This is due to Amazon donating 1000$ of cluster time to a
 project member, who has since taken a position with a different
 organization.  The 1000$ was on a now discontinued corporate card.  We are
 actively working on getting the situation worked out (the usual large
 corporate SNAFU keeps this fix at a snail’s pace), and
 getting more compute time donated from AWS.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Robert Scholte]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java 
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a 
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build 
lifecycle.

* Issues

  <<There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.>>

* Activity

  Maven 3.5.0 was been released. Only a few bug/regressions have been
  registered, which makes this a successful release. Merging the branches
  for Maven 3.5.1 has started.
  
  We're in the middle of discussions regarding disaster recovery and backup
  of Central. The current 1:1 files based has exceded the acceptable size.
  Per July 1 2017 the backup server has been shut down. We're working on
  identifying different scenarios, with their infrastructure requirements
  over time, and we'll come back to ask for resources once we have better
  visibility.

  We've been informed on CVE-2012-6153, a bug in Apache Commons HttpClient.
  Maven itself uses a more recent version, so that project isn't affected. 
  However, the wagon-webdav-jackrabbit was still using quite an old version,
  so currently we're rewriting the code and will push a new version ASAP.
  
  Java 9 has reached a new phase. We notice that the community is starting
  to experiment with it and some new issues are exposed is a couple of
  maven-plugins. In general they are easy to fix, but it also implies that
  we have to do quite some "just for java 9"-releases of plugins.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Description:

Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute
resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling
fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and
run effectively.


Issues:

There are no Board-level issues at this time.


Activity:
 
* We finished a successful MesosCon Asia where we saw over 12 new
users present. The conference was co-located with Linux Foundation's
Open Source Summit. It was our second Asia conference and it was great
to see new users join.

* MesosCon North America will be in Los Angeles in September. The
submitted talks went out for community voting ~two weeks ago and we'll
be finializing the schedule soon.

* Lot's of ongoing work, standouts include faster master failover for
large clusters. Better
multitenancy w.r.t. to resource allocation, containerization
improvements (OCI support), driving / supporting CSI for storage
plugins, supporting first class fault domains (to standardize fault
domain handling in the mesos ecosystem, and to support having agents
in different domains).

* The few working groups we have are also going well, in particular
the containerization working group and community working group that
just got started.

* The project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features,
reviews and releases. The mailing lists, slack and IRC channels are
also very much active with healthy discussions.


New committers:

Gilbert Song was voted in as a committer and PMC member on 2017-05-02.
Greg Mann became a committer and PMC member on 2017-06-29.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache NiFi Project  [Joe Witt]

## Description: 
 - Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to
   process and distribute data.
 - Apache NiFi MiNiFi is an edge data collection agent built to seamlessly
   integrate with and leverage the command and control of NiFi. There are
   both Java and C++ implementations.
 - Apache NiFi Registry is a centralized registry for key configuration items 
   including flow versions, assets, and extensions for Apache NiFi 
   and Apache MiNiFi.
 - Apache NiFi Nar Maven Plugin is a release artifact used for supporting
   the NiFi classloader isolation model.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - Based on board feedback in last report the descriptions above have been
   simplified to avoid confusing child/subproject terminology.  We have
   successfully conducted and completed name searches for the MiNiFi and 
   Registry efforts.
 - Conducted numerous releases as listed below.  The 0.7.x releases focused
   on providing simple bug fixes and resolving reported CVEs.  The 1.x 
   releases brought about stability, performance improvements, and addressed
   reported CVEs.  Further, in the 1.x releases numerous substantive features
   were introduced including the ability to run multiple versions of the same
   components and support for both format and schema aware record processors
   to easily handle cases like acquisition, SQL based routing, enrichment, 
   conversion, and delivery of record oriented data.  These make many common
   record oriented use cases far more performant, intuitive, and retain the
   full power of NiFi's provenance features.
   
## Health report: 
 - Health of the community is strong and indicators of strength continue 
   trending in the right direction. Mailing list and JIRA activity is strong.
   ASF Hipchat is serving as an on-ramp for new users to our mailing list and
   JIRA systems. We continue to see new users and contributors. The PMC and
   committer ranks grew again during this reporting cycle and the pipeline
   is encouraging. We're generating many releases with new release managers 
   stepping up often. The team handles security reports swiftly and follows 
   ASF security team published processes effectively.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Sathwik Bantwal Premakumar]

## Description: Apache ODE is a WS-BPEL implementation that supports web
services orchestration using flexible process definitions.

## Issues: There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 ODE team has announced the release of ODE 1.3.7 on Fri Jul 07 2017.

 Highlights of this release:
     - Moved to minimum binary compatibility to JDK 6 from JDK 5.
     - ODE server with embedded Apache TomEE.
     - New ODE Management Console based on AngularJS.
     - Upgrade of Axis2, OpenJPA, & Hibernate.
     - Moved to SLF4J logging with Log4j2 as the implementation.
     - Some major memory leaks have been fixed.
     - Auto generation of Database scripts.
     - Development and Support for JBI based ODE distribution has officially
       ended.

 Future efforts will be directed towards upgrading to JPA2 and JDK 8
   complaint.

## Health report:
- ODE is very mature and stable, however the interest in BPEL has decreased

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorize access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

Release Apache Oltu Auth2 JWT 1.0.3 on 13/02/2017


CURRENT ACTIVITY

The activity of the project is really really low. One of the reason is also
due the fact OAuth is a protocol that is pretty stable. The other reason is
that the team members that are active are busy/demotivated.

Said that lately we had an issue with the Jenkins build that have been sorted
out after few days. We release last module in February 2017.

In the last report in February some problem has been highlighted:

The last few months it has been awfully quiet (this might also be due the fact
the OAuth spec is stable). But not only, since we have some patches laying
around for a while

The release has not been finished. It seems some of the artifacts are not
synched correctly in https://www.apache.org/dist/oltu

The builds keep failing

As far as I know 2. and 3. are resolved now. But 1. still persists.

I proposed to bring new blood in the PMC by rotating the Chair position but no
one seemed to be interested.

 
COMMUNITY

Last new addition tot the team are 2 PMC members: Stein Welberg and Jasha
Joachimsthal in June 2016  (13/06/2016)


ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description: 
 Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for databases,
 relational as well as non-relational. For relational databases, OpenJPA is
 compliant to the Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0.
 OpenJPA runs in stand-alone Java SE as well as  containers e.g Java EE,
 Tomcat, Spring or OSGi.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
    
## Activity: 
 Still low activity for now as most committers are busy with other 
 ASF project. I hope we gain a bit speed as the other parts are now
 mostly finished.  
   
## Health report: 
 Maintenance going on. Since JavaEE 8 did some minor changes to JPA
 in JPA-2.2 we might even skip 2.1 and directly move to 2.2 in trunk.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Marcus Lange]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source office-document productivity suite. There
are six productivity applications based around the OpenDocument Format (ODF)
that are Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, Base. With limited support for
other file formats, OpenOffice ships for Windows, macOS, Linux 64-bit, Linux
32-bit and in more than 40 languages.

## STATUS

The activity within the project is still low but nevertheless stable. Mailing
lists are still active and different things are discussed. Limitations of
capacity of development is an ongoing concern.

## ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS

There are no current topics to be concerned with.

## RELEASES

The current release is Apache OpenOffice 4.1.3 and was published on
2016-Oct-12.

Apache OpenOffice 4.1.4 is planned for the summer months. Since a longer time
we were able to produce pre-release builds for all platforms and languages.
These are now in testing within the community and marks a big step toward the
new release. There is some need for information about the direction which
bugfixes we still need to integrate. This will be discussed together. However,
the final decision is up to the Release Manager.

Apache OpenOffice 4.2.0 is also planned for this year - but without to name a
specific time frame - to include new features and bigger enhancements but of
course more bugfixes.

## ACTIVITY

Development and Release Engineering
-----------------------------------
The release manager for the upcoming release 4.1.4 was changed, bugfixing
has started, dev builds and testing have been done so far. Upgrade of
further language webpages to a new look & feel incl. a standardized download
area and other things is also still active since weeks. Besides this,
bugfixing of issues is also a part but not that many at the moment.

Downloads
---------
As of 2017-Jul-12 we have more than 220,000,000 downloads and it is at a
consistent rate with ~80,000 downloads in average per day. Windows is still
by far the most famous platform that is downloaded. Then macOS and Linux
are following.

Downloads regarding the country over the last 3 months are spread like the
following (source:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openofficeorg.mirror/files/stats/map?dates=20
17-04-01+to+2017-06-30):

14.2 % United States
13.6 % France
10.0 % Germany
 8.1 % Italy
 4.9 % Russia
 4.5 % Spain
 4.4 % Poland
 3.8 % United Kingdom
 3.7 % Japan
 2.0 % Canada
30.3 % all other countries

Websites
--------
There is a lot of action to improve the translation and structure of webpages
that weren't updated for a longer time. The improvement of social media
representation (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, YouTube) is nearly finished and
therefore up-to-date again.

Apache OpenOffice is represented on a few fairs and events. This is managed
regularly by a small and fine team.

Issue Tracking (Bugzilla)
-------------------------
The rate of new Bugzilla issues is decreasing and on a stable level. The rate
at which issues remain unresolved over all that time is more than 40%. But
volunteers can handle and help with the new issue reports that come in.

Development Capacity
--------------------
The arrival of new developers is very low. But the current committers are
willing to help were possible. Improving the mentoring of newcomers and
expanding the capacity to address major issues is a key factor for the next
time.

Branding
--------
In average there is nearly 1 request per month for use of the marks. The same
for reports about suspected trademark misuse (or confusion about selling of
Apache OpenOffice binaries, e.g., on eBay).

## ISSUES

No topics


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BE: Report from the Apache ORC Project  [Owen O'Malley]

## Description:
 - A high-performance columnar file format for Hadoop workloads.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring the board's attention.

## Activity:
 - A presentation on "ORC File - Optimizing Your Big Data" was given
   at the Dataworks Summit in San Jose.
 - Alibaba is contributing a C++ ORC file writer, which is a very
   welcome contribution.

## Health report:
 - Unfortunately, the C++ code reviews have been going slower than we
   would like.  The combination of summer vacations, the small pool of
   ORC committers that feel comfortable reviewing the C++ code, and
   the influx of C++ from Alibaba have lead to longer review
   cycles. Clearly we need more committers on the C++ side of the
   house.

## Description:
- the Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with PDF
documents.

## Issues:

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

The project made no significant progress since the last report. The
mailing list was quiet and no discussions happened since May.

Since the last commit was pushed in March there is no work happening
towards a 1.0.1 release at the moment.

The slow progress may not be a problem but the lack of activity is
something that concerns. People responded that they are using
Stanbol but show not much interest so far in contributing. Maybe
Stanbol is in its current state just right for their needs.

Subscribers on the dev list: 231

Last new committer was
  Cristian Petroaca on May 7th, 2015

Last new PMC member were
  Cristian Petroaca on July 28th, 2016
  Rafa Haro on July 28th, 2016
  
Last stack release was:
  Apache Stanbol 1.0.0 on Oct 23rd, 2016

Last component release was:
  Apache Stanbol Partial Security Release RC2 on June 5th, 2014

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description: 
- Apache STeVe is Apache's Python based voting system that the Foundation uses
  to handle things like voting in our new Board of Directors.
  
## Issues: 
- There are no issues that require board attention.
  
## Activity: 
- No noticeable activity in the past quarter, as expected by the fact that the
  project mostly revolves around the annual meeting.
- Several apache communities have been using STeVe in the past quarter
  to conduct official votes on issues, though not much feedback has
  made it back to the STeVe community.
  
## Health report: 
- The automated score of -2 somewhat accurately reflects the project. While
  we do have PMC oversight, there has been no considerable efforts
  to further develop the system. We may have to start discussing
  how to better reach out to new developers/contributors and get
  folks interested in working on STeVe.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant and
modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON. 

The Struts team made one GA releases in the last quarter.
* Struts 2.5.12 - full GA release including bug fixes, feature enhancements
  and security fixes (2017-7-13) [1][2]
* Struts 2.3.33 - bug and security fix release (2017-7-13) [2][3]

Furthermore we released an additional security announcement that did not
imply a new Struts framework releases [4]

After a quarter that was dominated by dealing with a critical high impact
security issue as reported last time, this quarter allowed us to focus again
on improving and bug fixing the framework. Work is focused on the 2.5
development line, with the 2.3 line still receiving security maintenance. The
2.5.12 release includes major new features and improvements.

In the last reporting period we were notified by the ASF Trademarks Team
about the struts1forever project, which is a community fork to maintain the
EOLed Struts 1 framework. While we don’t think there are trademark issues
involved, we tried to approach the maintainer both to discuss some possible
clarification in the project homepage readme, as well as a Struts 1 security
issue reported to us. So far were not able to get in contact with the
maintainer, we’ll be chasing this further.

We continue to see new contributors popping up. We monitor them closely to
identify possible new committers.

No committer or PMC member was added in the last quarter.
The last committer addition was on 2017-1-30 (Stefaan Dutry).
The last PMC addition was on 2016-08-13 (Aleksandr Mashchenko).

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Thrift Project  [Jake Farrell]

Apache Thrift is a framework for providing cross-platform RPC and serialization.

Project Status
---------
The Apache Thrift community continues to see consistent growth with submissions
from new contributors for bug fixes and client library improvements. There have
been a number of stability and performance enhancements to our Go, Node and
Python client libraries and we have just cut the 0.11.0 branch [1] and are
beginning testing in preparation for our 0.11.0 release candidate. 

A code audit is also starting to take place to ensure that Apache Thrift is 
compliant with the recent category-x licensing changes [2] that occurred due to
the Facebook BSD+patents license changes.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache TinkerPop Project  [Stephen Mallette]

## Description:
Apache TinkerPop is a graph computing framework for both graph databases
(OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).

## Activity:
In the last report, we alluded to a committer to whom we extended an 
invitation to for membership within the PMC, and that invitation was accepted
by Robert Dale. In addition, two new committers have been added in Florian
Hockmann and Jorge Bay Gondra. Both have been contributing in recent months
to expanding the TinkerPop ecosystem into the Microsoft .NET and Javascript 
worlds.

TinkerPop released versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.5 (in the last report it was 
mistakenly written that 3.2.5 was released - that should have read 3.2.4). 
New development has started on the follow-on releases to those versions and 
work for the new major line of 3.3.0 continues with an expected release
by end of summer.

Microsoft announced the release of Azure CosmosDB[1], which is a globally
distributed, multi-model database service. They chose to expose Apache 
TinkerPop as their Graph API. There were some initial branding issues where
Apache was not properly acknowledged, but the issues were quickly rectified 
once the PMC contacted the project developers at Microsoft.

There were also a number of talks given related to TinkerPop and the
Gremlin language. Here are a few samples from PMC members:

- "Open problems in the Universal Graph Theory" Keynote at Graph Day 
    by Dr. Marko Rodriguez[2][3]
- "Start Flying with Python and Apahce TinkerPop" at Graph Day 
    by Jason Plurad[4]
- "JanusGraph: Today and Looking to the Future" at Graph Day
    by Ted Wilmes[5]

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Releases:
- 3.1.7 (June 12, 2017)
- 3.2.5 (June 12, 2017)

## PMC/Committer:

- Last PMC addition was Robert Dale - April 2017
- Last committer addition was Florian Hockmann/Jorge Bay Gondra - July 2017

Attachment BW: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

## Description:

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

## Issues:

As reported to the board there was a disagreement between two committers on an
update to the documentation section of the TomEE website late on June 27.  The
issue involved a commit which was applied by one person then reverted by the
other within minutes.  This happened a total of 3 times in quick succession
over the course of 50 minutes.  During this time little discussion reached the
mailing list.  Afterwards a "Suffocating development environment" thread [1]
was started on the dev@ mailing list which gave the opinion this was not a
one-time incident, but indicative of the tone of the project as of late.

The discussion of the issue has been very healthy, taking place both on the
public dev list and private list.  No parties continued any negative behavior
and discussion did not take the form of stubborn and unyielding debate you
often see in situations like this.  While the issues raised in the original
"Suffocating development environment" email are not completely resolved, it is
clear everyone truly wants what is best for the community and open to changes.

This has revived the thread I reported on in January on potentially adopting
review-then-commit (RTC) for a trial period. Discussions continue with regard
to RTC, as yet no vote has taken place or a decision been made.

One challenge the project currently has is contributions coming in via GitHub
pull requests, with the potential for the discussion to happen on the PR as
opposed to on the mailing list. Between Github PR comments and JIRA Issue
comments, there are ample options for draining the dev list of activity.  How
the dev list should be used with these systems and how they fit overall is
being discussed as part of RTC, but no changes have been voted on or made.

Though not vote has taken place, some contributors have started using the
discussed RTC format to submit their PRs to the dev list for review.  Dev list
discussion overall has shown an increase in the last two weeks.

We will continue to report on the matter and will be carefully tracking any
reverts or other stats we can use to gauge the general tone of the project.

## Activity:

The majority of work on the project is maintenance and bug fixes, although
this is likely to change with Java EE 8 being finalized later in the year. In
addition we have seen a number of fixes being backported to the 1.7.x branch,
supporting Java EE 6.

## Health report:

We have continued to see contributions from Svetlin Zarev, and also
contributions from new contributors Ivan Junckes Filho and Otavio Santana. In
particular we're seeing interest in improving our documentation, which is most
welcome. We are actively trying to be more welcoming and nurturing to these
contributors with a view of growing our community.

## Mailing list activity:

There has been a surge in activity on dev@ as a result which is very
encouraging. (July mailing list stats on dev@ are significantly up on the
previous 3 months). In particular we are seeing more discussion around new
functionality and bug fixes on the list as well as more review. This is likely
due to more activity since the "Suffocating development environment" thread
[1].

Attachment BX: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Bryan Call]

## Description:
Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
and Varnish in functionality and features. What makes ATS unique across the
landscape of HTTP proxy caches is a focus on extensibility (plugins), HTTP
protocol conformity and performance. ATS is driving some of the largest CDNs
in the world, delivering a significant portion of all Internet traffic.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - We had our first ATS Reliability summit in St. Croix.  We focused on
   closing out Coverity issues and went from 367 issues down to 122 issues.

 - We had the ATS Summit combined with the Traffic Control Summit, 2 days
   before ApacheCon (5/14 and 5/15), at the InterContiental in Miami.  There
   were 50 people that attended both summits.

## Health report:
 - We are continuing to stabilize the 7.1.0 release and a couple of large
   companies are running it in production on a limited number of servers.
   It is taking longer than expected to make the 7.1.0 release and it will
   be coming out soon.

Attachment BY: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description: 
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - Development of VCL 2.5 is pretty much complete. A discussion thread has
   been started. We anticipate and hope to begin the vote on a release
   candidate this week.
 - Apache VCL has been using some cryptographic functionality for quite some
   time but we recently became aware of the ASF's crypto guidelines and
   requirements [1]. This is being discussed on our dev list. We are working
   through the legal terminology and will consult with the legal-discuss
   list if necessary. Regardless, it would be helpful to our project and I'm
   sure others if the ASF crypto page [1] was updated. It includes some
   outdated links and information that is no longer correct since the BIS
   has updated the regulations multiple times since the page was written. I
   tried to explain some of what I found in the thread [3]. We'll pass any
   information which may be helpful to the pertinent list or Jira issue.
   
## Health report: 
 - The health is stable. I'd like to see development interest from
   additional people and more participation from some current committers /
   PMC members. We've discussed ideas on our dev list and I've included
   thoughts in previous board reports. Perhaps after our release is finished
   we can make more of an effort towards community development.

   late. This is always encouraging.

Attachment CA: Report from the Apache Web Services Project  [Sagara Gunathunga]

Apache Web Services is a collection of shared technologies related to
SOAP/XML based Web Services that can be shared by different implementations.
Spring-WS, Axis2, CXF, and others use parts of the technology created within
Apache Web Services.

Community:
WebServices is a mature project based on standards that are also quite
mature.   As such, there is not a significant amount of activity required.
However, user questions are being answered promptly, bugs are being fixed,
and there are at least 3 independent PMC members around making sure
the project can continue to produce releases as needed.   Since
SOAP/XML based Web Services is no longer considered state of the art,
we don’t expect a major uptick in new development efforts, new
committers, etc...

Last committer addition: Sun Sep 14 2014 (Alessio Soldano)

Last PMC addition: Tue May 17 2016 (Alessio Soldano)

Notes : 
- Releases happen frequently, specially  during this quarter there were
releases on Neethi and XmlSchema after sometime.   

- WS projects are very stable and mature hence can't expect any drastic
development around these project.

Attachment CB: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Sean Busbey]

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and
release processes for software projects.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD'S ATTENTION

We missed our report last month due to the PMC Chair failing to find time.
As mentioned in previous reports, the current chair is looking to have the
position rotated. Another member of the PMC has expressed interest and the
PMC will be working on the issue this quarter.


RELEASES

The community released version 0.5.0 on July 12, 2017. 

ACTIVITY

No new PMC additions in this period; our last PMC addition was Ajay
Yadava on Dec 1st, 2016.

No new committer additions in this period; our last committer
additions were Andrew Wang and Ajay Yadava on Sep 20th, 2016.

The community recently finished up the  0.5.0 release, which has some
usability improvements and a utility for CI systems that run docker
(e.g. ASF Jenkins). The burst of activity around this release drove a
higher amount of JIRA activity compared to previous period (in both
creation and resolution).

There are also some features under development from new contributors. The
PMC still needs to be more proactive on recognizing these new contributors
with more project responsibilities.

STATS

- Currently 8 PMC members
- Currently 10 committers
- dev list has 42 subscribers (flat from previous period)
- 31 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
- 29 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months
