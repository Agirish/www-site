 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Phil]

       I had calls with Sam and Greg this past month, discussing a range of
       topics relating to the two things that I am working on at the
       foundation level now: 1) the 5-year strategic plan and 2) ASF document
       retention and access policy. I received some great feedback on the
       members list on the strategic plan components and I have started work
       on a plan draft, which I will make available in the ASF GoogleDocs
       space.  I would like to reserve time at next month’s board meeting to
       discuss the plan.

       There has been some discussion recently on how to streamline
       communications between the Board and PMCs, or more specifically how to
       make the PMC Chair’s job more manageable by reducing the number of
       email messages that Chairs need to read.  One item that was suggested
       for suppression is Board comments on project reports.  Thinking about
       that, and discussing with Sam, I have decided to start including a
       summary of recent Board feedback in this report.  Feedback on my
       feedback summary is of course welcome.  If this turns out to be
       effective, I will propose that we suppress copying board@apache.org on
       report comments.

       There were quite a few positive comments over the last month thanking
       PMCs for producing informative and thoughtful reports.  In general,
       the positive comments were in response to reports that gave a clear
       picture of the state of a project, interpreting data rather than just
       presenting it.  An excellent example is this month’s HTTP Server
       report.  Critical comments centered on a few recurring themes:

       1. Reminders to always include the dates when the last committer and
       PMC member were added to the project.

       2. Reminders that mailing list and / or JIRA statistics presented by
       themselves (i.e. not in support of a statement related to project
       health or issues faced by the project) can be omitted.

       3. Requests to affirm that there is sufficient PMC oversight for the
       project.

       4. Reminders that no response has been received to a comment that
       requires a response (comments that require response are flagged in
       Whimsy.  I am happy to personally respond to questions regarding
       whether or not a specific comment requires a response of if a proposed
       response is adequate).

       Constructive feedback also followed some common themes:

       1. Projects considering formal criteria for committership are
       encouraged to be careful setting the bar too high or making the
       criteria too complex.

       2. Projects organizing meetings, meet-ups or other in-person events
       need to make sure that either the events do not have any specific
       bearing on the project or a) they are open to all interested parties
       and b) discussions and any proposed decisions are brought back to the
       project dev list.

       3. Private mailing lists should be used sparingly, only for issues
       that can’t be discussed on the public dev list.

       4. Votes for PMC Chair rotations and / or committer / PMC nominations
       should always be closed and actioned.

    B. President [Sam]

       Items requiring board attention:

       * Fundraising VP resolution.  I believe that the bylaws question has
         been resolved.  I believe that need for a VP title has been
         established.  I see that there has been some calls for additional
         process; I don't see the need for such, but if the board chooses
         to table this resolution again, I ask that clear guidance be
         provided.

       * Conferences discussion item.  I suggest that this not merely be
         discussed as if it were a one time expense, but as input to
         the five year plan.

       * In order to reach they goal of having a top-down five year plan by
         year end, there really should have been some draft numbers produced
         by now.  Certainly no later than by the end of this month so that they
         can be approved in the next board meeting.

       Overall, expenses remain under control.  Working with Virtual, 
       it was determined that Infrastructure incorrectly forecasted FY18
       costs.  This should be covered this year, but may result in the
       need to revise upwards future budgets.

       Income appears to be on track, with the normal comment about sponsor
       timing considerations make this difficult to be sure.

       Ross and I talked about what can be done to ensure that the EA is
       fully utilized, and we are exploring a number of options.

       Brand Management continues to work to produce a proposal for board
       consideration.  Ideally, this would also be included in the five
       year plan discussion.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 7.


    C. Treasurer [Ulrich]

       Virtual Report:

       Here is a summary of the Foundation’s performance for the first Six
       months of FY18.

       Cash on Oct 31st, 2017 was $1,710K, which is down $24.3K from last
       month’s ending balance (Sept 17) of $1,734.3K, due to the timing of
       some Sponsor payments and Payables released.   The Oct 2017 cash
       balance is down $86.8K from the Oct 2016 month end balance of
       $1,796.8K.  The Oct 2017 ending cash balance of $1,710K represents a
       cash reserve of 14.9 months based on the FY18 Cash forecast average
       monthly spending of $114.6K/month. The ASF reserve continues to be
       very healthy for an organization of ASF’s size, with an FY18 YE
       estimate of 12.4 month’s cash reserve.

       Regarding the YTD Cash P&L, we continue to have a very strong showing
       against our FY18budget at the halfway point of the year, however as I
       noted last month the timing of Sponsor payments and Payables releases
       plays a big part in how well we perform financially each month.  This
       month while we are under the FY 18 plan for Revenue, we are also under
       plan for Expenses, by more, and that gets us to a better actual Net
       Income as compared to our FY18 Budget.    Therefore, we need to
       continue to focus on our new sponsors but we also cannot afford to
       take any focus away from our existing sponsors as that was how the
       FY18 budget was constructed.  The Fundraising team continues to do an
       excellent job in both areas, servicing both new and existing Sponsors.
       With total actual Revenue, as of Oct 31st, 2017, of $826.1K, we are
       67.4% of the way to our total Revenue budget for FY18 of $1,226.5K. 
       Regarding Sponsor revenue, specifically, we have received so far in
       the first six months of FY18, $744.6K, which has us 68.7% to our
       budgeted Sponsor revenue goal of $1,084K for FY18, which is fantastic,
       at the halfway point of the current Fiscal Year.   We remain
       conservative in our forecasting, showing modest annual increases in
       annual Sponsorship and Donations, due to actual collected amounts such
       as those coming from Hopsie (which was not budgeted for FY 18).

       YTD expenses, through Oct 31st, 2017 are under budget by $68.4K.  All
       depts. are either under budget or at budget, (Infra, YTD, is slightly
       over budget by $0.2K or flat to FY18 budget YTD which is another $10K
       improvement vs Budget, from last month). I also completed a review of
       the Forecast for expenses, in Oct and have either spoken to or had
       email correspondence with the Dept. heads after last month’s close and
       have incorporated those discussions in the current forecast for the
       last six months of FY18. We will continue to monitor the actual vs
       budget as we move through the remaining six months of FY18 and we will
       stay in contact with the dept. heads as we close each month going
       forward so that we have a clearer picture for the remainder of the
       Fiscal year.

       Regarding Net Income (NI), YTD for FY18 the ASF finished with a
       positive $194.7K NI vs a budgeted negative <$156.3K> NI or $351K ahead
       of FY 18 Budget at the half year for Net Income.  With the current
       conservative forecasted revenue, and expenses for the remainder of FY
       18, we are estimating a $-97K negative NI for FY18 vs a budgeted NI
       loss of -$167.8K or about $70.8K better NI than the FY18 budget.  I
       would also like to point out that YTD 18 vs YTD 17 we are $336.4K
       ahead in Revenue while Expenses were only $140.8K ahead year over
       year, for a $195.6K increase in Net Income year over year ($194.7K
       positive NI in FY18 vs <-$.84K> NI in FY 17.) Again, I want to
       congratulate the entire Organization on these very positive numbers as
       we have arrived at the halfway point of FY 18, though we do need to
       continue to keep these efforts up as we move through the back half of
       FY 18 and continue to give Fundraising all the support we can as we
       move forward, while keeping an eye on our expenses at the same time.

       We have been in contact with the CPA and we will be getting the Cash
       Basis Audit underway shortly, and we will keep everyone updated as to
       its progress once it starts.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Work is continuing on a streamlined approach to inviting new
       contributors, committers, and project management committee members to
       submit ICLAs. For a demo, please visit whimsy.apache.org/project/icla

       The day-to-day workload on secretary remains well within bounds.

       In October, 86 iclas, three cclas, and one grant were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Ross]

       Infrastructure
       ==============

       The team have investigated an oddity in our staffing expenditures as
       identified last month. It seems that Infra incorrectly foretasted FY18
       costs from the FY17 actuals. This means there is no budget for the
       open headcount. However, other areas of the infra budget are in a good
       state and with ongoing and predicted savings in other areas it is
       expected that the team will come within its total budget.

       In other news there was an outage on mail-archives.a.o that took a
       while to correct. It highlighted our ongoing issues with services on
       old hardware, old operating systems, and non-puppetized services. This
       has been mitigated and work to improve aging services continues,

       Marketing and Publicity
       =======================

       Sponsor Ambassador program work continues, along with general
       awareness raising around what the foundation does (e.g. published
       "Success at Apache: Scratch Your Own Itch" https://s.apache.org/7Amk ,
        which was also published as a cover feature in JAX Magazine's special
        issue on Open Source).

       The recent turmoil around high profile security breaches has died down
       and PR and Marketing activity is mostly back to normal.

       Conferences
       ===========

       VP Conferences continues to explore options for ApacheCon events after
       having confirmed with the broader community that such a thing is still
       needed. Input welcome on planners@apachecon.com mailing list, which is
       open to members.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

* Coordinated with SES (ATO’s exhibition service) re all logistics for the
  show, including negotiating a deep discount to compensate for our box of
  swag they misplaced (it was leftover inventory).
* Special thanks to Sam, Sam’s wife, and everyone who helped setup/breakdown and staff
  the booth!


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

* ISSUES FOR THE BOARD (continuing issue)

The core issue is that we are greatly under-serving our projects in terms of
brand services.  The lack of questions vs. number of popular projects we host
shows many PMCs aren't properly policing their marks.

Brand strategy - at a very high level, there are two long-term blockers with
providing brand services to our projects currently:

- Lack of reliable volunteers.  We have only two volunteers in recent years
who have shown a sustained interest and knowledge of our policies.  Thus, 
nearly all the work is done by a single person.

- Specialized knowledge.  Being able to *accurately* answer most trademarks@
questions doesn't require law experience, but it does require both a 
thorough reading our our existing policies, as well as a keen attention to 
detail and consistent way of looking at each situation for the visible 
facts.  This requires a notable amount of time to correctly answer questions 
for anyone who might volunteer.

(To be continued next month, reviewing skills/work needed)


* OPERATIONS

A normal month, with more questions about use of Apache brands on merchandise.
We are getting (a very small) amount of royalties on licensing Apache marks to
Litographs, which is heartening to see.  It's likely there are other vendors
interested in similar arrangements.

A large thread discussed appropriate boundaries for use of commercially
licensed software in building and displaying the website for a newly created
TLP.  The specific questions were handled with Legal, but the larger question
of prominent use of commercial software displayed on Apache project websites
bears watching.

Website Analytics shows a steady decline in overall hits - not sure what
that's from, although since we don't have any campaign for awareness, it's
hard to tell.  Assistance planning outreach would be useful.  The majority of
hits are still direct to the primary policy page.


* REGISTRATIONS & CONTRACTS

HAWQ has finished transferring ownership to the ASF.  The US registration of
PREDICTIONIO has transferred, however a number of international applications
are outstanding and will be evaluated for cost effectiveness.

Our BROOKLYN registration in the EU was finally issued.

Counsel continues to craft a contentious consent contract.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Kevin A. McGrail]

* Resolution to establish VP, Sponsor Relations

* We continue to discuss new sponsorships and renewing existing.  Nothing
unusual to report but multi-year commits are helping both with less stressful
large sponsors relations and putting Infra concerns to rest.  The no-follow
policy also appears to be getting rid of the SEO-focused tiny sponsors.

* Raising Hopsie minimum donation to $10 due to high overhead with Stripe is
pending Sally’s input.

* Meetings semi-monthly with Virtual continue between KAM and Lynsey.  Sally
will also be joining them as well.

* Directed sponsorship process continues to go well.  Met with Infra and started
the audit of all inkind sponsors and their levels.

* Started creating the new Directed Sponsor levels at
http://www.staging.apache.org/foundation/thanks2.html

* Sponsor Agreement is now written and was Used to sign Union Investment as a
Silver Sponsor!
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pdksp-XuI1nbZfjW4n218WUJCe3Zpd8Ele4m1euXcok/edit

* I am using this agreement with all new sponsors as they onboard.  Should we
send a copy to existing sponsors with no requirement to sign but so they know
the details.  And then require signing on renewal?

* Future or Items with no Progress to Report: Attending FOSDEM on ASF Behalf
Likely to attend Berlin Buzzwords & FOSS Backstage on ASF Behalf Sponsor thank

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we are on budget and on schedule. One new vendor payment
request has been submitted for processing.

II. Cross-committee Liaison: work on the Sponsor Ambassador program is
ongoing with ASF Fundraising. Sally Khudairi has secured a handful of
Sponsor commitments for renewals for the upcoming year, and is
planning a new individual giving campaign for the holidays. We
published "Success at Apache: Scratch Your Own Itch"
https://s.apache.org/7Amk , which was also published as a cover
feature in JAX Magazine's special issue on Open Source.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

 - 1 November 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Kafka®
   v1.0.0
 - 31 October 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache® Juneau™
   as a Top-Level Project
 - 24 October 2017 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache®
   PredictionIO™ as a Top-Level Project
- 19 October 2-17 - The Apache Software Foundation Announces Five
Years of Apache® OpenOffice™ as a Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: 10 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog. 1 "Success at Apache" blog post was published, as
mentioned above. 4 Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of
173 weekly summaries published to date. We tweeted 25 items, and have
44.3K followers on Twitter. We posted 9 items on LinkedIn, which
garnered more than 226.8K organic impressions in total.

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are in development.
Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as
PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are requested to contact Sally at <press@apache.org>
with at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 8 media queries, and are working
on 2 long-lead media opportunities. The ASF received 2,090 press clips
vs. last month's clip count of 4,639. Media coverage of Apache
projects yielded 5,579 press hits vs. last month's 14,364.

VII. Analyst Relations: we received two analyst queries during this
timeframe, including a preview of a Cloud influencer report. Apache
was mentioned in 10 reports by Gartner, 7 reports by Forrester, 4
reports by 451 Research, and 7 reports by IDC.

VIII. Graphics: we completed graphics production for several
promotional items to be used at various conferences. Sharan Foga and
Melissa Warnkin have been very helpful in shepherding these projects.

IX. Events liaison: in addition to liaising with ComDev with external
community-focused opportunities, we are supporting the ASF’s presence
at China Open Source Conference COSCon '17 in Shanghai.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 1 pre-paid press release remaining with
NASDAQ GlobeNewswire through December 2017, and will be applying our
2018-2019 contract early to accommodate any announcements issued
before the end of 2017.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

General
=======
Infra continues to operate as expected, and there are no issues for
the President or the Board at this time.

Much work has been done around finances this past month, but we remain
on track to meet our overall budget.


Finances
========
With the help of Tom from Virtual, we investigated an oddity in our
staffing expenditures. Given that we currently have an open headcount,
our year-to-date costs should be low, but they were running at our
budget levels instead. The answer is that Infra incorrectly forecasted
FY18 costs from the FY17 actuals. We left the headcount open for a
while, and along with savings in other cost centers, when we fill the
headcount for the remainder of FY18, the total Infra costs should fall
within its total budget.

One of our secondary (large) budget items has been variable, due to
currency fluctations. The structure of the payments and related
sponsorship is due to change soon, and should create a more stable
cash flow. The Treasurer and Fundraising teams are working on this.


Short Term Priorities
=====================
- Working out plans to move some services into Azure, under their
  programs to assist F/OSS organizations.
- Digging into our VM usage across our various datacenters to find the
  top-line costs, for future tradeoffs and cost-savings.


Long Range Priorities
=====================
- Continue VM migration and puppetization. Our major concerns here
  revolve around mail handling.


General Activity
================
We have consolidated our domain management under Namecheap to reduce
expenses, make use of their API, and get better support. We plan to
expand/shift our DNS management to Namecheap as well, away from our
custom solutions.


Uptime Statistics
=================
We had an outage on mail-archives.a.o that took us a while to correct.
It hightlighted our ongoing issues with services on old hardware, old
operating systems, and non-puppetized services. We corrected the
issue, but have started on additional disaster-relief measures. Given
the age of these services, monitoring is difficult.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the VP of Conferences  [Rich Bowen]

Since our last report, I've been considering options for a way forward
with ApacheCon, in the hopes that we can still do a North America
event in Spring 2018, and a Europe event in the latter half of the
year.

In the time since ApacheCon Miami, I have received numerous queries
about when we'll be holding the next event, and lamentations that we
didn't have an EU event this year. It is clear that our community
wants this event.

To this end, we'll be working towards that goal, and discussion will
begin immediately on the planners@apachecon.com mailing list, wihch is
open to members.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Melissa Warnkin]

No issues to report


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Chris Mattmann]

The month began with discussion surrounding fair use of files used
in our projects, e.g., open image files, or scans of text from the
web. Though no broad policy updates emerged, the parties in discussion
received the feedback needed from the Legal committee to move on
with their efforts as described in LEGAL-331 [1] and LEGAL-332 [2].

A new top level project (TLP) wanted Legal's opinion in the
construction of its new website as to whether or not design files
licensed commercially (and not under the ALv2) would affect their
use on the website. Legal provided guidance that this was acceptable
in this specific case, but further requests similar to this would
need to be evaluated on their own merits. More information on the
discussion can be found in [3] and in LEGAL-341 [4].

An ASF and Legal Committee member raised discussion surrounding
replacing our CLA with DCO+ALv2 as described in [5]. Several other
members chimed in and the overall consensus was that our ICLAs are
working out just fine since they are a direct pre-requisite to
having ASF accounts and thus there is a community benefit of having
an ICLA on file should contributors be invited as committers or PMC
members to ASF projects.

The question of what metrics can be recorded in ASF projects w.r.t.
downloads and user information related to them incepted a spirited
discussion. Pointers were made to infra policy and infra members
including the Infra Admin provided guidance in the thread.

This month we had a researcher incorrectly report an issue in
Solr/lucene by sending it not just to security@apache.org but also to
public mailing lists.  CVE-2017-12629.  This information included an
exploit and spread rapidly.  Updates from the project to mitigate this
were produced rapidly and we worked with Press to ensure we had a
media response.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Jan Materne]

## Description: 
Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools.
It consists of 3 main projects:
 - Ant - core and libraries (AntLibs)
 - Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
 - IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
Additionally Ant provides several extensions to Ant (antlibs).

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
Apache Ant is an old - and maybe wise - project. So the grandfather gives a look back
on to its life so other younger projects could benefit from this. Stefan Bodewig 
will be giving such a talk on FOSS Backstage Micro Summit on 20th November in Berlin
(https://berlinbuzzwords.de/17/news/foss-backstage-micro-summit-program-online-now).

Fixed some Ivy issues.
Updated Ivy+IvyDE codebase to newer Java version.

## Health report: 

For Ant we feel healthy enough to apply patches, and get a release done.
But basically we are in "maintenance mode". There isn't much development.

With the two new committers Ivy + IvyDE revived and activity is (relativly) high.

   project, but still actively maintained. We expect to have a new PMC chair
   accepted by the board this month (Robert Lazarski). Most of the emails on
   the Axis2 user mailing list, and Jira issues created in the last 3 months,
   have received timely responses. We continue to receive patches from various
   new users/contributors.

## PMC/Committer changes:
 - Currently 62 PMC/Commiters members.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Nate McCall]

## Description: 
The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability
and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and
proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it
the perfect platform for mission-critical data.Cassandra's support for
replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower
latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive
regional outages.

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
The Next Generation Cassandra Conference
(https://www.eventbrite.com/e/next-generation-cassandra-conference-ngcc-ticket
s-36160855091#) was recently held in San Antonio, TX. This conference was
planned and run solely by the community coordinated on the private,
development and user mail lists (as appropriate) with no vendor influence.
Talks were selected directly by the PMC. A summary of the event posted to the
dev list can be found here:
https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5ab801e508a792d81defe092a77c59df862ce36b1
4c1a41445367190@%3Cdev.cassandra.apache.org%3E

Great care was taken to summarize any major discussions back to their
respective JIRA tickets as well as summarize and continue conversations on the
development mailing list after the event to facilitate larger community
participation. 

A huge thanks to long-time PMC members Gary Dusbabek and Eric Evans for doing
all the leg work in putting this event on. 

## Health report: 
Overall the project is healthy. We continue to leverage the lack of any vendor
influence by focusing the current work on stability and testing.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Cédric Damioli]

## Description:
  Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Issues:
  there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

  The most recent release is 2.1.12 on 2013-03-14
  2 JIRA issues opened and resolved since last report.
  There's only a little activity on both users and dev mailing-lists (a dozen messages during the period).
  The project is mainly in maintenance mode.

  There have been some quite interesting changes since last release, at least for
  2.1 branch, which would deserve a release. We issued the same statement
  last quarter but noone launched the process yet.


## PMC changes:
  None.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Sharan Foga]

## Description:

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects

## Issues:

No issues require board attention at the moment.

## Activity:

Our last board report for August was missing so those items are included as
part of this report.

During the last two quarters our main focus was to promote an Apache presence
at existing conferences with a booth or presentation content.

OpenExpo

We participated for the first time at the OpenExpo Madrid event in June. We
received an invitation to the event because of a contact made at FOSDEM. We
recruited two Spanish speaking booth volunteers (Ignasi Barrera and Jan
Iversen). Ignasi created a small ASF brochure that has been approved by Sally.

The conference attracted over 3000 visitors and approx around 10% stopped to
talk to us at the Apache booth. We found that many people didn't really know
that there was a Foundation behind Apache projects so being there helped fill
this knowledge. As a follow up Ignasi was invited for an interview at a local
Spanish radio station to talk about the ASF.

Following on from this, the organisers are planning the 2018 conference and
would like more English content so have asked the ASF to become more involved
and to organise a track around on open source governance, trends and best
practices.

Solutions Hamburg

In early September we participated in a 3 day Apache track at Solutions
Hamburg. Nine ASF speakers participated include a keynote from Greg Stein.
Attendance was mixed and the talks about microservices were the most attended.
This was the first time at this event and need to review how we could improve
our participation. Thanks to the speakers and especially to Myrle Krantz and
Chris Dutz for their work in organising, facilitating and generally liaising
with the organisers.

Open Source Summit Prague

Although we did not have a booth at this event, there were several Apache
related presentations including a Keynote from Neha Narkhede about Apache
Kafka, Rich Bowen talked about Mentoring,Piergiorgio Lucidi talked about the
incubation process for Apache ManifoldCF and Sharan Foga spoke about the
Committer Diversity Survey at the Diversity Empowerment Summit.

MesosCon Prague

The Apache Mesos community were happy to have an Apache presence with a booth
and also a Keynote from Rich Bowen. Feedback on the keynote was very positive
and we received several enquiries about future ApacheCons.

ComDev Jira

We have started using the ComDEV Jira again to help track tasks. Some cleanup
of old / existing tasks are in progress. Notifications have been moved to the
dev list to allow better communication and this has been successful as seen by
the ASF Brochure translations.

Open Source Summit Paris We have been given a booth and also a half day track
at OSS Paris. The track has been filled with presentation from several
projects. We have also been given a keynote slot which will be presented by
Bertrand Delacretaz.

FOSDEM

A request for an Apache booth has been made and decisions will be announced in
late November. Based on community feedback, we also put together a proposal
for an Apache Community Collaboration devroom but this was unsuccessful.
Another Community devroom was accepted and we are encouraging people to make
submissions to this.


Rotation of PMC Chair

In September we rotated the PMC Chair from Uli Stark to Sharan Foga. Many
thanks to Uli for all his hard work and effort as VP ComDev over the last few
years.

FOSS Backstage

The schedule for FOSS Backstage Micro Summit has been announced and focusses
on community, governance and the legal aspects around open source. Several
speakers from Apache have been selected to present.

GSoC Update

Uli is keeping track and following up on GSoC progress for the various
projects involved.

Marketing

With the help of various volunteers, the ASF Brochure has been translated into
several languages. This will be available for people to use at events.
Discussions around the introduction of Apache Community business cards has
been very positive so we will be looking at promoting it to committers and
projects.

ComDev Mission

A discussion is currently in progress about the mission of Comdev to adjust
the description, scope and focus of activities.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
- Seamless multi-master sync, that scales from Big Data to Mobile,
  with an Intuitive HTTP/JSON API and designed for Reliability.
   
## Issues: 
- there are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
- Released versions 2.1.1 and 1.7.0 in response to a critical
  security vulnerability being reported. Details are embargoed
  for a few more days at the time of writing of this report.
  CVE’s have been filed and should be out by the time of the
  board meeting.
- Released version 1.7.1 because 1.7.0 included an unintentional
  API break.
- Barring any other major security issues, this will have been
  the last release in the 1.x.x line.
- 2.1.1 included a flurry of other improvements and performance
  advancements an follows relatively shortly after 2.1.0 (August),
  showcasing the advance in CI reliability and breadth allowing
  for faster and more confident releases (just wish we had that
  in place for 1.x.x so we could have avoided 1.7.1, alas).
- Late response to a March Board Report question by `mt`
  (again, all formal apologies for the delay). In January 2017,
  CouchDB was in the news about data leaks and ransom scenarios,
  citing CouchDB’s “open by default” setup. In short CouchDB 1.x
  has followed an open-by-default strategy to make it easy for
  new users to get started. The main mitigating factor only
  binding to 127.0.0.1, and requiring an explicit admin step
  to bind to a public IP. 10 years in the strategy worked, but
  it is also time to shed that legacy. CouchDB 2.x default
  setup requires an admin password to be set, even on 127.0.0.1.
  This is a big improvement, but leaves a few more ways until
  we get to a closed-by-default sitaution. We’re expecting a
  full transition to be done by CouchDB 3.0.

   
## Health report: 
- CouchDB is doing fine. Unprecedented activity in Q3 of work
  that ended up in a release already. We aim to keep up a
  quarterly release cadence.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 15 PMC members.
- Nick Vatamaniuc was added to the PMC on Tue Nov 07 2017

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------ 
Since the last report, a new TLP for DRAT was proposed, which raised
some questions about how it relates to Creadur / RAT. There were no specific
concerns raised within the Creadur PMC. An offer was extended to the Creadur
PMC members to join the DRAT PMC, and Brian Fox accepted and is now also part
of DRAT. Otherwise, no changes to the code.

Since this is a low activity project, a vote was called on the content of this
report as a test of our ability to self-govern. As of the time of posting, we
achieved 4 +1s in less than 24 hours.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low despite the ongoing lack of progress.
If someone has an itch to scratch, it will no doubt get fixed.

Community
--------- 
In September 2016 Karl Heinz Marbaise was elected to join the PMC /
Commit.


Releases
-------- 
Apache Rat  0.12 was released in June, 2016 Apache Rat  0.11 was
released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was released in September, 2013.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Josh Wills]

## Description: 
 Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
 and Apache Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.
   
## Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 Aside from a few small bug fixes, the main focus of development/discussion
 in the last quarter was how to execute the series of upgrades on our
 dependencies (mainly Apache Hadoop, HBase, and Hive) that we need to complete
 the 1.0 release. We need to do some heavy lifting and compatibility-breaking
 changes to the HBase module in order to make the move to HBase 2.x, which
 is necessary to make the move to Hive 2.x. The JIRA issue here tracks this:
 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CRUNCH-659
   
## Health report: 
 The fact that we're no longer really working on new features or functionality
 in favor of bug fixes and version upgrades is the most significant issue with
 the health of the project. The good news is that a number of new contributors
 have been driving the version upgrade effort, and several of them clearly
 have the potential to become committers and PMC members once this work is
 done. The biggest need (and where I have fallen short as PMC chair) is
 providing them with guidance, feedback, and support for their efforts so
 that they can complete this work and earn their committerships.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DRAT Project  [Chris Mattmann]

## Description:
 - Apache DRAT is a distributed, parallelized (Map Reduce) wrapper
 around Apache RAT™ and other code auditing tools to allow it to
 complete on large code repositories of multiple file types.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 1. Working on design of DRAT website, can be seen here in drat #98 [1]
 2. Stood up DRAT VM (see INFRA-15304 [2]) and demo service of DRAT proteus,
    here: https://drat.apache.org/demo/ (evaluate one repo at a time), and
    here: https://drat.apache.org/asfgit/ (generated weekly, full DRAT runs
          and statistics for ALL of the ASF git repositories. Thanks to Chris
          Lambertus and infra for helping us get going there.
 3. In standing up DRAT on Ubuntu, we ran into some Apache OODT bugs in the
    recent 1.2 release, and are working with Apache OODT to roll a 1.2.1 that
    fixes these bugs. In addition we were able to harden DRAT a bit more as
    described in DRAT #100 [3] and #101 [4].

## Health report:
 - We've had some engagement from Wayne Burke who started a thread to figure
   out whether or not we wanted to create a #drat channel in ASF slack.
   Mattmann went ahead and created it after the thread on dev@drat.
 - Shivika Thapar and Nipurn Doshi are working on the website design as
   described in DRAT #98 [1].
 - Thejan Wijesinghe from Apache Tika's GSOC 2017 project has began testing
   DRAT and is filing tickets (e.g., DRAT #104 [5].
 - Phil Ottlinger of the Creadur community is checking out DRAT and wants to
   help with the website.
 - The project's activity is ramping up, but still remains a small set of
   folks working on it.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 10 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 10 committers.
 - No changes (the PMC was established in the last 3 months)

## Releases:

 - None yet

## Mailing list activity:

 - More emails being sent to the dev list, including commits, and issue
   activity from Github. A thread was started to discuss website development
   that linked to several Github issues. Now that we have our Proteus demo
   up at https://drat.apache.org/demo/, we expect more folks to check out
   and try DRAT. We also will begin shortly publishing weekly runs of Apache
   DRAT against all ASF Git repos at https://drat.apache.org/asfgit/. Both of
   these will likely generate more mailing list activity.

## Description:
- Drill is a Schema-free SQL Query Engine for Hadoop, NoSQL and Cloud Storage.
 
## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
 
## Activity:
- An all-day Drill 2.0 Hackathon was organized on Sept 18th in San Jose at a
participating company's headquarters. 27 developers registered and
participated in the hackathon. It was a productive day of technical design
discussions on topics related to a major 2.0 release next year.  
- The community is actively working towards an upcoming 1.12 release sometime
in late November.
- There is a noticeable uptick in contributions of storage/format plugins for
Drill; PCAP, OpenTSDB, Kafka plugins are either committed or nearing
completion.
  
## Health report:
- The project is healthy. Development activity based on the pull requests and
JIRAs is quite good and growing, as evidenced by 63 more JIRA tickets resolved
in this reporting period compared to the prior one. Activity on the dev list
showed a 48% jump compared to the previous quarter and activity on the user
list showed a moderate increase.  Two new committers were added in the last
period.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Rainer Döbele]

## Description: 
 - Apache Empire-db is a relational database access engine that takes an 
   SQL-centric approach in contrast to object-relational-mapping like with JPA
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - There has been activity in providing bugfixes, feature improvements 
   and answering user questions.
 - The project is mature and there seems to be currently little demand by the 
   committers or users to undertake major changes. The chair intends new to ask
   committers about where the project should be heading. Unfortunately the 
   chair has been too busy recently to already have started such a discussion.

## Answers to comments made by Board members to our last report
  Mark Thomas: "It has been a while since the last committer was added. Are
               there any prospects on the horizon?"
 - Whenever we are notified of suggestions for improvement other than simple
   bugfixes we guide people to a possible solution and encourage them to 
   provide us with their code that solves their problem and make a 
   contribution. However there has not been enough feedback recently that made
   us believe that there is a willingness by someone to engage in the project 
   and really bring the project forward. This may also be due to the fact that 
   rdbms and sql have been around for so long, that there is little change on 
   the rdbms side and hence there is little demand for big changes or
   improvements in our code base. So to be frank, at the moment there are no 
   good prospects for new comitters. 
   
## Health report: 
 - The project remains healthy although activity has been low this quarter.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Gora Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description: 
The Apache Gora open source framework provides an in-memory data model 
and persistence for big data. Gora supports persisting to 
 * column stores,
 * key value stores,
 * document stores,
 * distributed in-memory key/value stores,
 * in-memory data grids,
 * in-memory caches,
 * distributed multi-model stores, and
 * hybrid in-memory architectures 
Gora also enables analysis of data with extensive Apache Hadoop MapReduce 
and Apache Spark support. Gora uses the Apache Software License v2.0.
   
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
Project activity has been low. Nothing worrying as we shipped 0.8
not too long ago and have received no big fixes in that period. The
PMC discussed evolving the project description. The new descripion 
can be seen above, this reflects several years of GSoC contributions
and a wide variety of community input over the years.
   
## Health report: 
Post GSoC and 0.8 release, things have quietened somewhat. The 
mailing lists however are still active and queries are answered 
in a timely manner.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 25 PMC members. 
 - New PMC members: 
    - Madhawa Kasun Gunasekara was added to the PMC on Fri Sep 22 2017 
    - Nishadi Kirielle was added to the PMC on Sun Sep 10 2017 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 25 committers. 
 - New commmitters: 
    - Madhawa Kasun Gunasekara was added as a committer on Thu Sep 21 2017 
    - Nishadi Kirielle was added as a committer on Mon Sep 11 2017 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - 0.8 was released on Mon Sep 18 2017 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
We recently received a mailing list request for Google BigTable 
integration so it is encouraging that people are using Gora
for new things.
   
 - dev@gora.apache.org:  
    - 73 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 229 emails sent to list (559 in previous quarter) 
   
 - user@gora.apache.org:  
    - 78 subscribers (down -3 in the last 3 months): 
    - 48 emails sent to list (9 in previous quarter)

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Groovy Project  [Guillaume Laforge]

## Description: 

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, first class functional programming support 
and runtime and compile-time meta-programming.
 
## Issues: 

There are no new issues arising requiring board attention at this time. 

Update on a previous issue (website update) is still being tracked by
these 3 tickets:

- GROOVY-8181: Website move - step 1: 
   create new repositories for user and dev sites
- GROOVY-8182: Website move - step 2: 
   populate user and dev sites splitting current content
- GROOVY-8183: Website move - step 3: 
   generate user and dev sites from repo content

Of these, step 1 and step 2 (previously reported) are complete. 
Some work has begun on step 3. We are still exploring how to adapt our 
current site generation scripts to work with existing Apache tools in this
area (e.g. Buildbot). As well as automating some manual steps taken to
complete step 2, part of step 3 completes the move of the website fully 
onto Apache infrastructure. Due to time constraints completion of this
step has been slower than we would like but progress is being made.

## Activity:

This quarter, 279 commits were contributed from 24 contributors
including 19 non-committer contributors (12 new). 

## Health report: 

With the progress on the build and release aspects of the project, 
our release train has increased velocity, and the community seems 
happy to see us being back on track with regular releases.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Hama Project  [Edward J. Yoon]

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache HTTP Server Project  [Daniel Gruno]

## Description:
- The Apache HTTP Server is an open-source HTTP server for modern operating
systems including UNIX, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS/X and Netware.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
Two releases, 2.4.28 and 2.4.29, were cut for the 2.4 branch.
Discussion is underway for a possible 2.5.0 alpha release. It was decided to
do some pruning of our (visible) branches in svn, to make it less muddy when
browsing our source code.

## Health report: 
The project remains in good health. What follows is a slightly more 
technical/academic analysis than usual.

Code-wise, activity has been pretty much the same as in the past quarter with
roughly the same number of committers and commits. Diversity-wise, httpd
remains at a Pony Factor[1] of 5-6, which is a solid diversity score for a
project of httpd's age.

Email-wise, the PF score is currently 5 for dev@ and 46 for the users@ list,
arguably because a handful of people are responsible for the bulk of helping
users with issues.

Retention-wise, the community has managed to retain a steady amount of people
over the past 6 years, "idling" at around 35 people actively working on code,
700ish people active on the mailing list, and some 250 working on bugzilla
issues. The bulk of people working on code has a five year or longer
experience with httpd. We can interpret this as two distinct causes: 1) We are
excellent at retaining people we take under our wings as committers, but also
2) We need to put more effort into getting new committers (the average httpd
coder has spent nearly 8 years working on httpd).

While I'm sure the PMC will discuss ways to engage with newcomers and make
working on the httpd project more accessible and appealing to more people, I
wish to also point out that we have maintained this status for more than six
years. So...we excel at retaining, but we could also do with some fresh blood
in the ranks.

Using Apache Kibble, I have also personally been able to assess more social
aspects of the community, and I am pleased to note that the overall mood of
our mailing lists are above average for the ASF. The take-away here being 
that we for the most part adhere well to the ASF code of conduct. See 
mailing list section below for more information.

[1] https://ke4qqq.wordpress.com/2015/02/08/pony-factor-math/

## PMC changes:

- Currently 49 PMC members.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Steffen Land on Mon Feb 27 2017

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 119 committers.
- No new committers added in the last 3 months
- Last committer addition was Daniel Ferradal at Wed Apr 26 2017

## Releases:

- 2.4.28 was released on Thu Oct 05 2017
- 2.4.29 was released on Mon Oct 23 2017

## Mailing list activity:

Mailing list activity remains steady. August was slower than the other months,
likely due to summer vacations ending there. 812 emails were sent to our user
and dev lists by 143 people, spread over 242 topics.

We have had to re-iterate to people that the ASF has a code of conduct that
should be followed. As a result, a member of the mailing list was removed for
continuously failing to follow these guidelines.

## Bugzilla Statistics: 
BugZilla stats are pretty much identical to past quarter:

- 71 Bugzilla tickets created in the last 3 months by 61 people
- 51 Bugzilla tickets resolved in the last 3 months by 12 people

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache HttpComponents Project  [Asankha Chamath Perera]

## Description: 

 - The Apache HttpComponents project is responsible for creating and
   maintaining a toolset of low-level Java components focused on HTTP and
   associated protocols

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
 - The board has asked about prospective PMCs or committers, but 
   we do not have any at this moment.

## Activity:

 - The HttpCore 5.0 beta 1 has been released with HTTP/2 support

## Health report:

 - Overall the project remains active. Although established in late 2007
   the project remains stable and active as seen by JIRA and Emails.
 - The number of emails could be seen as low, but it is stable like the state
   of the project, and we still have interested people contributing.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 9 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Michael Osipov on Mon Aug 24 2015

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Ignite Project  [Denis A. Magda]

## Description: 
- Apache Ignite is an in-memory computing platform that is strongly consistent
and highly available with powerful SQL, key-value, and processing APIs. 

## Comments

The section includes commentaries on questions raised by board members during
at the previous board meeting.

Q1: it would be good to include a note about the ignite.run data collection
issue and it's resolution in the official board report.

The issue was solved. The ignite.run domain was transferred to ASF and shut
down. All the statistics collected before was purged. Presently, an Ignite
node process connects to this page [1] deployed on ASF to find out the latest
Ignite version and notify a user about its availability. No user data is
collected at all. 

Q2: Ignite has historically been very tightly aligned with a single vendor.
How are efforts going forward to add more diversity?
  
The community is becoming more and more diversified. Specifically, we see many
contributors coming from the financial sector (banks, etc.) who widely use
Ignite in production and want to take part in its development. Next, the
community is about to accept a big contribution by NetMillennium, Inc [2].
Finally, Ignite members take part in a myriad of events (meetups, conferences,
webinars) to expand awareness of the project and get more contributors. At
all, I wouldn’t say that presently the project is somehow tightly aligned with
a single vendor.

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## Activity: 
- Apache Ignite 2.2 and 2.3 were released since the time of the previous
report. 
- Filed a trademark request for Apache Ignite. The request has been awaiting
the examination.
- More than 30 talks were conducted by community members and Ignite users at
various meetups, conferences, and webinars.
  
## Health report: 
- The popularity of Ignite continues to grow. We see it in an increased number
of users, contributors, discussions, releases.
  
## PMC changes: 
  
- Currently 24 PMC members. 
- Pavel Tupitsyn was added to the PMC on Mon Aug 28 2017 
  
## Committer base changes: 
  
- Currently 33 committers. 
- No new committers added in the last 3 months 
- Last committer addition was Igor Sapego at Thu Mar 02 2017 
  
## Releases: 
  
- 2.2.0 was released on Mon Sep 18 2017 
- 2.3.0 was released on Tue Oct 31 2017

--------------------
Amaterasu

Apache Amaterasu is a framework providing continuous deployment for Big
Data Pipelines.

It provides the following capabilities:

Continuous integration tools to package pipelines and run tests.
A repository to store those packaged applications: the applications
repository.
A repository to store the pipelines, and engine configuration (for
instance, the location of the Spark master, etc.): per environment - the
configuration repository.
A dashboard to monitor the pipelines.
A DSL and integration hooks allowing third parties to easily integrate.

Amaterasu has been incubating since 2017-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Prepare the first release
  2. Grow up user and contributor communities
  3. Prepare documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Talks have been given in different events to promote and give
visibility to Amaterasu

--------------------
Daffodil

Apache Daffodil is an implementation of the Data Format Description Language
(DFDL) used to convert between fixed format data and XML/JSON.

Daffodil has been incubating since 2017-08-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Obtaining SGAs
  2. Establishing new apache-centric infrastructure
  3. Broadening base of contributors

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

- Only that chasing the SGAs down is going to take some time, though
this may be typical.

How has the community developed since the last report?

- Users: No change.

- Developers/Contributors: No change.

How has the project developed since the last report?

- Completed setup of the git repo.
- Started process of transfer of existing JIRA
tickets to Apache.
- Established our contributor/branch workflow and
published to wiki.
- Submitted Tresys SGA.
- Progress is being made on obtaining organizational
SGAs from NCSA and IBM.

Edgent

Apache Edgent is a programming SDK and micro-kernel style runtime
that can be embedded in gateways and small footprint edge devices enabling
local, real-time, analytics on the continuous streams of data coming
from equipment, vehicles, systems, appliances, devices and sensors of
all kinds (for example, Raspberry Pis or smart phones). Working in
conjunction with centralized analytic systems, Apache Edgent provides
efficient and timely analytics across the whole IoT ecosystem: from the
center to the edge.

Edgent has been incubating since 2016-02-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create and expand a diverse community of contributors and committers
     around the Edgent project.
  2. Attracting at least another independent committer/ppmc member.
  3. Finding further real world users of Edgent

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  While two contributors are still quite active working on
  the conversion to maven and towards getting out the next release,
  there has been very little other community or dev list activity.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  * Will Marshall had a meetup in San Francisco on the 20th of September
    to demonstrate an Edgent video analytics application which was
    initially presented at ApacheCon 2017 (Video Analytics at the Edge:
    Fun with Apache Edgent, OpenCV and a Raspberry Pi).
  * Christofer Dutz gave a presentation at Solutions Hamburg that
    included Apache Edgent.
  * There was one new non-committer enhancement/PR merged.
  * There was one JIRA from a new individual: asked & answered.
  * Total, we have 73 subscribers to our mailing list, an improvement
    of 3 since the last report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Two contributors/committers have been very active overhauling the
    Edgent build system to Maven from Gradle on the features/maven
    branch. We are very close to merging and working on a release.
    Maven provides benefits over Gradle, including a more rigid build
    structure, the Maven package system, and ASF release process integration.
    The work includes a variety of other cleanup / usability items,
    such as how we distribute Edgent samples and how users build them.
  * According to JIRA, 6 new issues were added to the project and
    2 issues have been resolved or closed between August 2017 and October 2017.
    11 issues are in progress as part of PR-309 (the maven work).

How would you assess the podling's maturity?

  Edgent is making slow but consistent progress towards graduation. While we
  don't yet meet the diversity requirements, we put emphasis on community
  growth through outreach which will ultimately pave the way for additional
  committers and contributors.

  Additionally, before we graduate it is important that we find users
  outside of IBM. As most Edgent committers are employed by IBM, external
  stakeholders help ensure long term contribution to the project.

     Comments:  The podling is still growing.  I don't believe things have changed
     since I joined as mentor a few months ago.  To be able to graduate, they need
     to have a truly viable community with actual features coming in.

IPMC/Shepherd notes:
Development and the number of developers working on the project have fallen off. Dave Fisher.

Guacamole

Guacamole is an enterprise-grade, protocol-agnostic, remote desktop gateway.
Combined with cloud hosting, Guacamole provides an excellent alternative to
traditional desktops. Guacamole aims to make cloud-hosted desktop access
preferable to traditional, local access.

Guacamole has been incubating since 2016-02-10.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Reach consensus on graduation resolution DISCUSS thread (general@)
  2. Call IPMC graduation vote
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has discussed, voted upon, and approved a resolution to
  graduate to TLP. This resolution is now being discussed on the general@
  list, prior to calling the IPMC graduation vote.

  Community activity on the mailing lists continues to be productive  and
  increasing, with the user@ list now receiving an average of 201 posts per
  month.

   git log --format='%ci' | grep -cE '2017-(08|09|10)'

 62 of those commits were by non-committers:
   git log --format='%an %ci' | grep -E '2017-(08|09|10)' | tr -d '0-9\-' | cut -d ' ' -f -2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

Of the 37 patch authors, 16 were not committers at the beginning of this reporting period.

 There are three new committers members and one new PPMC member:
   https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@impala.apache.org:dfr=2017-8-1|dto=2017-10-31:%22has%20invited%22

Impala has done a fourth release with a third release manager.

Impala has begun graduation procedures: we have held a community discussion and a
community vote on graduation, both unanimous. We have established our intended PMC.
Next, we will draft our charter and hold a discussion on general@incubator.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Impala has removed the old unpartitioned hash and aggregation nodes, relics from
years ago that were kept around for backwards compatibility: the new buffer management
makes these obsolete. Code generation for decimal and timestamp types has been added
to the text scanner, increasing the performance of some queries by up to 19%. More
robust query plans in case of data skew have made some aggregations eight times as fast.
A number of large changes are in-flight, including changes to equivalence class computation
in the planner, more decimal semantics adjustments, min-max filters for Kudu, and
multi-threaded metadata loading that increases the performance of some metadata operations by 8x.

--------------------
Joshua

Joshua is a statistical machine translation toolkit

Joshua has been incubating since 2016-02-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make another Apache Joshua incubating release (7.0.0).
  2. Identifying specific use cases that Joshua might excel at.
  3. Attracting active developers and users.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

The community mailing lists continue to see a few new users
requiring assistance with using the project.
Questions have been answered in reasonable time. Community 
building continues to be the biggest challenge for Joshua right
now.

How has the project developed since the last report?

The PPMC is actively working towards a 7.0.0 release
candidate which will essentially be a re-modularization of
the Joshua source code for distribution and hopefully 
improved consumption as a dependency within other projects.
We have seen a few pull requests logged specifically addressing
source code formatting, this is a positive.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Apache Slider community/PPMC has voted to move portions of Slider into
     Apache Hadoop YARN as modules. It is possible that the remaining pieces
     will be moved at a later point in time or become obsolete or evolve to
     work closely with YARN. A vote was initiated in the Apache Hadoop
     community to merge all Slider specific changes (now referred to as YARN
     Services) from a branch to trunk. Expectation is to make YARN Services
     an integral part of Apache Hadoop 3.x release. Few issues were raised
     on the changes in the branch, but all have been addressed and a new
     vote was initiated on Oct 30, 2017.

  2. Getting more external users

  3. Growth of a diverse set of developers/committers/PMC members

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Mailing list activity has been lower due to the bulk of the development
  moving to an Apache Hadoop branch. Questions on usage and issues
  encountered by end users keep coming at regular intervals, keeping the DL
  somewhat active.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Work continues in parallel on the Apache Hadoop yarn-native-services
  branch and on the Slider podling. The bulk of the work has been in
  yarn-native-services. However, quite a few Fortify identified issues,
  a new feature for Percentage based Health Monitor support (SLIDER-1246) and
  a few Slider patches (related to critical issues or agent-only issues) have
  been committed to the Slider podling, since the last report.

     Comments: Work happening in Apache Hadoop YARN project has reached a critical milestone -
     the Apache Hadoop community has voted and Slider functionality is now merged into Apache
     Hadoop trunk. It is potentially going to be part of the Apache Hadoop 3.1 release. Slider
     community to summarize this on dev-list and figure out the mechanics of working with

     and migrating existing applications etc.

extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Announce release 0.3 properly
  2. Prepare release 0.4 (end of November)
  3. Grow community and get more active developers as a TLP

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

We'd like to graduate after 0.4 is out, maybe Q1-2018.

How has the community developed since the last report?

A lot of discussion/bugreport/fixing concerning the upcoming OSGi features on the mailing list.
Unfortunately not yet any new committers.
Members of the project have joined the official Configuration JSR (Anatole/John)


How has the project developed since the last report?

We've introduced new features such as OSGi support and full Java8 compatibility
while raising test and mutation test coverage.
Apart from that the upcoming 0.4-SNAPSHOT has Microprofile API support.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez]

## Description: 
 - A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
JEE components (Java, servlets, JSP).
   
## Issues: 
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - It's been another quiet quarter, with only a couple of commits needed to
   complete markup's parsing and rendering decoupling, so that other
   alternatives to JSPWiki markup parser / renderer can be used.
 
 - As something stripped from @dayjob, Markdown support will hopefully 
   arrive next weeks (see "Markdown support" thread at dev@jspwiki.a.o for
   details [1]), at least for discussion and study. Scope and things 
   remaining to be done still ongoing at dev@jspwiki.a.o
   
## Health report: 
 - Another quiet quarter, but enough people from PMC show up to provide
   oversight. 

 - Several ideas being discussed at user@jspwiki.a.o to increase 
   contributions [2], namely:
   * move to Github as primary repo
   * lower committership barrier by granting commits rights to 
     a) any ASF committer 
     b) any other people who simply asks for it
   * adopting something similar to a release train, and release 
     master every four months or so

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache Kafka Project  [Jun Rao]

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform for efficiently storing and
processing a large number of records in real time.

Development
===========
We released 1.0.0! This is a big milestone of Apache Kafka after
7+ years of active development, which has accumulated key features such as
intra cluster replication, 
compacted topics, security, connect, kstream, exactly-once semantics, among
others. 108 people contributed to the 1.0.0 release. More than 340 people have
contributed to Apache Kafka over time.

We are actively working on new features such as JBOD, delegation tokens,
additional 
improvements of the controller, various improvements in kstream and connect,
etc.

Community
===========
Lots of activities in the mailing list. We have 2551 subscribers
in the user mailing list, up 78 in the last 3 months. We have 1268 emails in
the user mailing list in the last 3 months, a bit less than the 1631 in the
previous cycle. We have 1059 subscribers in the dev mailing list, up 55 in the
last 3 months. We have 4409 emails in the dev mailing list in the last 3
months, a bit less from the 6349 in the previous cycle.

We elected one new committer, Onur Karaman on Oct. 31, 2017. We elected one
new PMC member, Becket Qin on Aug. 23, 2017.

The next Kafka Summit in London in Apr. 2018 is now open for submission.

Releases
===========
0.11.0.1 was released on Sep. 13, 2017.
1.0.0 was released on Nov. 1, 2017.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Kibble Project  [Rich Bowen]

## Description:
 Apache Kibble is a suite of tools for collecting, aggregating and
 visualizing activity in software projects.

## Issues:
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

 The project is starting up as a TLP within the Apache family. October
 was a month which saw many community members doing a ton of travel,
 which hampered the project somewhat. Nonetheless, the project has
 managed to set up its initial web site, code repositories, and a demo
 instance of the Kibble software suite. The community will be working
 towards defining goals and contacting interested parties (such as
 other PMCs at Apache interested in taking part in our community
 analyses). One of the many benefits of being part of the Apache family
 is ready access to a lot of interesting projects from both a technical
 and - equally important - community aspect, and we'll be working with
 the ASF projects to determine what projects would like to see emerge
 from Kibble in terms of trends, breakdowns, aggregations etc that can
 help shed some light on how projects and their communities are doing.

 There has also been discussion of what metrics are useful, or at
 least potentially useful, and how we might engage with projects to
 get their input on what metrics they consider important measures of
 project health, as this will vary from one project to another, and
 may be very different for projects outside of the ASF.

## Health report:

 The project has sufficient (3+ PMC members) oversight.
 It is too early to contemplate progression of community health,
 but we will of course keep the board apprised of any changes.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 11 PMC members.
 - All PMC members added in the last 3 months

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 11 committers.
 - No changes (the PMC was established in the last 3 months)

## Releases:

 - No releases yet. We tentatively plan to have our first release within
   the next six months.

## Mailing list and bug tracker activity:
 As we have just started, it makes little sense to discuss these stats yet.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Knox Project  [Larry McCay]

## Description: 
The Apache Knox Gateway is a REST API Gateway for interacting with Apache
Hadoop clusters. The Knox Gateway provides a single access point for all
REST/HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters.

## Issues: 
There are no issues that requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
The Apache Knox team is in the process of an active VOTE for our 0.14.0 release.
We will be immediately following up with our 1.0.0 release which will include
a repackaging of all of our class package names to remove "hadoop" from the name.
This will allow downstream consumers to take on new features in 0.14.0 without
moving to new package names in case of incompatibilities.
   
## Health report: 
We have continued to use the KIP-# pages to drive the primary focus of each
release and feel it is working well. The 0.14.0 release was primarily
focused on the addition of the service discovery and simplified descriptors
(KIP-8) to improve and simplify management of topologies. It also includes 
many improvements and bug fixes.

The current level of collaboration is healthy and encouraging within the
community on both mailing lists and JIRAs.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Logging Services Project  [Matt Sicker]

## Description: 

Apache Logging Services creates and maintains open source software
related to application logging.
   
## Issues: 

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 

 - Log4j: during this quarter, some of our main work has revolved
 around Java 9 support, improved support for generating and parsing
 safer formats such as JSON in order to discourage native Java
 serialization and the vulnerabilities associated with that, removal
 of default configurations that would use the old Java serialization
 layout, better defaults for XML parsing to avoid potential security
 issues with configuration files, a new HTTP appender, and automatic
 JMS reconnection support for JMS clients that don't support that
 natively.

 - Log4net: no new releases this quarter, but the Jenkins pipeline
 builds have been stabilized. Some bug fixes and enhancements to
 the AdoNetAppender.

 - Log4j Scala: no new releases this quarter. Some talk about testing
 for Scala 2.13 beta releases. The website was partially integrated
 back into the Log4j site.

 - Log4cxx: no new releases this quarter. Some bugfixes committed.

 - Log4php: no new releases this quarter. No new commits.

 - Chainsaw: no new releases this quarter. Discussion has started
 regarding revitalizing the project for a 3.0 version with the
 general idea being to migrate to JavaFX for its GUI instead of
 Swing, and to write it in either Scala 2.12 or Java 8. Work was
 done to prepare the project for a release, and discussion is taking
 place to start a release candidate process for it. Talk about how
 to package appropriate binaries for various operating systems was
 also considered. There is general interest in overhauling the
 project after a new release of the existing 2.x codebase.

 - Log4j Audit: some initial work has been done towards creating
 an audit logging framework and catalog.
   
## Health report: 

Logging Services remains an active project. The overall community
is healthy and friendly. We recently voted to rotate the PMC Chair
to Matt Sicker which was approved by the Board on 18 October 2017.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 13 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Mikael Ståldal on Mon Jun 20 2016 
 - Ralph Goers resigned from PMC Chair on Oct 18 2017
 - Matt Sicker was added as PMC Chair on Oct 18 2017
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 32 committers. 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Thorsten Schöning at Mon Mar 06 2017 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - LOG4J-2.9.0 was released on Sat Aug 26 2017 
 - LOG4J-2.9.1 was released on Wed Sep 20 2017 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
We recently added a notifications@ mailing list to redirect a lot
of duplicate messages that are generated by tools such as GitHub,
JIRA, and other integrations. This will decrease the absolute traffic
numbers in the dev@ list and has already had an effect by decreasing
the traffic to dev@ by almost 300 emails.

The dev@ mailing list had less traffic than last quarter. The
log4j-user@ list had more activity than last quarter. The other
user lists had about the same amount of traffic as last quarter.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AP: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 2.8.1 release on
September 7, 2017.  The next major release is scheduled for December 31, 2017.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

We signed up three committers in this period; the most recent one was Julien
Massiera on September 30, 2017.  We have not made much progress, however, on
signing up new PMC members; the last PMC member remains Rafa Haro, voted in on
August 31, 2015.  In response to the Board's inquiry in February, we've been
looking for PMC members and there have been some discussions, but so far we do
not see PMC-level committment for any of our current committers. Generally we
like to see long-term interest in the project before we offer PMC memberships.

There have also been discussions around planning for transfer of the PMC Chair
position to another person in some reasonable timeframe.  We've discussed
responsibilities and requirements for the PMC Chair position and looked for a
volunteer. Currently we've had no takers, so Karl Wright will continue to be
the Chair for the foreseeable future.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list activity has been fairly high this quarter.  Development has been
taking place due to many downstream critical release updates.  Issues reported
have been largely about refinements to some of our connectors that have less
robust user communities and constituencies.  I am unaware of any mailing list
question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

No outstanding infrastructure issues are known at this time.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We received word that the ManifoldCF
trademark application (US TM App No. 86583085 for "MANIFOLDCF" in Cl. 9 | DLA
Ref: 393457-900118) has been accepted.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Mesos Project  [Benjamin Hindman]

Description:

Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute
resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling
fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and
run effectively.


Issues:

There are no Board-level issues at this time.

Activity:

* The community completed two successful events since our last board
  report, MesosCon North America in Los Angeles and MesosCon Europe in
  Prague. Both conferences were co-located with Linux Foundation's
  Open Source Summit. We added two new parts to the conference that
  were a huge hit, town where community members got together to talk
  about various projects in the Mesos ecosystem (including Mesos) and
  MesosCon University where we ran longer, tutorial/workshop based
  presentations.

* The community held a "docathon" in September that brought in
  numerous community members and really helped improve the
  documentation.

* The community started a performance working group where numerous
  community members and organizations are joining to improve the
  performance in Mesos.

* Members of the community are driving a new container storage
  standard called Container Storage Interface (CSI) and are working
  with other open source communities such as Cloud Foundry, Docker,
  and Kubernetes.

* The project continues to see new bug reports, bug fixes, features,
  reviews and releases. The mailing lists, slack and IRC channels are
  also very much active with healthy discussions.

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache MetaModel Project  [Kasper Sørensen]

Report from the Apache MetaModel project [Kasper Sørensen]

## Description: 
  Providing a common interface for discovery, exploration of metadata and 
  querying of different types of data sources. 
  
## Issues: 
- there are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
- We've just released MetaModel 5.0.0 which has been brewing for a long time.
  Whether the release is a big a success is too early to say anything about,
  but it's good to finally have it out!
- The new "Membrane" subproject will get it's initial release soon too. We
  hope that this subproject will act as a showcase for what MetaModel's
  capabilities can be used to archieve. Membrane will be distributed as a
  Docker image too, making it very easy to install and try out.
- An initial check was made to see how MetaModel works on JDK 9. Due to
  limitations in some of the supported datastores (old version of
  ElasticSearch, Neo4j) we still cannot do the complete build on JDK 9.
  This is something I think we'll have to address soon.
  
## Health report: 
- We're not seeing explosive growth or anything like that, but it seems to be
  a good time with decent amounts of activity from both recurring and new
  contributors.
- Good signals in terms of new contributions coming organically and less
  company-sponsored.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Oozie Project  [Robert Kanter]

## Description:
- Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.
  
## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
- The board had asked about our Committer vs PMC gap in
the previous report.  Some of the Committers are no longer
active.  Otherwise, we generally wait about 1 year after
Committership to promote to PMC.  A couple Committers
are reaching that point in the next month or so, and a few
more will be there early next year.
  
## Activity:
- We're now planning a 5.0.0 beta release sometime before
the end of the year, with Oozie on Yarn as the flagship feature.
- Someone was asking about us giving them the "Oozie"
twitter handle.  We've decided to keep it to protect the brand.
We'll look into actively using it again.
- Other misc bug/usability fixes and improvements are still
ongoing.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache POI Project  [Dominik Stadler]

Report from the Apache POI committee [Dominik Stadler]

## Description: 
- Apache POI is a Java library for reading and writing Microsoft Office file
  formats

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## Activity: 
- There is constant activity in commits, bugfixes, feature-work and also
  user questions. 
  We release 3.17 and started work on a major release 4.0 in order to perform
  some larger work on the codebase. Among those is to desupport Java 6 and 7
  as well as removal of some deprecated API parts.
  Work happened to cleanup the code-base after the switch to 4.0, a number of 
  bugfixes and some function enhancements/additions.
     
  We started discussion about a non-maintainer-update of XMLBeans (which is in
  the Attic) to fix some bugs that affect Apache POI users.

## Health report:

  are being raised and addressed, in line with prior activity levels.

- Adel Boutros was added as a committer on 9th August 2017.

- There were no new PMC additions in this quarter.
  The most recent new PMC member is Ganesh Murthy, added on 30th Jan 2017.

# Development:

- Work progresses towards a 1.0.0 release of Dispatch router, with various
  new features and an overhaul of its IO handling based on new functionality
  from Proton-C in 0.18.0. A 1.0.x branch has been created and a couple of
  testing candidates created, with progress being made on resolving some
  final issues ahead of calling a 1.0.0 release vote.

- A 7.0.0 Qpid Broker-J release is imminent, with voting open on a second
  candidate for release. The AMQP 0-x JMS client will soon proceed to a
  6.3.0 release vote to complete making it independent going forward. Some
  broker fixes are going to be backported to the existing 6.x line for a
  further bug fix release.

- Proton-C and its language bindings had their 0.18.0 release, incorporating
  some extensive work on new IO handling, as well as a 0.18.1 bug fix to
  clear up some niggles. Work on 0.19.0 is under way, aiming to build on
  some of this work and making improvements to the Ruby binding. Work
  continues on Proton-J to incorporate fixes and changes needed to enable
  bug fix and feature additions in dependent client/broker/other components.

- The AMQP 1.0 JMS client had its 0.25.0-0.27.0 releases, incorporating
  various bug fixes and improvements, and facilitating building and using
  on JDK9. Work on additional fixes and improvements continues.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Royale Project  [Harbs]

## DESCRIPTION

Apache Royale is a new implementation of the principles of Apache Flex but
designed for JavaScript runtimes instead of Adobe Flash/AIR runtimes.  Apache
Royale is designed to improve developer productivity in creating applications
for wherever Javascript runs, including browsers as well as Apache Cordova
applications, Node, etc.

Apache Royale was approved as a new TLP in the September meeting.  Royale took
over responsibility for the code related to what was known as Apache FlexJS
from the Apache Flex community. This is our second report.

## ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## RELEASES
- Apache FlexJS 0.8.0 was released on 6/25/17.

## ACTIVITY
- The effort to set up new builds and rename code assets from FlexJS to Royale
was/is significant and that effort is still in progress, but nearing
completion.
- Some new names have appeared on the mailing lists investigating whether
Royale is a suitable solution for migrating existing Flex applications off of
Flash.
- One PMC member has proposed an initial web site for Royale.  There were some
logistical issues in being allowed to use it as he created it on WordPress
with a commercial theme.  Those issues are mostly resolved at this time.
- Some work is being done on a new default look-and-feel for Royale.
- There has been some progress and discussion on improving the testing
architecture to make it easier to improve the automated test coverage.

## COMMUNITY

The community is still working through the transition from Apache Flex to
Apache Royale.  There is much documentation remaining to be transitioned from
the Apache Flex wiki to some place in Apache Royale.

Currently, users@royale has 38 subscribers (up from 29) and dev@royale has 47
(up from 42) subscribers.  We are not sure why more folks from the Flex
mailing lists haven't subscribed to Royale, but it's likely that once we get
our website and documentation moved over we will ask again on the Flex lists
to see if folks want to come over.

We have not added any new committers or PMC members yet.

## TRADEMARKS

Several PMC members wanted to allow another PMC member to use royalesdk.io
and/or royalesdk.org to externally host some content to promote Apache Royale.
Trademarks denied use of that domain name. We might revisit the topic if and
when there is a concrete reason to do so.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Santuario Project  [Colm O hEigeartaigh]

## Description: 
 - Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - There were two new releases over the last quarter of the Apache Santuario
   XML Security for Java project. 2.0.9 was a minor bug fix release, albeit
   with an important bug fix when deploying the library in the Google App
   Engine. 2.1.0 was a new major release with support for JDK 9.

   A new release of the C++ library is expected in the next quarter.
   
## Health report: 
 - Apache Santuario is a mature and stable project that has reached a point
   where not too many fixes are required, as it is a set of implementations
   of some specifications that are quite old now. It is actively managed by
   the PMC. Right now there are no obvious potential new committers for the
   project.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 6 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Marc Giger on Wed Apr 03 2013 
   
## Committer base changes: 
   
 - Currently 16 committers. 
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report. 
 - Last committer addition was Marc Giger in July 2012
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Apache Santuario XML Security for Java 2.0.9 was released on Mon Aug 28 
   2017 
 - Apache Santuario XML Security for Java 2.1.0 was released on Mon Aug 28 
   2017

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Bert Huijben]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library
   built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the
   default client library of Apache Subversion, Apache OpenOffice and
   mod_pagespeed.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
   There hasn't been much activity over the last few months, but minor
   tweaks are applied quite often to keep up to date with changes in
   other relevant projects such as OpenSSL. I expect that we will
   release a new 1.3 release soon.

## Health report: 
   Activity is at a normal, fairly quiet level.

   The serf project's activity is quite related to that of Subversion
   and with that projects recent affairs we slowed more than expected.

## PMC & Committer changes: 
   Currently 12 PMC members and 13 committers. We added Evgeny Kotkov
   as Committer and PMC member this April.

## Releases:
   Apache Serf 1.3.9 was released on Thu Sep 01 2016

## Mailing list and Jira activity:
   Normal slow activity.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of spatial objects
for searching, archiving, or other relevant spatial needs. The base of the SIS
library is modelled according international standards published jointly by the
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO).


## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.


## Activity:

The two Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects have been completed, but their
integration into SIS will require a significant amount of work. For example
the Android port had a rewrite of some classes for using the Google SQLite API
instead than JDBC. The amount of code changes will make difficult to merge
future work from SIS trunk to Android branch. A more convenient approach would
have been to create JDBC wrapper for SQLite (only for the parts that we use).
The student was aware of this issue, but didn’t had time to change his
approach before the end of the project. A cause of this issue may have been
the mentor (myself) not putting enough insistence for a change.

Following the Apache SIS presentations in two Free and Open Source Software
for Geospatial (FOSS4G) conferences, we wrote two blogs comparing Apache SIS
and Proj.4 (the dominant open source map projections library) [1] [2]. Our
main conclusion is that Proj.4 supports more map projections and is generally
faster (because of faster trigonometric functions in C/C++ compared to Java
8), but Apache SIS provides better compliance with international standards
together with more information (accuracy, domain of validity) for evaluating
coordinate operations reliability.

Related to above paragraph, we proposed to the Open Geospatial Consortium
(OGC) a process for evaluating the reliability of geospatial referencing
softwares [3]. If this process is accepted and if OGC find sponsors for it,
Apache SIS would be in good position for participating and I think it would
perform well.

OGC has deployed GeoAPI 3.0.1 on Maven Central, which allow us to release
Apache SIS 0.8. A release candidate is being prepared and will be submitted to
vote this week. Status of work submitted by external contributors:

* Update of netCDF discovery metadata [4] has been integrated in SIS.
* Update of XML metadata: we delayed their integration to after SIS 0.8
  release in order to avoid the risk of major changes to close to a release.


## Health report:

The project is reported mostly okay according the Apache Committee Report
Helper. However mailing list activity went down to the usual level when there
is no GSoC projects.


## PMC changes:

* Currently 20 PMC members.
* Johann Sorel was added to the PMC on Thu Sep 07 2017


## Committer base changes:

* Currently 21 committers.
* No new committers added in the last 3 months.
* Last committer addition was Johann Sorel at Thu Mar 31 2016.


## Releases:

* Last release was 0.7 on May 27 2016.
* 0.8 release candidate is in preparation.


## Mailing list activity:

* dev@sis.apache.org:
    - 66 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 36 emails sent to list (142 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Alexandru Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It 
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. 

Project status:

- We released Spark 2.1.2 on October 9th, with maintenance fixes for the
  2.1 branch. This release was also managed by a new committer, which
  helped expose issues in the release process documentation that we've
  fixed. We are encouraging more new committers to be RMs for upcoming
  releases like 2.2.1.

- The Spark Summit Europe conference ran in Dublin, Ireland in October
  with 1200 attendees.

- Work is under way to merge Kubernetes support for Spark 2.3.0, with
  the first major pull requisition having undergone a bunch of review
  and getting close to merging. We need one more pull request beyond
  this for basic support.

SPIPs:

We wanted to give an update on Spark Project Improvement Proposals
(SPIPs), the process we started to formally propose large changes
before having an implementation. Since we started the process, there
have been seven SPIPs proposed on the mailing list with the first in
June 2017, which are all listed in JIRA at https://s.apache.org/aMHI.
So far all the voted-on SPIPs have been accepted and it seems that
the discussions, both on our dev list and in JIRA, have been useful,
resulting in design changes, better understanding of each idea, and
feedback from a wide range of Spark users. Some of the major SPIPs
discussed and accepted include Kubernetes support, images as a
first-class data type in MLlib, updates to the data source API, and low
latency continuous processing. We will continue to encourage people to
write large proposals as SPIPs to generate this type of discussion.

Trademarks:

- No large issues to report in the past 3 months.

Latest releases:

- October 9, 2017: Spark 2.1.2
- July 11, 2017: Spark 2.2.0
- May 02, 2017: Spark 2.1.1
- Dec 28, 2016: Spark 2.1.0

Committers and PMC:

- The latest committer was added on September 22nd, 2017
  (Tejas Patil).
- The latest PMC members were added on June 16th, 2017
  (six new PMC members from the existing committers).

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Stefan Sperling]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  The community is healthy and active. New features are being designed
  and developed, and bug reports are being handled. Our user support
  forums (Email and IRC) receive questions and answers regularly.

  The project is holding a hackathon in Aachen, Germany, for a duration
  of 5 days in November (21st - 26th). At least 5 developers will be
  attending this event. The community has reached out to the general
  public with an invitation to a "meet and greet" event which will
  occur on the 23rd of November. Funding for this hackathon was first
  sought from the Foundation, but ended up being covered by the company
  Assembla.

  Two committer additions happened in October 2017:
    Pavel Lyalyakin who has been contributing to the project's website.
    Troy Curtis Jr who has been contributing to SVN's Python 3 bindings.

  In October, the PMC chair hat was passed from Evgeny Kotkov to
  Stefan Sperling. There was no pressing need for this switch.
  The switch was discussed beforehand and agreed upon by the entire PMC.
  Our main motivation was our belief that occasionally passing such
  responsibilities around benefits our community in the long term.
  Evgeny Kotkov served as PMC chair for one year, and we expect our
  new chair to serve for at least the same amount of time.

* Releases

  There were no new releases published since August 10 2017.
  The current supported releases are still 1.9.7 and 1.8.19.

  Several bug fixes for our stable release series have since been proposed,
  implying that new stable releases can be expected in the near future.
  None of the proposed bug fixes have security implications.

  We continue moving towards the first GA release of Subversion 1.10.

Attachment BV: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Sam Ruby]

## Description:
  Tools that help automate various administrative tasks or information lookup
  activities

## Issues:

  None

## Health report:

  We continue to have more than adequate oversight, with two to three active
  committers, and two to four occasional committers.

## Development:

 - All tools which previously used React.js were converted to use Vue.js just
   in time for Facebook to re-license React.js.  At the moment, we are
   continuing with Vue.js, but this could change.

 - Development has resumed on a tool to assist PMCs with inviting new
   committers.  Once deployed, this tool will reduce errors and reduce the
   workload on the Secretary.  Craig is leading up the coding of this effort.

 - Whimsy-vm3 has been retired.  There are no current plans to create a
   whimsy-vm5 until the infrastructure team is ready to support Ubuntu 18.04
   (due to be released in April).
