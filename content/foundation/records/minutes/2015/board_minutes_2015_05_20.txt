       This month we are trialling some new processes in the meeting to better
       keep track of reports needing attention, and action items. Thanks
       again to Sam and those that have tweaked Whimsy to help make that
       seamless, and Greg for taking on responsibility for following up stale
       action items.

       It looks like we had a hiccup with the report reminders later in the
       month, which may have contributed to a higher than usual number of
       missing reports. I will follow up to make sure the next reminder goes
       out successfully.

       I'm planning to submit a report later this week as part of the Annual
       Report that is being prepared.

       James Carman has indicated that he plans to step down as Assistant
       Secretary. On behalf of the board, I'd like to thank him for his
       service!

    B. President [Ross]

       As of May 1st Melissa is an employee of Virtual Inc. David is in the
       process of moving appropriate infrastructure contractors over to
       Virtual Inc. (target date June 1st)

       My thanks go to Melissa for coordinating many of the moving parts in
       the foundation for ApacheCon (as well as looking after out booth) and
       to Rich for his shepherding of the content and the volunteers who
       assisted with it. 6 TACers attended, all of whom were very helpful at
       the event. Of note is that one of these attendees came to us through
       the Linux Foundation website rather than the usual ASF channels.

       Branding has seen some more movement with Melissa taking ownership of
       the Branding "runbook". We are actively working towards streamlining
       the "simple" cases by empowering Melissa to coordinate between the
       requestor and the appropriate PMC. This should help ensure that we
       stay on top of the ever-increasing number of requests we receive.

       Melissa, Sally and I have started looking at how we might have a
       greater foundation presence at open source events. We are not
       proposing having a booth at multiple events, rather tracking events at
       which Apache projects and representatives are present so that we can
       provide swag and other supporting materials. Please share any
       recommended event details with Melissa.

       Fundraising continues to run smoothly. The excellent work process
       improvement work led by Upayavira, the accounting of Virtual, the
       transition to our two new VPs (Jim and Hadrian) alongside the
       increased engagement of our EA (Melissa) can now be considered
       complete, it's looks like a well oiled machine at this point. In fact
       items that have been at the bottom of the todo list for a number of
       years are now complete. As a result, fundraising is ahead of the
       projected FY15 budget by $82.2k.

       The infrastructure team have rolled out git based websites (a commonly
       requested feature) and there has been significant progress towards
       improvements in our mail systems (special thanks to Kevin McGrail and
       the SpamAssassin community). Our mail infrastructure is now able to
       scale horizontally in order to support significant additional loads.
       However, David reports this is just a completion of phase 1 - more
       improvements to come.

       Discussions about code of conduct on the members@ list have led to an
       observation that using president@ for reporting of Code of Conduct
       breaches may be inadequate. As a result I am seeking advice from DLA
       Piper on how to craft an appropriate policy for such escalations.
       Unfortunately, in the last month there has been a serious issue on one
       of our mailing lists which resulting in a police report being filed.
       This issue is not yet resolved and I am working with DLA Piper in
       order to ensure our actions, if any, are appropriate. I will use this
       as guidance for a policy for handling such reports in the future.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

        The Treasurer’s Office is working to close out the WFS financial
        accounts. Virtual held a meeting with our customer contact at WFS
        and things are moving forward. We hope to have more to report soon.

        The Assistant Treasurer granted access to the board agenda tool to
        Tom Pappas from Virtual for situational awareness.

        The Treasurer’s Office received a request to include the ASF in All
        State’s Employee Giving programs. The request was forwarded to
        Virtual for processing. As requested, the Apache Software Foundation
        mission statement was sent to All State.

        A request to renew the HALO contract was received by the President
        and Treasurer.

        Phil Steitz provided detail on a need to move away from individual
        donations via Amazon Simple Payments which is sunsetting as a service
        on June 1, 2015.  We need to migrate to the "Login and Pay with
        Amazon” service. Phil estimates that the code change will be minimal
        and he is happy to help in terms of setting up the donate button -
        but has requested help with account setup. Request has been forwarded
        on to Virtual.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary is running a bit behind at the moment with some issues with
       the board agenda tool. Many documents have been received in April: 66
       iclas, two cclas, 12 grants, and 32 membership applications were
       received and filed.

       The prototype automated icla-by-mail has received several comments and
       secretary hopes to resolve issues with VP Legal to move this process
       forward.

       The Assistant Secretary has resigned and Secretary is looking for a
       replacement.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       Not much to report this month. ApacheCon EU is about to start into
       the CFP and promotion phase, and ApacheCon NA hasn't started at all.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       Nothing to report this month. Sent a reminder about action items, but
       I intend to figure out a more structured/helpful approach than a
       simple reminder. Something to grow into, over the next months.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, tm-registrations@, and board@) and following-up with
appropriate personnel
Fundraising:
• Payments received for renewals:
• $50k charitable donation (not a regular sponsor)
• As of the time of submitting this report (May 13th, 2:35pm), I have not
received a response from Virtual re sponsor payments rec’d; therefore, I have
no further info to report on payments.
• AmazonSmile registration completed
• MS Matching Volunteer Time registration completed Virtual:
• Became an official employee as of May 1st
ApacheCon and TAC:
• Booth attendance was great, as always! I had a lot of “old faces”, but I
also met a lot of new people that I was able to spread the ASF love to!
Including a couple of new potential sponsors.
• TAC’ers did a great job in their roles of assisting
• As always, Nick and Jan did an awesome job in their TAC roles!
• One thing I would like to point out for future events is that it would be
great if the booth set-up time didn’t clash with the TAC meeting/dinner; I was
not able to attend the TAC meet and greet dinner due to the tight booth set-up
restrictions! This is the first time this has happened, so hopefully it will
be the last time too!
Trademarks:
• Work resumes with Shane on registrations
• I now have the resources available to be able to assist Shane more
effectively with the incoming queries.
Misc:
• Application for non-profit pavilion for OSCON completed on May 1st.
Accepted applicants to be announced May 26th
• Collaborating with Sally on future events that having an ASF presence at
will be beneficial
• Sally will poll the community to see who will be at what events, and if
there is any availability/willingness to have a booth; we will then prioritize
from there.
• Stickers ordered for Marcel Kinard for Cordova as part of Sally’s
“ProjectApache Project sticker request [was: Apache project S: let's work
together.]” initiative.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

## Operations:

Higher than usual number of questions on trademarks@, including a number of
new kinds of questions; overall I view this as good because many new third
parties are asking questions based on our updated Contact Us page.

Resolved 3 PODLINGNAMESEARCHes, 4 new ones submitted.  As discussed at last
month's meeting, the Apache Orc pTLP creation did have a PODLINGNAMESEARCH,
which is something we need to more clearly document for future pTLPs to ensure
their PMCs understand any issues with their chosen names.

## Registrations:

At the request of the relevant PMCs, we submitted US registration applications
this month for: OFBiz.

Several other PMC registration requests are still coordinating getting all the
information needed reviewed by the PMC and to counsel.

Our HADOOP trademark registration application in Japan was finally granted.
The OPENOFFICE trademark registration application in Canada that was
originally begun by the prior owner has finally issued the formal
registration.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

See Melissa's report for more details.

I am not tracking renewals (or anything else) for infrastructure sponsors.
During the past month we realized that this is could be a problem as invoicing
for one sponsor in particular got discontinued. I am looking into changes in
the process that would address that.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: The contract with HALO Worldwide has been renewed for FY
2015-2016 with no change in the remuneration. Sally Khudairi submitted
HALO's engagement documents and invoice to Ross Gardler. All vendor
payments are up-to-date.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally has begun work on
the ASF FY2014 Annual Report which will be published the last week of
May. The refresh/redesign of the apache.org homepage launched during
ApacheCon, and HotWax Systems have been recognized on the ASF Sponsor
"Thanks" page for their donated services. Sally has also begun working
with Apache CouchDB to solicit use cases and testimonials, and
continues to assist with outreach for Apache CloudStack.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 04 May 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™
SpamAssassin™ v3.4.1

- 27 April 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™
Parquet™ as a Top-Level Project

- 13 April 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Welcomes Pivotal as a
Platinum-level Sponsor

IV. Informal Announcements: 8 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 19 items were tweeted on @TheASF. 10 videos
from ApacheCon North America have been updated to the ASF YouTube
channel. Five Apache News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 31
weekly summaries published to date.

V. Future Announcements: there is one announcement in development that
is scheduled to be released the week of 18 May. Projects preparing to
graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce
major project milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are
welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more information.
Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and
execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 7 media requests. The ASF
received 496 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip
count of 1,040. Press clips for Apache CloudStack will no longer be
monitored at the request of the PMC.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 3 analyst queries. Apache was
mentioned in 2 reports by Gartner (they are holding two upcoming
Webinars on Apache Hadoop), 6 reports by Forrester (an additional
report will be released soon), 9 reports by 451 Research, and 6
reports by IDC. Sally received a preview copy of the Forrester report
on Cloud platform standards that included Apache CloudStack.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally discussed themes, messaging, and
outreach for future ApacheCons with the producers, and will be working
with them on formal announcements next month.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no formal
activities over the past month. Sally is working with Ross and Melissa
Warnkin on a strategy for ASF's presence at future events. In
addition, the process (and budget) for producing Apache
Project-specific promotional materials has migrated from Marketing &
Publicity to Conferences/Local Events/Hackathons.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 15 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and continue to receive gratis
news release distribution in the UK by Pressat.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
n/a

Finances:
==========
$3013 - related to ApacheCon
$422 - hardware replacement
$2350 - Cloud expenses
$60 - Registrar fees

Operations Action Items:
========================
This month has seen work around onboarding the two US-based
contractors as employees. This involves background checks,
reference checks, as well as paperwork. That looks to be
largely complete. It is likely that the two US-based contractors
will be employees effective June 1.

Short Term Priorities:
======================

Websites
----------
Git-based websites are now possible, and seem relatively popular.
8 projects are now using the gitwcsub services, and we are
receiving ~2 requests per week.

SSL
----
SHA-1 based chains have been deprecated. Chrome and Windows now
show alerts for SHA-1 based certs, or certs with SHA-1 certs in the
chain.  Due to this we spent a good amount of time swapping
out SSL certs this month. Despite switching out, this hasn't been
completely trouble free. Some git binaries for Mac or Windows seem
to be having difficulty, and this is a problem that continues to be
worked.

Long Range Priorities:
======================

Automation
----------
This month has seen some automated testing enabled for our
configuration management repo. In addition, we've moved to RTC
from CTR for most changes - while this isn't final, the change
at this point appears positive.

Resilience
-----------
The big boost this month in resilience comes in the mail
infrastructure. See the comments in the mail section.

Technical Debt
---------------


Monitoring
------------
While most of our monitoring has been working we continue to
have issues on our legacy systems that leave us without an
ability to monitor. Additionally, some of our applications
are needed deeper introspection for specific functionality,
and we have yet to cope with that.

General Activity:
=================

Mail
-----
This month has seen the culmination of phase 1 of our mail
overhaul. Many thanks to the SpamAssassin community and
Kevin McGrail in particular for providing insight into
what they see as best practice. Phase one is focused on our
MXes, spam and virus processing. In some ways, we've overbuilt
the current deployment - our new architecture can scale horizontally
allowing us to handle many times our current mail load.

Much work continues to be done on this front, and should be seen
as phase 2 materializes.

Uptime Statistics:
==================

Overall, the total uptime for 2015 increased by 0.02% this month, in what has
generally been a quiet month in terms of emergency maintenance and downtime.
The few services that performed badly this month have been mentioned in
earlier reports, and steps are being taken to increase the availability of
these services in the long run.


Type:                Target:   Reality, total:  Reality, month:  Target Met:

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

The Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) exists to help those that would like to
attend ApacheCon and/or other ASF Sponsored events, but are unable to do so
for financial reasons.

Overall Activity since last report
----------------------------------

* ACNA 2015 Austin took place since our last report.

* TAC folks on the ground Jan and others looked after 6 successful applicants.

As usual it was a great success; and we have had feedback from all our
applicants which reside in our SVN. We hope to provide public versions
of these soon. Some feedback including suggestions that we should use more
social media to help spread the word about TAC, another mentions that as
there was so few TACers (6) that (they implied) more work was required of
them and so less free time. Whilst most TACers found us through the ASF via
mailing lists of fellow
committers/contributors, one found out via the Lunux Foundation site whilst
registering for the event direct.

How has the community developed since the last report?

------------------------------------------------------


No members have joined or left. There are currently 14 subscribers to the

main mailing list. (1 up on last month)


Budget:

-------

The board approved our budget request of $50,000 which will be used for the
next 2 ApacheCon events and if requested and if available, any ASF supported
smaller events such as a retreat or bar camp, project hackathons etc.

Future Events:

--------------

ApacheCon EU is the next event TAC is supporting. Talk in under way in terms
of

creating a timeline of events leading up to ACEU 2015. The opening up of
applications should be soon but we need to plan this to try and line up with
CFP announcements.

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Matt Franklin (mfranklin@) has joined the Social Web Working Group.
The Foundation is already represented by Henry Story.

Henry Story (bblfish@) has joined the Social Interest Group, with the
Foundation signing up to the Interest Group as this is the first
representative.

Sergio Fernández (wikier@) has joined the Schema.org Community Group,
with the Foundation signing up to the Interest Group as this is the first

Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

JIRA issues continue to be tracked and closed as appropriate; special
thanks goes to Henri Yandell. Some discussions but nothing requiring
board attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

Quick stats for April:

1     Support question
18    Phishing/spam/proxy/attacks point to site "powered by Apache" or
      Confused user due to Android licenses

Vulnerability reports:

1     [httpd, via security@httpd]
1     [struts, via security@struts]
2     [cordova, via private@cordova]
1     [httpd, via security@httpd]
2     [site, via security@] server-status again rejected
1     [cordova, via security@]

It was noticed that Axis PMC have not responded to all the security
issues forwarded to them, and those that have were not correctly cc'd
to security@.  We would suggest the board remind Axis PMC of the
responsibility in handling external security vulnerability
notifications.

It was noticed that there was an issue with communication with Xerces
PMC, this was found to be partially due to the failure to moderate
messages to private@.  No board action required.

In the past month the Apache Tomcat project became aware of two
instances where embargoed Tomcat security vulnerability information
was accidentally published by Red Hat. After discussions with Red Hat,
the Tomcat team are confident that both publications had the same root
cause; that procedures have been put in place by Red Hat to prevent
similar errors occurring again; and that no further action is
required.

Apache Buildr is a Ruby-based build system for Java-based applications,
including support for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages
and tools.

We made one minor release (v1.4.22 on March 5th) since our last board report.

Development and community activity (mailing lists, bug reports, etc.)
remains relatively low. Our last committer/PMC change happened in
October 2013.

We have no issues that require board attention.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Cassandra Project  [Jonathan Ellis]

Cassandra is a distributed database providing massive scalability,
high performance, and high availability.

Releases:

2.0.15    29 Apr 2015
2.1.4     1 Apr 2015
2.0.14    1 Apr 2015
2.1.3     16 Mar 2015

Development:

A security issue was reported to Apache that Cassandra's default
configuration allowed arbitrary code to be executed remotely via JMX.
We followed Apache protocol and developed a fix as a PMC (led by Eric
Evans and Jake Luciani) resulting in the 2.0.14 and 2.1.4 releases
prior to the public announcement of the vulnerability [1].

With most of Cassandra 3.0 development complete, but with release
stalled by continuing difficulties in finishing CASSANDRA-8099 (a
rewrite of the storage engine around CQL principles rather than the
old Thrift API), we decided to release the-features-formerly-known-
as-3.0 as 2.2 as soon as possible, followed by a 3.0 release later
based on 8099.  I expect a vote to begin on 2.2 beta 1 by the time the
board meets.

Community:

We had our second annual Next Generation Cassandra Conference for
Cassandra developers.  (I.e., much smaller than a user-oriented
conference.)  We had just over 50 developers attend this year in
Austin in conjunction with ApacheCon.  Speakers included committers
and contributors from Apple, DataStax, Mesosphere, SVDS, and Vast.

Tokyo Cassandra Summit saw 500 registrations for the April event [2],
about double last year's.  This puts it about on par with our San
Francisco summit from 2011, although the two events are not directly
comparable.  (San Fransisco charged a fee to attendees, while Tokyo's
cost was borne entirely by sponsors, in large part because Tokyo was
able to find a sponsor willing to provide the venue for free.)

As you know, it is often difficult for Western open source projects to
gain traction in Japan (and vice versa) because of the language
barrier, so I am glad to see this growth.  One analyst who attended
commented to me that he found it notable that by his estimate, about
40% of the audience at the Tokyo Summit were businessmen, compared to
virtually none at the MongoDB event that he attended recently.  He
interpreted this to mean that Cassandra is more interesting to the
enterprise market that makes up so much of the Japanese industry.

Most recent committer and PMC changes:

Robert Stupp was added as committer on 15 Jan 2015.*
Aleksey Yeshchenko was added as PMC member on 7 Aug 2014.

*Sam Tunnicliffe has been voted in as committer, but has not submitted
 his ICLA as of this writing.  I expect that to be done by the time
 the board meets.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Alexander Broekhuis]

## Description:
OSGi framework implementation in C.

## Activity:
 - Discussion started for the next release. This will be a release without
APR dependency in the framework, which will be backwards incompatible
update.
- celix-bootstrap added to Apache Celix. celix-bootstrap is a project/code
generation tool which can be used to create new Apache Celix Bundle project
and initial code for bundles.
- Alexander Broekhuis & Pepijn Noltes presented "Modularizing C software
with Apache Celix" @ the Luminis devcon (Netherlands).

The activity for Apache Celix has been slow for the last months and we
expect this will increase for preparation of the next release.
Although for time to time activity on the Apache Celix mailing-lists can be
slow, we think this is natural for a small community; As long as there are
also burst of more active periods.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

Apache Cocoon 3 is a major rewrite of Cocoon 2.2. Like Cocoon 2 it is based
around the concept of pipelines and sitemaps and it is very similar to Cocoon
2.2 in many respects but is slimmed down and designed to be easily used with
Java code (= no frameworks required!). On top of this, Cocoon 3 has the goal
of becoming the best available platform for RESTful webservices and web
applications.

Issues needing board attention:
------------------------------
 None.

Community
----------
  Traffic on users and devs list had been very light this last quarter. Some
  users asked about different issues in the different versions of cocoon but
  no real discussion raised.
* Last committer: Cédric Damioli and Robby Pelssers - 2011/12/18
* Changes in the PMC membership: None. - Last modified: 2012/10/21 (change of
  PMC chair)


Releases
---------
  2.1 has been released on 2013/03/20.

Development
-----------
  None

Security issues reported
------------------------
  None.

Progress of the project
-----------------------
  none. We still need to release a new version of cocoon 3 and cocoon 2.2 but
  no committer is stepping up to do so.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich Stärk]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Report from the Apache Continuum Project  [Brent Atkinson]

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security, and
integration with popular build tools and source control management systems.

Activity

The increase in mailing list activity reported last period has settled back to
prior volumes. The spike in issue tracker and commit activity reported has
continued to be high with progress toward a 1.5 release, but contributions were
limited to an individual. The pending 1.4.3 vote reported last period failed due
to insufficient PMC votes.

Board Issues

 - There are no specific issues requiring board attention at this time

PMC/Committership changes

 - Currently 18 committers and 13 PMC members in the project.
 - No new changes to the PMC or committership since last report.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

Report from the Apache CouchDB project [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
   NoSQL document database using HTTP, JSON, and MapReduce

## Activity:
 - Massive uptake in marketing@ activity, specifically pertaining
   the framing of “The CouchDB Story”, i.e. how we communicate what
   we do to the world.
 - Switched website to git deploy, seeing immediate uptake in
   website contributions.
 - Ongoing effort to get over the last humps for our major 2.0
   release.
 - Accepted the Nano project (a Node.js library for CouchDB) into
   Apache CouchDB. This took a while because IP-clearance for a
   GitHub project is, well, interesting.
 - CouchDB will participage in the Google Summer of Code with at
   least one project.
 - Community vote for a new project logo. The PMC is now working
   with the most favoured designers for a final selection.
 - (Not necessarily Board Report material, but still a big dael,
   so I am going to include it: CouchDB made the ThoughtWorks
   Technology Radar: http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques
   in the “Offline First” category \o/)
 - Finally, I’d like to voice my appreciation for the new board
   report tool. Thank you all who made this happen!

-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Gerhard Petracek]

Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
(Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
which are missing in the CDI core spec.

DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like
Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly,
Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also on
simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

Community
---------
* New Committers
  ** Ron Smeral (April 2015)
* New PMC Members
  ** Rafael Benevides (April 2015)

We receive contributions from the community on a regular basis.

Our annual PMC-chair rotation vote passed.
Thomas Andraschko got voted in as new DeltaSpike PMC Chair
taking over from Gerhard Petracek.

Releases
--------
* DeltaSpike 1.3.0 (4/March/15)

Attachment T: Report from the Apache DeviceMap Project  [Reza Naghibi]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Devicemap is a data repository containing devices attributes, and their
related browsers, and operating systems. The project also maintains an api
to classify these attributes.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* Working on 1.0.3 data release. Plan on releasing it this month.
* Planning continues on 2.0. The data spec is pretty much done. The next step
  would be creating a test specification and reference client. After that,
  data can be migrated to the 2.0 format and official clients can be created
  using the spec, the test spec, and reference client as a guide.

RELEASES

* DeviceMap Data 1.0.2 was released on February 13th, 2015.
* DeviceMap Java Client 1.2.0 was released on December 22nd 2014.

COMMUNITY

* Volkan Yazici was added as DeviceMap committer in April 2015.

ISSUES

* There are still lingering issues between PMC members. Since I am involved,
  I will try and report on them as unbiased as possible. The issue seems to
  be rooted in how the project moves forward with multiple independent client
  codebases. I personally was tired of the constant disagreement and even
  floated my resignation on the dev list. I got many responses encouraging me
  to stick with the project and Bertrand made some recommendations to help
  with the disagreements. We all came to agreement that a better partition
  in the SVN repo would help seperate the clients and how they move forward.
  The hope is that members are more free to work on and move different pieces
  of this project forward without the large inter-dependencies which were
  present in the OpenDDR data and client.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache DirectMemory Project  [Raffaele P. Guidi]

Apache DirectMemory is an off-heap cache implementation for the JVM

* General Information
Development and mailing lists traffic are mostly quiet. I think that, more
than a real report, the project needs some real activity

* Issues
The project is not seeing any active contribution nor any real world usage

* Committers or PMC members change
Last added PMC PMC member was Noctarius (Cristoph Engelbert) on 2013-09-25

* Releases
Release 0.2 has seen the light on 2013-09-17

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Drill Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:
   A distributed SQL MPP for Hadoop and NoSQL

## Activity:
 - The community is very active, driving towards a 1.0 release.  The last two
   releases have driven additional engagement on the user mailing list.  While

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Francis De Brabandere]

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development
than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient
database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety
and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

We switched from svn to git as we heard from other projects that it lowers
the barrier for sending patches. Further we got a really useful patch
submitted by a community member that we are currently integrating. A release
should be following soon.

Changes in committers or PMC members

There have been no changes in committers or PMC members during the last
months.

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

Releases

No releases since last report.
Latest release was Apache-Empire-db 2.4.3 released on 20/Aug/2014.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

  There was minor activity on the dev mail list.
  Late in the previous quarter, one PMC member started a dev discussion about
  contributing a new Bootstrap-based skin. As a PMC member, i assisted to
  move that discussion along and tried again late in this quarter. Going by
  the response to my draft report, we should see some action during the next
  quarter.

  During the previous quarter, as the Chair, i reminded the dev list that the
  project needs to make releases. During this quarter in late-April, i did
  follow-up as a PMC member to try to move that along. There was no comment.

  As Chair, in late-April i asked the private list to each do our bit to
  attend to the main community-health issues: having a recent release,
  increasing the committer/PMC base, and being a little active. There was no
  comment, but some murmurs in response to my draft report.

  At this report, three PMC members were present during the quarter and
  four other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
 Activity: Low
  3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  Improved the "upgrading" notes to remind to keep any optional configuration
  files synchronised with the default.

  Updated our Description of a Project (DOAP) file, to rectify Forrest being
  missing from the projects-new.a.o site.

  In the previous quarter, Infra advised us that the machine hosting the
  Forrest project's build and demo server is being decommissioned. One of
  our PMC members asked for a new VM via the issue INFRA-9093 (FOR-1251).
  During this quarter, Infra made a little progress by asking us what
  packages we need to support that. Two PMC members responded.

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

Incubator PMC report for May 2015

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

Things have been going well in incubator lately with no major problems
to highlight. The last member election added a large number of new
members and several of these have taken the opportunity to join the
IPMC. A (good) challenge for the Incubator will be to make sure that
these people feel welcome and make contributions by shepherding and
mentoring.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

    Amareshwari Sriramadasu
    David Lester
    Kim Whitehall
    P. Taylor Goetz
    Michael Joyce
    Jitendra Pandey

* New Podlings

    Geode

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

    Parquet

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

    2015-04-02 apache-ignite-1.0.0
    2015-04-02 apahce-johnzon-0.7
    2015-04-15 apache-parquet-mr-1.6.0
    2015-04-16 apache-calcite-1.2.0
    2015-04-25 apache-streams-project-0.2
    2015-04-27 apache-tinkerpop-3.0.0.M8-incubating

* IP Clearance

  Apache Storm Azure Eventhub Integration
  Donation of Apache Flex documentation by Adobe
  Donation of Apache Usergrid source code by Apigee.

* Legal / Trademarks



* Infrastructure

  The "Marvin" report reminders fired in a timely manner for the first
  time in several months and were sent to the proper podlings.  A
  replacement script had been contemplated but now that there is less
  urgency it seems likely that we will continue to use the existing
  facilities. The only problem was that the script worked against an
  old board report. This issue has reportedly been fixed as well.

--------------------
CommonsRDF

Commons RDF is a set of interfaces and classes for RDF 1.1 concepts and
behaviours.  The commons-rdf-api module defines interfaces and testing
harness.  The commons-rdf-simple module provides a basic reference
implementation to exercise the test harness and clarify API contracts.

CommonsRDF has been incubating since 2015-03-06.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the CommonsRDF Community such that we can progress
     towards graduation
  2. Further engage the podling with the nuances of the Apache
     Incubation process
  3. Drive towards the first incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Peter Ansell resigned from the PPMC, but remains affiliated with the
  project.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Development and coding practices agreed.
  Newcomers are joining discussions, adding feature requests.

  Mailing list subscribers numbers were not included in last report. Numbers
  for April 2015:

  dev@      ======> 16 subscribers, 333 messages
  commits@  ======> 9 subscribers, 248 messages

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There has been a bunch of development activity going on at CommonsRDF with
  over 200 dev@ messages in March and 300 in April.  Website and
  documentation established at http://commonsrdf.incubator.apache.org.  All
  project communication and development has been migrated to Apache
  Infrastructure.  The project has been introduced to the W3C Data on the
  Web Best Practices Working Group to increase the community.  There is also
  an ongoing thread relating to the first project incubating release with a
  release candidate currently being voted on.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Chris Mattmann:

      Peter Ansell's resignation from the IPMC isn't related to this project,
      right?

  Rob Vesse:

      Peter Ansell's resignation was due to frustrations at the speed of
      progress particularly around some technical discussions that he had felt
      had previously been resolved prior to this project entering the
      Incubator and so he has chosen to focus his efforts on other projects.
      The project does seem to now have resolved those issues and has been
      able to move forward with a first release candidate.

  John Ament:

    Peter Ansell resigned from the PPMC/Podling, not the IPMC.

--------------------
Droids

Droids aims to be an intelligent standalone robot framework that allows to
create and extend existing droids (robots).

Droids has been incubating since 2008-10-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Activity
  2. Name Search

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

  Name search needs to be concluded. Availability looks better this quarter
  for completing that task.

Groovy

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

Groovy has been incubating since 2015-03-24

The most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We still have to get our new release process ready for making our first
     release under the incubator banner
  2. We need to continue encouraging our users to use our new resources at
     Apache instead of using the old ones at Codehaus (in particular
     mailing-lists which are still running at Codehaus)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We noticed some issues with JIRA rights that we brought to the attention
  to our mentors.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  With the JIRA creation and the mirroring on Github, the project received
  new tickets and also code contributions through pull requests.
  So the the community has followed the project at Apache, and has managed
  to move to using our new resources there, and new users contributing.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report, the JIRA issue tracker has been created and
  Codehaus JIRA issues have been moved in.  We also got a "notifications"
  mailing-list created for JIRA notification emails.  The Git repository has
  also been created and the code was imported in Apache's Git, and mirrored
  on Github.

Date of last release:

  Not yet released under the Apache incubation umbrella.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No new election.

Kylin

Kylin is a distributed and scalable OLAP engine built on Hadoop to support
extremely large datasets.

Kylin has been incubating since 2014-11-25.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make the first release from apache, it's in progress now, status
     tracking under: KYLIN-669
  2. Grow user and contributor base, increase the number of active
     committers
  3. Add more documentation to support new users and contributors.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * Nothing

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Kylin joined Spark Meetup Bay Area on March 23 to discussed "Adding

libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which build into an
advanced enterprise mail server.

ISSUES

There are no issue requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASES

No new release (last release done on 19 March 2013).

OVERALL ACTIVITY

We have seen interest from  contributors and have committed patches
for the different server sub-projects (protocols, mailbox...) related to
build optimization, test fixes and ACL (Access Control List) implementation.

We are also discussing on a way to integrate Pull Requests coming from Github.

Once we will reach stability on test, build and ACL, we will release the
various projects one by one (updating the DOAP file).

We monitor the newcomers to ensure they have the needed level to invite them
as committter.

We are still looking on a way to handle vulnerability VU#988628 (not yet made
public). The vulnerability is identified on James 2 which is not the current
target (we concentrate our  limited resources on the upcoming James 3).

COMMUNITY

No new committer (Last committer was voted on 30 of Nov 2013).

No new PMC member (Last PMC member was voted on 17 Jul 2012).

TRADEMARKS / BRANDING

Still to do:
Logos and Graphics (include TM, use consistent product logo on web site).

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

ManifoldCF PMC Chair: Karl Wright (kwright@apache.org)
Date: May 2015

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been ten major releases, including a 1.8 and 2.0 release on
December 26, 2014, and two corresponding pairs of point releases on February 3,
2015 and March 2, 2015.  The next major release is scheduled for April 30, 2015.
A pair of release candidates (1.9 and 2.1) are now up for voting in the
community.

ManifoldCF is still in the position of supporting both a legacy set of releases
(1.x), and a non-backwards-compatible set of releases (2.x).  We plan to
continue this dual support for a period of roughly one year, that is until
roughly December 2015.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Kishore Kumar on April 28, 2015.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has been less active than at its peak a couple of quarters ago,
but still robust.  Most of our connectors now have significant use cases and
constituencies.  Dev list comments for this period centered around the
ManifoldCF 2.0.2 and 1.8.2 point releases, and the fact that there is no
official upgrade path between the 1.x series and 2.x series of releases.
This seems to be a concept that users are finding hard to grasp for
some reason.  I am unaware of any mailing-list question that has gone
unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

Release upload to the dist.apache.org svn repository is quite slow, and takes
well over an hour for a single ManifoldCF release candidate.  We raised this
issue with Infra originally by posting to the Infra list, but did not manage to
resolve it.  The problem was originally noted in uploads to people.apache.org.
We were told to migrate to svn for release candidate availability, which we did,
only to find that it was no faster than uploading to people.apache.org.  I
finally raised a specific ticket - INFRA-9519 - when it became clear that no
progress had been made.  There has been no progress on or acknowledgement of
this ticket at the time of this report.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We submitted ManifoldCF to the trademark
registration service and received word that our trademark application is now
pending.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012 and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.

We have again two students for GSoC 2015:
* "RDF HDT implementation for Sesame RIO" (MARMOTTA-593), by Junyue
  Wang, and
* "Proposal to Implement GeoSPARQL in Marmotta" (MARMOTTA-584), by
  Francisco Xavier Sumba Toral.

The last quarter has been relatively quiet on the lists, and also the codebase
did not change a lot.

Community building is becoming an issue for Marmotta: Soon two years will have
passed since we last elected a new committer. The PMC is aware of this and is
actively looking for candidates.

Subscribers to the projects mailing list:

  begun, incorporating some major SASL related changes since 0.9. Work
  also continues on expanding language support for the new Reactor API's
  to Go, C++, Ruby, and Java, some of which may be aimed at the following
  release.

- Following the Qpid 0.32 release there was intent to reorganise the
  repository structure to better support releasing the various components
  on their own schedules going forward, as has been the case for newer
  components. The Java broker, earlier clients and associated items have
  been relocated to a new trunk, with further relocations still to come
  for other components.

# Issues:

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache River Project  [Patricia Shanahan]

Apache River is a Java-based Service Oriented Architecture, implementing the
Jini Specification and Jini Technology Starter Kit.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD

There are no board-level issues at this time

RELEASES

Apache River 2.2.2 was released on November 18, 2013 Apache River 2.2.1 was
released on May 2, 2013.

COMMUNITY

The last change in the PMC was in June 2014, when Patricia Shanahan returned
from emeritus to active status as a committer and PMC member.

There is a concern about slow progress because many of the committers and PMC
members have limited time. Recruiting new committers is hindered by the need
for a better initial experience.

ACTIVITY

There is on-going development in the following areas:

* Improved examples - important for community building by providing a good
initial experience for new users and developers.

* Update code for Java 8.

* Usability

* Security issues associated with Java Serialization.

Our major push at this time is to get these developments out to our users by
preparing an Apache River 3.0 release. We have agreed to replace sun.com.jini
and com.artima package names with org.apache.river names in this release. We
have also agreed on the base branch for the new release.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Adam Estrada]

Apache SIS is a spatial framework that enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

Development:
Some of the simplest map projections have been ported to SIS [1]. This
gives us a base for testing the general framework (e.g. WKT and GML)
before to continue porting more map projections.

Well Known Text (WKT) [2] (a.k.a. ISO 19162) support is under development:

Formatting is almost done.

Port of the parser code is expected to start soon.

Geographic Markup Language (GML) support for Projected Coordinate
Reference Systems is under development.

Community:
VOTE has been passed but not formally accepted by board@ for Martin
Desruisseaux to become the new SIS VP. Adam E., Charitha M, Joe W,
Chris M and Olivier N have all +1'd the VOTE.

Apache Tika now uses SIS for parsing ISO 19139 files (geospatial metadata)
[3].

Apache Lucene created a Geo3D package for searching geospatial
information [4] but does not yet use SIS. That Geo3D package is
designed for Lucene specific needs and is mostly about geometries. SIS
is not yet ready to support a geometry module because it depends on
“referencing by coordinates”, which is still a work in progress, and
because the international standard for geometries (ISO 19107) is under
revision. However we plan to see if some Geo3D functionalities can be
moved to SIS when we will be ready to start geometry work.

The next Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) meeting will take place in
Boulder (Colorado) in June 1st to 5th [5]. Discussion about geospatial
API is expected to continue there.

We have been contacted by Andrew Ross (director of ecosystem
development of the Eclipse Foundation) about an issue they are also
facing. We have not yet resolved whether Apache or Eclipse could
distribute the EPSG database together with their software [6]. We do
not know yet if some action could be taken in common.

Branding:
None

Issues:
SIS implements the GeoAPI 3.0 interfaces, which is an OGC standard [7]
deployed on Maven Central. OGC owns the “opengis.org” internet domain
name and defines the GeoAPI 3.0 interfaces in “org.opengis” packages.
However a few external projects (not from Apache or OGC) use their own
fork of GeoAPI interfaces without changing the “org.opengis” package
names to something else, for historical reasons. This cause
incompatibility problems for users who want to use Apache SIS (or any
other GeoAPI 3.0 compliant implementation) together with those
projects [8]. Some of those projects are considering to deploy their
software on Maven Central. Is there any verification mechanisms in
Nexus for making sure that JAR files deployed on Maven Central do not
contain classes in packages owned by another community? In this
particular case, is there a way to ensure that only the owner of
“org.opengis” groupId can deploy on Maven Central JAR files containing
classes in the “org.opengis” packages?

Releases:
SIS 0.5 has been released in February.

Press:
None

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  A small hackathon/gathering occurred during the ApacheCon US in
  Austin. Some work was completed, but it was not as well-orgniazed as
  past hackathons. There are another couple possibilities in the near
  future. The community tends to gather at hackathons once or twice
  per year.

  Subscribership across our mailing lists is down about 1% this
  quarter, but activity is up about 20%.

  The project has 43 PMC members and 79 committers (in varying
  capacities). We are one of the few PMCs with Universal Commit.
  Our last PMC addition was Mar 2014, and committer in Sep 2014.
  As a mature project, new faces in our community are rare, but we
  continue to work to include people as they arrive.

* Releases

  Since our last report in Feb, we released 1.7.20 and 1.8.13 in March
  to (primarily) fix some security issues. (1.8.12 was skipped)

  On May 11, we posted our first 1.9.0 release candidate (1.9.0-rc1).
  Based on past experience, the actual release should drop in the next
  month or two.

== XML GRAPHICS COMMONS ==
2 commits to SVN this quarter. 1 bug fix, and a new feature to add support
for PDF/VT generation.

There were no releases this quarter

The latest release is 2.0 (3 October 2014)

== FOP ==
18 separate commits to SVN. These are mostly bug fixes (including a couple
of patches from the community); but also includes support for PDF/VT and
PDF Linearization. Now that the Batik and commons releases have been
completed we're in a position to start a FOP release. This was recently
agreed on the developers mailing list. The PDF Plug-in sub project will
not be released yet since this still depends on a snapshot of PDFBox. Once
PDFBox v2.0 is released we'll release PDF plug-in. The PMC agreed on this
course of action since the PDF Plug-in is an optional module used only by
a small number of users.

The FOP User list has a slow but steady stream of questions being raised
and answered; 77 e-mails in total.

There were no releases this quarter

The latest release is 1.1 (20 October 2012)

== BATIK ==
18 separate commits to SVN. This breaks down into refactoring to resolve
the cyclic dependencies between components, and some bug fixing in
preparation for the release. We decided to do the release after the Complex
Script work has been put on hold for a while, and we received notification
of a security vulnerability. This security vulnerability was reported
1/23/2015 according to ASF Security guidelines. The issue was resolved via
a PATCH being developed and deployed as a general Release. The Eclipse
project has also requested that the fix for security vulnerability be back
ported to 1.6 and 1.7 versions. Thanks to Luis Bernardo for volunteering to
apply the patch to both branches and to prepare the releases. The mailing
lists are fairly quiet, with only 19 e-mails to the users list this
quarter.

Batik v1.8 was released on 17th March

The latest version is 1.8 (17 March 2015)
