 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Encouragingly this month we have received the most reports that we
       have in recent months, with just a handful not submitted. This helps
       reduce the effort of shepherds and the knock on effect of extra
       reports in the next month.

    B. President [Ross]

       First of all, my apologies for the late submission of my report this
       month. It's been a busy time.

       My Travel
       ======== 

       Due to changes in my Visa arrangements I am currently unable to travel
       freely. This is a short term issue but as I regularly travel and
       always seek to represent the ASF wherever I go it is causing some
       issues that I need to address.

       Firstly, I may not be able to attend ApacheCon EU. Shane will be
       present for Big Data and will present State of the Feather if I am not
       present. Bertrand will be at Core and will be able to present it
       there.

       I am due to provide a keynote address as ASF Prez in Korea in October.
       I need a replacement. I am also due to meet a potential sponsor on
       this trip, this could be delayed but if someone can replace me that
       would be great. Expenses for this are covered.

       I am due to provide a keynote at an Apache Roadshow event in China,
       also in October, though I am still awaiting final confirmation of this
       event. At the time of writing I have not arranged any sponsor meetings
       but there are two potential sponsors that we should line up if someone
       is able to replace me. Expenses for this are covered.

       Note, the Korea and China events are back to back if someone fancies a
       little Asian tour. But two separate speakers is also fine.

       Finally I have been invited to keynote at a high level China event in
       November. I have not yet accepted this invitation.

       Anyone interested should contact me to discuss.

       Executive Assistant
       ===============

       Melissa has been focusing on TAC this month. Everything is ready to go
       despite the very tight timeframes. Other activities have included the
       usual support of various VPs though there has been minimal time for
       proactive help this month.

       A laptop, keyboard, mouse and monitor was purchased from the Prez
       discretionary budget. The total package came in well under the budget
       cap I set last month.

       Brand Management
       ===============

       Three projects (Mesos, Tomcat and Spark) have all requested
       registrations that are not covered in the boards approved budget (i.e.
       they include non-US registrations). I've asked Shane to provide
       concrete argument to support these specific requests, and Shane is
       working with the appropriate PMCs. Once I have received that argument
       I will submit each to the board alongside my recommendation and any
       adjustment to budget that this might require,

       Shane is also addressing a new policy question that has emerged
       relating to downstream redistribution of our project code. He is also
       handling the usual requests as per policy.

       Fundraising
       =========

       Prompted by last months report from Virtual that fundraising was
       significantly behind budget predictions I asked Virtual to provide an
       accurate record of when sponsorships were paid and when they are due
       for renewal. This will allow next years budget to be based on actual
       numbers rather than an averaged income across 12 months as has been
       the case in previous years. This will make it much easier to evaluate
       actual vs budgeted income. Melissa and Hadrian are now working from
       this data and ensuring that their CMS records align with the financial
       data. Furthermore Hadrian has been working with Virtual to ensure that
       they assist in identifying any late renewals. 

       It seems that each month Fundraising announces a new sponsor and this
       month is no exception - welcome to PrivateInternetAccess as a new
       Silver sponsor.

       A renewing sponsor asked if their sponsorship could be directed to a
       specific project. Hadrian interpreted the email in the same way that I
       did, it was a question not a request. Hadrian indicated that we do not
       currently accept directed sponsorships but has offered to discuss this
       further if the sponsor requires. Hadrian and I reviewed the directed
       sponsorship terms at LinuxCon recently and I believe he and I are
       roughly on the same page with respect to what is/is not possible.

       Finally, Hadrian has indicated that in he plans to indicate which
       sponsors have renewed and are due to renew in future board reports. I
       agree this is useful but I have requested that the information be
       marked private so that sponsor names will not appear in the published
       minutes in case any sponsors choose not to renew.

       Marketing and Publicity
       ==================

       Sally continues to work on proposals for a logo redesign and was
       scheduled to review proposals on Sept 14th (too late for this report
       despite being before the meeting itself).

       An item arose in the last couple of days and is thus not included
       Sally's report but I want to raise it for visibility. An analyst firm
       has published a report that claims a well known company had discussion
       with the ASF about IP management. At the time of writing I have not
       read the article and it may be harmless. However, based on comments
       sent to press@ it appears that they may have some inaccurate
       information that may or may not be problematic. Greg has offered to
       work with the author and Jim, as VP Legal, is aware of the discussion.
       I have been given a trial subscription so that I can retrieve and
       share a copy.

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       HEADLINE: Infrastructure Investments in architecture and configuration
       management pay off

       A loss of an LDAP server this month resulted in a number of services
       being useless. Monitoring and alerting worked as expected. Thanks to
       robust configuration management for LDAP a new host was provisioned
       and configured within 12 minutes. Astounding!

       To quote David as VP Infrastructure "A 12 minute Mean-Time-to-Recovery
       is a stunning statistic."

       Round of applause for the Infra team please....

       We had what the team believe to be a DDoS attack against our download
       CGI scripts this month. It took around 12 hours to fully address.
       Thank you to the team for their hard work on this.

       New work this month has focused on monitoring. The centralized logging
       facility is now in production, bringing lots of visibility into what
       is really going on. An immediate result of this is the identification
       of abuse of our systems and a resulting "blocky" service which
       automatically blocks abusive IP numbers identified in the centralized
       logs. Results have been immediate and significant, for example a 30%
       reduction in one servers bandwidth.

       The Mail (Phase 2) project hit a snag. In short the PoC looked
       promising but it became clear it would not scale to our mail load. The
       infra team have a plan, but it does present some risk. This is likely
       to delay progress but it is better to see and address such problems
       during the PoC stage.

       Finally all SLAs were met this month and the graphs continue to show
       improvements: http://status.apache.org/sla/

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ======================

       Once again there is no report from TAC. I have spoken with Gavin as VP
       TAC and we have a plan to resolve this situation after ApacheCon. As
       usual I do have good insight into what is happening on TAC thanks to
       Melissa's oversight.

       An applicant raised a concern about being expected to perform certain
       actions (such as introducing speakers) at the event. This requirement
       was indicated in the original materials sent to potential applicants,
       however it seems that this was not clear enough. In this case the
       concern expressed related to a justifiable worry about not being able
       to perform the actions in a satisfactory way due to circumstances
       beyond the individuals control. The applicant offered to withdraw
       their application. However, I reassured the individual that we will
       make appropriate arrangements should problems arise and that they
       should still accept TAC assistance.

       Daniel Gruno will be present in Budapest to help Gavin organize TAC
       recipients at the event, as will the ever present Melissa.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        After changing the paypal buttons to reflect a donation, chargebacks
        are believed to have been completely nullified. The Treasurer’s
        Office does not anticipate any further changes at this time.
        
        An extension for the 990 was filed before the Sept 15th deadline.
        
        Coordination with Jim and audit@a.o has begun concerning if an audit
        for 2015 will be done. The Treasurer’s Office is ready to support
        the audit in full capacity. D&O Insurance was renewed.
        
        Apache received a $150+ donation from AmazonSmiles.  The Treasurer’s
        Office suggests considering augmenting our promotion of the link
        for this type of donation.

       Closing the Wells Fargo account is in process and should be
       complete next month.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Thanks to some new tooling in Whimsy created by Sam, Secretary is
       reviewing and synchronizing icla.txt Public Names and LDAP Full Names.
       Most of the several dozen mismatches have been resolved. Once the
       remaining issues are taken care of, we will work on a process for
       people to request a change in their Public Name and LDAP Full Name. 

       During the process of synchronizing these names, a number of anomalies
       in the records were discovered, such as missing ICLAs, non-standard
       file names for signatures, and wrong names in iclas.txt.  Sebb has
       contributed a number of improvements in this area. Others are also
       being worked on.

       In August, 84 iclas, five cclas, and four grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       We are less than a month away from ApacheCon EU. The attendance
       numbers are very disappointing, and surely not helped by the refugee
       situation. Angela is requesting that we do all we can to promote
       attendance on our end, and we're doing what we can.

       ApacheCon North America is already being promoted at
       http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apache-big-data-north-america
       and at
       http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-core-north-america
       but we have not yet done any promotion of the event(s). The CFP, also,
       has not yet been promoted. We will start doing that in earnest in
       October, and attempt to get more coverage of this event than we
       managed to do for EU.

       Discussion has started about having a presence at FOSDEM to promote
       the ASF, and encourage a new generation of university students to
       participate in ASF projects. Details have yet to be determined, as the
       call for participation in FOSDEM has not yet gone out. Daniel Gruno
       has volunteered to head up that effort, and will be supported by
       Melissa and myself in making that happen. OpenOffice has long had a
       presence there, but we wish to expand that to a larger ASF presence.

       We (President, EA, VP Marketing, and myself) have also discussed our
       presence at OSCon, and determined that it's 1) not really the audience
       we want to be reaching and 2) was in particular not worth the
       considerable cost and effort this year. We will therefore not be
       participating in OSCon Europe, and unless someone steps up with a
       strong case and volunteer effort to make it happen, we'll not be
       participating in OSCon in Austin next year.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

ApacheCon and TAC:
•	All flights booked
•	Rooming assignments done and wire transfer requested
•	Registrations done
•	Giveaways ordered
•	Booth logistics sorted
•	Lodging and registration sorted for Daniel Gruno, our TAC OTG
(on-the-ground) helper
•	TAC Welcome Dinner and subsistence money being paid by Daniel; he will
submit for reimbursement afterwards


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Operations proceeding normally.

The Mesos, Tomcat, and Spark projects have requested registrations both in the
US as well as internationally, including Europe and other jurisdictions.
Working with the PMCs to provide a justification to the board for the
registration fees, which are not able to be covered under the existing brand
budget.

Various PMC members requested clarifications as to how Apache marks should be
handled in various common software distribution or install channels, like
linux package managers and the like.

The Mesos project noted concern over several US registrations that will cause
problems for their requested application.

Registration application of HADOOP in India was provisionally denied; however
counsel believes we can overcome the issues at very minor cost and have the
registration granted.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Fundraising activities are continuing normally. Google is in the process of
renewing and we got a new Silver sponsor (PrivateInternetAcess). 

The accounting@ team provided a report of sponsorship records from an
accounting perspective and we are reconciling them with our CRM records. We
also agreed with accounting@ to get a semimonthly report out outstanding
payments.

I think it will be useful to include the report the number of sponsors that
renewed in the past cycles and those due to renew in the next. I will start
adding them with the next report, to make things easier to track.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Operations Action Items:
========================


Short Term Priorities:
======================
DDOS
-----
We experienced what we believe to be a DDoS attacking the mirror 
redirection CGI script this month. This drove our 15 minute load 
average to 2700+ We ended up using a much more efficient redirection
script, and redirecting all queries to the old one to the new to
resolve the issue, and it took us around 12 hours to mitigate the 
attack. 


LDAP 
----
During the reporting period we lost an LDAP server inadvertently, and
this caused a number of services to cease being useful. However, our 
alerting detected the problem in a timely manner, and thanks to our
resilient architecture and configuration management, we were able to 
provision a new host and have it working again within 12 minutes. A 
12 minute Mean-Time-to-Recovery is a stunning statistic. 



Long Range Priorities:
======================
Automation
----------
See the monitoring section for details on how we've automated the 
blocking of abusive traffic. 

Resilience
-----------
We didn't add much in the way of resilience, but we have a great 
example of how our resilience allowed us to quickly recover from 
a failure. See the short term section above. 

Technical Debt
---------------
See details of mail in the General Activity section

Monitoring
-----------
This month a lot of investment in monitoring over the past quarter has come 
to fruition. 

First - we have finally promoted centralized logging into production. This has
given us tremendous additional insight thanks to the visualization and query
tools that are now available. 

We did run into some scaling issues with the 'preferred logging tool' and were
able to move to a very simple python-based log-ingester, that works on both our
new puppet-managed machines as well as our legacy machines. 

Once we had data in place, and ability to run analysis on the fly,  we
immediately saw a number of situations where our services were being abused.
Eventually, we determined that we could programmatically deal with a number of
these issues, across all of our machines. To that end, we've now deployed a
tool called blocky that, based on input from our logging system automatically
blocks IP addresses across our entire infrastructure. We have a catalog of how
blocking this abusive behavior has dramatically reduced bandwidth usage, in
one case 30% of a server's total bandwidth was caused by abuse. 

In addition to the technical benefits, we can also provide insight to projects
and fundraising for how much traffic is visiting our web properties, or even a
specific project's site, and where that traffic is coming from and what they
are doing most often. 

General Activity:
=================

Mail Phase 2
-------------

Mail has been interesting, we went from a very promising POC, to realizing at 
least one component would likely not be able to scale to match our historical
load, much less be able to scale to the future. In general, while we don't 
currently see any blockers, we are hearing of troubling experiences from 
others. 

In response to that, we've developed a prototype of a replacement called
Ponymail.  It can certainly handle the load. Our plan is to move this software
to the ASF, and ensure that it can develope a community around it. We've
already called attention to it with some similar organizations who are going
through mailman3 POCs.  We will not adopt this software if a community of
folks other than ASF Infra who cares and helps to develop this software. We
want to make sure we aren't replacing an aging system with additional
technical debt that will come back to haunt us in 5-7 years. 


Uptime Statistics:

We met this months service level expectations

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Andy Seaborne (andy@) has joined the "RDF Test Suite Curation Community
Group".  This is the first member of the group for ASF, so the foundation
agrees to the standard community group conditions.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

A formal ASF Release Policy has been drafted; it is in the process of being
reviewed. In addition, clarification on the ASF's non-release licensing
policy has also been discussed and clarified on the legal-discuss@
mailing list.

JIRA tickets continue to be closed.

Our legal council was engaged to help us with drafting a set of
emails; the pertinent matter has since been closed.

No issues requiring board attention.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

## Description:
   Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command
   line tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web
   documents.

## Activity:
 - Project activity has primarily revolved around the GSoC project which
   involved implementation of Microformats2 within Any23. We are very close to
   merging this work into Any23 master branch. We will nearly be ready for a
   1.2 release once this has been committed.

## Health report:
 - Any23 is a small and reasonably quiet community. We would hope that our
   GSoC student will continue to contribute to the project but will also be
   reaching out to the Microformats community again very soon to introduce the
   availability of Microformats2 support within Any23. Mailing list activity
   is typical for Any23.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:

 - Currently 13 committers and 13 LDAP committee group members.
 - No new LDAP committee group members added in the last 3 months
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Stephane Corlosquet at Mon Aug 18 2014

## Releases:

 - Last release was 1.1 on Tue Oct 28 2014

## Mailing list activity:

 - dev@any23.apache.org:
    - 32 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months):
    - 116 emails sent to list (216 in previous quarter)

 - user@any23.apache.org:
    - 42 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 3 emails sent to list (15 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:

 - 0 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 2 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Report from the Apache APR Project  [Jeff Trawick]

## Description: 

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
  software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
  to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
  which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
  the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
  since 2007.

## Activity: 
 - Commits have been low, as is typical in a quarter with no release-
   related activity.
 - Mailing list activity has also been low aside from a discussion about
   future APR 2.0, which has had major structural changes implemented
   (consolidation of APR and APR-util) for a number of years but which
   thus far has not had the developer support to push it towards a release.
 - Six bugs were opened during the reporting period, and only one bug had
   any followup (closure or discussion).

## Health report: 
 - This is a mature project, and most of its development activity is
   driven by the needs of the same small number of applications that have
   used it for many years.  The project members are more than able to
   meet the requirements that arise from that use.
 - The needs of the small number of other users are not met very well;
   bug reports languish and mailing list posters may not receive timely
   responses.  The amount of help provided is probably not sufficient
   to serve as encouragement to potential new users of APR.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## LDAP committee group/Committership changes: 
   
 - Currently 65 committers and 39 LDAP committee group members. 
 - No new LDAP committee group members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last LDAP committee group addition was Yann Ylavic at Wed May 13 2015 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Christophe Jaillet at Sat Mar 14 2015 
   
## Releases: 

 - No releases in this quarter
 - APR 1.5.2, released April 29, 2015
 - APR-util 1.5.4, released September 22, 2014
 - APR-iconv 1.2.1, released November 26, 2007
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - dev@apr.apache.org:  
    - 360 subscribers (up 3 in the last 3 months):

Attachment E: Report from the Apache Aurora Project  [Bill Farner]

## Description:

Apache Aurora lets you use an Apache Mesos cluster as a private cloud. It
supports running long-running services, cron jobs, and ad-hoc jobs.
   
## Activity: 
 - Release planning underway (0.10.0)
 - Major effort recently for official installable packages (RPMs and debs)
   - released of debs for 0.9.0, close to release of RPMs
   - preparing infrastructure for nightly packages

## Health report:
 There has been healthy development on Aurora for this period, though we hope to
 see more growth in adoption, contributions, and committers.  There has been
 significant effort to make alternatives to Aurora (e.g. Kubernetes, Marathon)
 easy to install and use, and Aurora is relatively more complicated to evaluate.
 Packaging and better introductory documentation will our focus to address this.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Andrew Purtell]

Apache Bigtop is software for integration, packaging, deployment, and
validation of Apache big data ecosystem components.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASES

The last release was version 1.0.0, released on August 10, 2015. 

ACTIVITY

The project recently reached a very important milestone with the 1.0.0
release. The release completes a reboot of our build and CI
infrastructure now hosted on several EC2 cloud instances. All costs of
these instances are defrayed by a generous grant of these resources
from Amazon.

We have just kicked off a new initiative, BigTop Data Generators, an effort
to extract and clean up our data generator code into a set of generally
usable libraries for building data generators. Our vision is for all of
Apache to come to Bigtop for tools for building better, more comprehensive
data generators and blueprints for scale system simulations. We note that
Ubuntu and Kubernetes are already using the Bigtop Docker images of our pet
store data generators for testing.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Camel Project  [Christian Mueller]

Apache Camel is a powerful open source integration framework based on known
Enterprise Integration Patterns.

Project Status
--------------
* There are no issues that require the board attention.
* The project is healthy, active and stays at a high level.

Community
---------
* The current PMC chair would like to resign and we are discussing who could
  take over this role.
* On 15th July one of our PMC discovered a trademark issue, a GitHub project
  called camel-labs. Unfortunately, some of the Camel PMC's was involved in this
  project. On 31nd July the project was renamed and the issues was solved.
* We got 1 new contributors who signed the ICLA.
* The community stays at a high level (328 subscribers at dev@; 873
  subscribers at users@)
* The community is active and questions being answered in short term.
 * Avg. 355 mails per month on the users mailing list in June 2015 -
   August 2015
 * Avg. 116 mails per month on the dev mailing list in June 2015 -
   August 2015
 * Avg. 282 commits per month in June 2015 - August 2015

Community Objectives
--------------------
 * The camel-extra project [1] is now read-only. The people didn't received any
   information how to proceed to move to SF. This wasn't a good experience, also
   because all of the camel-extra committers want to move to GitHub.
 * We are focusing the development of the next minor release Apache Camel
   2.16.0.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Cayenne Project  [Andrus Adamchik]

## Description: 

Apache Cayenne is a Java persistence framework. It takes a distinct approach
to object persistence and provides an ORM runtime, remote persistence
services, and a GUI mapping/modeling tool.
   
## Activity: 

The project is working towards 4.0.M3, though this quarter was fairly quiet.
We switched 4.0 branch to Java 1.7, upgrading a number of internal APIs. There
were a number of bug fixes and minor improvements. A few bigger things are
likely to be committed in the coming quarter. User mailing list activity
picked up almost twice compared to the previous quarter.

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Chemistry Project  [Florian Müller]


## Description:

Apache Chemistry is an effort to provide an implementation of the CMIS
(Content Management Interoperability Services) specification in Java,
Python, PHP, .NET, Objective-C, and JavaScript (and possibly other
languages).
The project has graduated in February 2011.

## Activity:
   - We received a new code contribution called PortCMIS, which is a
     C# CMIS client library. It is very similar to DotCMIS, but
     implements the CMIS 1.0 and CMIS 1.1 specifications.
     Long-term it will replace DotCMIS.
   - The Java implementation OpenCMIS gets bug fixes and new features.
     It has been recently refactored to work with Java 8 and Java 9.
   - All other CMIS implementations are not active at the moment.

## Issues:

   - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:

  - Currently 37 committers and 35 LDAP committee group members.
  - No new LDAP committee group members added in the last 3 months

  - DotCMIS 0.7 was released on Mon Apr 13 2015
  - ObjectiveCMIS 0.5 was released on Mon Mar 09 2015
  - OpenCMIS 0.13.0 was released on Mon Apr 06 2015

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Sebastien Goasguen]

## Description:
  Apache CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud
  orchestration platform.

## Activity:
- The CloudStack project continues to release new software at a steady pace.
- We have adopted a new commit workflow for our master branch.  Trying to
  stabilize master and make it the releasable branch.  All commits to master
  must now be reviewed and given two LGTM + green Travis tests before being
  merged. While this slows down development, our hope is that it increases
  stability and reduces time between releases.
- EC2stack which went through IP clearance is now going through its first
  release VOTE
- We have added Docker images for our main components
  (simulator, management server, marvin, ec2stack, cloudmonkey)
- We have held two CloudStack day events collocated with Linuxcon, attendance
  has been poor.  CloudStack conference Europe is scheduled for Oct 8-9 in
  Dublin, this is a multi-day event.  It seems that the collocation with
  linuxcon is not providing the cross-pollination hoped for and despite the
  good number of registrations there is a significant number of no shows.

## Health report:
- Committee Health score: 9.60 (Super Healthy) from reporter.apache.org
- Participation on mailing lists is stable
- Participation in CloudStack day events has been poor so far this year
- Cycle of releases is healthy

## Issues:
- A slight note that ASF infra should make sure to pay attention to Docker Hub
  integration and the use of it to house ASF software images.
- The CloudStack “marketing alliance” effort which had been discussed
  at length has stalled with no further discussions.
- There are no other issues requiring board attention at this time

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

## Description:
   Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Activity:
 As you can see from the statics there had been close to nothing in
activities. Francesco deleted old releases and there were a question
that had not been a single reply. However the draft of this report
got 5 positive pmc votes meaning we are still fully functional as project.

## Health report:
 - the project is suffering a decline of interest from the common public
since xml is nothing sexy anymore. There is further basically no
interest of doing a release and no communication on the mailing lists. I
will raise the discussion on the cocoon PMC whether we should move to
the attic.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:

 - Currently 80 committers and 32 LDAP committee group members.
 - No new changes to the LDAP committee group or committership since last
   report.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

   A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and 
   JavaScript. 
   
## Activity: 

Current releases have been voted on according to the Apache vote policy. We
missed the target of releasing the cordova-ios 4.0.0 platform this quarter
(but released minor versions 3.9.0 and 3.9.1), and are actively working on
updating our other platform versions for the upcoming quarter.

We released a new platform, cordova-browser@4.0.0, and minor updates for
cordova-android and cordova-windows. We have two platforms that have been
revived after being inactive for some time -- cordova-webos@3.7.0 and
cordova-blackberry10@3.8.0.
    
We also renamed and moved all our core plugins to npm (node package manager -
npmjs.org), and set the Cordova Plugins Registry (c.p.r) to read-only, with a
shut-down date tentatively set for October 15th, 2015. Users that use the old
plugin ids from the c.p.r are re-directed to npm automatically from our
cordova-cli.
   
## Health report: 

Due to the summer vacation period, activity is slower than usual especially on
release of plugins, although we had essentially the same number of releases
from last quarter (45 vs 46). For this period, we managed only one overall
plugins release (of 22 plugins) when our goal was to have one plugins release
per week.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was also released on 6/23/15.
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.1 was released on 8/6/15.

-Apache Flex SDK 4.14.1 was released on 3/30/15.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache FlexJS 0.0.2 was released on 7/17/14.
-Apache Flex FalconJX 0.0.2 was released on 7/17/14.

ACTIVITY 
The past three months saw continued activity related to FlexJS, a
version of Flex that is independent from the Adobe Flash Platform.  Some
interesting new features were added, such as integration with the IntelliJ IDE
and the ability to write low-level JavaScript applications in ActionScript. 
Stabilizing the code for release has taken longer than expected, but I expect
the vote to start in September.  Another distraction was responding to a CVE
that resulted in the BlazeDS 4.7.1 release.  Meanwhile, there is activity
around various bug fixes to other Apache Flex releases and better Maven
integration.  Mailing list traffic is down, but not an issue yet.

The recent changes to the mirrors.cgi broke our installer.  Infra has put in a
temporary workaround, but we will be forced to release a newer installer that
uses the newer mirror JSON.

COMMUNITY
-Joseph Labrecque was added as a committer.
-A vote is about to start on a new PMC member.
-Latest analytics include a little less than 2000 hits per day on the website
during the work week (less on weekends).
-There were more than 12,500 installs of Apache Flex 4.14.1 since its release
about two months ago.
-Almost 75,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.  Tour De Flex is
a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex applications.

TRADEMARKS
-We discovered that yet another apacheflex.com site has been created. The last
time (September 2013) it was resolved easily, but I guess someone else grabbed
and is now using it. An email was sent, but no response. What should we do
next?

Attachment W: Report from the Apache Flink Project  [Stephan Ewen]


DESCRIPTION

Flink is a distributed data streaming system for batch and streaming data
analysis on top of a streaming dataflow engine.
Flink's stack contains functional batch and streaming analysis APIs in
Java and Scala and libraries for various use cases.

Flink interacts and integrates with several Apache projects, including
Hadoop (YARN, HDFS, MapReduce), Kafka, HBase, Zeppelin, MRQL, Tez, Orc,
HCatalog.


ISSUES

 - There are no issues that require board attention.


STATUS AND ACTIVITY

 - The community is working towards version 0.10, which contains several new
   major features, like an overhaul of the streaming API, high availability.
   The community aims to graduate the streaming API out of beta status and make
   it stable.

 - The question about a releasing version 1.0 has been brought up in the
   community, as APIs and operational features mature.

 - Flink is seeing an increasing number of users and contributors, and the
   community is discussing ways to handle the load, make pull requests and
   patches more efficient to review, and to guide contributors towards
   making productive contributions. Current efforts include more precise
   guidelines and automated QA technology.

 - Interest in Flink is growing, we are seeing more and more meetup groups
   springing up, as well as a 2-day conference on Flink in October in Berlin.

 - The community is looking to diversify the technical expertise.
   Right now, most people contribute to libraries, APIs, tools, integration.
   We would like to get more people knowledgeable about the core. Efforts in
   talks and documentation are currently happening.


COMMUNITY

   Gora 0.6.1.

## Health report:
 - Mailing list activity has remained fairly steady over the last three months
   with minor levels of growth evident. We hope this will increase as the 0.6.1
   release gets more widely used.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

No development activity, Gump seems to create useful results for the
few projects that use it.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

The projects that use Gump have occasionally modified their respective
configuration files.  No other activity.

=== Mailing-List Statistics ===

general@gump.apache.org:
49 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months) (64 emails sent in the past
3 months, 92 in the previous cycle)

commits@gump.apache.org:
Currently: 20 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months) (42 emails sent
in the past 3 months, 94 in the previous cycle)

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

     Commons RDF meets potential user requirements and expectations

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  N/A

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A new community member has mentioned development of a branch which _may_
  have the potential to drive the project in a different direction.  Commons
  RDF IPMC members are continuing conversation on the topic.  Additionally
  there is recent discussion of how Commons RDF can be used within Apache
  Jena. Jena is one of the key consumer communities Commons RDF aims to
  target within the scope of addressing #3 above.

How has the project developed since the last report?

Development has been reasonably slow post 0.1.0-incubating release.

Corinthia

Corinthia is a toolkit/application for converting between and editing common
office file formats, with an initial focus on word processing. It is
designed to cater for multiple classes of platforms - desktop, web, and
mobile - and relies heavily on web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for representing and manipulating documents. The toolkit is
small, portable, and flexible, with minimal dependencies. The target
audience is developers wishing to include office viewing, conversion, and
editing functionality into their applications.

Corinthia has been incubating since 2014-12-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Solve the community crisis and avoid a break
  2. 
  3. 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The community is experiencing a major breakdown. The mentors have accessed
  the situation including several attempts to stop the breakdown without
  success. IPMC have been informed with a suggestion which are being
  considered.

  It is to be expected that several core developers will leave the project
  in a very short term unless a solution is found.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are proud that we have managed to make our first release.
 
How has the project developed since the last report?

  Added support for 32/64bit windows.

  Made the setup of a build environment a lot easier, a PPMC provide all
  third party libraries prebuilt.

  A long discussion about licenses lead to major difficulties in deciding
  whether and how to proceed with one of the project’s two main
  components, an end-user editing app. As a result this development is
  being redirected.
 
  Our buildbot setup is slowly taking shape, this is important since it will
  allow a nightly build as well as a nightly test.

Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Getting more external users
  2. Getting more diverse set of developers
  3. Getting more diverse set of committers/PMC

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are seeing a lot of traction in the community, over the improvement in
  deployment and management of applications using Slider. Good number of
  emails are pouring in the dev list, primarily on creation of Slider
  packages for newer applications and willingness to contribute code. Few
  presentations and meetups were organized by the community, socializing
  their Slider-ized applications.  Occasional patches were submitted and a
  number of features added to the recent releases were driven by end-user
  needs. We still have to get those people into long term coding, and then
  bring them in to the committer group. 

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We released slider-0.80.0-incubating in May with 64 JIRAs resolved. It was
  one of Slider's most important release, with several critical business
  application features like rolling upgrade, co-processor support for
  dynamic addition of libraries, and support for Docker containers.

  We've been debating when to switch from Hadoop 2.6+ support to 2.7.1+
  only.  Given how Slider has always tended to push much of the YARN
  services work, it's time to pick up on the changes they've put in.

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

## Description: 
   Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open 
   Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of 
   OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0 (beta). The latter is 
   the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC. 
     
   
## Activity: 
   The project is ongoing. With the OData V2 implementation we see more adoption
   and thus get more JIRA issues and mails on our user list. The dev list is 
   currently used for OData V4 related discussion. The most recent discussion
   is about the release candidate for the first stable OData V4 implementation
   for Java servers and clients.
   
## Health report: 
   The number of mails and issues in our JIRA is either constant or slowly 
   growing. We expect a rise in interest after the first stable V4 release. All 
   in all we are happy with the state of the project although we would always 
   like more committers.

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

DESCRIPTION

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard.

A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014. We plan to make a new
minor release soonish
( [https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/issuetypes/task.png]
OLTU-171<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OLTU-171>
- Release a new version of Oltu Open ). We have extended the coverage for the
IETF JOSE specifications
(that is strictly correlated to OAuth 2) as JWS
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-36). The
current intention is to extend the coverage to the JWE part. We got quite some
feedbacks from users (included patches). The answer from Oltu dev seems to be
a bit slow though. The overall coding activity is also slow. The reason might
also be the fact the OAuth specification is stable for a while (being an RFC)
hence also the code is stable.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

Project Activity:
Development has slowed slightly since the last reporting period. The last
release (0.5) was done in mid-January which had a number of significant
toolkit improvements.

While we've seen some tapering off of activity we have had a number of
contributions from long idle members and a few contributions from
new faces. The team is actively discussing rolling a 1.0.0 RC since
we've made quite a bit of respectable progress on some key features.

Issues for the Board:
None

When was the last release:
0.4 - 11 September 2014
0.5 - 14 January 2015

When was the last committer or PMC member elected:
Ross Laidlaw - 6 November 2014

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Joern Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference
resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text
processing services.

Development
------------------
The two GSOC students both passed and we will start working to incorporate
the WSD component they build into the core OpenNLP Tools package.

The development team stayed active over the last three month and
participated in smaller development efforts.

Community
---------------

We received a Naive Bayes classifier contribution from
Cohan Sujay Carlos and integrated it into OpenNLP.

The community stayed active with the usual amount of traffic on the user
mailing list.

Rodrigo Agerri was added to the PMC on Jul 09 2015

The two GSOC 2015 students were voted in as committers.
Mondher Bouazizi and Anthony Beylerian were added as a committer on

Activity is fine.
We shipped new maintenance releases, improved our site and
started with the work towards CDI-2.0.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Pig Project  [Rohini Palaniswamy]

## Description: 
   Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets on Hadoop.  It 
   provides a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, 
   coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. 
 
## Activity: 
  - Development is under way for Pig 0.15.1 patch release and Pig 0.16 release
    with focus on performance optimizations, minor features/enhancements and
    stabilization of Pig on Tez.
  - Pig on Spark was running out of steam and had very little progress for
    past couple of months with only one person working on it and most of the
    interested parties backing out to focus on other projects. But it is back
    on track now with new contributors from another organization who are
    heavily invested in Pig scripts and looking to migrate from Mapreduce to
    Spark ready to drive it and target making it production ready by end of
    the year for deployment in their clusters. 
  - Dilip Ramesh mentored by Daniel Dai on PIG-2597 for GSOC 2015 successfully
    completed the program. He is continuing to work on it post GSOC 2015 as
    well on rest of the pieces required to complete the full feature.

   
## Health report: 
 - Project activity in the community - mails, commits, bugs etc is good. Users
   have also started using and reporting issues on Pig on Tez which was a new
   execution engine released in Pig 0.14. 
 - There has been no new committership for an year. Patches are being
   contributed by lot of new and different users. But not enough complex
   patches or volume of patches or long time involvement per person to
   nominate for committership at the moment. There are couple of folks inching
   towards that with regular contributions and hopefully we will have some of
   them in the next board report.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time 
   
## LDAP committee group/Committership changes: 
   
 - Currently 28 committers and 15 LDAP committee group members.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Description: 
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet 
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
   usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
   robustness of the Java platform.
   
Activity: 
 - User activity was very low this quarter, the lowest I've ever seen,
   although there were two (apparently) new users.
 - Development activity was all from myself -- I have many ideas for
   enhancements, but not much time.  No other committer (with one exception)
   seems interested in (or available to) do anything.
   
Health report: 
 - The Reporter facility says that we are in an unhealthy state because of
   no recent releases and no new committers and no PMC changes for several
   years.  I concur.
 - The topic of moving to the Attic comes up at least once a quarter in
   private correspondence.  Since I am actively using it I would hate to see
   that, but I am doubtful we could raise 3 PMC members for a vote at this
   moment.  I think we could (and should) release a new maintenance version
   in the next quarter, so I will push for that, and see if we can raise the
   votes for it.
 - I reached out to ComDev last quarter for ideas/help in building community
   and heard nothing back.  I will do some further reaching out in the next
   few weeks.
 - As I mentioned last quarter, the move by Google (final as of last week) to
   no longer support Java applets in the browser means that approximately 25%
   of the browser market is no longer available for the kind of applications
   that can be developed using Pivot (IIAs).
   
Issues: 
 - There are still two issues brought up last quarter that need Board
   attention:  Apache-Extras and the ASF "cookie" policy.
   
LDAP committee group/Committership changes: 
 - Currently 9 committers and 6 LDAP committee group members. 
 - No new changes to the LDAP committee group or committership since last 
   report. 
 - Last Committer Piotr Kolaczkowski (pkolaczk) was created 09 May 2012.
 - Latest PMC Changes:
   Roger Whitcomb (rwhitcomb) was added to PMC on 27 Oct 2011,
   Martijn Dashorst (dashorst) went Emeritus in July 2012,
   Greg Brown (gbrown) went Emeritus on 10 Sept 2013.

Releases: 
 - Last release was 2.0.4 on Mon May 19 2014 
   
Mailing list activity: 
 - dev@pivot.apache.org:

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Portals Project  [David Sean Taylor]

## Description:

Apache Portals exists to promote the use of open source portal technology. We
intend to build freely available and interoperable portal software in order to
promote the use of this technology. With the Pluto project, we provide a
reference implementation for the Java portlet standard. The Jetspeed project
is a full feature enterprise open source portal. The Portals Applications
project is dedicated to providing robust, full-featured, commercial-quality,
and freely available portlet applications.

## Activity:

 Apache Portals released 1 release since the last report.

Apache Portals Jetspeed released version 2.3.0. Version 2.3.0 introduces new
features as well as bug fixes. New features include Portlet 2.1.0 support,
Preferences and Security performance improvements, new Responsive Layouts and
Decorators, Java7 and Tomcat7 support, new User and Profiler Admin portlets,
an AutoRefresh feature and more.

 Apache Pluto is actively designing the Portlet API 3.0


## Issues:

 We have no board-level issues at this time.

## PMC/Committership changes:

none

## Releases:

- Portals Jetspeed 2.3.0 on July 28 2015

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Serf Project  [Bert Huijben]

## Description:
   The serf library is a high performance C-based HTTP client library built
   upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. Serf is the default
   client library of Apache Subversion and Apache OpenOffice.

## Activity:
   We have been busy moving the project to the ASF infrastructure. The
   website, mailinglists, Subversion, Jira, etc. are all migrated. With
   some help of some Subversion developers we now have a few buildbots
   configured to help with release testing. With all this done, we are
   now trying to get serf 1.4.0 released as the first ASF release.

## Health report:
   The last few weeks we had an above average average activity as
   everybody was trying to get everything moved onto the ASF
   infrastructure after the googlecode site was made read-only.
   I hope we can continue at this pace to get 1.4.0 released soon.

## Issues:
   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:

 - Currently 12 committers and 11 LDAP committee group members.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

## Project Status

The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow over the
summer, but is picking up again now that we're planning to do new releases.

We have released the first release from the new 6.0.x, which is based on 
Karaf 3.0.x and includes numerous new features. We have also provided the 
users with a new release 5.5.0, based on Karaf 2.4.x and containing upgrades 
to the newest dependencies and some new features. We have also released the 
next maintenance releases 5.4.1 and 5.1.6 and 3 sets of OSGi bundles.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

## Community

Currently 49 committers and 22 PMC members in the project. No new PMC members
nor committers were added in the last 3 months. Last committer addition was 
Wim Verreydt on July 05 2014. Last PMC addition was Krzysztof Sobkowiak on 
July 05 2014. 

## Community Objectives

After the 6.0.0 release, our goal for the next period is to make the branch 
6.0.x as a new stable line of ServiceMix. We're not expecting too much 
dependency updates to become available for the 5.1.x, 5.2.x and 5.3.x branches,
but we do plan to keep our release schedule going with the 5.4.x and 5.5.x 
releases. We plan to keep a steady release schedule and keep up with new fix 
releases of our dependency projects. 

We also plan to start the work on the new ServiceMix 7.x line, which should be
based on Karaf 4.x and will include numerous new features and dependency
upgrades. 

Our goal for the next months is to improve the documentation and website.

## Releases

 - A set of 77 OSGi bundles on June 19 2015
 - Apache ServiceMix 5.1.6 on June 26 2015

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Stanbol Project  [Fabian Christ]

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment.

The project is working on updating the JIRA issues and bringing the code
base into a state that allows easier release cutting.

We had an issue with a crashed testbed server running at
http://dev.iks-project.eu/ that was now resolved. The server is available
again.

A hint by Mike Kienenberger to invite additional people as PMC members to
increase their involvement in Stanbol was recognized. The current PMC
is now looking for opportunities to bring in new people to the Stanbol PMC.

Subscribers on the dev list: 227

Last new committer was
  Cristian Petroaca on May 7th, 2015
  
No new PMC member was elected since the graduation of Apache Stanbol on
Sep 19th, 2012.

Last stack release was:
  Apache Stanbol 0.12 on Mar 2nd, 2014

Last component release was:
  Apache Stanbol Partial Security Release RC2 on June 5th, 2014

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description: 
   Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system. 
   
## Activity: 
 - The community is currently working on finalizing version 0.10.0 and
   planning for version 0.11.0.
 - The PMC is working with Alibaba to finalize the donation of the JStorm code
   (a Java implementation of Storm's clojure code) and the corresponding IP
   clearance process.
 - The community is actively working on implementing a number of improvements
   identified in Twitter's Heron paper.
 - The community is finalizing a redesign of the Apache Storm website.
   
## Health report: 
 - Activity on the mailing lists is steady, and Storm continues to attract new
   users and contributors.
   
## Issues: 
   In July I asked on the board@ list [1] for advice regarding anecdotal
   evidence that members of another ASF community were claiming that Storm
   is "End of Life" (and thus a community in decline) and how best to
   respond. In that thread, a number of suggestions were made by both ASF
   directors and members, and the PMC continued the discussion on the Storm
   private@ list. The general sentiment from the board@ discussion was that
   it is the responsibility of the PMC to decide what, if any, actions to
   take, and escalate the matter only if those actions fail to produce the
   desired outcome.
 
   The general consensus among the Storm PMC is that no specific action is
   necessary at this point, and that any efforts by the PMC are best focused
   on improving Storm as a project and community. 
   
   No further attention from the board is necessary.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Hiranya Jayathilaka]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

No new committers or PMC members were nominated this quarter. Latest
Synapse committer was elected on December, 2013. Latest Synapse PMC
member was elected on December, 2013. 

We continue to work with the Axis2 community on getting an Axis2 release
out, which has been a significant blocker for releasing Synapse. Progress 
has been slow but steady. Issues have been fixed/resolved more aggressively 
than usual, and some of the build issues that have been affecting both
projects have been resolved. Overall, there have been multiple positive
signs that an Axis2 release is imminent. 

Releases
========

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on 
January, 2012.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Mick Semb Wever]

## Description:
 Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for
 Java applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to
 simplify the development of user interfaces.

## Activity:
 Activity in the Tiles community remains slow, roughly the same.
 Questions and issues are still generally addressed quickly.

 June-July saw a flurry of activity with some contributions from newcomers.
 An interesting discussion was raised from a newcomer that could see some nice
 improvements result.  Otherwise since then it has been quiet and the majority
 of traffic on StackExchange and within the Spring community.

## Health report:
 The Apache Tiles project remains in the "action required" health status for
 apache projects.  The few active members are aware of the state of the
 project and most of our attention goes toward keeping a stable project still
 communicating with users and developers that have questions.  Little time
 goes toward trying to increase the project's momentum, we need to address
 this.

## Issues:
 there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:
 - No new changes to the LDAP committee group or committership since last
   report.

## Releases:
 - No releases were made this quarter. The project is due for a patch release.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

A repeat discussion has been around what the next major version number
for TomEE should be.  After a vote the community has decided to rename
TomEE 2.0 to TomEE 7 to more clearly align with the Java EE 7
specification.  I have pointed out the many disadvantages of this such
as being locked into a major version number that we don’t control,
only changes every 4 years and doesn’t reflect our own innovations and
major changes.  While not my personal preference, the overwhelming
majority prefers the 7 version number and I am quite proud to see the
community has the health to peacefully disagree and move forward —
especially when some of them are disagreeing with their employer.
This must be encouraged.

The project has voted in 4 new members to the PMC; Andy Gumbrecht,
Mark Struberg, Romain Manni-Bucau and Thiago Veronezi.  Discussion of
this took place openly on the dev list with actual voting on the
private@ list.  Noted in a previous board report that if the community
continued to feel more comfortable voting in private, the PMC numbers
would have to be increased.  This appears to be the case and so the
PMC has been expanded.

New faces appeared on the project from Pivotal and SAP, both wishing
to contribute a buildpack for TomEE to run in their cloud platforms.
Faces from WS02 and ManagedCat have started appearing a little more
frequently occasionally joining dev or user list conversations.
Contributions are not there yet, but it is promising and the timing is
very good.  As of September Tomitribe employs the majority of active
committers the project has had over the last 5 years.  While all
members of the community act as individuals, we all know how important
it is to have diversity in employers.  It would be a milestone to see
the project graduate to Tomcat or HTTPd levels of diversity in both
individual and employers.  This will also be heavily encouraged.

While many positive community changes have happened in the previous 5
months since the last board report, the development pace of the
project continues to be slow and focused on maintenance.  TomEE 1.7.2
was released in May and is now the primary download for most users.
Work on TomEE 7 continues to be hindered by the lack of a Java EE 7
TCK.  Cameron’s departure from Oracle, could likely be a sign the
community will have to stand purely on it’s own innovations.

Last release was 1.7.2 on 2015-05-22.  Last committer was added
November 2013.  Last PMC addition, 4 new members on 2015-08-11.

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description: 
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

## Activity: 
- The Apache VCL community had previously decided to release a minor
bugfix-only VCL 2.4.3 release in order to facilitate a transition from
Subversion to Git. It was decided that adding support for Windows 10
images was worthwhile. Since the upcoming version will contain new
features, it will be version 2.5. Work is nearly complete.

## Health report: 
- Traffic to the dev@vcl list is down from the previous quarter because
there was a flurry of activity in March and April while we prepared VCL
2.4, 2.4.1, and 2.4.2. I expect traffic to increase over the next month as
VCL 2.5 is finalized.

## Issues: 
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes: 

- Currently 8 committers and 7 LDAP committee group members. 
- No new LDAP committee group members added in the last 3 months

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Ross Gardler]

## Description: 
  Whimsy is a site where a set of absolutely unnecessary yet often quite 
  handy applications are deployed.  
  
## Activity: 
The project is up and running and apart from a chair not coordinating board
reports in a timely manner is functioning well. We are even seeing growth in
the number of dev list subscribers, which is surprising to some given the
nature of the software being produced.
  
## Health report: 
This project is very specific to the ASF and is unlikely to attract
significant interest from outside contributors. Interest in the project is
perhaps higher than we might have expected at this stage. Turning more of that
interest into contributions and issue triage will be useful. 
  
## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
  
## LDAP committee group/Committership changes: 
  
No new additions to the PMC or committer list since TLP created in May
2015.

- Currently 1 committers and 8 LDAP committee group members. 
- No new LDAP committee group members added in the last 3 months 
- Last LDAP committee group addition was James W. Carman at Wed May 20 2015 
- Ross Duncan Gardler was added as a committer on Tue Aug 18 2015 
  
## Releases: 
  
No release have been made and given the nature of the project are unlikely to
be made. However, the live service is updated regularly.
  
## Mailing list activity:

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Zest Project  [Niclas Hedhman]

## Description:
   Apache Zest is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented
   Programming for domain centric application development.

## Activity:
Apache Zest made its first release (Java Edition 2.1) last day in July and it
went remarkably well. Release Manager had no previous ASF release experience,
and that shows testimony to the high standards of the generic Release
Documentation (kudos!) After release, everyone went on a well-deserved
holiday, but activity is now climbing back up, with planning and
implementation for ver 3.0, which will require Java 8. All naming from Qi4j to
Zest has been completed.

## Health report:
Zest is a small but active community, and the size of community is not
expected to grow substantially in the near future. All previous Qi4j
contributors still active have been on-boarded, and we will take it from
there.

## Issues:
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

ACTIVITY
========

Release Effort and Plans
------------------------

Developer focus is on provision of the Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2
maintenance release.  This will extend to localization, web site
updates, and provision of any associated security advisories.

Non-4.1.2-release-blocker issues and some anticipated features are
targeted for th future Apache OpenOffice 4.2 release.  There
is no anticipated date at this time.

Community Operations
--------------------

The developer and support channels (users mailing list and official
forums) remain typical.   There has been some finger-pointing in
conjunction with the world-wide upgrading to Microsoft Windows 10,
although complaints seem to be minimal considering the pace of
upgrading.

Issues brought to the developer and user lists about usage are
addressed by volunteer users, sometimes unevenly.  Discussion is
just beginning on improved coordination of issues across the
Bugzilla, lists, wiki and forums.  The goal is more-reliable capture
of issues and consistent provision of resolutions and work-arounds.

PMC/COMMITTERS
==============

ISSUES
======

The lack of progress on all fronts in the project has been a
continuing issue.  Obstacles are being identified and brought before
the entire community for its wisdom in identification of consensus-
based direction.

Initial achievements on this approach will be reported in October.

Sustainability
--------------
The following warning signs are noticed with regard to
sustainability.

CUSTOM IT SUPPORT.  The Project has not maintained consistent
support of the servers that is has agreed to operate as part of its
agreement with Infra. The services are at risk. (See Infrastructure
in the next section.)

RELEASE MANAGEMENT.  A single Release Manager has undertaken all
releases up until now.  On the stepping down of that RM, Andrea
Pescetti has stepped in for 4.1.2 and others are needed to rotate
into Release Management duties thereafter.
SKILL DEVELOPMENT. The learning curve required to contribute
effectively to the current code base has proven to make it difficult
to develop or attract experienced developers to the project. While the
ASF is traditionally about the people and not companies, the AOO
project is evaluating engagement with companies that might
have a strategic reason for contributing skills to the project.

EXISTING CAPACITY. The depth and breadth of developer coverage of
the code base will be assessed by October when the sprint toward
4.1.2 can also be appraised and development capacity assessed.

ISSUE CLEARANCE AND TECHNICAL DEBT.  Analysis of bugzilla status
since the inception of that database provides the following portrait
of issue legacy as of 2015-08-05

 * the oldest unresolved issue is #497 created on 2001-03-02
 * 24115/121298 (20%) issues are unresolved from before November,
              2012 commencement as a TLP
 * 2232/5139 (43%) issues unresolved of new issues from November,
              2012 through July, 2015
 * 192/452 (42%) issues unresolved of those created in the first
              seven months of 2015

There are a number of factors that impact the quality of these
statistics (PDF details at <http://s.apache.org/OEy>), including

 * Unresolved issues are not here differentiated by type.  Feature
   and enhancement requests are counted among confirmed defects.
 * The resolved proportion includes issues rejected as duplicates,
   as lacking supporting information, and as usability/support
   matters rejected as not being bugs, even when obviously about
   defects.

There is every reason to fear that, after such adjustments, the rate
of technical debt accrual is even greater than 42-43%.

   The disposition of bugzilla issues will continue to be monitored
along with improved coordination of issues across the user-facing
activities of the project now beginning discussion.

PMC OPERATION.  The AOO PMC was unable or unwilling to find a
replacement in its own ranks for retiring Chair, Andrea Pescetti.
The election of a new Chair was held between two non-PMC nominees
after there was no consensus on the only PMC member who stood as a
nominee.

   On the subsequent retirement of that new Chair, the only nominee
to step forward had been on the PMC six months and had no PMC
involvement since graduation of the AOO podling in October 2012.
Whatever the level of confidence that reflects, it remains that
there does not appear to be a strong, ready bench and easy
succession.  The Chair-elect intends to retire in September, 2016.

Infrastructure Issues/Needs
---------------------------
Apache OpenOffice, by long-standing agreement with Apache Infra,
takes responsibility for the custom MediaWiki and Forum servers
operating on Infra-provided VMs.  Limited support is achieved;
more is required.  Although operational, the software is out-of-
date.

   There is also need to support buildbots from within the
project.

   ACTION: Clarify the situation and achieve a sustainable arrange-
ment in consultation with Infra.  Identify at least temporary
relief by October, with solid arrangement by January.
