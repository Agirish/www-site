 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       On March 24, we held the Annual Members Meeting. There are still a
       couple of days for the remaining applications to come in, so we'll
       hold off the formal announcement of who the new members are, but I'm
       pleased to say that we added more than 100 new members this year! Our
       gratitude goes to the Secretary & assistant for processing all of the
       applications in addition to their regular workload.

       We had no concerns reaching quorum this year, in part due to the
       easier method of requesting a proxy.  This will still remain a topic
       of some interest as the Foundation continues to grow.

       This is the first meeting of the newly elected board, and we welcome
       back Shane Curcuru, and for the first time David Nalley. I'd like to
       again thank Doug and Ross for their service to the ASF on the board
       after they stood down at the meeting.

       Below is the report that I shared with the members for the Annual
       Meeting:

       ------

       I'd like to welcome all of our Members to our Annual Members Meeting
       for 2015. Thanks for taking some time out to participate in the
       governance of the ASF, including electing new Members, and electing
       the new Board of Directors. A special welcome again to the 40 new
       members elected during 2014.

       This year the meeting is being held slightly earlier than it has been
       in recent years. This allows the new board to be in place before the
       end of our fiscal year, and to review and approve the budget for the
       next year - a pattern I hope will be continued in the future.

       Even with a shorter period of time since the last meeting, there has
       been a lot happening within the ASF! We have added 13 new top-level
       projects: Tez, Celix, VXQuery, Storm, DeviceMap, Drill, MetaModel,
       BookKeeper, Falcon, Flink, Samza, Aurora and Zest. We retired just one
       project, with Whirr moving to the Apache Attic. Finally, we wound up
       our second oldest committee - Conference Planning - with
       responsibility moving to the President/EVP and our event and community
       partners. We now have 162 Project Management Committees, with a
       further 37 podlings in the Incubator. This means that within the next
       month we should expect to cross the milestone of having 200 projects
       under management at the ASF. Further to that, we've appointed
       replacement PMC chairs 29 times, showing that PMCs continue to rotate
       important positions, share the load and avoid volunteer burnout.

       We have grown at this steady rate while continuing to ensure that our
       projects operate under the pattern of open, collaborative and
       independent development known as "The Apache Way".

       Over the last year we have streamlined some processes to support this
       growth - adding to and expanding the tools that help manage PMC
       membership, monthly project reports, and management of the monthly
       board agenda. I expect this to continue, and thank the volunteers
       who have initiated and contributed to those efforts.

       The operations team are building a stable base for future growth. Our
       income and reserves have to date kept pace with growth, and we have
       gradually seen a transition from a day-to-day mode of operation
       towards a mode of planning and execution as we move forward each year.
       This helps ensure that these areas are able to provide the support
       that the Foundation and projects need, with a minimum number of
       distractions from producing software and building communities.
       Communication between the operations team and the board has been
       effective, and the board has adequate oversight and input into the
       work without needing to get more directly involved. Many thanks go to
       the President, EVP, and the VPs and committees that work with them for
       their significant efforts. We thank the sponsors and individual donors
       that contribute financially to the success of the ASF and its
       projects.

       Our thanks also go to the Treasurer, Secretary and their assistants
       who as volunteers put significant amounts of time into those roles and
       have kept them running extremely smoothly.

       As we looked back in 2014 at the 15 years of incorporation of the ASF,
       we recognised the massive impact that the Foundation has had on both
       the open source landscape, and computing in general. Every committer,
       PMC member, and contributor to our projects should be proud of what
       we've achieved and the part they have played in it.

       While many aspects of hosting and developing an open source project
       have become easier to do independently over the years, the benefits of
       being backed by a Foundation are routinely recognised within the open
       source development community. The ASF will certainly play a valuable
       role for many, many years to come.

       Finally, I'd like to thank the directors who served in 2014-15 for
       their dedication to the ASF and their regular contributions to its
       success both inside and outside of the board's activities. Particular
       thanks go to Ross Gardler (who will continue to serve as President)
       and Doug Cutting, who have opted not to stand at the coming election.
       Their presence among the board will be missed.

       We are therefore assured of welcoming new directors to the board this
       year, and the members have once again put forward a wonderful group of
       nominees. I wish the new board all the best for the coming year!

    B. President [Ross]

       Welcome to the new board!

       This month has been a mixed month. On the one hand it has been
       relatively quiet since the members meeting and ApacheCon have sucked
       up most of our time and energy. On the other hand it has been very
       busy because the members meeting ad ApacheCon has sucked up most of
       our time.

       The most important item is the Budget. The proposed budget has been
       available for the previous board and the new board to consider for
       some weeks I trust that all Directors are familiar with it. However, I
       have made some significant last minute change requests to cover
       increased expenses for moving three contractors to Virtual as a PEO. I
       managed to speak with most directors in person about this (at
       ApacheCon) and have notified the others by email. In order to ensure a
       budget is passed I have called out the additional expenses so that the
       budget can be approved without these expenses if the board feel this
       is necessary. 

       I request the board approve the budget as provided in Special Order G.

       From a financial position the foundation remains in good standing with
       a significantly higher cash surplus than the industry benchmark (as
       reported by Virtual). We have a surplus of 20.8 months at the FY15
       spend rate, the benchmark is 6 months. This means the increased
       deficit is not problematic from a financial planning perspective.
       Though we should recognize that this increased cost is a recurring
       cost. I have started working on a 5 year budget estimate to ensure we
       monitor this situation.

       Brand management
       --------------------------- 
       The currently brand budget covers US registrations only. VP Brand
       Management has received a request from a PMC to register in EU/CTM,
       India, and China in addition and, as a result has requested an
       increased budget of $2,425. I have denied this request indicating that
       it request should be repeated if the budgeted amount for the year falls
       short.

       Shane continues to work on a risk assessment indicates he will be
       ready to report next month.

       Fundraising
       ----------------
       Migration to using ZoHo is well underway. Renewals are being processed.
       All is good.

       Marketing and Publicity
       -------------------------------
       In addition to the "business as usual" items Sally reports the end of
       year report is in preparation. The refresh/redesign of the apache.org
       homepage has been completed with thanks to extensive work donated by
       HotWax Systems. Sally was also successful in securing a Proclamation
       from the City of Austin for the foundations 15 year anniversary.

       Infrastructure
       ------------------
       A request for feedback on a proposal to deprecate the CMS caused some
       "interesting" reactions. Amongst the unnecessary noise there was a
       great deal of valuable feedback. The infra team are now formulating a
       plan for the CMS and will report to the community soon.

       Travel Assistance
       ------------------------
       6 successful applicants attended ApacheCon NA. Thanks to the team for
       their diligence and hard work that make this possible.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary is running smoothly, with the Assistant Secretary picking up
       much of the workload. In March, a new record was set for activity,
       with 92 iclas, five cclas, 74 membership applications, four emeritus
       requests, and three grants received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

        We held ApacheCon North America in Austin last week, April
        13-16, and had 449 registrations, up by 50 from Denver. We
        had the honor of hosting several of the founding members of
        the httpd project at the event[1], and had a birthday celebration
        for the 20th birthday of the httpd project. We also received a
        proclamation from the City of Austin declaring April 13-16 to
        be Apache Days.[2]

        There was also a lively BarCamp on Thursday, with a good
        number of people in attendance. Several projects (Spark,
        Traffic Server, Cassandra) held project summits.

        On the whole, we appear to have had a successful event by most
        measures, although the size of the attendance is still a
        source of frustration for many.

        There was an incident at ApacheCon where a keynote speaker
        was subject to a verbal barrage while in the refreshment line
        in the exhibit area, and felt intimidated and threatened. A
        great deal of discussion has happened on the members list, 
        as well as numerous other places, about what action should be
        taken. The conference producer has been made aware of the
        incident, but is still traveling and doing events, so I haven't
        had a chance to discuss this at length with her. Meanwhile,
        the individual in question has apologized to the speaker
        (cc'ing myself and the conference producer), and I am also
        awaiting communication from her regarding whether she wishes
        to pursue this further with the conference producer, pursuant
        to enforcing the conference Code of Conduct and blacklisting
        this individual from future events. I ask for the continued
        patience of the membership as we work through this. I've also
        discussed this incident directly with the individual in
        question, explaining our stance that this kind of thing won't
        be tolerated in our community.

        We had very productive meetings with the LF producers
        regarding how future events will be run. As reported before,
        LF is stepping up to provide more leadership in upcoming
        events, and have proposed that ApacheCon EU (September) have a
        much narrower content focus, with three days primarily
        focusing on our Big Data projects, and then a fourth day
        populated by community talks, and project-specific tracks. The
        goal is to make the conference easier to market, because we
        will be able to state what the conference is about in terms
        that the market understands. The secondary goal is to have the
        main part of the event fund the community portion of the
        event, which has, in a sense, been a goal of ApacheCon from
        the beginning.

        Projects are welcome to propose content in the CFP[3], as per 
        earlier events, but LF will make the final content determination,
        rather than a committee of ASF people. This is a significant
        change from earlier events. It is anticipated that it will
        result in some tensions in the community, but given that we
        are asking LF to take 100% of the financial risk, it is
        reasonable that they also have the majority of the decision
        power also. We remind the board that our mandate was to
        license our brands to a producer, and get out of their way as
        much as possible, and this is the goal towards which we have
        been working for the last year.

        Jan Iversen will be our primary contact for ApacheCon Europe,
        while I (Rich) will focus primarily on the North America
        event.

        ApacheCon Europe will be held in Budapest [4], September 28 -
        October 1, 2015. The CFP is open, but has not been announced
        yet, as there is discussion about running two separate CFPs,
        one for the Big Data event, and a second of the
        yet-to-be-named community event.

        ApacheCon North America will be held in Vancouver, BC, May 9 -
        12, 2016. The CFP will open soon, but a date has not yet been
        determined. I will be visiting the venue [5] while I am at the
        OpenStack Summit in 3 weeks.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, tm-registrations@, and board@) and following-up with
appropriate personnel Fundraising:
•	Hadrian has migrated the information from the spreadsheet over to Zoho CRM.
We will be meeting in Austin to discuss workflow processes with Zoho
•	Payments received for renewals:
•	$50k for the first of two installments from a platinum
•	$5k for a bronze
•	$110 – prorated amount for a gold that upgraded to platinum (great work,
team!!)
•	$40k from a gold 

Virtual:
•	Upon receiving and reviewing the employment offer from Virtual, I had
discussions with Ross and Virtual to confirm salary details.  Upon receiving
feedback from Virtual, it was decided that the salary terms were not
acceptable and the paperwork was not signed. The ASF is seeking an alternative. 

ApacheCon and TAC:
•	All work with TAC completed
•	Booth logistics all sorted
•	Giveaways all en route to the venue
•	Sorted hotel reservations for a few last-minute folks 

Trademarks:
•	Flowing smoothly – all requests have been caught up- some projects still
need to provide the information to us in order to process the application, but
they are aware of this and just need a little time to compile all of the data.

Misc: 
I’d like to extend a heartfelt thank you for being nominated and voted
in as a Member.  This is truly a huge honor, and it really made my heart
smile! So, thank you very much!

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

## Budget: *Board action needed*

* BUDGET REQUEST INCREASE: += $2,425.00 on behalf of the well organized Tomcat
project who wishes to register their name as both a service mark in 
the US, as well as a software product mark in the EU/CTM, India, and China.

Given the President's adjusted budget request for brand, the core budget 
is only meant to (primarily) cover a US software product registration for any
TLP that requests one.  Thus I would like to increase the brand budget request
by +$2425 to meet the Tomcat PMC's request (which I support).

Separately, please FYI that due to a billing error, over $12K of legal 
fees and outside counsel expenses incurred during 2014 was not actually 
billed to the ASF until last month; apologies if this caused some confusion as
to the monthly brand expenses in the past.

## Operations:

Gave two well-received talks at ApacheCon Austin related to brands, one 
focused on education for PMCs and the other focused on helping vendors 
working in our project technology spaces how to respectfully use Apache 
brands.  The level of questions I got both after the talks and during 
the conference was much better than in past years in terms of PMC 
members asking more detailed and thoughtful questions.

Work on the requested detailed risk analysis for the board of not 
registering our project trademarks is progressing slowly due to ApacheCon,
budgets, and the like.  Propose to present something next month.

Interesting questions on trademarks@ this month about the recent Groovy
project submission to the Incubator (no TM issues expected), the use 
of trademarks in relation to email addresses (to reduce spam), as well as 
questions about detailed uses of marks including the Apache Attic as 
well as a higher volume then usual from both PMCs and outside parties.

(Outstanding) Waiting on infra to confirm if supporting a regularly maintained
list of all Apache product trademarks is feasible; if it is not feasible, then
I would expect to ask for an additional budget item to 
complete this task in the future.

## Registrations: 

At the request of the relevant PMCs, we submitted US registration applications
this month for: Accumulo, ManifoldCF, Tomcat.

The Tajo, ManifoldCF, DeltaSpike, Accumulo, Bigtop, OFBiz have requested to
register their project names; we're still coordinating getting all the
information needed for those and previous requests to counsel.

The PMC requested Cassandra and CouchDB applications are on hold pending 
various legal consent issues.

The Tomcat PMC has requested additional registrations, both as software 
products in the EU/CTM, India, China and as a service (i.e. the service 
of providing developer support to contributors) in the US.  This is on 
hold pending a decision on budget.

The Corinthia podling has requested to register their product name, and 
may have volunteers to donate the costs associated with the registration 
if the official Brand budget cannot be used to pay for podling 
registrations.  Awaiting feedback from the Corinthia PPMC currently.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Jim Jagielski]

Fundraising progresses very well (see Melissa's report 
for more details).

Most notable event was Pivotal's upgrade to platinum 
(announced at acna).

The "Thanks" page has been updated and looks much better. 
Many thanks to Daniel Gruno for making it happen and for
his attention to details (a few follow up fixes). This happened
before the site update and although a bit eclipsed by the
whole site update it is still great.

Information about all accounts is now in Zoho. Hadrian is
in the process of adding data to all the accounts and potentials
and uploading all the existing documents (invoices and 
payments) in zoho for reference and accuracy of reports. We
will go back and upload docs starting with 01/01/2015, but not
before that. While doing that we need to add tasks and
renewal reminders. The desire and expectation is to fully 
finish this for all sponsors this cycle (i.e. until the next board
meeting). For the next couple of cycles the plan is to 
iron out and document our process.

There are still very few outstanding items that should be taken 
care this week, hopefully before the board meeting.

Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: Sally Khudairi submitted a request to augment the 2015-2016
Marketing & Publicity budget by at least $5,000 to accommodate the
increasing number of requests for collateral/promotional items for
project-related events. All vendor payments are up-to-date.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing liaison: Sally is working with
Hadrian and Melissa on providing recognition for ASF Sponsors that
require M&P visibility. She has begun work on the ASF FY2014 Annual
Report which will be published the last week of May. The
refresh/redesign of the apache.org homepage has been completed with
thanks to extensive work donated by HotWax Systems; we are
anticipating the new homepage to be launched the week of ApacheCon.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 30 March 2015 --The Apache™ Software Foundation to celebrate 15
years of community-led innovation at ApacheCon
- 17 March 2015 -- The Apache Software Foundation Accepted as a Google
Summer of Code 2015 Mentoring Organization
- 11 March 2015 --Groovy Submitted to Become a Project at The Apache
Software Foundation

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 26 items were tweeted on @TheASF. Four Apache
News Round-ups were issued, with a total of 26 weekly summaries
published thus far.

V. Future Announcements: there is one announcement in development that
will be released during ApacheCon. Projects preparing to graduate from
the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing to announce major project
milestones and "Did You Know?" success stories are welcome to contact
Sally at <press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at
least 2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 4 media requests. The ASF
received 1,040 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's
clip count of 1,611.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 4 analyst queries. Apache was
mentioned in 1 report by Gartner, 6 reports by Forrester, 6 reports by
451 Research, and 4 reports by IDC. Sally received the 451 Research
report on Apache CloudStack.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally submitted the M&P highlights to Ross
Gardler for the State of the Feather presentation and has arranged for
a special recognition for the ASF. She has also assisted the producers
with outreach to potential attending members of the media/analyst
community, and will be at the ASF booth alongside Melissa Warnkin
through 15 April.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no formal
activities over the past month. Sally created promotional materials
for several Apache project events, including the Cincinnati Apache
Spark Meetup.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 19 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and continue to receive gratis
news release distribution in the UK by Pressat.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
None

Finances:
==========
$53 domain renewals
$2165 Cloud Services


Operations Action Items:
========================
n/a

Short Term Priorities:
=======================

LDAP
----
We've increased our spread of LDAP so that all of our cloud regions now
possess an LDAP server for authentication to work over the local network.

CMS
----
We've generated a FAQ to catalog issues and questions that came up during
the RFC. We hope to have some direction during or shortly after ApacheCon.

Long Range Priorities:
======================

Automation
-----------
We've been working on a number of automation efforts. One of our
recent deployments of LDAP has proven we can deploy a new host in
less than 10 minutes from provisioning to functional service.
Additionally we've been working on moving more services. One of
the highlights this month includes the SteVe deployment. We now
have the service in a state where it is trivial for us to deploy
a fresh machine with a STeVe deployment for projects to use.

Resilience
----------
We've begun moving VMs off of our internal VMware deployment. At the
same time we have been working on spinning up our VMware-based cloud
deployment at PhoenixNAP.

Technical Debt
--------------
We suspect (but are unable to prove) that some of our VMware issues
are related to using EOL/EOS software from VMware that requires us
to run the deployment for at least one machine in a suboptimal
manner.

Monitoring
----------
While monitoring has been useful in identifying issues, we haven't
materially expanded its use this month, something we hope to remedy
this month.

General Activity:
=================
Incidents
------------
We had a total of 98 incidents in the month of March that we alerted on
and paged the on call contractor out for. The relatively high number has
caused some concern, and we are tracking ways to reduce the number
of alerted incidents to the truly severe.
http://s.apache.org/WjC
http://s.apache.org/jQs

Jira
-----
A number of Jira imports have successfully been handled. These include the
plethora of Maven project imports, Tinkerpop, and Groovy among others. The
bulk of this work has been done by Mark Thomas who deserves special thanks
for tackling this work.

VMware hosts
-------------
One of our VMware hosts has been suffering from intermittent network
failures as well as the entire machine dying. This originally appeared
to be time related. We've begun migrating services off of this host in
order of priority, but the outages have affected a number of important
services to include the git services as well as blogs.

Uptime Statistics:
==================

Contractor Details:
===================

Gavin McDonald
--------------

Engage with OpenOffice community regarding a few Infrastructure related issues, such as the Mac Buildbots 

Revisit and engage with CouchDB PMC to sort out 2 outstanding Domain Name
transfers.  Sort out couch.[org|com] domains with Dotster, Domains are
successfully transferred.  Next step is to sort out secondary DNS and httpd
configs.

Covered on-call whilst folks were travelling to ACNA

Jira Tickets: 68 worked on and 56 competed as of 04/20/15

Confluence Wiki migration was completed.

Began work on moving the Blogs service to Puppet 3 and a new home in the cloud.
Began work on preparing to migrate TLP playgrounds to Puppet 3 and the cloud.

Prepared a draft policy covering VCS canonical locations.

on 4/17 qmail stopped sending mails and the queue went above 100000. Resolved
issues and service running normally again.

commonsrdf cms setup refuses to create a staging site. Looked extensively into
the problem but remains unresolved at this time. This is a blocker for the
project as they have no website and are waiting on it to do a release. See:
INFRA-9260

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]


Note that this is a pre-ACNA board report. A full report on how things went at
ACNA will be reported next month.


The Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) exists to help those that would like to
attend ApacheCon and/or other ASF Sponsored events, but are unable to do so for
financial reasons.


Overall Activity since last report

----------------------------------

* Everything is set to go for ApacheCon NA in Austin Texas. Jan with assistance
  from Nick and Lewis are taking on the ‘man on the ground’ position in
  organising the TAC attendees to perform their roles as needed and also to
  ensure they get the most out of the event itself.

* 8 applicants were accepted with 2 later dropping out so 6 successful
  applicants are attending this time around. That is a lower than usual figure
  so we need to find a way to get more successful applicants next time.

* We have deprecated use of IRC in favour of using HipChat as our synchronous
  communication channel.

Any ASF member is welcome to join this channel and hang out. Ask Infra for a
HipChat invite as guests will not be invited in to the private channel.


How has the community developed since the last report?

------------------------------------------------------

No members have joined or left. There are currently 13 subscribers to the main
mailing list.


Budget:

-------

We missed the original request for a budget submission. Since then we have
replied to a board email stating that we’d like the same budget as last year,
i.e $50,000 to supply 2 ApacheCons and up to 2 smaller events. Decision is
pending.

Future Events:

--------------

ApacheCon EU is the next event TAC is supporting. Nothing has been started on
this yet but imagine that we’ll get started around the end of May - there may be
a meeting to discuss some details including a timeline at ACNA. Any ASF member
that wants to help out are welcome, see the resources section for details.

Jan - whom has been a prolific contributor to ACNA and previous ApacheCons, has
indicated he will be much less available for ACEU. Therefore we need to consider
this and encourage others to join the effort for this next event.

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

The draft of the privacy policy is still being reviewed; the DMCA policy
is (still) being drafted. Numerous JIRA items have been closed. A dis-
cussion regarding online submission of (i)CLAs has started, in cooperation
with the Operations team.

The question of whether or not the ASF could use Github as the canonical and
official repo for any ASF project was asked: the decision of VP Legal is
that the unavailability of the push logs from Github results in an increased
risk to our developers and end-users, and would make the consumption of, or
leverage of, ASF projects by end-users a more difficult proposition due to
the ASF not being able to completely and independently verify and perform
the required IP provenance of our released code. A blog post and/or JIRA
ticket, to further make this policy decision more known, is likely.

No issues requiring board attention at this time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark Cox]

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

No activity and it looks like Abdera will be retired to the attic now.
We need to mention this on the dev list and then if there are no
objections i'll endevour to get a retirement resolution by the next
report.

No board issues.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Report from the Apache ActiveMQ Project  [Hiram Chirino]

Apache ActiveMQ is a popular and powerful open source messaging
server. Apache ActiveMQ is fast, supports many Cross Language Clients
and Protocols, comes with easy to use Enterprise Integration Patterns
and many advanced features while fully supporting JMS 1.1 and J2EE
1.4.

Community:
* The development and user lists continue to stay active.
* Several ActiveMQ based presentation were given at Apachecon NA.
* The ActiveMQ community has voted to name the HortnetQ code donation
ActiveMQ Artemis.
* Apache board members requested a special report to address what the
plan is of the hornetq code donation.  There were some specific
question what were directed at the PMC:

   Q. Red Hat has a product, called HornetQ, which includes a website;
        branding, etc.  http://hornetq.jboss.org/

   A. ActiveMQ PMC does not intend to use the HornetQ branding in any code,
       docs or website. The code donation has been updated to remove such
       references. The HornetQ open source project is now considered a legacy
       project and the code is no longer maintained as the open source project
       HornetQ. The ActiveMQ community is beginning to work together to
       develop a plan to take the donated code base forward and to develop
       community around this code base.

   Q. The ActiveMQ PMC needs to deliver a plan for:
   A.  Apache ActiveMQ has multiple products with multiple versions:
            a.  ActiveMQ - (version 5.x.x)
            b.  ActiveMQ Artemis - (version 1.x.x)

          This means that we are not yet ready to declare that
          ActiveMQ Artemis is the successor to ActiveMQ 5.x.  We will wait until
          the product matures to make that decision.

   Q. The current chair has been the chair for *many* years and based on the
        current status and issues in the community, I would strongly
        suggest having a plan for potentially replacing the chair of the project.

   A. The PMC agrees.

* The PMC has voted to give the code donation a code name so that it
is not referred to as HornetQ anymore within ActiveMQ.
* IP clearance for the code donation is almost complete:
http://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/hornetq.html
* At least one member of the PMC, as well as several members of the
community, feels strongly that disagreements and concerns are not
getting addressed.  They would rather have Artemis go through the
incubator.
* PMC is in discussions looking for ways to increase community diversity
* PMC has voted to appoint Bruce Snyder as the ActiveMQ PMC chair.
The PMC requests that the board approve the the following resolution:

----------------------------------------------------------

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors heretofore appointed Hiram Chirino to
the office of Vice President, Apache ActiveMQ, and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors is in receipt of the resignation
of Hiram Chirino from the office of Vice President, Apache
ActiveMQ, and

WHEREAS, the Project Management Committee of the Apache ActiveMQ
project has chosen by vote to recommend Bruce Snyder as the Successor
to the post;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Hiram Chirino is
relieved and discharged from the duties and responsibilities of
the office of Vice President, Apache ActiveMQ, and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Bruce Snyder be and hereby
is appointed to the office of Vice President, Apache ActiveMQ, to
serve in accordance with and subject to the direction of the
Board of Directors and the Bylaws of the Foundation until
death, resignation, retirement, removal or disqualification, or
until a successor is appointed.

----------------------------------------------------------

Development:
* Development on ActiveMQ 5.12 is in progress.
* Development on ActiveMQ Artemis is in progress.

Trademark / Branding Status:
* Sub-projects need to be reviewed to make sure they are also
compliant /w TM policies
* Documentation and readme files will also be reviewed for compliance

Releases:
* Apache ActiveMQ 5.11.1 - 2/17/15
* Apache ActiveMQ 5.10.2 - 2/17/15
* Apache ActiveMQ-CPP v3.8.4 - 2/19/15

Enterprise Subsystem Archives (ESAs), made it into trunk.

The SPI Fly releases were successfully voted, but the voting thread wasn't
closed off in the usual way with a results tally. It looks like it was
closed on 2015/03/24 as stated above.

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Konstantin Boudnik]

## Description:
   A 100% community-driven Bigdata management platform.

## Activity:
 - PMC has voted new project committer Nate D'Amico with assignment to be
Apache Bigtop community manager, helping PMC with project outreach,
conferences and marketing materials. Vote thread http://s.apache.org/1Mf
 - Amazon EM2 team has reached with an offer to host Bigtop CI
infrastructure, which is CPU and RAM intensive. We are currently
investigating the options
 - As per project bylaws a new PMC Chair election has been started
   (vote thead: http://s.apache.org/B40; vote result: http://s.apache.org/Mla).
   Andrew Purtell was elected as the new Chair.
 - All other project activities were outlined in the March 2015 project
report to the board.

## Issues:
Following up on a number of discussion within this PMC and some of the now
former board directors the following "social media" guidelines were
developed in consensus with the project community
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BIGTOP/Social+Media+Guidelines
The consensus has been confirmed by two votes:
  http://s.apache.org/6i4 - Social media guidelines
  http://s.apache.org/gMc - Amending the guidelines w/ more precise language
The twitter account @ASFBigtop is now hosted on Twitterdeck where any community
member can be added and make posts as per the guidelines above. Hence the issue
seems to be fully resolved via normal community process.

Community & Development
=======================

Committer activity has remained low over this quarter though there have been
efforts from committers to get unstable automated builds working and we have
also been taking time to update the issue tracker to the latest version of
Bloodhound. This in particular has brought one of our original PMC members
into a position to increase his involvement in the project.

There have been a few long running INFRA tickets for work related to
Bloodhound that remain open. In particular access to a read-only nfs mount
of the bloodhound svn repository continues to be missing. However, no
attempt has been made to press for progress on this issue from the PMC.

In contrast INFRA were able to provide site monitoring for the main issue
tracker and demo sites in a reasonable time. This gives us good confidence
in the stability of the main issue tracker but appear to show that our demo
servers are struggling under their load.

Although we have been involved with GSoC for the previous two years, we did
not organise ourselves to continue for this year. It was also suggested that
we should put more effort into the integration of previous work before
considering taking on further students.

The user email list has increased in response to our release in December.
Discussions on the dev mailing list have also increased in comparison to
the previous quarter.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Gabriel Reid]

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running
MapReduce and Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

Project Status
--------------

The project has been moving at a similar pace to the previous quarter, with
20 new JIRA issues logged since the previous board report, with 15 of them
being closed in that time. The majority of the work on the project continues
to focus on maintenance.

The addition of a new committer was successfully voted on, but the person in
question decided to make a major career change just at the same moment, which
was an unfortunate loss for the Crunch community.

This report also marks the resignation (due to the term of one year being up)
of Gabriel Reid, the current PMC chair. There has been a successful vote to
recommend Micah Whitacre as the new PMC chair.

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Community
---------

Community activity continues to be similar with the previous reporting period.
The user mailing list was more active, with an average of more than one
message per day (nearly double of the previous reporting period), while
the dev mailing list activity has dropped slightly in comparison with the
previous reporting period.

Micah Whitacre was added to the PMC on April 3rd, 2014.
Micah Whitacre was added as a committer on July 11th, 2013.

Releases
--------

There were no releases made in this quarter. The last releases were:
* Apache Crunch 0.11.0, released Sept 10, 2014
* Apache Crunch 0.8.4, released Sept 13, 2014

   upcoming ZooKeeper 3.5.x

## Issues:
 - None

 - Last PMC addition was Scott Blum at Fri Aug 29 2014
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Scott Blum at Thu Aug 28 2014

Attachment R: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
   Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
   develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
   JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
   XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports
   such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.

## Activity:
 - Work is progressing to get 3.1.0 released, hopefully later this month
 - Work is also progressing to get CXF Fediz (WS-Federation project) 1.2
   released
 - In support of the above, lots of work around some new features related to
    management, metrics, logging, etc...
 - Lots of work with the WebServices project to get WSS4J updated to the latest
   OpenSAML release to support CXF 3.1.0.

## Issues:
 - No major issues at this time.   However, there was an "issue" last week that
   we are concerned about.   The process that is used to keep CXF's website
   up to date stopped working.  An issue was raised (INFRA-9328) on May 24th,
   it wasn't looked at at all (from what I can tell) for 50 hours when it was
   assigned to someone.   And then nothing.  On March 31st, I raised the
   priority to Critical as it was blocking SEVERAL projects (CXF, ActiveMQ,
   Camel, etc...) from getting sites updated.   Joe had it diagnosed 10
   minutes later, but the "fix" was not applied for another 26 hours.   So 9
   days to fix something that was causing problems for multiple projects.
   That's concerning.

## PMC/Committership changes:

 - Currently 35 committers and 22 PMC members in the project.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment S: Report from the Apache DB Project  [Myrna van Lunteren]

The Apache DB TLP consists of the following subprojects:
 o DdlUtils: a small, easy-to-use component for working with Database
             Definition (DDL) files.
 o Derby: an open source relational database implemented entirely in Java.
 o JDO: focused on building the API and the TCK for compatibility testing of
        Java Data Object implementations providing data persistence.
 o Torque: an object-relational mapper for Java.

== Status ==

Issues requiring attention from the board:

At this time, I'd like to gently alert the board to the fact that I have sent
a message to private@db to indicate my intention to resign the chair position
because of time constraints and to ask for a volunteer to replace me. This was
on March 23. No one has stepped up yet. It is now clear that the Derby
project, which was the most active of our subprojects until October 2014, is
suffering because key companies have pulled back their support of the
project. Although some people are still monitoring the lists, the effects are
very obvious. The last several PMC chairs (including myself) all have been
from the Derby project, and this well has now dried up. It seems possible that
taking on the responsibilities for all subprojects is a hurdle in finding a
replacement for the chair position. I will follow up on this when I have more
time to look into things.

Activities over the last quarter

a) The JDO community released JDO version 3.1. in March.
b) The Derby community has embarked on a Google Summer of Code project, with
   a mentor and student.
c) The Derby community is still answering questions. However, new development
   outside of GSoC has stopped.

No PMC changes since January 2014.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Kiran Ayyagari]

I have been elected as the new Chairman of the project. I have been
contributing to Directory project since January, 2008. I thank my
mentors and PMC for entrusting me with this duty.

Current Activity and Status
---------------------------

The last three quarters have seen an increased activity on almost all
of the Directory projects. After years of stable number of committers
and PMC members, we have added 5 new committers (all of them active)
and 2 new PMC members (and we are thinking about voting another in)

From the project point of view, we are still moving forward with stable
releases, but released as milestones. Hopefully, we can expect an RC
for the LDAP API soon, a couple of more milestone for Mavibot, followed
by an RC for ApacheDS. At the same time, we are cutting the first RC for
Fortress, which was added as a sub-project last September. The release
is currently blocked by a problem with Nexus, but that should be solved
quickly.

We do think that the new Kerberos server (Kerby) will be better
than the current implementation we have, and the goal is to simply
replace what we have with the new code. At the same time, we will
most certainly benefit from some of the modules of this project,
like the new ASN.1 codec, for ApacheDS. In the similar fashion,
Kerby might benefit from a stable version of Mavibot.

Studio is expecting to be released soon too. A new build system is put
in place, which lead to a lot of modifications. At the same time, many
additional plugins have been injected (template editor, OpenLDAP
configuration editor, and we also have a new contribution for an eDirectory
configuration editor).

There is an increased activity on the user and developer mailing lists.

We are quite happy with the recent evolution of the project!

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

In YARN, the next iteration of the TimelineServer, work on network shaping,
per-queue policies, and collecting node metrics for scheduling have made
progress. Work on erasure coding in HDFS continues. A design document for
the object store (HDFS-7240) also appeared. Activity is low in MapReduce,
mostly bug fixes and repairs for unstable tests. Overhaul of shell scripts
continues in Common, in addition to changes supporting pluggable
authentication and authorization.

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 40 podlings currently in incubation. There is another
climate project in discussion for incubation which is an interesting
continuation of the nascent trend of academic projects coming to
Apache. This may be a singleton due to Chris Mattmann's efforts, but it
would be an interesting development if it gathers momentum.

There is a new ASFIncubator twitter entity. It has little activity so
far, but has had a lot of followers jump on after Sally's announcement
on @ASF.

Datafu and ODF Toolkit are showing very low activity. This isn't
necessarily a serious problem yet, but may be a leading
indicator. Wave has previously had a warning, but may be doing a
little better.

  Updated SGA sent to secretary@a.o

  CommonsRDF SGA filed 2015-03-27.

  Zeppelin SGA submitted and acknowledged on 2015-03-20.

* Legal / Trademarks

  The old debate about how to submit SGAs for ALv2 projects with huge
  numbers of copyright holders reappeared with Groovy's SGA.  In the end,
  the SGA was signed by a single community member.

  Ambiguity around Legal Policy language on when optional GPL library
  dependencies are permitted caused confusion.

* Infrastructure

  The "Marvin" report reminders have not run in a timely manner for podlings
  for 4 months in a row.  A dedicated Incubator-specific replacement is
  being contemplated.

* Miscellaneous

  An official Twitter account for the Incubator was initialized but has not
  yet been used.  Access will be maintained via TweetDeck.

AsterixDB

Apache AsterixDB is a scalable big data management system (BDMS) that
provides storage, management, and query capabilities for large collections
of semi-structured data.

AsterixDB has been incubating since 2015-02-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Get SGA signed from UCI and others.
  2. Code drop and start actively using lists.
  3. Do an Apache release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No, still getting started.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Account setup is mostly done and code repositories are in place. Right now
  working mostly on the SGA to do the code drop.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Account and other infrastructure setup mostly done.
  SGA and code drop still open.

Calcite

Calcite is a highly customizable engine for parsing and planning queries on
data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access, and in
particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data not
residing in a traditional database. (Renamed from Optiq on 2014-09-30.)

Calcite has been incubating since 2014-05-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to build community
  2. Add more committers and PPMC members
  3. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among
     multiple project members

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  In March, there were 159 messages on dev@, 41 commits, 52 issues
  created, 37 issues resolved by 8 contributors.

  Julian Hyde gave a talk “Why you care about relational algebra (even
  though you didn’t know it)" about Calcite at Enterprise Data World in
  March. He also spoke at a Phoenix meet-up in San Francisco about
  Phoenix-Calcite integration.

  Collaborations are under way with other Apache projects:
   * Phoenix is going to use Calcite for SQL parsing and planning; and a
     separate project is using Calcite’s Avatica component to build a remote
     JDBC driver.
   * Added support for parsing/validating streaming SQL and collaborating
     with the Samza project on adding streaming SQL to Samza.
   * Collaboration with Hive and Drill continues.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We completed our milestone 1.0 release, continued our monthly release
  tempo with release 1.1, and are preparing 1.2.

Date of last release:

CommonsRDF


Commons RDF is a set of interfaces and classes for RDF 1.1 concepts and
behaviours.  The commons-rdf-api module defines interfaces and testing
harness.  The commons-rdf-simple module provides a basic reference
implementation to exercise the test harness and clarify API contracts.

CommonsRDF has been incubating since 2015-03-06.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the CommonsRDF Community such that we can progress
     towards gradution
  2. Further engage the podling with the nuances of the Apache
     Incubation process
  3. Drive towards the first incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  A SGA was recently filed with secretary@ and the CommonsRDF codebase now
  resides at the ASF with the canonical source residing at
  https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=incubator-commonsrdf.git

  Project is not yet decided on goal of TLP or Commons component - but still
  aiming at the Commons component.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There have been no new committers, however the overwhelming majority of
  project-related development conversation is already taking place on the
  Apache lists.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  CommonsRDF very recently joined the Apache Incubator. Bootstrapping and
  migration have quickly progressed (mailing lists, git, Jira) and the
  initial committer community is transitioning very well into the Apache
  incubator ecosystem.

  Web site remains to be sorted - evaluating technologies (considering
  INFRA's proposed CMS deprecation).

Date of last release:

  XXXX-XX-XX

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  N/A Commons RDF has only just joined the Apache Incubator.

Groovy

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

Groovy has been incubating since 2015-03-24

The most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. All the ICLA of all the PMC / Committers have been sent.
     Most Apache accounts have already been created.
  2. On behalf of the whole Groovy development team and the community,
     Guillaume Laforge signed and scanned the SGA, and sent it to Secretary
     on April 1st.
  3. We've communicated to the historical mailing-lists about the new lists,
     encouraging subscribers to join the new ones. The JIRA migration should
     be taking place over the week-end, and we'll also communicate with our
     community about that change. And last but not least, we need the Git
     repository to be created and import our current sources from Github.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No, just getting started.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Currently, the pretty large Groovy community is happy about the move into
  the ASF, but continues to be centered around our old infrastructure.
  That’s why we’re going to start attracting the community towards our new
  lists, to get them involved in this new era for the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  No last report, as this is the first!

Date of last release:

  We did a last non-Apache release as the vote for incubation was still
  ongoing, but we haven’t yet planned the next release dates.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No new elected PMC or committers.

    Quite a good start for a podling... Even the user mailing list starts to
    be active ! Waiting for the JIRA migration this week-end, and the code
    migration asap, then the podling will be almost fully setup, as soon as
    the web site will be available. Great work by the Groovy fellows, and
    the Infra peeps !

  John D. Ament:

     Project seems to be going well initially, doing the expected up front
     house keeping required considering the largish size of the code base.
     I would expect email volume to pick up quickly as the Codehaus services
     begin to shutdown.

Lens

Lens is a platform that enables multi-dimensional queries in a unified way
over datasets stored in multiple warehouses. Lens integrates Apache Hive
with other data warehouses by tiering them together to form logical data
cubes.

Lens has been incubating since 2014-10-10.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow user and developer community and add more committers
  2. Document all features and do one more release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  NONE

How has the community developed since the last report?

Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together
on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both
Hadoop and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Get ebay to donate the code to ASF. Ebay is willing and has done this
     before. The process is started, but will take time.
  2. Get ICLAs from all committers and give them Apache accounts and karma.
  3. Integrate with Apache infrastructure and make our first release.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None. Just getting started.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  First report. Now we have mailing lists and discussions have started on
  dev@. In addition to committers/contributors from the 3 initial
  organizations (ebay, MapR, Mesosphere), we have 5 more contributors from
  at least two different organizations.

  Gave presentations at Strata/Hadoop World and the March Bay Area Mesos
  Users Group and London MUG meetups. Upcoming presentations at ApacheCon,
  Data Science MD, and East Bay Big Data Group.

development of Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) Systems in a
variety of languages. In general the work is at least consistent with
or actually conforming to the OASIS XACML Standard.

OpenAZ has been incubating since 01-2015

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. Get ICLA’s from all the committers. So far AT&T and JP Morgan have done,
 but Oracle is taking more time.
2. Merging the source code from AT&T, JP Morgan and Oracle and creating
 POM’s. AT&T and JP Morgan source code has been merged and POM’s created,
 it needs uploading into the Apache repository.
3. Get our first release done.

Usergrid

Usergrid is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) composed of an integrated database
(Cassandra), application layer and client tier with SDKs for developers.

Usergrid has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to grow the Usergrid Incubating Community
  2. Clarify the SGA for Apache Usergrid Incubating codebase
  3. Drive towards another Usergrid incubating release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The Usergrid community has been working to clarify the status of the SGA
  for the Usergrid codebase. The original SGA listed a GitHub repo that did
  not include all of the source code that Apigee intended to grant. We
  are preparing a new SGA that will cover all code that is currently part of
  the project.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  In short, the Usergrid incubating community is healthy with loads of
  mailing list and development traffic from a growing community. Usergrid
  continues to see new community members making themselves known on the
  mailing lists.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Development is very dynamic. The codebase is being actively developed with
  correspondence taking place on the Usergrid JIRA instance. The processes
  and workflows for development are pretty solid now.

Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication.
It can be used like email, chat, or a document.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Wave is very close to making its first release.  This is the top
     priority.
  2. The project needs to determine what the next few technical goals are.
  3. The project needs to attract more developers and users.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been slow to develop.  There are still many people
  downloading and using the software, we have seen several bug reports and
  questions, but there has not been much contribution by new members.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The code for the release has largely been finalized.  We believe that
  major legal and technical issues have been overcome.  Only a few finals
  steps remain. The project believes that we are finally ready to make a
  release.

Date of last release:

  N/A

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Christian Grobmeier:

    The mentors have missed to sign this report last time. For that reason I
    am adding it again. Since last month there was some discussion on how to
    prevent the project going to the attic.

  Upayavira:

    We have received a GSoC application, and a committer has accepted the
    role of mentor. The task involves simplification of the codebase which
    will make it more accessible to others, hopefully facilitating greater
    involvement, as it seems the greatest impediment to Wave is the
    (over)complexity of its codebase.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

## Description:
   Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven
   applications in Java.

## Activity:

   Mailing list activity has been steady, while this quarter we also released
   v1.8.0, a major release of approximately 4 months development effort.

   Plans for v1.9.0 include tidying up and fully testing the code
   contribution from one of our user community [1,2] to update our dependency
   on DataNucleus; this will enable us to properly support JDK 1.8 (important
   with support for Java 7 about to end).

   We have also solicited quotes from the user community and have used
   these (with permission) to update the Apache Isis home page [3].

## Issues:

   After our last report Bertrand Delacretaz contacted the Isis PMC through
   private@i.a.o with two concerns.  The first related to the Isis Addons
   website: "from your report It sounds like the Isis PMC owns that external
   addons website, which we don't think is right."  The second related to
   our mention some corporate entities for whom some Isis committers are
   working: "independence from corporate entities and not paying for
   development work are core principles of the ASF".

   We replied to Bertrand on the private list to clarify the position.
   Without repeating the entire thread here, we committed to:

   1) explicitly state that Isis Addons is not directly related to Apache
   2) avoid mentioning employers in future reports

   Bertrand was happy with these assurances.

   I have since gone through the Isis website and ensured that any links to
   the Isis Addons website are followed by "(non ASF)", and there are
   explicit statements on the site [4].  There are also similar statements on
   the Addons site [5].

   Accordingly we believe there are no issues requiring board attention at
   this time.

## PMC/Committership changes:

 - Currently 11 committers and 11 PMC members in the project.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Martin Tzvetanov Grigorov at Tue Dec 16 2014

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Phillips]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

# Project Status

jclouds has carried out one successful release (1.9.0) in the last quarter.

After a quiet period during the 2014 holiday season, development activity has
picked up quite substantially at the beginning of 2015, with both Google and
Microsoft contributing resources to the project.

The latest release is also the first to make use of an almost fully-automated
release process, which will hopefully make it much easier to publish minor
versions on a more regular basis.

# Community

Last committer: 2014-07-30 (Andrea Turli)
Last PMC member: 2014-11-30 (Chris Custine)

# Community Objectives

* Ensure that functionality for the most widely used clouds works and is
  up-to-date:
  * Remove API and provider cruft (async APIs, stale providers)
  * Increase integration test coverage
  * Broaden portable abstractions
* Continue to support the ongoing contributions by new committers
* Provide example code demonstrating current best coding and design practices
* Create a more predictable "graduation path" for new contributions

# Releases

* 1.9.0 (2015-03-29)

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:

A framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data
applications in Java.

## Activity:

The project has one potential GSoC proposal in progress.

Amongst several major features in the last release, the project added
Jena Elephas (RDF processing support for Hadoop).  This has had interest
from users both during development and on release.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## PMC/Committership changes:

Attachment AG: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

## Description:
   Pure Java application for load and functional testing

## Activity:

The JMeter website has been refreshed to use a more modern design. This is
sensitive to the screen size, improving the readability on smaller devices
such as tablets and phones.

The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt with
promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter developers.

Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by the
committers.

The JMeter Twitter account has 1725 followers as of 8th April 2015.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## PMC/Committership changes:

Attachment AH: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos]

## Description:

   A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
        J2EE components (Java, servlets, JSP).

## Activity:

 - Again, slow pace of development, including (but not limited to) some
   interesting functionalities committed into trunk:
   * Portable builds of JSPWiki.
   * Complete rewrite of AJAX functionality.
   * JSPWiki configurable via environment variables, which allows easy
     dockerization.

 - Few questions at user@j.a.o, with their follow-ups, with dev@j.a.o mostly
   containing JIRA notifications.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

## Description:

The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for dynamic
programming languages. It is a "loose" C port of the Apache Lucene search
engine library for Java.

## Activity:

Development activity continues to focus on adding new language bindings, with
Go being the top priority and Python next in line.

A "Virtual MeetUp" via Google Hangouts is scheduled for Tuesday April 7.
It is hard to get Lucy's developers to congregate at an ApacheCon or another
conference; instead, we will attempt to build on our positive experiences
with the virtual Lucy Book Club.  Naturally, any discussions will be taken
back to the dev list, just as they would for an in-person MeetUp.

Commit activity for this quarter was below average.  The last several releases
were maintenance releases; making a feature release may provide a spark.

## Issues:

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## PMC/Committership changes:

 - Currently 14 committers and 13 PMC members in the project.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Mahout Project  [Grant Ingersoll]

Apache Mahout has implementations of a wide range of machine learning and
data mining algorithms: clustering, classification, collaborative filtering
and frequent pattern mining.

Project Status
--------------

The project continues to have a large and active user base.  The project now has
integrations with Spark and H2O execution engines, this is in addition to the
traditional MapReduce.  Integration with Apache Flink is next on the cards with
a possibly dedicated resource available from the Flink community to work with
Mahout.

The new integrations with H2O and Spark engines extend Mahout Machine Learning
to other more popular Big Data platforms.

Community
---------

* We have added 3 new PMC members: Pat Ferrel, Andrew Musselman and
  Andrew Palumbo

There is a healthy committer base to the project that are actively working on
the project on a voluntary basis. There is no dedicated full time resource
available for the project yet as most large scale Machine Learning libraries
cannot be built and sustained on voluntary contributions.


Community Objectives
--------------------

The project has an active committer base and there’s a renewed interest in the
project with the new Scala based Engine agnostic distributed linear algebra
library with bindings for Spark, H2O and Flink in the future. The project got a
shot in the arm with backing from Apache BigTop community and we are looking to
keep that momentum going for future releases.

The project is targeting more frequent minor releases and a major release once
every quarter.  While the 0.10.0 release is targeted for the week of April 7-11
2015, a subsequent 0.10.1 release is planned in the subsequent releases.


Releases
--------

The team is working towards Mahout 0.10.0 release targeted for the week of April
7-11 in time for ApacheCon North America 2015.


Issues
------
None now.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Maven Project  [Hervé Boutemy]

Apache Maven is a widely-used project build tool, targeting mainly Java
development. Apache Maven promotes the use of dependencies via a
standardized coordinate system, binary plugins, and a standard build
lifecycle.

* General Information

  * Work on plugin releases to define common 2.2.1 minimum Maven version
    and Java 5 requirements is near done: automated report [1] shows 48 plugins
    are ready from 49. The plan to start 3.x.x line of plugins with Maven 3 and
    Java 6 minimum requirements has been announced [2]: implementation will
    start shortly.

  * JIRA migration from Codehaus to Apache was done on April 5th: 60 Maven
    projects were migrated [3].
    The PMC thanks Codehaus for the support during this migration and more
    generally for the great service given to us for many years.
    The PMC thanks Mark Thomas, volunteer at Infra, for the huge work done on
    import.

  * There was a major Maven 3.3.1 release with new requirements:
    - Support for Win9x has been dropped
      -> mvn.bat has been renamed to mvn.cmd, as well as for mvnDebug
    - Java *Runtime* Environment 1.7 required
      -> Improved toolchains support, so plugins can still use older JDKs
         (e.g. maven-compiler-plugin)


* Community

  * Currently 54 committers and 27 PMC members in the project.

  * No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache MyFaces Project  [Gerhard Petracek]

The Apache MyFaces project is an umbrella project of the
Apache Software Foundation for projects relating to the
JavaServer Faces (JSF) technology.

Community
---------
 * No new Committers (since November 2013)
 * No new PMC Members (since July 2011)
 * No new Contributors

The MyFaces community is stable. Besides working on new releases,
we discuss upcoming topics.

-> Community business as usual (nothing special to report).

Releases
--------
 * MyFaces (sub) projects with new releases since the last report:
 * MyFaces Core 2.0.23 (12/January/15)
 * MyFaces Core 2.1.17 (12/January/15)
 * MyFaces Core 2.2.7 (12/January/15)
 * MyFaces Tobago 2.0.6 (24/February/15)
 * MyFaces Tobago 2.0.7 (22/March/15)

Issues
------
The TCK issue mentioned in our January report for 2014 still exists.
Werner Punz [1] and Leonardo Uribe [2] discussed the impacts of this issue and
the impacts are summarized as follows:
 * It reduces our marketability, since consumers are more likely to pick
   an open-source JSF implementation certified as
   "TCK-compliant" over a non-certified one.
 * It reduces our ability to be distributed as part of a Java EE stack,
   such as Apache TomEE and Apache Geronimo,
   since their TCK certification depends upon our TCK certification.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Nutch Project  [Sebastian Nagel]

Apache Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open source web crawler
software project. Stemming from Apache Lucene®, the project has diversified
and now comprises two codebases, based respectively on Apache Hadoop
data structures and Apache Gora for leveraging NoSQL databases.

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASES

There have been no releases since the last board report:
- Nutch 2.3 was released on January 24, 2015,
- Nutch 1.9 in August 2014

The release of Nutch 1.10 is planned to be soon after release
of Tika 1.8 which will fix a licensing issue of a library
dependency (TIKA-1581).


CURRENT ACTIVITY

We hope to participate in Google Summer of Code 2015
and have 3 mentors and 6 students registered.

Nutch is used to prepare datasets for the TREC Dynamic
Domain Track (http://trec-dd.org/) as part of Memex and
NSF Polar projects.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache ODE Project  [Tammo van Lessen]

Apache ODE (Orchestration Director Engine) executes business processes
written following the WS-BPEL standard. It talks to web services, sending
and receiving messages, handling data manipulation and error recovery as
described by your process definition. It supports both long and short living
process executions to orchestrate all the services that are part of your
application.

STATUS
In this reporting period we made some progress towards a 1.3.7 release and
improved our Jenkins CI builds. We also got three GSoC applications and will
enter the ranking phase soonish.

RELEASE
No releases in this reporting period.

DEVELOPMENT
We started developing a new monitoring console for ODE, based on AngularJS,
talking directly to the SOAP API. The console code is now in a separate git
project so that we can enter an independent release cycle. There are still
some minor issues to fix before we can make the first release. We have also
improved our Docker-based CI builds to that we can now reliably build our
branches again. We basically use Docker to avoid installing build dependencies
on Jenkins. Instead, we mount the working copy into the docker container and
run the build process within this container. This also ensures that the
environment is always under our control.

COMMUNITY
Nothing important to report. Last committer was added on Dec 10, 2012, last
PMC member was added on Jun 28, 2013.

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Jan Iversen]

## Description:
Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.


## Activity:
Andrea Pescetti resigned as Chair after 2 years in order to enable
a "rotating" Chair role (i.e., a change every 1-2 years). Andrea
remains an active PMC member. Jan Iversen was elected as new Chair
and the transition was smooth.

The mailing lists for users and the development list are fairly
active, while specialized lists see a lower, but steady, activity
(which is natural considering their specialized nature).

The support channels (users mailing list and official forums) are
very active as usual, thanks to the work of many of volunteers.

New volunteers for development show up regularly, but our lack of
mentors have made it very difficult to keep them active. The level
of commits on trunk remain low, only a few simple fixes have been
committed.

The challenging position as release manager remains open since
Jürgen Schmidt announced he wanted to resign as release manager.
Jürgen is still an active PMC member.

The 2 Mac (buildbot) delivered Q3 2014 from Infra are not
operational, but a little group of volunteers work on installing
the AOO development platform.

Proof of concept for Digital Signing was made mid. 2014, no further
work have been done. Once version 4.1.2 is ready for internal
testing, work will continue.

OpenOffice was present at FOSDEM (January 2015 in Brussels,Belgium),
with talks and had a table that was well visited. We look forward to
the idea of having an Apache Stand in 2016, where AOO want to be an
integrated part.

A BoF was held in CSDN OSTC (March 2015, China).

2 Volunteers worked on preparing a AOO track for Austin, in the end
it was decided not to make a track. Traditionally Europe is stronger
for AOO so we look forward to Budapest.

A major issue for AOO is the current activity level (practically no
development). The community only has a few active developers, which
makes a bootstrapping a challenge.

As always AOO wants to cooperate with derived project, and believe
derived projects benefit from a AOO with a high development level.
Talks are (as usual) ongoing and are currently focused on how
development in derived projects can be integrated in AOO and thereby
help the whole eco-system. Talks in particular with one project, has
been more intensive, but has currently not lead to any agreements,
except it is clear that a cooperation must be a win-win situation,
where AOO make changes adapting to the needs to the derived project.


## Issues:
The current CMS discussion based on a proposal to decommission the
tool and ask projects to find other solutions would cause a
significant problem for AOO. The AOO Web pages depend on the
features of CMS  that cannot be easily ported to other tools. If
Infra is to stop the service, AOO will need to either only maintain
only a few pages or run CMS on a project VM. The Board should
remember to look at the total cost of this change, not only the
Infra costs.


## PMC/Committership changes:
 - Currently 140 committers and 29 PMC members in the project.
 - New PMC members:
    - Jan Iversen was added to the PMC on Wed Feb 11 2015
    - Mechtilde Stehmann was added to the PMC on Sat Jan 03 2015
    - Dr. Michael Stehmann was added to the PMC on Sat Jan 03 2015
    - Dennis E. Hamilton was added to the PMC on Fri Feb 13 2015
 - Last committer addition was Tal Daniel at Tue Apr 29 2014


## Releases:
 - Last release was 4.1.1 on Thu Aug 21 2014

Even though AOO remains committed to bring out version 4.1.2, it is
only progressing slowly. It is decided this will be the first
digitally signed release. The slowness is due to focus on other
challenges (like electing a new chair) and to lack of  developers /
release manager.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Rave Project  [Matt Franklin]

Apache Rave is a widgets-based, web-and-social mashup platform.

ISSUES
Low community activity.

COMMUNITY
The community activity has continued to wane.  New contributors to the
list are being encouraged to contribute more. The existing community
needs to expand efforts to engage new individuals.

COMMITTER/PMC CHANGES
02/17/15 - Stanton Sievers was added as a new committer & PMC member.

RELEASES
01/07/14 - 0.23 released.

ACTIVITY
The list activity saw an increase in traffic and the community has laid
out a path forward.  Little progress has been made against it, but at
this point, it would be prudent to see the year through and if there is
no significant traction, re-evaluate the project's status.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Shindig Project  [Ryan Baxter]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Shindig is an Opensocial Reference implementation in wide use by
both social networks and enterprise software. Shindig graduated from the
Incubator in January 2010.

ISSUES

The Shindig PMC has no issues that require board attention.

COMMUNITY

The Shindig community has seen a noticeable decline in mailing list activity as
well as contributions to the code base over the past few months.  Some of this
might have to do with the OpenSocial Foundation being dissolved and portions of
the OpenSocial specification being taken over by the W3C
(http://www.w3.org/2014/12/opensocial.html.en).  The Shindig community has not
seen any contributions due to specification changes coming from the W3C since
the move has taken place.

COMMITTER/PMC CHANGES

No PMC member changes.

RELEASES

Apache Shindig 2.5.2 was released the 2014-10-26.  The community
is currently working towards a 2.5.3 release.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Kevin A. McGrail]

## Description: 
SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent
email filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited
bulk email, more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to
email headers and content to classify email using advanced statistical
methods. In addition, SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that
allows other technologies to be quickly wielded against spam and is
designed for easy integration into virtually any email system.

## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## PMC/Committership changes: 
   
 - Currently 26 committers and 7 PMC members in the project. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Joe Quinn at Sun Mar 02 2014 

 - We do not have any new people moving moving towards committer
   but do have commits and rules being discussed and passed through to
   current committers to vet and apply showing good community development
   health.  We are trying to encourage this more.

 - We have one mentor for GSoC, Kevin A. McGrail and one project 
   we are excited if it is chosen from Sarang Shrivastava:

   https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/org/google/gsoc2015/xlr_24/5629499534213120 

   He is an open source enthusiast from Motilal Nehru National Institute of
   Technology, Allahabad, India.

## Project Branding Requirements

  - IN PROCESS - Logos and Graphics : include TM, use consistent
  product logo on your site. The artist has finished adding the TM 
  mark to all our logos ready for publishing.

  NOTE: Will announce the new logo along with the powered by logo with
        the 3.4.1 release.

  - We have created the new Powered By logo for the press kit last week.

  - No decision has been made to register the trademark of the project.

## Activity

 - Releases: 
   
   - 3.4.0 was released on 2014-02-11.

   - 3.4.1-rc2 was release on 2015-04-16.  All blockers for this release are 
     closed and we are hopeful to announce a release in the next few days.
     Thanks to Sally and her work for the press release about the upcoming 
     release.

   - Our rules releases have continued and with 81 rule sets published since 
     the last quarterly report. 

 - We have some exciting ideas for what will likely be Apache SpamAssassin 4.0

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Jim Jagielski]

Apache Steve is a collection of tools and programs used by the
ASF to implement the STV voting system and tallying of results.

RELEASES

* No releases yet.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made no releases in the last quarter. A release vote for
Struts 2.3.22 test build was canceled, a vote for a Struts 2.3.23
release is currently underway.
The last GA release was Struts 2.3.20 (2014-12-07)

Within the last quarter we saw reasonable development and community
activity. Since moving to git based SCM along with our git mirror being
available at GitHub, we see an increase in pull requests issued by
community members contributing valuable patches to the project. In
combination with requiring JIRA tickets for pull request to be accepted
as contributions, we seem to a have a lightweight yet solid process in
place, enabling both for easy accessible contributions as well as
meaningful and documented code reviews and a well guarded patch
acceptance workflow.

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.
The PMC voted to invite Christoph Nenning (cnenning) to join the PMC, we
are currently awaiting his response.
Last PMC member addition was on 2013-05-11, last committer addition on
2014-01-06.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.7) has been released 2013-04-29.
  We have made available the a series of beta builds of the upcoming 5.4
  release, (most recently, 5.4-beta-26, on 19 Jan 2015), following successful
  votes.  A release candidate is expected in the coming quarter.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is fair. Questions are answered with
  participation of not only the core contributors but also by the community
  at large. Discussion focuses especially around new features of the upcoming
  5.4 release. There are also frequent announcements concerning third-party
  libraries developed entirely outside the Tapestry team.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4 which
  will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other new features.
  At this point we are primarily looking at fixing bugs (from our large backlog)
  and documenting the significant new features.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 25 Apr 2014, and
  subsequently been voted into the PMC (2 Mar 2015).

PMC and committer diversity

  PMC and committer diversity is good. To our knowledge no two committers share
  the same employer. Levels of contribution vary over time.

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org" - completed
 * "Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc." - completed
 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing
 * "Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in footers,
   etc." - completed
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo
 * "Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date" - completed

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Massimo Manghi]

Apache Tcl is an umbrella for Tcl-Apache integration efforts. Current
projects are

 * Rivet
 * Websh

Board issues:

 No issues relevant to the board

Community:

 The last committer and PMC member joined the project in
November 2014.

We tried to privately contact 3 PMC members who have been
totally inactive for very long time.
I asked them if they still had interest in
Apache Tcl or if they could see ahead any chance to
be actively involved. 

I will make one more attempt to have a formal resignation
statement to ease the procedures, but in case I won't have
it we will ask the board to have them removed from the PMC.
I want to stress that this is not meant to be an exclusion,
we would be happy to have them back on Apache Tcl if they
will find a renewed interest in Apache Tcl.

There is a similar issue with some committers. I will tackle
it soon.

Current number of subscribers to our public mailing lists are

rivet-dev@: 46 subscribers
websh-dev@: 15 subscribers

 + 2 bug reports were filed for rivet. Fixes for these bugs
are making urgent a rivet 2.2.2 bugfix release which is due
this month

Releases:

 + Rivet released version 2.2.1 on Jan 20 2015. A rivet
2.2.2 RC is under evaluation

 + Websh is maintained but no new artifacts were released after
3.6.0b5 (2009-09-24)

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Tez Project  [Hitesh Shah]

## Description:
  Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application
  framework which can be used to process arbitrarily complex
  directed-acyclic graphs (DAGs) of data-processing tasks and
  also a re-usable set of data-processing primitives which can
  be used by other projects.

## Activity:

  There has been decent activity over the past few months. The
  maintenance lines for 0.5 and 0.6 are going strong with
  various fixes. Users are looking forward to a new release of
  0.6.1 which hopefully should happen in the next few weeks.
  New enhancements such as making the more performant
  PipelinedSorter the default sort implementation as well
  as initial work on a PipelinedShuffle have gone into the
  master branch.  Branch TEZ-2003 created for work related
  to allowing Tez to co-ordinate execution with external
  services ( initial focus to work with Hive’s LLAP engine)
  The release for 0.6.0 ( with the emphasis on the Tez UI )
  went out in January. On a different note, although the PMC
  has been following the same implicit policies that had been
  applied whilst incubating, we are now finally getting
  around to formalizing them into the project by-laws
  (jira TEZ-2231).

## Issues:

 There are no major issues at this time that require the
 Board’s attention.

## PMC/Committership changes:

- Currently 33 committers and 31 PMC members in the project.
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
- Last PMC addition was Jonathan Turner Eagles at Mon Oct 20 2014
- Prakash Ramachandran was added as a committer on Thu Jan 08 2015
- Alan Gates resigned from the PMC in February, 2015, citing his lack
  of activity on the project and the presence of enough other
  experienced Apache people on the project.

## Releases:

- 0.6.0 was released on Fri Jan 23 2015

## Mailing list activity:

- dev@tez.apache.org:
   - 152 subscribers (up 7 in the last 3 months):

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Tika Project  [Dave Meikle]

What is Tika?
=========================
Apache Tika is a dynamic toolkit for content detection, analysis, and
extraction. It allows a user to understand, and leverage information from, a
growing a list over 1200 different file types including most of the major
types in existence (MS Office, Adobe, Text, Images, Video, Code, and science
data) as recognised by IANA and other standards bodies.

Issues
=========================
There are no issues that need the boards attention.

Releases
=========================
The last release (1.7) was made in January 2015. There has been much progress
since then with a release candidate for 1.8 currently being voted on.

Community
=========================
The Tika PMC added Luis Filipe Nassif in March 2015 and Giuseppe Totaro in
April 2015 as committers and PMC Members.

There are six talks related to Tika scheduled to take place at ApacheCon NA
2015.

Chris Mattman has registered to be a mentor for Google Summer of Code 2015
with some Tika issues marked as potential projects.

Mailing list activity on dev@ was at 445, 891 and 107 messages in February,
March and April 2014, respectively. user@ was at 15, 15 and 1 messages,
during the same timeframe.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services based on,
but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification and Java Enterprise
Edition Specifications.

Work on TomEE 2.0 remains slow as noted in the February report.  Work towards
Java EE 7 compliance is understandably difficult and the community is running
out of threads to pull on Java EE 7 without a TCK.  The TomEE 1.7.x branch
remains the center of the day-to-day.  Some fixes and minor enhancements are
in progress for a future 1.7.2 release likely to come out in this quarter.
The stability and gradual movement of the 1.7.x branch seems to be carrying
the project forward.

Particular new developments in the 1.7.x branch involve the addition of a
enhanced command-line library for managing TomEE.  It was added externally by
some non-committers in a Github project, however discussion has moved to the
Apache lists and we'll see if we can get the ideas added and potentially some
good new committers as well.

There has been some discussion in the community around Apache rules for
including snapshot downloads links in the website.  There is a page[1] that
includes them and features a red disclaimer.  Links to this page were recently
removed by request.  Looking at the Google Analytics project for the last 12
months, exactly 0.09% of the website traffic ever saw the snapshot page.  This
would seem to me be in an acceptable range.  With my VP hat on -- and barring
board disapproval -- I'm inclined to rule it responsible use and allow links
to be restored as it does appear to enable the right people yet still
discourage the general public.

Last release was 1.7.1 on 2014-09-15.  Last committer was added November 2013.
Last PMC addition was 2010-08-26.

Apache VXQuery implements a parallel XML Query processor.

ISSUES

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

STATUS

Apache VXQuery graduated from the incubator in July 2014. The paper that we
reported on was finished but has not been published yet. Apache VXQuery 0.5
was released incorporating the changes that were required for the paper.
Mailing list activity has picked up, mostly due to the release and interest
in Google Summer of Code.

COMMUNITY

All PMC members came in through graduation, all committers are PMC members.
The community is still small. Last committer (Steven Jacobs) was added in
September 2013.

COMMUNITY OBJECTIVES

Continued focus on completing the engine and on growing the community. In the
past Google Summer of Code has helped the project to grow, hopefully this year
will be similar.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Wookie Project  [Scott Wilson]

Apache Wookie develops software related to implementation of the W3C
Widgets family of specifications.

ISSUES
As mentioned in previous reports, activity in the project has declined and is
now at a minimum with some questions from users and implementers but little on
the development side  and also the community has not grown since 2013. The
reasons for this remain the same, in particular the lack of non-proprietary
adoption of the W3C widget specification.

FUTURE
Having said that, there have been some new use cases suggested in the
community which have lead to development discussions on the part of the
primary team.  One use case suggestion has been to develop a github link
allowing widgets to be directly imported from github thus facilitating an easy
mechanism to develop and deploy widgets outside of the wookie tree.


RELEASES
Wookie 1.0 was released on 24th February 2014.

ACTIVITY
Work is still being undertaken on Wookie 2.0.

COMMUNITY
Our last committer added was Steve Lee on 21st February 2013.

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Zest Project  [Niclas Hedhman]

Inception: 18 March 2015
Last PMC addition: 18 March 2015
Last Committer additions: n/a (In progress)

Description
    Apache Zest contains platforms and tools to explore the Composite Oriented
    Programming paradigm.

Activity
    3 weeks has passed since the inception of the project and being one of
    very few TLPs not coming from the Incubator, some smaller stumbling blocks
    were encountered by infra. But infra has been great, and we have gotten;
      -  Mailing lists dev, users, private and commits has been created
      -  Subversion repository for static HTML website has been created
      -  Git repositories has been created.
      -  Requests for Software Grants from all previous contributors have been
         sent
      -  Jira is set up.

Community
    The PMC had no objections to invite the previous contributors, and
    invitations has been sent out, including requesting ICLAs (standard invite
    letter). One previous contributor passed on the invitation (moved on to
    other things)

Mailing list activity
    Development discussions have started on dev@zest, and the Google groups
    one is quickly deserted.

Next Steps
    * Ensure IP is free of encumbrance.
    * Migrate website (incl re-design and branding compliance)
    * Import codebase
