 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       A discussion has started over the last month about potential updates
       to the bylaws, related to quorum requirements and the requirements for
       transition to and return from emeritus membership. This may develop
       into a concrete proposal in future months.

       As others detail in their reports, we have produced an annual report,
       which is great to see! Many thanks to all involved.

    B. President [Ross]

       We have confirmed a booth at OSCON and a number of folks have stepped
       forward to help staff the booth (Thanks Dennis Hamilton, Shane Curcuru
       and Roman Shaposhnik). 

       There is (at the time of writing) no report from Brand Management.
       However, Shane has informed me verbally of an organization that has
       indicated a concern about our trademark registration policy as it
       directly affects their business. In short this company has been asked
       to stop using its usual marketing materials in a geographic region as
       the associated Apache mark is not currently registered in that region.
       Given time during the discussion items I would like to discuss this in
       order to get guidance from the board.

       Marketing have published our first Annual report, something we have
       talked about producing for a number of years. In recent years a number
       of sponsors have asked for this information. It is fantastic to see
       this actually completed and I look forward to our VPs Fundraising
       providing feedback on its effectiveness. 

       This was an effort that involved coordinating across many offices. My
       thanks go to Sally for this work, as well as to all who contributed
       (Ross Gardler, Chris Mattmann, Rich Bowen, Jim Jagielski, Hadrian
       Zbarcea, David Nalley, and Shane Curcuru, as well as Daniel Gruno and
       Tony Stevenson of the ASF Infrastructure team, and Tom Pappas of
       Virtual).

       At the time of writing no report from Fundraising has been received.
       In this months financial package from Virtual a question was raised
       about invoices from May 2014 (totaling $200k) that remain unpaid
       despite (in two cases) the sponsors name still being present on our
       thanks page. I've asked VP's Fundraising to look into this.

       Infrastructure hit some problems with an SVN migration which resulted
       in some down time. The service was rolled back to allow for a proper
       diagnostic. Our two US based contractors have been moved to Virtual as
       a PEO.

       At the time of writing no report has been submitted by the Travel
       Assistance committee. With ApacheCon EU ramping up I expect to have
       reports in the coming months. Melissa reports the process has not yet
       started.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        The Treasurer's Office welcomes Jan Iversen and Kevin A. McGrail as
        our new Assistant Treasurer's. A meeting was held between the
        Treasurer, the two new Assistant Treasurer's and the former Assistant
        Treasurer Sam Ruby. There is some expected ramp up, and the new
        Assistants will begin helping write reports, interacting with Virtual
        and spelling Chris.
        
        The transition away from Wells Fargo is proceeding.  Currently the
        Treasurer's Office is working to transfer and close out the Savings
        & Checking accounts, and to wrap up any remaining connections to
        WFS. In addition, Credit Card statements have been downloaded from
        WFS for record keeping purposes. Citizens Bank is our operational
        account at the moment and bills/operational aspects are being paid
        out of that account.
        
        Monthly P&L reports are now being regularly sent out.  Thanks to
        Virtual for taking care of this.
        
        The Treasurer's Office contributed to the ASF Annual Report.  Thanks
        to Sally and team for pushing that forward.
        
        Amazon payments transition into the new donation system has been
        completed. There are remaining funds in Amazon Payments that Virtual
        will proceed to transfer into our operational account at Citizens.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       May was a busy month for secretary. In May 140 iclas, four
       cclas, and four grants were received and filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       The ApacheCon CFP for Europe is open for a little while longer (July
       1).

       ApacheCon dates for Vancouver have been published to the website, so
       that we can mark our territory in terms of dates. This was done due to
       the Strata conflict with EU. We've also attempted to establish closer
       communication with major conference organizations to prevent that
       happening again.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       I've discovered that I have an Action Item to get action items
       into the agenda for review and prodding :-P ... and will dig in
       for next month.

 8. Discussion Items

    Use of Apache Trademarks in marketing materials for non-Apache products
    potentially being blocked by our lack of registration in geographic
    regions.
    
    There is an organization that has received cease-and-desist in another
    country for marketing materials that reference Apache projects. The
    company that has issued the cease-and-desist has registered Apache
    trademarks in that country. 
    
    The organization is a significant sponsor of Apache. Long term, if they
    cannot market their association with Apache, Apache may get less support. 
    
    Ross: "If you market your product without mentioning Apache, you are not
    affected by this issue."
    
    Shane: "You should be able to mention Apache in your advertising. Apache
    should attempt to protect our marks, especially in countries that have a
    first-to-file trademark law."
    
    @Ross @Shane discuss how to move this issue forward

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, tm-registrations@, and board@) and following-up with
appropriate personnel 

OSCON:
• Our application for a booth in the non-profit pavilion has been accepted
• Contract signed and returned to the OSCON Team
• Currently working with the OSCON Team on the booth logistics
• Dennis Hamilton (AOO) has agreed to participate in booth duty again this
year, along with Shane and Roman.
• Giveaways have been discussed with Sally; we have agreed to eliminate the
current inventory, thereby no additional expenses will be incurred there.

ApacheCon and TAC:
• Nothing to report here – my involvement hasn’t started yet 

Misc:
• Collaborating with Sally on future events that having an ASF presence at
will be beneficial 
o Sally will poll the community to see who will be at what events, and if
there is any availability/willingness to have a booth; we will then prioritize
from there.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Fielded a very wide range of questions from projects and third parties alike
about branding policy and permissions.  Thanks to those members helping out on
trademarks@, especially folks surfacing questions from various private@project
lists for advice.

Several previously requested project registrations are currently on hold due
to administrative issues.

Approved the new names Apache: Big Data and ApacheCon: Core for the updated
ApacheCon branding used by LF.

Investigating a report that a notable contributor to Apache projects is being
threatened with legal action related to their use of our APACHE brand on their
products.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

This was a slower and uneventful month. We are waiting for payments from a
couple of sponsors.

I started to work on a list of potential new sponsors and finally doing some
outreach work, starting with a couple of organizations in the financial space.

Pending tasks:
* send letters to sponsors after the ASF's annual report
* research what happened with a couple of unpaid invoices from last year


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: All vendor payments are up-to-date with no outstanding

2 June, with thanks to Brett Porter, Ross Gardler, Chris Mattmann,
Rich Bowen, Jim Jagielski, Hadrian Zbarcea, David Nalley, and Shane
Curcuru, as well as Daniel Gruno and Tony Stevenson of the ASF
Infrastructure team, and Tom Pappas of Virtual. Sally worked with
Hadrian and David in recognizing PhoenixNAP on the ASF Sponsor
"Thanks" page for their donated products/services, and with PhoenixNAP
on their press release announcing their Sponsorship. Sally has also
assumed management of the @PlanetApache Twitter feed, which is now
following the accounts of Apache Committers and contributors, and
continues to solicit use cases and testimonials on behalf of Apache
CouchDB. The ASF video documentary produced by George Syrimis is in
the filming/interviewing process.

III. Press Releases: the following formal announcements were issued
via the newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org
during this timeframe:

- 02 June 2015 --The Apache® Software Foundation Announces Annual
Report for 2014-2015 Fiscal Year
- 19 May 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™
Drill™ 1.0

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 33 items were tweeted on @TheASF. No new videos
have been updated on the ASF YouTube channel. 5 Apache News Round-ups
were issued, with a total of 36 weekly summaries published to date. 

V. Future Announcements: We are waiting to hear back from two projects
that requested assistance with issuing a formal announcement. Projects
preparing to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs
wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for
more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution. 

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 11 media requests, including two
weeks of background/fact-checking for the Wall Street Journal. The ASF
received 955 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip
count of 496. 

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst queries. Apache was
mentioned in 29 reports by Gartner, 8 reports by Forrester, 23 reports
by 451 Research, and 3 reports by IDC. Sally received a preview copy
of the Forrester report on Cloud platform standards that included
Apache CloudStack. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally finalized edits for The Linux
Foundation's announcements for the new "Apache: Big Data" and
"ApacheCon: Core" events in Europe, and has been helping promote their
respective CFPs.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally continues to
work with Ross and Melissa Warnkin on the ASF's presence at future
events, and has secured a keynote speaking opportunity for Joan
Touzet, who will be presenting "Evolve or Perish! Improving OSS
Communities The Apache Way" at the Texas Linux Festival. In addition,
she is working with Rich and ComDev on promoting future MeetUps and
related regional events, and is preparing the ASF's presence at OSCON
with Melissa.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 13 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and continue to receive gratis
news release distribution in the UK by Pressat.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
n/a

Finances:
==========
$3150 - cloud related expenses
$17.49 - domain renewals

Operations Action Items:
========================
n/a

Short Term Priorities:
======================

SSL
---
The issues reported last month seem to have been dealt with 
earlier in the month. 

SVN
---
Disk usage on our SVN host became an issue. We attempted a 
service migration to a cloud-based host with more storage. 
We migrated the service and then discovering problems that 
weren't found in testing; rolled back. 

Long Range Priorities:
======================

Automation
----------
Moving to RTC for our configuration management code has been 
an interesting exercise, it certainly hasn't found all of our
issues but is forcing cognizance of what and how folks are getting
things done. In addition we are seeing a number of issues fixed 
during review, before they get pressed into service. 

Resilience
----------
We made little progress on improving our resiliency this month. 

Technical Debt
--------------
We made little progress on reducing our technical debt. 

Monitoring
----------
This month has seen a sharp rise in false positives in monitoring. 
This naturally adds to the workload of the oncall person, and is 
frustrating. Work is ongoing to reduce the amount of false positives
that wakes folks up. 


General Activity:
=================
As of June 1, Chris Lambertus and Geoff Coreys are now 
employees within the Virtual PEO.

groups, and also for relicensing of unfinished specs.

This is not the license for published specifications.

  software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
  to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
  which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
  the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Deepal Jayasinghe]

The Apache Axis project is responsible for the creation and maintenance of
software related to the Axis Web Services frameworks and subsidiary
components. Axis project consists of multiple sub projects: Axis2 (Java),
Axis2 (C), Rampart (Java), Rampart (C), Sandesha, Sandesha2 (C), Savan, and
Axis.

Community
=========

Level of participation on developer community is none, and board raised
several concerns on health of the project. User community was somewhat active
but level of participation was significantly low compared what it used to be.

Releases
========================
No major releases for all the core and sub projects. Axis2 Java was waiting a
release from WS project (Apache AXIOM) and it came available on 6/12/2015. Now
we will push forward an Axis2 release (probably the last release before moving
to attic). Alone with Axis2 many of other sub projects will also have their
own releases.

Last releases:
Axis2/Java: April 2012
Rampart/Java: April 2012
Sandesha2/Java: April 2012
Axis2 Transports/Java: December 2009
Axis/Java: April 2006
Axis2/C: Apr 2009
Rampart/C: May 2009
Sandesha/C: Oct 2007
Savan/C: May 2007
Axis/C++ 1.x: March 2006

Issues
===========================
Due to the lack of developer participation Axis project cannot stand alone,
one possible proposal would be to merge Axis with WS PMC (it was the case
before), in the same time if Synapse community thinks they can also move to WC
PMC, we should be able to get enough level of active participation.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Andrew Purtell]

Apache Bigtop is software for integration, packaging, deployment, and
validation of Apache big data ecosystem components.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASES

The last release was version 0.8.0, released on Oct 5, 2014. 

ACTIVITY

The project rebooted its CI infrastructure with Docker and several EC2
cloud instances. All costs of these instances are defrayed by a generous
grant of these resources from Amazon.

Development activity for the upcoming 1.0 release is almost complete.
The release was blocked by the CI overhaul.

The project has placed the Twitter @ASFbigtop account under joint
management via TweetDeck. Several members of the PMC are able to tweet
using the account.

COMMUNITY

Nate D'Amico was added as a committer on 3/24/2015.

Olaf Flebbe was added to the PMC on 6/8/2015.

Evans Ye was added to the PMC on 6/8/2015.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matt Benson]

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
The Apache BVal 1.1.0 release vote passed on June 9, 2015. The formal release
process continues.

### Activity ###
A small flurry of activity has brought the 1.1.0 release to pass. Because Apache
BVal's semantic version numbers are intended to track the version of the Bean
Validation specification targeted, this has resulted in the 1.1.0 release
(implementing Bean Validation 1.1) actually having preceded a 1.0.0 release,
which remains outstanding.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.
Last PMC member added Q4 2013
Last committer added Q3 2013

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.

   it's the preferred place for these committers.
 * We are focusing the development of the next minor release Apache Camel
   2.16.0.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Sebastien Goasguen]

Project health score as reported by reporter.apache.org: 10 (super healthy)

## Description:
    Apache CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud
    orchestration platform.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich Stärk]

## Description:

The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects

## Activity:

ComDev's SVN repository has been opened up for every Apache committer, mainly
due to interest in contributing to projects-new which is constantly improving.

ComDev is also now home to reporter.apache.org, a tool written by Daniel Gruno
that allows to pre-fill board reports with statistics gathered from different
sources.

Jim had made intros between Infra and Sourceforge, who offered to create a
neighborhood to replace Apache Extras. Dave N was handling that and then asked
that someone else take it on, at which point Jim grabbed it again. Jim needs
to follow-up.

Rich Bowen has written some scripts extracting Apache-related events from
meetup.com and is providing the general public with the results at
http://apache.org/events/meetups.html.

Google Summer of Code has started with coding commencing until Aug 21. We have
56 projects accepted this year - an all time high.

ApacheCon:

CFP for the "apache: bigdata" event in Budapest has been officially opened and
runs until july 15. CFP for the "apacheCon: CORE" event in Budapest has been
officially opened and runs until July 1.

Initial response from the PMCs have been good (5 of 14 track days are marked)

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Deltacloud Project  [Marios S. Andreou]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment V: Report from the Apache DirectMemory Project  [Raffaele P. Guidi]

Apache DirectMemory is an off-heap cache implementation for the JVM

* General Information

We had only one contact on the developer's list since april. A formal votation
has been made about retiring to the attic and it held only 3 votes (all in
favour of retirement). Some team members discussed proposals to improve
documentation in order to improve our appeal to developers and a call for help
has been submitted to the developers list but nothing much happened. I
proposed to step back as PMC chair but no one volunteered to take over the
role

* Issues
Development is stuck since long time and developer's appeal is lost. No one, 
including me, seems to have time to devote to the project. I honestly think 
it's time to retire the project or, at least, for me to retire as PMC chair

* Committers or PMC members change 
Last added PMC PMC member was Noctarius (Cristoph Engelbert) on 2013-09-25

* Releases
Release 0.2 has seen the light on 2013-09-17

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex SDK 4.14.1 was released on 3/30/15.
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7 was released on 3/6/15.

-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache Flex Installer 3.1.0 was also released on 7/14/14.
-Apache FlexJS 0.0.2 was released on 7/17/14.
-Apache Flex FalconJX 0.0.2 was released on 7/17/14.

ACTIVITY
The past couple of months saw a dramatic increase in activity related to
FlexJS, a version of Flex that is independent from the Adobe Flash
Platform. Two new committers have joined in and at least two long-time
committers increased their participation significantly. Meanwhile, other
committers are working on the Installer, various bug fixes to other Apache
Flex releases and better Maven integration.

Adobe also donated a set of Flex documentation. That is being updated for
our web site.

COMMUNITY
-Josh Tynjala and Kevin Godell were added as committers.
-Latest analytics include a little less than 2000 hits per day on the website
during the work week (less on weekends). We are seeing a slight downward
trend.
-There were more than 6000 installs of Apache Flex 4.14.1 since its release
about two months ago.
-Almost 60,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application. Tour De
Flex is a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex
applications.

TRADEMARKS
-We discovered that yet another apacheflex.com site has been created.  
The last time (September 2013) it was resolved easily, but I guess 
someone else grabbed and is now using it.  We are currently drafting a
“friendly” email that we will send to an email address on their web site.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Giraph Project  [Avery Ching]

Attachment AB: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Gump has learned to use msbuild/xbuild and NuGet to build .NET
projects.

Gump seems to create useful results for the few projects that use it.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

One of the projects (XMLUnit.NET) built by Gump recently switched to
msbuild/xbuild as its build tool so we had to catch up.  This also
required us to support nuget's command line as a build step.
Currently the support just provides what the project asks for - which
is not the way Gump would be expected to work.  Given the only project
using it doesn't have any dependency on any other project built by
Gump it is unlikely we'll make the implementation more "Gumpy".  With
the move of XMLUnit.NET there no longer is any project using Nant as a
built tool left in the set of projects built by Gump.

As more long running test projects have been added, we needed to
change vmgump's configuration back to perform four runs a day rather
than three. A single run of Gump currently takes about eight and a
half hours. So the setting of "three" in fact meant that we would only
manage two per day.

=== Mailing-List Statistics ===

general@gump.apache.org:
Currently: 49 subscribers (no change in the last 3 months) (92 emails
sent in the past 3 months, 138 in the previous cycle)

commits@gump.apache.org:
Currently: 20 subscribers (no change in the last 3 months) (94 emails
sent in the past 3 months, 142 in the previous cycle)

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

With 4 new podlings and no graduations, the Incubator has grown to 43
podlings this month -- up from 31 one year ago, but still well shy of the
record 57 set in 2012.

We had some issues this month with Sentry's latest release and
engagement.  See the miscellaneous section for more details.

There are several podlings that seem to be having trouble coming
together. These include log4cxx2 and kalumet.  We will keep an eye on
these for now and initiate discussions about retiring the podlings as
appropriate.

Otherwise, there are no particular issues that warrant board
attention.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

    Jarek Jarcec Cecho
    Bill Rowe (rejoining)

* New Podlings

    Atlas
    CMDA (Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer)
    MySOS
    Trafodion

* Graduations

    None this month.

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

  johnzon-0.8
  kylin-0.7.1
  ranger-0.5.0
  TinkerPop 3.0.0.M9


* IP Clearance

  Sebastien Goasguen, Ian Duffy, and Darren Brogan donated gstack to
  Cloudstack.  gstack is an API wrapper that maps the Google Cloud Platform
  compute engine (GCE) API to the CloudStack API.

  Sebastien Goasguen, Ian Duffy, and Darren Brogan donated ec2stack to
  Cloudstack.  ec2stack is an API wrapper that maps the AWS Elastic Compute
  Cloud (EC2) API to the CloudStack API.

  Adobe donated the Sling HApi Tools, which provide a set of Hypermedia API
  tools for Sling.

* Legal / Trademarks

  There was much debate about the name of the new MySOS podling on Incubator
  lists and elsewhere.  The Incubator voted to accept the podling, since
  project name choice does not block entry into incubation.

* Miscellaneous
  
  Several mentors for Sentry have expressed concerns about the
  podling's engagement with the incubating process. Mentors are in
  dissent with the podling's self-report, and are recommending that
  the podling be moved to monthly reporting until concerns are
  addressed. Since the self-report was not signed off by the mentors,
  we have not included it in this report and will include it in
  subsequent reports as the mentors synchronize with the community.

  A proposal to incubate the Freemarker template engine is under discussion.

  The question of whether or not podlings may have official blogs came up
  and was discussed with both Press and Infrastructure.  Past rulings have
  been inconsistent.  The situation was resolved by establishing that
  podling Mentors must review posts prior to publication.

Brooklyn

Brooklyn is a framework for modelling, monitoring, and managing applications
through autonomic blueprints.

Brooklyn has been incubating since 2014-05-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community
  2. More diversity of the committers/PPMC (currently biased towards
     employees of a single organization)
  3. Following up our first release with further, regular, releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our community continues to grow slowly but surely, and every month
  receives interest and contributions from new community members. In
  particular, Brooklyn's recent integrations with Cloud Foundry have
  brought some interest from that community into ours.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code continues to be proposed and merged at a high rate. We are
  satisfied with our technical velocity.

  We plan to follow up our December release with a further release
  as soon as we can, and following this up with regular releases.
  We plan to add binary convenience bundles to our next release and
  have been working on complying with the appropriate licensing
  documentation for this purpose.

Date of last release:

  2014-12-23 (apache-brooklyn-0.7.0-M2-incubating)

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No change since 2014-07-02.

CommonsRDF

Commons RDF is a set of interfaces and classes for RDF 1.1 concepts and
behaviours.  The commons-rdf-api module defines interfaces and testing
harness.  The commons-rdf-simple module provides a basic reference
implementation to exercise the test harness and clarify API contracts.

CommonsRDF has been incubating since 2015-03-06.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Build community.
  2. Further engage the podling with the nuances of the Apache
     Incubation process
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  See community section.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community still needs to find a discussion mode based on
  consensus and compromise.  Certain techncial issues in RDF
  lead to entrenched positions (this is not unique to the podling;
  there are such long discussions outside ASF).

  This has lead to a lack of energy and one person stepping back
  from the project in this reporting period.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project made its first release on 2015-05-15.

Date of last release:

  2015-05-15

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  None added so far.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

rvesse - The strong differences of opinion over some aspects of RDF are
as reported by the podling causing some issues and they have yet to find a
satisfactory way to build consensus and move forward on some of these.  As
noted this is not unusual in the wider world, even within the ASF we have
5 different TLPs that use RDF who between them use 3 different APIs each
with very different world views so building that cross project consensus
and moving forward on releases has the potential to be a blocker to
progress and graduation.


--------------------
Corinthia

Corinthia is a toolkit/application for converting between and editing common
office file formats, with an initial focus on word processing. It is designed
to cater for multiple classes of platforms - desktop, web, and mobile - and
relies heavily on web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for
representing and manipulating documents. The toolkit is small, portable, and
flexible, with minimal dependencies. The target audience is developers wishing
to include office viewing, conversion, and editing functionality into their
applications.

Corinthia has been incubating since 2014-12-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Discuss and decide on a medium-term roadmap
  2. Finalize source structure change (easy access for new developers)
  3. Get the first release out


Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

   None.



How has the community developed since the last report?

  Discussion are now taking place between more people, signalling that
  the knowledge on the code base is being distributed.

  The period has in general been a bit quit, where people have developed
  more than discussing.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The ODF filter is well underway.

  The 64bit windows version is going through the last round of polishing.

  The Qt edtitor interface is starting to take shape.

Geode

Geode is a data management platform that provides real-time, consistent access
to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud
architectures.

Geode has been incubating since 2015-04-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Expanding the community to include contributors and committers
     outside of Pivotal
  2. Execute and manage the project according to governance model
     required by the "Apache Way"
  3. Have our first Apache (incubating) release (currently blocked
     on us solving JGroups licensing issues)


Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The project had around 350 messages and around a 100 different people
  joined the discussions on the mailing lists, covering all sorts of
  topics, from development model to new features.

  ICLAs for initial committers are filled and processed.

  The wiki has been kept up to date based on mailing list discussions,
  with processes for:
   - Code Review and submissions
   - Branching and versioning
   - Code of Conduct

     (Review-Then-Commit) policy initially and re-evaluate after some
     iterations.
   - Jenkins nightly builds are setup
   - DockerHub account with a nightly build
     - https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/apachegeode/

Groovy

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

Groovy has been incubating since 2015-03-24

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

1. We still have to get our new release process ready for making our
  first release under the incubator banner, but progress has been made
  towards that goal already.  
  
2. We need to continue encouraging our users to use our new resources
  at Apache instead of using the old ones at Codehaus, but most
  remaining resources or assets from Codehaus have been moved or
  closed.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No particular issue right now.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community seems to have followed the move to our new home, as
  for example we're not seeing emails on the old lists anymore.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Ongoing incremental improvements and bug fixes.

Date of last release:

  No release yet, but progress being made to make our build process to
  comply with Apache rules.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  One new committer has joined the team: Andrés Almiray.

  And we are inviting two other committers to join us, so hopefully
  next month, we should further expand our community.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

The project is in good shape! The new committers addition is a good sign.

Two remarks though :
  
- The web site is still not linked to Apache, there is a bit of work
  to do in this area.
  
- There is not a lot of discussion on the dev list. If some of those
  discussions are conducted on a side channel, it's important to move
  such discussions to the dev list. Otherwise, I think that the
  current committers are quite busy with their new day job, that would
  explain this.

Thanks, keep going the good job!


--------------------
HTrace

HTrace is a tracing framework intended for use with distributed systems
written in java.

HTrace has been incubating since 2014-11.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Continue to grow the HTrace community
  2. Continue to develop and release stable HTrace incubating artifacts
  3. Continue to explore the integration of the HTrace framework into
  other Apache products

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

 A few new folks have showed up on the dev and user lists of late.

 Lively dev discussion on lists about:

 * The 3.2.0 release.
 * HTrace and CI
 * HTrace and JDK7 minimum
 * A meeting and discussion of GUI going forward
 * How to accommodate github pull requests

Johnzon has been incubating since 2014-06-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Expanding the community, increase dev list activity and adding new
     committers/pmc members
  2. Complete the project incubation status page
  3. Add and improve documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * Nothing

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There are new people on the dev list and the project got contributions
  from non-committers.  On the dev list there are approx. 32 msgs (on
  average) messages per month.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project did its 5th incubator release.
  During the last three month 8 jira issues were reported and fixed.

Date of last release:

log4cxx2

Logging for C++

log4cxx2 has been incubating since 2013-12-09.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Create a release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Not grown. However, the project aims to become a sub project of Apache
  Logging again.  Community growth is not much a matter for this podling, as
  long as there are a few active contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Not much: There currently doesn't seem to be any public development, though
  support is given and bugs are tracked.

Date of last release:

  2008-04-03 was the last official, pre-incubation 0.10.0

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  P. Taylor Goetz (ptgoetz):

    It appears the attempt to reboot the lo4cxx2 project by re-incubating is
    failing, and the podling is not making any progress in terms of releases
    and community development.

    The primary stated goal of the last few reports has been to produce a
    release, but the dev@ mailing list is largely devoid of any release
    discussions (the last mention of a release was 12 Dec 2014 [1]). The
    current report is a word-for-word copy of the last report, and there has
    been only one email from a mentor in the last 5 months (to discuss the
    incubator report).

    I noticed that the podling does not appear to have (that I could find) a
    private mailing list (possibly an oversight from when it returned to the
    incubator?), which I think it would need for discussing new committers/PPMC
    members, retiring, etc. I'm assuming they are relying on private@logging
    for private discussions, which may not be appropriate for a podling.

--------------------
MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and
Flink.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase the number of active committers
  2. Increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list activity

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None

How has the community developed since the last report?

There were no new developers or new committers since our last report.
We have presented our project at ApacheCon NA in April. The talk was
well-attended and some developers from other Apache projects expressed
some interest in collaboration, which resulted in discussions at the
dev@mrql list and new JIRA issues.

How has the project developed since the last report?

We have created a GitHub mirror and synchronized it with the existing
Apache git repository and with JIRA. The GitHub mirror allows to
merge git branches easier and provides a better integration with JIRA.
We have added more features to MRQL Streaming (such as, new input
stream formats) and have fixed various bugs.

Date of last release:

  2015-02-25

project around and have taken steps to attract new committers to the
project.


--------------------
Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together on
the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both Hadoop
and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Fill out ip-clearance form and donate the Myriad code to ASF.
  2. Grant committers karma, migrate the code and issues from github.
  3. Figure out how and when to release a new "version" of Myriad.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

SAMOA

SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most
common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification,
clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop new
algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs).
It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on several DSPEs
such as Apache Storm, Apache S4, and Apache Samza.

SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Roll an Apache release
  2. Elect new PMC members
  3. Grow the community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

Two of our current PMC members (Olivier and Matthieu) have new jobs
and have declared that they will not be able to actively contribute to
the project for the moment being. This leaves 4 active PMC members.


How has the community developed since the last report?

  Mailing list activity (March-April-May 2015):
  * @dev     375 messages

  Jira issues backlog (March-April-May 2015):

  * Created:  14
  * Resolved: 19

We have had contributions from outside the PMC.
In particular, we have been collaborating with the Apache Flink community.

Our main goal is still to grow the community, which is still pretty
small.  To achieve this goal, we are doing a large amount of
dissemination work in conferences and events to promote SAMOA.


How has the project developed since the last report?

We are fully operational on the new infrastructure:
* Completed migration of issues from old GitHub repository.
* Completed migration of documentation from old wiki.

* Created new Confluence wiki with roadmap and contribution
  instruction:
  https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SAMOA/Samoa+Home

Main developments:
* New adaptor for Flink integrated.
* Simplified the website and solved several bugs.
* Preparing for our first release in June.

We should increase the rate of technical contribution to the project
and move to less incremental ones.  Codebase still need cleanup to
ease adoption by new contributors.


Date of last release:

None, plan to have one in June.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication. It
can be used like email, chat, or a document.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We are still working on first release. Several votes were
  attempted, however, we were slowed down due to unfamiliarity with
  release process and last second technical issues with the code.

  2. Need to grow up community.

  3. Make effort to lower entrance barrier for new contributors which
  is pretty high due to steep learning curve.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

None at this time.


How has the community developed since the last report?  While people
are in general interested in the software - we see traffic on demo
servers and bug reports, but we have only limited contribution by new
members.


How has the project developed since the last report?

We had a few votes on the release - each time issues were found and
fixed. We are working on a new wiki for the project to allow new
contributors a better access to the project information.  Also we
cleaned up the issues in Jira and categorized them in order to allow
potential contributors to find a potential task easier.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in 
C#  and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

As last reported, we were concerned with the stagnant nature of our PMC. 
That concern is fading as we've seen a large uptick in community involvement
from both the current committers/PMC members as well as the greater community.


- Our website refresh has stalled, I will look to revive this over the next
quarter. We'd like to have a refresh with the 4.8.0 release

Pushing on 4.8.0.
- Approximately 30 commits in the last quarter to move our port along
- Currently we have ~80 failed failing tests to fix (down from ~120 last
report) as well 
  as some additional libraries that help users make the most of Lucene.Net 
  (Suggest, Analysis, Highlighters, QueryParser, Codecs and a few others)


== Crowdfunding ==

Previously we mentioned that one of our PMC members was looking to crowdfund
some of his development time. However, took up a new full time job while we
were sorting out some of the specifics. We currently have no knowledge of any
plans for this at this time

== Releases == 
Last Release 3.0.3 - Oct 2012 Working toward 4.8.0

== Statistics == 
Last PMC Member Added, Paul Irwin, October 2013 Two
committers added Jan '15 - Laimonas Simutis, Feb '15 - Wyatt Barnett

Nuget package downloads: 
Lucene.Net 3.0.3: 160246 (up from 133926)

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache MRUnit Project  [Brock Noland]

DESCRIPTION

MRUnit is a Java library that helps developers unit test Apache Hadoop
MapReduce jobs. Unit testing is a technique for improving project quality
and reducing overall costs by writing a small amount of code that can
automatically verify the software you write performs as intended. This is
considered a best practice in software development since it helps identify
defects early, before they're deployed to a production system.

RELEASES

The last release of Apache MRUnit was version 1.1.0, released on
June 8, 2014. This was MRUnit's second release since graduation in May 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

0 JIRA's was resolved since the last report.
Mail traffic is largely on the DEV list.
Messages since April 1st: dev 4, user 3 (all in April)

COMMUNITY

The composition of the committers and PMC members has not changed since
the last report.
Currently there are:

Total of 40 subscribers to the developer list.
Total of 79 subscribers to the user list.
Total of 13 committers
Total of 13 PMC members

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard.

A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014. We plan to make a new
minor release soonish ( OLTU-171 - Release a new version of Oltu ( Open) ). We
have extended the coverage for the IETF JOSE specifications (that is strictly
correlated to OAuth 2) as JWS
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-36). The
current intention is to extend the coverage to the JWE part. Users activity is
growing slowly but steadily (the user@ mailing list has got new messages from
new users). We got some feedback from some users about our not too clear
documentation. Hence we are planning to improve this area. A presentation
about Apache Oltu was given for JUG Basel : "OAuth Hacks - A gentle
introduction to OAuth 2 and Apache Oltu"
(http://www.jug.ch/html/events/2015/oauth_hacks.html)

COMMUNITY

PMC composition has not changed since graduation We have voted one new
committer Jasha Joachimsthal in January 2015  (31/01/2015)

Attachment AW: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe M. Chiasson]

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since 2014-12.

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

Steve Hay has taken the role of release manager for mod_perl-2.0.9 and
produced 3 RCs so far. The current RC3 was made on June 10th and is looking
pretty good, with only some known Windows issues.

I expect to see mod_perl-2.0.9 to be released shortly.

Steve Hay deserves special credit for his great work driving this forward.

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites that can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

As planned, prior to the release of mod_perl-2.0.9, a new release
of Apache-Test was made.

Apache-Test 1.39 was released on Apr 21, 2015

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Apache-SizeLimit 0.97 was released on Apr 02, 2012

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since 2014-12.


--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Apache-Bootstrap 0.07 was released on Jul 13, 2009

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since 2014-12.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Apache-Reload 0.13 was released on May 09, 2015


-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

Apache-DBI 1.12 was released on June 12nd, 2013

No new Apache-DBI releases since 2014-12.

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
fixes are applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

Work on the httpd-2.4 branch has come to a standstill, as all work on that
branch completed and was merged into the trunk.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, except for the ocasional
obscure bug report, or general user questions.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened since the last report.

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

## Description: 
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet 
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
   usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
   robustness of the Java platform.
   
## Activity: 
 - Activity remains low this quarter.  Very little User list activity, but
   definitely some bugs fixed and new development going on, mostly from
   one developer (myself).
 - I have reached out (just lately) to the ComDev members for help with
   building the Pivot community.
   
## Issues: 
 - The move by Google to eliminate Java applet support in the Chrome
   browser further diminishes the utility of IIAs in general, so this
   is definitely a concern for the project.
 - Still have not heard from ComDev about what Apache Extras is going
   to do.  We need a decision before our next Board report is due.
 - We have just heard of an issue in Europe (specifically Italy) where
   websites that use cookies are required to document this, provide a
   privacy policy, etc.  Have requested official ASF policy about this
   because it seems that many ASF project sites are involved.  The Pivot
   site specifically uses Google Analytics.
   
## PMC/Committership changes: 
 - Currently 9 committers and 6 PMC members in the project. 
 - No new changes to the PMC or committership since last report. 
 - Last Committer Piotr Kolaczkowski (pkolaczk) was created 09 May 2012.
 - Latest PMC Changes:
   Roger Whitcomb (rwhitcomb) was added to PMC on 27 Oct 2011,
   Martijn Dashorst (dashorst) went Emeritus in July 2012,
   Greg Brown (gbrown) went Emeritus on 10 Sept 2013.

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA is picking up. We had some new 
contributions and one new contributor filed iCLAs specifically for contributing 
to Apache ServiceMix. We also have been giving a talk about ServiceMix during 
an Open Source Day conference in Warsaw.

We have released the second preview of ServiceMix 6.0.0, which is based on 
Karaf 3.0.x and includes numerous new features. We have also released the next 
maintenance release 5.1.5 and the transition releases between 5.1.x and 5.4.x 
line. We have also provided 2 sets of OSGi bundles and 1 set  of OSGi-fied
specs.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------

June.  After the 6.0.0 release, the goal will be to make the branch 6.0.x as a
new stable line of ServiceMix. 

For the beginning of June we also plan the next stable release 5.4.1
containing minor depenecy upgrades and bug fixes, and the next release 5.5.0
based on Karaf 2.4.x containing upgrades to the newest dependencies and some
new features. We plan to keep a steady release schedule and keep up with new

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- No new releases since our previous 1.2.3 bugfix release on
  25 February 2014.  2.0 development work is still in progress, but
  the team has not indicated a concrete release date.  There are
  some backwards incompatible changes that need to be vetted before
  a release is feasible.

Community & Project:

- Mailing list traffic remains steady compared to last quarter.

- Efforts towards a 2.0 distribution remain active on a separate dev branch.

- Project is mostly stable and in maintenance/bugfix mode until a 2.0 release
  can be made.  No significant feature development is planned on 1.x.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache SpamAssassin Project  [Kevin A. McGrail]

## Description:
SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam. It is an intelligent email
filter which uses a diverse range of tests to identify unsolicited bulk email,
more commonly known as Spam. These tests are applied to email headers and
content to classify email using advanced statistical methods. In addition,
SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows other technologies to be
quickly wielded against spam and is designed for easy integration into
virtually any email system.

## Issues:
 - Any guidance on how to get sensitive passphrases/credentials to more
   members of the project who live in far flung parts of the world short of
the lengthy circle of trust process?  Is there some sort of verification
service we can leverage?  Registered mail service that requires identification
and makes it a crime to tamper?

## Board Q&A:
- The board requested input about the lack of promotion to the SA PMC.  The
  following response was submitted on 4/22/15 by the chair:
"The lack of promotion to PMC is likely not a valid concern at this time.  As
a project, we are consistently trying to get more committers and hence more
people on the track for the PMC.  I won't sugarcoat things though because
people aren't beating down our door to become committers though and there is
considerable brain drain caused by private enterprises hiring away talent.

However, with that said, our advancement policy at
https://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/ProjectRoles is being followed and
committers have been invited to the PMC but declined to accept.

And we have invited several people to initiate CLAs and we are mentoring for
the GSOC with one project with the hopes that they will become regular
contributors.   I have also been reviewing open bugs and submitted patches to
try and get the hurdle of CLAs solved so we can accept more contributions from
a more diverse crowd of programmers.

Perhaps it would be good to add to the reporter tool the number of CLAs
processed by the secretary on behalf of projects?

In conclusion, we are aware of the issue and this email serves to remind the
PMC to diligently promote new contributors, contributors becoming committers
and committers becoming PMC.  We know our community is very important to the
long-term viability of the project.

Any PMC members, please feel free to add or object to my statements."

## PMC/Committership changes:
  - Currently 26 committers and 7 PMC members in the project.

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment.

The project is doing well but on a slow level. Main issue at the moment
may be that there is no one who is cutting releases from time to time.
The last release was cut one year ago. The project is aware of this
issue and is working on it.

For the first time in the project's lifetime the number of subscribers
on the dev list has dropped by about 10 subscribers.

Subscribers on the dev list: 226

Releases:
  UIMA Ruta 2.3.0 released, with better integration with Maven,
  extensions and simplification of the rules language,
  improvements to analysis engines including the HtmlConverter,
  and many bug fixes. http://uima.apache.org/news.html#08 June 2015
    
Other Activity:

A major potential contribution was posted to our Jira, which reimplements
much of the "innards" of UIMA core using more standard Java constructions,
in an attempt to support better concurrancy on processors with large
numbers (e.g. 64) of cores.  This work is a proof-of-concept, and is
being evaluated.  The community has asked the donor to submit a
software grant so we can take this through IP clearance and put it into our
SVN for further study and evaluation.

This has prompted some new wiki pages documenting various ideas, tradeoffs,
and diagrams explaining some of the more subtle points about UIMA innards.
These are on our confluence wiki.  As a side note, a big thank you to
infra for the upgrades to the wiki, in support of nice diagramming tooling!

3 people including 2 PMC members gave UIMA-related talks at Apachecon 2015
in Austin. We heard from one person that they attended ApacheCon just to be
able to meet with the UIMA team.  One person subsequently has started
contributing to the project. 

Based on an ApacheCon talk which suggested talking with your community
where they like to talk, more people have started responding to UIMA
questions on StackOverflow, a popular website for these kinds of questions.

We have agreed to participate in the documentary video about the ASF;
a video call is planned for later this month.

Besides UIMA Ruta (which had a release), UIMA DUCC is progressing toward
a next release, and core UIMA development continues to be quite active.

Community:

The community continues to be moderately active.  A new person has started
committing improvements to one of the core UIMA tools.
 
Issues:
No Board level issues at this time.

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

There were a few minor commits in the last three months but it's
been fairly quiet on the development front. We are long overdue
for a release but need volunteers to help with that.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 40 posts on the j-dev
and j-users lists since the beginning of March 2015.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is Xerces-J
2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

Xerces-C 3.1.2 was released on March 19th, fixing several defects
and addressing a security vulnerability.

Mailing list traffic has been moderate; roughly 120 posts on the
c-dev and c-users lists since the beginning of March 2015.

The latest release is Xerces-C 3.1.2 (March 19th, 2015).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development activity
over the reporting period.

XML Commons

No activity of the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in February 2015 (Xerces-C)
and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

No new PMC members in the last quarter. The last two additions to
the PMC were in May 2010.

Three committers committed changes to SVN in the last quarter.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.

Attachment BT: Report from the Apache Zest Project  [Niclas Hedhman]

Inception: 18 March 2015
Last PMC addition: 31 May 2015
Last Committer additions: 26 May 2015

Description
    Apache Zest contains platforms and tools to explore the Composite Oriented
    Programming paradigm.

Activity
    The second/third month of Zest has been dominated by bringing in the
    external codebase, start ensuring that NOTICE files are constructed
    correctly, migrating the website, and general clean up. Development on new
    features has begun. [Edit] The geospatial query capability that is being
    added, sparked Chris M to invite collaboration with Apache SIS. Still
    early, but could be fruitful.

Community
    3 committers have been added in this month, and one new member (Jiri
    Jetmar) has been added to the PMC.

Mailing list activity
    Dev mailing list discussions are slow, but healthy.

Board Raised Query
    In previous Board meeting, a discussion around the IP cleanliness was
    raised, and Sam requested that we should share our experience on this
    matter. First of all, we would like to know "how to share", and secondly,
    before the project came to ASF, we tried to stick to an Apache-compatible
    approach as much as possible. Therefor, we were not overly worried about
    importing the codebase, but we are slowing ensuring that all of the ~100
    individual components have its attribution correctly marked. We are also
    trying to automate this process.  Finally, we are still uncertain about a
    Neo4j extension, which may be dropped due to a unclear GPL dependency, and
    Neo Technology doesn't seem to want to clarify.


Next Steps
    * Ensure IP is totally free of encumbrance.
    * Plan release 2.1, hopeful for July
    * New Apache branded documentation. (New Zest logo proposed)
