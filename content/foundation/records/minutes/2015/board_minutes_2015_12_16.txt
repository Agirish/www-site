 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       First up, apologies to those I've missed emails from recently - I've
       been running quite behind for the last few weeks.

       Aside from that, nothing specific to report from the last month.

       In January, I'll propose a date for the next Annual Members Meeting,
       so that we can aim to hold it in March again. I intend to run this
       past the board list shortly.

    B. President [Ross]

       Lots of housekeeping work this month, but nothing warranting board
       attention.

       I am meeting with an existing sponsor later this week to discuss the
       directed sponsorship model. The sponsor in question is not
       dissatisfied with the existing model but is keen to understand what
       options are available to them as they have an interest in helping the
       PMC fund and organize community events. I will work with VP
       Fundraising if there is interest in moving forwards with an
       experiment.

       Executive Assistant
       --------------------------

       A fairly normal month for our EA. Lots of  "eyes and ears" activities.
       Plenty of hands on work with TAC.

       Melissa is trying to use the experimental application built by Ross
       and Rich (within the ComDev project) to pull Apache related meetups
       from meetups.com and publish them to the website. There are some
       technical difficulties to be resolved in the process but with some
       manual intervention from Rich we now have a regularly updated meetups
       calendar at http://www.apache.org/events/meetups.html (actually this
       has been live for some time, and Sally has beein including the info in
       her weekly roundups since June, e.g.
       https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/date/20150619, but I don't think
       it has been reported before). 

       Brand Management
       ---------------------------

       Further evidence of success in the ongoing decentralization efforts
       are seen within the Hadoop PMC who are called out as having
       successfully managed some recent trademark issues. The IPMC is also
       complimented on efficient handling of trademark searches.

       Interestingly another foundation is drawing on our VP Brand
       Managements experience as they further refine their own trademark
       policies. A testament to the work done here in the ASF by both the VP
       Brand Management and the foundation as a whole.

       Fundraising
       ----------------

       Two sponsors have decided not to renew in the last month. Neither
       cited any dissatisfaction with the foundation. A third sponsor has
       been identified as "at risk". VP Fundraising reports that this should
       not have a significant impact on the budget and the financial models
       provided by Virtual seem to confirm this. However, I have requested an
       analysis of the impact and will add it here, or report verbally, if it
       comes in time for this months meeting. Otherwise I will address this
       next month.

       Marketing and Publicity
       -------------------------------

       Mostly business as usual, although there is an issue with
       "non-media-related phone calls with customer (usually end-user) issues
       with certain Apache projects/products, the majority related to of the
       presence of Apache-powered products on mobile devices/apps, with a
       high number of calls received at non-business hours."

       I am trying to understand the scale of this problem and discussing
       solutions with Sally.

       Sally has submitted two alternative logo designs resulting from
       feedback collated from the initial designs shared earlier. Generally
       speaking both designs have been received well. The next stage will be
       to incorporate them into the recently completed site redesign. This
       work 
       includes rolling out a visual system, which will translate our new
       logo 
       across all ASF assets, from the Website to "powered by" graphics to
       the 
       annual report, as well as provide the feather glyph for projects
       wishing to 
       update their own logos. As always Sally will be progressing at a 
       manageable pace and seeking input from the Membership at appropriate 
       points.

       Infrastructure
       ------------------

       The "Merge all the Things" experiment with the Whimsy project is
       causing some churn in the GitHub integration tooling. However, it is
       progressing well (see Whimsy report for more information). 

       The board previously undertook an action to provide more clarity on 
       expected git usage patterns, this action has been completed.

       After a "disappointing" report last month in that critical services
       fell below the SLA for the first time we see it rebound this month to
       a fantastic 99.98%. Other services remain above SLA and continue to
       improve with the "all services" uptime being an excellent 99.93% (SLA
       is 98%).

       Work on the new mail infrastructure is progressing well, with a
       changeover planned in the next few months.

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ---------------------------------------

       No report submitted at the time of writing.

       Christofer Dutz has joined TAC. Chris is a recent TAC recipient and
       brings new ideas and energy to the committee.

       TAC applications for Apache NA is now open. The committee is focusing
       on expanding beyond the existing ASF community in an attempt to
       attract people genuinely new to the ASF. However no revisisions to the
       application process have been made at this time, the intent is not to
       change to many things at once.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        The Treasurer’s Office is reviewing paperwork from a book publisher
        regarding donation paperwork and working with VP Fundraising to
        determine how/who/if it should be signed.
        
        Virtual has turned over the Quickbooks file, questionnaire and
        supporting documents to the contracted CPA.  A 2nd extension was
        filed before December 15th. Review is anticipated in January 2016
        with the 990 to follow shortly thereafter ahead of Mar 15, 2016
        final deadline.
        
        The Treasurer’s Office is working with Virtual to set up a telecon
        before EOY to review the variances that we are seeing in the expenses
        as compared to budget.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The tool to detect discrepancies in the contributor license agreements
       has been useful to help ameliorate the problem. Notices were sent to
       all people whose ICLA was unaccounted for. Thirteen of the missing
       ICLAs have been resubmitted.

       In November, 69 iclas, seven cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       On November 25th, we sent a CFP announcement to all dev@ and users@
       lists, and the submissions are trickling in.

       We are in the quiet period before the storm. We expect to see talk
       submissions ramp up in January, leading up to the February deadline,
       and we will, accordingly, start pushing the CFP particularly hard at
       the beginning of the year.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       Sent a couple emails with my "hat" on, but nothing of substance to report.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

ApacheCon and TAC: 

The TAC have been working on a plan to attract more newbies and more students.
One way in which we are doing this is by having past recipients complete a
“TAC Interview”.  This interview is a questionnaire consisting of a few
personal questions, and a list of 13 questions that we ask that they choose
between 2-4 to answer.  The request was sent out to the last two ACEUs and the
last two ACNAs (43 total), and we’ve received 8 responses back.  We are going
to post these “testimonials” on our website, and also have them linked to the
LF’s site - these details remain to be worked out. Application questions have
been revised to make some areas clearer. TAC Application announcements have
been revised and sent out. Working w/LF on areas that need improvement between
TAC/LF.

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

A very wide variety of questions on trademarks, including many thoughtful 
requests from proposed/new podlings for assistance on helping them vet their 
incoming project names; great to see IPMC folks really connecting the dots 
on this issue early on.  Also, kudos to Hadoop PMC for working on addressing 
some third party issues recently.

Litographs, a t-shirt vendor we have a licensing agreement with is working on 
getting more big data related Apache project logos and codes on their products.

I'm working on processing several trademark registration requests for projects.
Will work with President to submit one PMC's justification for spending on 
their international registrations.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

This would have been a good quarter, we acquired a new (gold) sponsor [1]. We
do have a few promising leads and I am reasonably confident that we will get
new sponsors in the coming months.

Unfortunately, we lost another sponsor [2] and I have concerns that we may
lose another one. For the year, we do have new sponsors: one platinum, two
gold and two silver, so there are no reasons for concerns. We do have ongoing
conversations with other potential sponsors as well, however seeing sponsors
leave is a personal frustration for me.

The bulk of the renewals is from Dec to May and I hope we won't have any
surprises.

Last year we sent a Thank You (mass) email to our sponsors. Jim (I think)
indicated that we did have problems with our sending of mass email (in the
sense that a few recipients did not receive it). The free edition of the CRM
tool does not have support for direct email campaigns, so I will find a
different way to do it this year. I will put together the draft in a next days
and send it early next week. I was also on the fence if to ask the board to
provide the budget to upgrade to a paid version, but this conversation needs
to take place in a different context. Such a request may pop up in a future
report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget; Sally Khudairi is negotiating an
extension and renewal to our press release distribution service, as we
have a small handful of pre-paid releases remaining.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally is working
with a new Platinum Sponsor regarding promotion, and has also been
coaching the communications/marketing teams of several organizations
involved with existing Apache projects as well as podlings in the
Incubator. Now that the Foundations Operations Summary for FY2016/Q2
is out, she is beginning organize the Third Quarter report (November
2015-January 2016). Sally continues to work with Fran Lukesh of
LucidWorks and Lisa Dae of HotWax Systems on the new ASF logo, and has
forwarded the two options for the final logo to the ASF Membership for
their vote. The final logo and comprehensive visual system are
targeted for completion at the beginning of the New Year.

III. Press Releases: the following announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during
this timeframe:

- 8 December 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™
Kylin™ as a Top-Level Project
- 1 December 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation announces Apache™
CloudStack™ v4.6
- 27 November 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Operations
Summary: August-October 2015
- 23 November 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation Announces Apache™
Brooklyn™ as a Top-Level Project

IV. Informal Announcements: 3 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 19 items were tweeted on @TheASF. 5 Apache News
Round-ups were issued, with a total of 65 weekly summaries published
to date. No new videos have been updated on the ASF YouTube channel.

V. Future Announcements: two announcements are currently in
development. Projects planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator
as well as PMCs wishing to announce major project milestones and/or
"Did You Know?" success stories are welcome to contact Sally at
<press@apache.org> for more information. Kindly provide at least
2-weeks' notice for proper planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 7 media requests. The ASF
received 840 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip
count of 1,335.

VI-a. Public Relations: Sally continues to receive a number of
non-media-related phone calls with customer (usually end-user) issues
with certain Apache projects/products, the majority related to of the
presence of Apache-powered products on mobile devices/apps, with a
high number of calls received at non-business hours. Sally continues
to explore options for a dedicated phone line for ASF-specific queries
that will allow for more efficient screening; a dedicated "help" page
on apache.org that addresses such queries is also being considered.

VII. Analyst Relations: no analyst queries were received at this time.
Apache was mentioned in 23 reports by Gartner, 8 reports by Forrester,
18 reports by 451 Research, and 10 reports by IDC. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: no formal activities are planned at this
time. Sally is working with the Apache Travel Assistance Committee on
the application process and getting the word out with educational
institutions.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally has placed
an ASF Member at a 10-division corporate event in Germany. No other
formal activities are taking place at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 2 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and are working on a service
extension to the current contract. We also continue to receive gratis
news release distribution in the UK by Pressat.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
None this month

Finances:
==========
N/A

Operations Action Items:
========================
N/A

Short Term Priorities:
======================
- The M.A.T.T (Merge All the Things) project for Whimsy is progressing, albeit
  hindered a bit by the need to change our entire setup on GitHub. We expect
  this to be solved within the next reporting period.
- We discovered an error one of the monitoring systems we use (a faulty
  configuration) which had been preventing it from notifying us of some issues
  such as a bad disk. This has been rectified and hardware replacement should
  happen before the board meeting.
- We are in the middle of moving a lot of VMs away from our old vcenter setup to
  the new infra provider, LeaseWeb, as well as upgrading them, which will clear
  out a lot of technical debt.

Long Range Priorities:
======================
The mailing system switchover is scheduled to happen within the coming months,
with tests being performed at the moment to port lists form the old ezmlm system
to the new mailman 3 system. We are preparing to stress-/scale-test the new
setup.

We are looking into replacing our current backup plans with more affordable ones
while still retaining a hardware-managed solution. This will hopefully cut our
backup costs in half in the long run.

General Activity:
=================
* Lack of responsiveness
  We've noted that our responsiveness to email on infrastructure@ has suffered
  of late, resulting in dropped work items and failing to meet expectations.
  While we certainly don't want to manage work via email (far too much of it)
  it's clear that a number of issues were being lost in the sea of email. We've
  reinforced that the responsibility of insuring we are responsive to emails
  falls to the on-call staff member of the week, and hope to see this situation
  improve.

* people.apache.org moving to home.apache.org
  There has been some discussions going on about the decision to decommission
  the current people.apache.org server and move to a new machine. Most
  discussions have revolved around specific methods of access (rsync, scp, sftp)
  and some poeple have asked why the old data was not copied over verbatim. We
  are looking into whether RSYNC and SCP can become a reality - so far, our
  search has shown it's not an easy task to couple those with LDAP) We are not
  actively looking into copying everything from minotaur (the old host), as it
  would fill up most of the disk space with unnecessary files (very low signal
  to noise ratio).

* code signing service
  Discussion has begun about discontinuing the code signing service. Despite a large
  number of projects requesting the service, to date, only two projects are making use
  of the service. Moreover, in the past year, we've had a grand total of 34 signing events.
  The conversation on whether offering a code signing service remained pragmatic with
  such low uptake began on infrastructure@ - Symantec was notified that we plan to
  discontinue the service, and has asked to be allow to submit a less expensive option 
  for our consideration. 

Uptime Statistics:
==================
The November-December period has been extremely smooth sailing with uptime
across the board reaching the fabled 'three nines' (>=99.90%) and uptime for
critical services nearly hitting 100%. For more in-depth detail, please see
https://status.apache.org/sla/

Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Nick Burch]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report this month.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

As noted in last month's report, the official ASF release policy was
ratified and published, and can be found at:

    https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html

Thanks to all who helped.

On a non-legal list, someone asked about the possibility of submitting
a modified SGA. They were asked to refer the question to the legal lists
but, as of this writing, I have not seen the query.

There are no items requiring board attention.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Apologies for lack of report last month and late report this time, due
to a process issue (the trigger to commit the report used to be the
"Is Now Due" mail which have not been received in recent months).
However, there were no significant issues to report.

Given recent issues with some teams ignoring security reports, the
team has started going back over older reports and ensuring they have
been handled by the respective PMCs.

Stats for Oct 2015:

1     Support question
3     Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
7     Phishing/spam/proxy/attacks point to site "powered by Apache" or Confused user due to Android licenses

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Allura Project  [Dave Brondsema]

## Description:

Apache Allura is an open source implementation of a software forge, a web site
that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, wiki pages,
blogs, and more for any number of individual projects.

## Issues:

- No issues needing board attention.

## Activity:

 - A previous contributor is active again, learning our development process and
making more contributions.
 - Fixed some minor licensing header mistakes.
 - One release.
 - Some discussion and helping of users / installers of Allura.
 - Ongoing discussion, tickets, development, news announcements from the active
committers.

## Health report:

 - Activity is on par with previous quarters.  New contributor is interested in
GSOC already, so that's good.  A few less votes on most recent release compared
to prior, which is disappointing but one data point doesn't make a trend.

## PMC/Committership changes:

 - Currently 12 committers and 12 PMC members in the project.
 - Heith Seewald was added to the PMC on Fri Mar 06 2015
 - Heith Seewald was added as a committer on Fri Mar 06 2015
 - A new PMC/committer voted successfully last quarter, but they declined it
(they were done with their Allura work).

## Releases:

 - 1.3.2 was released on Tue Dec 08 2015

Attachment B: Report from the Apache Any23 Project  [Lewis John McGibbney]

Description: 
   Anything To Triples (Any23) is a library, a web service and a command 
   line tool that extracts structured data in RDF format from a variety of Web 
   documents. 
   
Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
Activity: 
 - Any23 activity for the quarter has been typically slow. The community
   has not really been able to ride off of a successful GSoC project however
   we are currently disucssing the release of the 1.2 codebase as 12 issues
   have been fixed since 1.1. 
   
Health report: 
 - Any23 is a small community with out primary consumers being communties
  outside of TheASF. To this end we aim to keep our parsing and extraction
  implementations up-to-date with Standards... we are doing well on this front.
  Mailing lists are always quiet so it is clear that we are not doing a great
  job at growing community. 
   
PMC changes:

## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Successfully released 0.10.0, expecting 0.11.0 shortly after the new year.
 - Recent work to provide RPM/deb packages have been successful, but needs
   more towards documentation and examples.

## Health report:
 - Mail/commits/issues have been active (slightly less so than the previous
   report period, which may be attributed to end-of-year slump).

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Bigtop Project  [Andrew Purtell]

Apache Bigtop is software for integration, packaging, deployment, and
validation of Apache big data ecosystem components.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASES

Last release was 1.0.0, released on Mon Aug 10 2015

ACTIVITY

The bigpetstore-flink implementation was presented at Flink Forward in
Berlin. [1]

Bigtop artifacts are running as an integration test for the Google Cloud
Platform/kubernetes, which indicates pickup of Bigtop outside of the
Hadoop ecosystem as a generic tool for testing data driven workloads.

IBM donated a VM on a POWER machine for porting Bigtop to the POWER
hardware architecture. Porting is still in progress.

After some churn due to sponsorship changes we finally have a stable
Docker-based continuous integration environment and convenience binary
artifact storage hosted on donated Amazon EC2 resources, to better
support project development.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Brooklyn Project  [Richard Downer]

Description: 
  Apache Brooklyn Project is a software framework for modeling, monitoring
  and managing cloud applications through autonomic blueprints.

Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
Activity: 
 - Brooklyn continues the good level of activity that we saw before our
   graduation. Code is being contributed and merged at a regular pace, and
   new users continue to appear on the mailing lists.
 - We are moving through the post-graduation task list. Our main focus is on
   migrating our source code repository; we are using the move from incubator
   to TLP as an opportunity to reorganise our source code from a single
   monolithic repository to a small number of repositories focussed on
   distinct modules of the project. This work is almost done.
 - As soon as the graduation tasks are complete, we aim to release a new
   version (0.9.0) as soon as possible.
   
Health report: 
 - With regular code contributions and merges, new users on mailing lists,
   and turnover of JIRA tickets, we are satisfied with the health of the
   project.
   
PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 11 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added since our graduation last month.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Julian Hyde]

## Description

  Apache Calcite is a highly customizable engine for parsing and
  planning queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows
  database-like access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced
  query optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database.

  As a framework, Calcite’s audience is fairly small, consisting
  mainly of developers building data engines (Drill, Phoenix, Hive for
  example).

  Calcite graduated from the Apache Incubator on October 21, 2015.
  Since graduation, we have completed the transition incubating to
  top-level infrastructure, appointed two new committers, and made one
  release.

## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity:
 - 1 release since the last report in November.
 - We fixed the branding issues mentioned in the last report; the web
   site now complies with the branding guidelines.
 - List, JIRA, and commit activity are at or above average.
 - Release 1.5 took a bit longer than average; we expect release 1.6
   will be on the shorter side. This release has no grand goals, but
   contributors are contributing improvements in their own particular
   areas of interest: improved constant reduction, streaming, support
   for sequences are examples.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 13 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added since graduation

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 11 committers.
 - New committers:
    - Josh Elser was added as a committer on Sun Nov 08 2015
    - Wei (Maryann) Xue was added as a committer on Sun Nov 08 2015

## Releases:

 - 1.5.0 was released on Mon Nov 09 2015

Attachment L: Report from the Apache Cayenne Project  [Andrus Adamchik]

## Description: 
  User-friendly Java ORM with tools 

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 
Development effort continues, although at a slower pace than in previous
periods.  We should review our progress and consider finalising the 4.0
release cycle.

## Health report: 
Cayenne is a mature product and it would be fair to say that none of the core
developers have significant itches to scratch, so development is slow.
However, no user questions go unanswered and there are no significant bugs
which require attention.

## PMC changes: 

- Currently 7 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
- Last PMC addition was John Huss on Fri Dec 07 2012 

## Committer base changes: 

- Currently 20 committers. 
- No new committers added in the last 3 months 
- Last committer addition was Savva Kolbachev at Tue Jan 20 2015 

## Releases: 

- Last release was 4.0.M2 on Thu Mar 19 2015 

## Mailing list activity:

Attachment N: Report from the Apache CloudStack Project  [Sebastien Goasguen]

## Description: 
   Apache CloudStack is an IaaS (“Infrastracture as a Service”) cloud 
   orchestration platform. 
   
## Issues: 
- Looking closely at the results of the GitHub experiment as CloudStack is
  using github heavily for its contribution including from committers.
- The github discussion is totally opaque to non ASF members
- Still looking for Docker hub integration
- The community will most likely start thinking about releasing official
  binaries
- The community will soon face an issue that we will be able to cut releases
  faster than we can vote, hence a discussion on continuous release will be
  needed.
- There are no other issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
- CloudStack conference was held in Dublin in October collocated with
  Linuxcon/Mesoscon. Event was a success and showed stable community 150
  attendees, great content, solid sponsors.
- CloudStack conference 2016 will be in Sao-Paulo organized by the University
  of Sao Paulo one of the leading users of CloudStack. The community is
  thriving there hence the fous on latin-america.
- New commit workflow is showing its results. 4.6.0 was released in Nov 14
  2015 , 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 (under vote) shortly thereafter. And 4.7.0 is out for
  VOTE with 4 new key features such as Nuage SDN enhancements and quota
  plugin.

Attachment P: Report from the Apache Continuum Project  [Brent Atkinson]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Cordova Project  [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. 
   
## Activity: 

Current releases have been voted on according to the Apache vote policy. We
had two major platform releases - cordova-ios-4.0.0 and cordova-android-5.0.0,
including minor updates to cordova-windows@4.2.0 (back button handling) and
cordova-ios@3.9.2 (iOS 9 support).

cordova-ios@4.0.0 brings anticipated WKWebView support to the platform (as
well as a pluggable webview architecture), while cordova-android@5.0.0 brought
Android Marshmallow permission checking in plugins.

Apache Cordova contributors also had a face to face meeting at the Microsoft
Campus in Redmond, WA, USA from Oct 14-15, 2015 -- where we discussed and
planned the future of the project. Proposals discussed there have been
reported back to the dev@c.a.o mailing list and most of them have been acted
upon.

   
## Health report: 

After the summer vacation period was over, activity has picked up, although we
had a significantly lower number of releases from last quarter (37 vs 45). For
this period, we again managed only one overall plugins release (of 22 plugins)
when our goal was to have one plugins release per week, although we had
individual plugin releases as well.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache FlexJS 0.5.0 was released on 11/14/15.
-Apache Flex FalconJX 0.5.0 was released on 11/14/15.
-Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7.2 was released on 11/16/15.

-Apache Flex SDK 4.14.1 was released on 3/30/15.
-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache Flex Installer 3.2.0 was released on 6/23/15.


ACTIVITY
The past three months saw continued activity related to FlexJS, a version
of Flex that is independent from the Adobe Flash Platform. After the
release in mid-November, mailing list activity related to FlexJS feels
like it has reached new heights with new names posting. Another security
issue was discovered in the BlazeDS 4.7.1 release resulting in the Blaze
4.7.2 release. Meanwhile, a release manager has volunteered to release
Apache Flex SDK 4.15.0 and there is activity around bug fixes to that
code. Work on Maven integration continues. Mailing list traffic is down,
but not an issue yet.

At some point in time, a change to the CMS was made and when we updated
our website with news of the FlexJS release, those changes affected the
output from the mirrors.cgi and broke our installer. I was able to find a
workaround and we'll have to eventually ship a new Installer release that
uses JSON output from the cgi.

3 PMC members presented a Flex track at ApacheCon EU and discussion are
underway for ApacheCon NA.

CODE ADOPTION
Based on threads on general@incubator and legal-discuss, we are now
discussing the notion of adopting non-ASF code bases that are already
licensed under ALv2. One code base is Swiz which was approved for
donation by vote over two year ago and reported in prior board reports but
was never completed probably because the donor was having trouble tracking
everyone down who needed to sign the Software Grant. The other is
AS3Commons, which is currently under discussion leading to a vote.

The understanding we have is that a Software Grant is not needed to accept
these code bases since they are under ALv2. We will contact the major
contributors from each code base to make sure there aren't conflicts or
other objections to have Apache Flex adopt this code. There is no
community around these code bases right now as the major contributors have
moved on to other projects so we will accept responses from the major
contributors as speaking for the community.

COMMUNITY
-Josh Tynjala was added as a PMC member.
-A discussion is underway about a new committer.
-Latest analytics include a little less than 1000 hits per day on the
website during the work week (less on weekends).
-There were more than 17,500 installs of Apache Flex 4.14.1 since its
release about nine months ago.
-Almost 85,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application. Tour De Flex
is a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex applications.

TRADEMARKS
-The apacheflex.com site we reported in the prior two reports seems to be
gone. We never received any response to our request other than the site
finally going away.
-A PMC member reported that a company is promoting a software product
called Flex that appears to be related to themes/styles for website
visuals. I used their contact page to deliver the standard trademark
violation template just before writing up this report so they haven't had
a chance to respond.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache Geronimo Project  [Alan Cabrera]

## Description:
Apache Geronimo is an open source server runtime that integrates the best open
source projects to create Java/OSGi server runtimes that meet the needs of
enterprise developers and system administrators.

## Issues:
- We are concerned with our current level of community activity. Some
  discussions were started about next-gen Geronimo effort. Work needs to be
  done to kickstart the conversation of where the community would like to take
  the project.

## Activity:
- A release of JavaMail
- A release of XBean
- Some developers have come forward to offer new features and fixes to Apache
  Yoko from the IBM WAS Liberty server. The smell of some fresh members is in
  the air!

## Health report:
- The project is a mature implementation of a mature technology. Given
  Geronimo's size and complexity coming up to speed and finding a compelling
  bit to work on is a daunting task, to say the least. A fresh re-write or
  re-org of components into something that is compelling given contemporary
  sensibilities will likely spur activity since it should open up some green
  field opportunities. The trick will be to balance the re-write/re-org with
  keeping important core capabilities, e.g. OSGi; we don't want to throw the
  baby out with the bathwater. This fall is a good time to start the
  discussion with hopes of beginning a fresh start in the new year. 

- With that said, it should be pointed out that of the activity that occurs,
  it is indicative of an engaged community.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==
No development activity, Gump seems to create useful results for the
few projects that use it.

== Releases ==
Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==
The projects that use Gump have occasionally modified their respective
configuration files.  No other activity.

=== Mailing-List Statistics ===

general@gump.apache.org:
48 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months) 89 emails sent to list
(63 in previous quarter)

commits@gump.apache.org:
19 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months) 11 emails sent to list
(23 in previous quarter)

== Changes to the Roster ==
All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AE: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

The Incubator continues to grow, reaching 50 podlings this month for the
first time since April 2012.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Todd Lipcon

* New Podlings

  - Impala
  - Kudu
  - Metron
  - S2Graph
  - Torii (formerly proposed as Spark-Kernel)

* Graduations

  None this month.

* Releases

  The following releases entered distribution during the month of
  November:

  - 2015-11-10 Apache Kylin 1.1.1-incubating
  - 2015-11-14 Apache DataFu (incubating) 1.3.0
  - 2015-11-16 Apache Sirona 0.3-incubating
  - 2015-11-16 Apache Apex Malhar 3.2.0-incubating
  - 2015-11-17 Apache Zeppelin 0.5.5-incubating
  - 2015-11-24 Apache TinkerPop 3.1.0-incubating

  The Wave PPMC has approved a release candidate which hit general@incubator
  on November 3rd.  Over a month later, it only has one IPMC +1 vote.

  The Incubator has been much better about approving releases in a timely
  manner since new processes were negotiated in late 2013, but Wave's
  experience shows that there is room yet for improvement.

* IP Clearance

  - Nicholas Peltier donated the Sling Pipes module, which provides a set of
    bulk content transformation tools for Apache Sling.

  - S.A.S. Ubik-Ingenierie and Decathlon SA donated JMeter Dashboard/Report,
    which allows generation of a report for a Load Test at end of Load Test
    or on an existing CSV result file.

* Legal / Trademarks

  - The registered trademark for the retiring podling Ripple is still held
    by Blackberry.  As the small Ripple community prepares to relocate to
    Github, they are exploring obtaining permission to use the trademark in
    their new home.

  - The name for a proposed podling was changed from "OpenMiracl" to
    "Milagro" to avoid marketplace confusion with the current copyright
    owner, Miracl (formerly Certivox).

* Infrastructure

  - It was brought to light that podling websites can be accessed by
    "podling.apache.org" in addition to "podling.incubator.apache.org".  A
    discussion about what remedy to pursue is ongoing.

* Miscellaneous

  - Driven by several new incubation proposals, traffic on general@incubator
    was extremely high in November -- at 915 messages, second only to the
    colossal Open Office proposal month in June 2011 (2013 messages).

  - A lengthy discussion on CTR vs. RTC (commit-then-review vs.
    review-then-commit) took place on general@incubator.  The debate
    continues with regards to what commit policy the incoming Impala podling
    will adopt.

  - The Kudu and Impala incubation proposal VOTEs were both contended, with
    a handful of -1 votes -- something which has not happened at any time in
    recent memory.  The VOTEs passed because they were interpreted as
    "procedural" under ASF voting rules and thus subject to majority
    rule.  This has implications for how graduation votes are interpreted,
    since objections to graduation by individual IPMC members have at times
    been given significant weight by the Board when considering graduation
    recommendations.

  - The new Metron podling is seeded with an ALv2 codebase for which the
    existing community is dormant/unresponsive.  There is no guarantee that
    an SGA can be obtained from the current copyright holder.  We anticipate
    no legal problems with this, nor social problems, but some efforts are
    underway to pursue an SGA regardless.

  - The Ripple, Corinthia, and Cotton podlings are all retiring.

Atlas

Apache Atlas is a scalable and extensible set of core foundational
governance services that enables enterprises to effectively and efficiently
meet their compliance requirements within Hadoop and allows integration with
the complete enterprise data ecosystem

Atlas has been incubating since 2015-05-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Podling name search is pending
  2. Expand the community and add more committers

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  * Everything seems to be smooth, nothing specific at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. We have added a new Committer/PPMC to the project.
  2. The user/dev community show increasing interests. The average number of
     messages in a month is over 500 as compared to 400 from the previous
     report.
  3. A lot of new contributors have been added, about 21 since the last
     report.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Some of the main limitations with type and entity mutations have been
     addressed and the dashboard has many more features added.
  2. We are preparing for the second release, 0.6-incubating by Dec 2015.
     This release should include about 85 jiras.
  3. A total of 76 issues were created and about 53 of them are resolved in
     Nov 2015.

Date of last release:

  * 2015-07-15 - 0.5.0-incubating

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  * Suma Shivaprasad was elected as a committer on 10/02/2015.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:



--------------------
CommonsRDF

Commons RDF is a set of interfaces and classes for RDF 1.1 concepts and
behaviours.  The commons-rdf-api module defines interfaces and testing
harness.  The commons-rdf-simple module provides a basic reference
implementation to exercise the test harness and clarify API contracts.

CommonsRDF has been incubating since 2015-03-06.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Re-engage and grow the Commons RDF community base
  2. Work with key target communities (initially within Apache) to ensure
     Commons RDF meets potential user requirements and expectations towards
     next versions of the Commons API.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  n/a

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Sleeper community in the last months; just few mails and commits.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Development has seen a drop in engagement across the board. Internal
  discussions about the scope and target audience/consumers has affected the
  community, loosing in the way one of the project founders and main contact
  with a primary target project. Therefore next months are critical to find
  the project fit or decide to wrap up this venture.  Some discussions in
  this direction are taking place: http://s.apache.org/SFA

  On a brighter note one thing for the CommonsRDF PPMC to consider is that
  in the beginning there was a small group of 5 core committers. Recently
  the number of subscribers to the dev@ list was 22. It is not all down and
  gloom. The PPMC has actually done pretty well in attracting new community
  to join the community ML.

Date of last release:

  2015-05-07

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  n/a (no PPMC or Committers have been elected yet)

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John D. Ament (johndament):
  
    Podling activity still appears to be on the low side.  I hope that more
    releases may help get more visibility into the podling, but the active
    group is active enough.

--------------------
Concerted

Apache Concerted is a Do-It-Yourself toolkit for building in-memory data
engines.

Concerted has been incubating since 2015-10-14.

--------------------
Eagle

Apache Eagle is a real time Data Activity Monitoring Framework to
instantly identify access to sensitive data, recognize attacks/
malicious activity and block access in real time.

Eagle has been incubating since 2015-10-25.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Infrastructure Migration: We moved the code to Apache Github,
     started using Apache JIRA for tracking purposes, Eagle external
     site transitioned to incubator and Jenkins projects to build binary
     and created docker images for easy installation.
  2. Expand the community, Increase dev list activity with new
     contributors.
  3. Existing committers are getting familiarized with the apache
     tools and process.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Nothing urgent at this time. Our mentors have been helpful in
  guiding us thru various stages.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. All core contributors/committers have started working on the
     Apache repository.
  2. We presented about Apache Eagle in the Data governance meetup
     meeting (Topic: Apache Eagle - Secure your hadoop data). We received
     good feedback on the use cases and scalable design of Eagle.
  3. Dev community showed increasing interests. In Nov, there have been
     507 messages on dev@ mailing list.
  4. There were increased participation in the dev mailing list
     pertaining to new feature development and roadmap.

  The development community is very active in terms of new features,
  bugs closed etc. This month we are putting more emphasis on community
  development and getting the interests from developers in the hadoop
  ecosystem.

  Julian Hyde (jhyde):
  
    Good activity and discussion, work is underway on meaningful features,
    and also some preparation for a release. They got late notice that a
    report was needed this month and sprang into action quickly to complete
    one.

--------------------
HAWQ

Apache HAWQ is a Hadoop native SQL query engine that combines the key
technological advantages of MPP database with the scalability and
convenience of Hadoop. HAWQ reads data from and writes data to HDFS
natively.  HAWQ delivers industry-leading performance and linear
scalability. It provides users the tools to confidently and successfully
interact with petabyte range data sets. HAWQ provides users with a complete,
standards compliant SQL interface.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce our first Apache Release
  2. Expand the community, increase dev list activity and adding new
     contributors
  3. Infrastructure migration: create Jenkins projects that build HAWQ
     binary, source tarballs and docker images, and run feature tests
     including at least installcheck-good tests for each commit (HAWQ-127).

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

MRQL

MRQL is a query processing and optimization system for large-scale,
distributed data analysis, built on top of Apache Hadoop, Hama, Spark, and
Flink.

MRQL has been incubating since 2013-03-13.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase the number of active committers
  2. Increase adoption, expand user community, and increase user list
     activity

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There were no new developers or new committers since our last report.
  There are 3 new UTA students who are planning to contribute to the MRQL
  projects as part of their Master's thesis in Spring'16, but they have not
  participated in the MRQL community yet. We hope to get more
  contributions/committers from the Flink and Spark communities to help us
  fine-tune the MRQL evaluation engine on these platforms.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Very little activity on JIRA since the last report (only 2 issues reported
  that were both fixed). One of the JIRA issues was related to a major
  extension to MRQL to support incremental query processing (to convert any
  stream-based MRQL query to an incremental query that merges the previous
  query results with the results of applying the query to the new data
  batches only). This was based on an idea presented at ApacheCon'15 as a
  future plan for MRQL. It works on Spark Streaming mode for now, but it
  will soon support Flink Streaming too.

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built
on top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and
query processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across
multiple nodes.  Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through
SPARQL, a conventional query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Populate the website for the project
  2. Expand the "how to" document to explain the ways new contributors can
     become involved in the project, so we increase the size of the
     community.
  3. Become familiar with the release process and have a first release as
     part of the Apache Foundation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - We started having questions and some traffic on the dev list generated
    by non-committers. There are 33 subscribers to the dev list, about half
    of them non-committers.
  - We started a discussion and created an initial draft of a document about
    how new contributers can contribute to the project and what should be
    the workflow.
  - The initial committers continue to learn to use the Apache
    infrastructure and processes.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Started working on updating the licence headers and poms to prepare for
    an Apache release.
  - Modified the Rya manual to markdown and linked it from the readme file,
    so the documentation is easier to access.
  - Working on new features: inconsistency detection, cloning, delete
    support for secondary indices.
  - Still working on creating a website for the project.

SAMOA

SAMOA provides a collection of distributed streaming algorithms for the most
common data mining and machine learning tasks such as classification,
clustering, and regression, as well as programming abstractions to develop
new algorithms that run on top of distributed stream processing engines
(DSPEs).  It features a pluggable architecture that allows it to run on
several DSPEs such as Apache Flink, Apache Storm, Apache S4, and Apache
Samza.

SAMOA has been incubating since 2014-12-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community
  2. Elect new PMC members
  3. Following up our first release with further releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Mailing list activity (September-October-November 2015):
  * @dev: 120 messages

  Jira issues backlog (September-October-November 2015):
  * Created:  8
  * Resolved: 6

  Our main goal is to grow the community, which is still pretty small.  We
  are doing a large amount of dissemination work in conferences and events
  to promote SAMOA.  For example, we had two talks at technical conferences:

  1) A talk at the Apache Conference BigData, in Budapest, Hungary, during
     the week of September 28-30, 2015.
  2) A talk at the Flink Forward, a conference for the Apache Flink DSPE, in
     Berlin, Germany, October 12-13, 2015

  We have had contributions from outside the PPMC. In particular, we have
  had contributions for:

  1) integrating Apache Avro input with Apache Samoa,
  2) a proposal for integrating Apache APEX as a new DSPE,
  3) continued the collaboration with the Apache Flink community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Main developments:

  * Performed development and testing of the VHT module.
  * Fixed various bugs and improved ensemble and bagging methods.
  * Worked on the integration of new data sources like Apache Avro.
  * Improved the website to include more material for new contributors.

Sentry

Sentry is a highly modular system for providing fine grained role based
authorization to both data and metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop cluster.

Sentry has been incubating since 2013-08-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Review PPMC election policy, if committers will become PPMC on
     graduation. Community is right now discussing this.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Graduation discussions have started. There seems to be some disagreement
  on graduation readiness which led to a broad discussion on general@. Seems
  like most of it is resolved but still need mentors agreement. The Sentry
  community did a number of things since last report to address the
  concerns/suggestions around the open communication.

  1. Community monthly hangout, IRC channel that's just been setup.
  2. Community members presented Sentry at the ApacheCon
  3. Sentry meetup at NY during HadoopWorld

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. We had ~260 messages on dev list in the past two months. (Got number
     from http://markmail.org/list/org.apache.sentry.dev)

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Expand the community, both in its size and its diversity. 
  2. Improve training efficiency by supporting GPUs, and improve scalability
     by reducing communication cost.
  2. Improve the usability by providing more built-in models and python
     binding.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The Github repository has scored 400+ stars and 150 forks. The developer
  community is growing slowly: the total number now is 14 developers. After
  the second release (with GPU) in December, it is expected that more
  developers will come.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been active with the development for the next release.
  Since September, there've been 296 and 369 new emails in the dev@ and
  commit@ mailing list respectively.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Ate Douma (ate):
 
    As reported above, mentor support has been too low, including my own.
    I find the dwindling down of participation and contributions other than
    from only one (very) active committer (Steve Blackmon) worrisome.
    More or even primary focus should be turned towards community
    development instead of only churning out code.
    I've suggested some concrete steps for this and propose to give the
    project a bit more time to try building up a community and more
    contributor involvement. As a mentor I'll try to help out more as well. 
    However, if there is no substantial improvement within one or two
    reporting periods, it might be better to consider retirement instead.

  Timothy Chen (tnachen): 

    Seems like there is one active committer as mentioned, and the majority
    of the mailing list activity is from JIRA and github from the same
    committer as well.  Also second that will need to consider retirement if
    this continues.

SystemML

SystemML provides declarative large-scale machine learning (ML) that aims at
flexible specification of ML algorithms and automatic generation of hybrid
runtime plans ranging from single node, in-memory computations, to
distributed computations such as Apache Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark.

SystemML has been incubating since 2015-11-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow SystemML community: increase mailing list activity,
     increase adoption of SystemML for scalable machine learning, encourage
     data scientists to adopt DML and PyDML algorithm scripts, respond to
     user feedback to ensure SystemML meets the requirements of real-world
     situations, write papers, and present SystemML at conferences.
  2. Core library improvements, including Apache Spark integration.
  3. Improved SystemML documentation to lower the learning curve.
  4. Produce a release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The community is blocked, and expects that the SystemML Apache JIRA

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Andy Seaborne (andy):

    Dev discussions have slowed right down this quarter.  Developer
    effort was strong for GSoC but there is now a minimum with no
    prospect of a change until Jan/Feb next year. A worry I have
    is that this was not communicated until considerable prompting
    applied.

    There are only 2 active mentors.

  Marlon Pierce (mpierce):

    +1 for Andy's comments. After a very promising summer, the project has
    come to a halt.  Despite mentor prompting, the project did not take the
    opportunity to grow its community from active GSOC participants.

  John D. Ament (johndament):

    Reading through the report, it seems that there may be some issues to be
    raised up.

--------------------

     (incubating) release.
  3. Streamline incubator website, so that it is easy for new contributors
     to get started.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

specification currently being worked on by the OASIS Context Server
Technical Committee. It provides a high-performance user profile and event
tracking server.

Unomi has been incubating since 2015-10-05.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Complete website to add "Getting started section"

Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication.
It can be used like email, chat, or a document.

Wave has been incubating since 2010-12-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Finalizing the first release
  2. Growing community
  3. Improving code base.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The Wave project put its first release on the Incubator PMC, however, it
  looks like the review takes a long time and we didn't get any
  communication back.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Not much, even though we managed to get a release and proceed with voting.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There some additional code developments in the process.

  Upayavira:

    Firstly, I believe Christian has resigned as a mentor, leaving just
    myself.

    As noted above, having struggled for a long time to pass a vote on a
    release artifact, the Wave PPMC has now done this, and is waiting on the
    members of the Incubator PMC to step forward and review the release.
    Please review this release!

    I myself have deliberately postponed voting, as my involvement at the
    ASF has not involved much by way of release reviewing.

--------------------
Zeppelin

A collaborative data analytics and visualization tool for distributed,
general-purpose data processing systems such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink,
etc.

Zeppelin has been incubating since 2014-12-23.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Do an Apache release
  2. Community growth: more committers from different organisations
  3. Increase adoption

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  There is an ongoing discussion [1] about speed of the patch landing being
  low, as project gets more popular and attracts more contributions.

  This issue, raised by one of the mentors, is acknowledged by the community
  and there is work in progress on how the speed of the patch processing and
  acceptance can be increased: by clarifying the contribution process [2],
  discussing and documenting guidelines and best practices [3]

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Lucene Project  [Michael McCandless]

## Description: 
 - Lucene Core is a search-engine toolkit
 - Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene Core

## Activity: 
 - The community is very active
   
## Issues: 
 - I don't think this requires board attention now, really just FYI:

   The infra team notified us via private (PMC) email on 11/30:

     https://mail-search.apache.org/members/private-arch/lucene-private/201511.mbox/%3cCAKprHVZ1cXNBm0z+1CtPOfJ0QeQDh=kENNETdy-iP0jKpcgZ=g@mail.gmail.com%3e

   saying that our svn to git mirror is too costly to continue running
   (breaking other projects' mirrors) and that in 30 days it will be
   turned off.  We've been discussing options publicly:

     http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201512.mbox/%3cCAL8PwkbFVT83ZbCZm0y-x-MDeTH6HYC_xYEjRev9fzzk5YXYmQ@mail.gmail.com%3e
   
   but at this point nothing promising is emerging ... I suspect the
   most likely outcome is we must cut over to git as our source
   control, if we are able to preserve the full svn source history,
   likely minus heavy JARs that we used to check in (the git mirror
   currently fails to).  We are thankful to the infra team for keeping
   our mirror running this long!

## PMC/Committership changes: 
 - Currently 59 committers and 37 PMC members in the project
 - Added two new committers:
     Nick Knize on October 20

We continue to yo-yo in community involvement. Our report dated 10/17/15, we
were in a lull, but as of the last week or so we have started to uptick
towards a release of 4.8.0

We have verbal commitments from several open source projects to provide
assistance once we show some of our own momentum. 

We are still working to have all tests passing across the various devs who run
them.

We are struggling to pull it over the line. We had a number of core committers
check who said they should be freeing up to help this quarter

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Olingo Project  [Christian Amend]

=== General ===
## Description: 
Apache Olingo is a Java and JavaScript library that implements the Open 
Data Protocol (OData). Apache Olingo serves client and server aspects of 
OData. It currently supports OData 2.0 and OData 4.0 (beta). The latter is 
the OASIS version of the protocol: OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC. 

## Olingo Status

Currently Olingo has no issues that would require board attention. 
The community is still working on the Java implementation for the OData V4 
standard. In addition the Olingo PMC voted for a new internal release process 
for the OData V4 codeline. Future releases will happen in a 3 month cycle. This 
should ensure that the releases are provided to users in a more timely manner. 
The PMC has decided this based on User and PMC feedback which expressed concerns
about the long and unclear phases between new V4 releases. The next release is 
planned at the end of December.
  
The V2 codeline is in a "maintenance mode". No new features have been developed 
here in the past 3 months. All changes done have been bug fixes. Since this is 
the case the Olingo PMC will not apply the new 3 month rule to this codeline. 
Instead releases here are done if users specifically ask for them or if the 
Olingo PMC finds that the current number of fixes is worth a new micro release.

With Ramesh Reddy the Olingo PMC has a new member that has been actively 
contributing to the project for some time now. We are very happy with this 
addition. Aside from that we receive very little contributions from outside the 
PMC circle. Since traffic on the user mailing list is constant and also
includes new users we do not worry at this point but we find it hard to
attract new contributors. 
   
After seeing the conversations about the board report quality on the board 
mailing list it would be nice if we could receive feedback if the current
report format. I see the reporter tool as a very helpful addition to keep
track of statistics. This in addition to the above overview hopefully gives a
very good insight to the Olingo project.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Tom Barber]

DESCRIPTION

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

        - Last release was 0.10 on Sept 13th 2015

We resolved 32 issues for this release.

0.11 has been under steady development, we have added Sonar reporting to our 
daily build. We also spoke with Atlassian and got an updated Clover license 
which we now use for test coverage stats. This is to help us stabilise the 
codebase and improve our test coverage in a run up to a 1.0 release. 0.11 
should be released shortly. 

Email traffic is up and the community has had a few new people ask questions.

539 emails to the list, 453 in the previous quarter.

The project is specific in its design but we have been working on advertising 
to a larger crowd for less scientific based data management to draw a larger 
audience. We plan to continue this into 2016 and run some demo's at ApacheCon
demonstrating a more business oriented approach.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Pinaki Poddar]

Apache OpenJPA is a persistent object management kernel for databases, 
relational as well as non-relational . For relational databases, OpenJPA is 
compliant to industry-standard Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) version 2.0
version. OpenJPA runs in stand-alone JSE as well as  containers e.g JEE, 
Tomcat, Spring or OSGi.

== Community ==

OpenJPA developers had developed a general-purpose, robust
software for Object-Relational Mapping. They also ensured its stability 
and backward compatibility across many released versions. 
OpenJPA has a significant user base and many users have migrated
their persistence provider to OpenJPA.
Current OpenJPA developers actively maintain the code base as well as
support the user community via the mailing list and the code service
streams. 
  
However, developer resource is shrinking as many senior developers are not
active and new volunteers are hard to come by as new development
opportunities are rare and hard to incorporate for a matured code base. 

We hope that the Board members may be able to share their experience 
on how to re-energize a matured project in its maintenance phase. 

== Recent Work ==

At this phase, the software defects are few but
reported defects have been resolved  [1] in timely fashion.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Jörn Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference
resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text
processing services.

Development
------------------
The development team stayed active over the last three month and
participated in smaller development efforts. A couple of bugs were
fixed. At the current pace we will probably the next minor release in
the first few month of 2016.

Community
---------------
The community stayed active with the usual amount of traffic on the user
mailing list.

Rodrigo Agerri was added to the PMC on Jul 09 2015

Mondher Bouazizi and Anthony Beylerian were added as a committer on
Fri Sep 04 2015.

Releases
------------
The last release OpenNLP 1.6.0 was released on Jul 09 2015.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OpenWebBeans Project  [Mark Struberg]

## Description: 
  Apache OpenWebBeans is an ALv2-licensed implementations of the
  "Contexts and Dependency Injection for the Java EE platform"
  specification which is defined as JSR-299 (CDI-1.0) and CDI-1.1 and 
  CDI-1.2 (MR) specifications (JSR-346). 

## Issues: 
  there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity: 
  Activity is ok. We did start with CDI-2.0 and fixed a few bugs.
  We currently prepare for new maintenance releases. 

## Health report: 
  The project is a container library which is stable and actively 
  used and maintained. Due to the fact that most users are using 
  OWB as part of another project (e.g. TomEE) we get much feedback 
  in 'indirect' ways.

## PMC changes: 
- Currently 12 PMC members. 
- No new PMC members added in the last 3 months

Attachment AS: Report from the Apache Pig Project  [Rohini Palaniswamy]

## Description: 
   Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets on Hadoop.  It 
   provides a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, 
   coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. 
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
  - Pig 0.16 which is a stabilization release for Pig on Tez with many bug
    fixes is actively being worked on as more bugs get reported. Initially
    planned for December, will be targeting a January release due to more
    issues that require fixing. 
  - Pig on Spark development is under way in the spark branch.
   
## Health report: 
  - Project activity in the community is good.  In terms of focused
    development, there are lot of bug fixes and performance enhancements going
    on for Pig on Tez and feature development patches going in for Pig on
    Spark. In terms of users, there is still the same amount of questions on
    the user mailing list and jiras are being filed by different and new
    users. We had 8 different new contributors this quarter who contributed
    patches on small issues. This is also inline with the trend of new folks
    who do not dedicatedly contribute, but come and go contributing new UDFs,
    enhance existing ones or fix small issues they face.
 - There has been no new committership or PMC for more than an year which
   keeps affecting the project health score a lot. But when Pig on Spark
   project is ready for merge in to trunk in another quarter, couple of folks
   would be good to be voted in as committers.
  - We have not done talks, blogs or organize user meetups in past couple of
    quarters. That is something that we will have to work on in the next
    quarter.
   
## PMC changes: 
   
 - Currently 15 PMC members.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

Description: 
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet 
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
   usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
   robustness of the Java platform.
   
Activity: 
 - User activity was up a little bit this quarter, with some more new
   users needing help.
 - There was some development activity, but less than the previous
   quarter, although progress was made on a gnarly Java 8 issue.
 - One of the emeritus PMC members has agreed to become active again
   and to devote a little time to help with administrative things. This
   will potentially help with adding some other PMC members and/or
   whatever we need to do going forward (Attic? or ?).
 - One other ASF Member has joined the private mailing list, also to
   help in some way.
 - I am still investigating ways to revive interest in the project
   (other than myself).
   
Health report: 
 - The Reporter app still reports us in an unhealthy state. But I think
   we are making a little progress toward "something".
 - The industry has really gone far away from the types of things that
   Pivot is good at, so we are near a cusp here -- either find a way to
   make it attractive to users again, or retire the code. To me, finding
   a niche in the mobile market might be a good future direction, so I'm
   investigating that.
 - Although we did get a couple new users this quarter, so there is still
   some interest (based on actual emails, not the list subscriptions).
   
Issues:
 - Still looking for help with the Apache Extras issue (no news from the
   Board since the last report in September).

PMC changes: 
 - Currently 3 PMC members. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months, although Niclas Hedhman
   (niclas at apache.org) has agreed to rejoin the PMC (ASF records not
   updated yet); that will make 4 on the PMC.
 - Last PMC addition was Roger Whitcomb on Mon Oct 24 2011.
   
Committer base changes: 
 - Currently 5 active (that is, not emeritus) committers. 
 - No new changes to the committer base since last report. 
   
Releases: 
 - Last release was 2.0.4 on Mon May 19 2014.
   
Mailing list activity: 
 - dev@pivot.apache.org:  
    - 58 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 78 emails sent to list (104 in previous quarter)

Attachment AU: Report from the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Project  [Jeff Trawick]

## Short version of report:

  No releases, no committee/committer changes, modest other activity 

## Description:

  The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
  software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
  to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
  which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
  the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
  since 2007.

## Activity:
 - Commits have been minuscule.
 - Mailing list activity has been about normal for the project.
 - Five unique bugs were opened during the reporting period, and two had
   followup (closure or discussion).

## Health report:
 - This is a mature project, and most of its development activity is
   driven by the needs of the same small number of applications that have
   used it for many years.  The project members are more than able to
   meet the requirements that arise from that use.
 - The needs of the small number of other users are not met very well;
   bug reports languish and mailing list posters may not receive timely
   responses.  The amount of help provided is probably not sufficient
   to serve as encouragement to potential new users of APR.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:

 - Currently 65 committers and 39 LDAP committee group members.
 - No new LDAP committee group members added in the last 3 months
 - Last LDAP committee group addition was Yann Ylavic at Wed May 13 2015
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Christophe Jaillet at Sat Mar 14 2015

## Releases:

 - No releases in this quarter
 - APR 1.5.2, released April 29, 2015
 - APR-util 1.5.4, released September 22, 2014
 - APR-iconv 1.2.1, released November 26, 2007

## Mailing list activity:

 - dev@apr.apache.org:
    - 360 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 112 emails sent to list (85 in previous quarter)

 - commits@apr.apache.org:
    - 73 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 9 emails sent to list (20 in previous quarter)

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA is picking up. We had some new 
contributions. We also have been giving a talk about ServiceMix during 
an 33rd Degree 4charity conference in Wroclaw (Poland).

We have achieved the stability of he ServiceMix 6. The new fix version 6.0.1
has been released. We have also released a new version 6.1.0 containing 
upgrades to the newest dependencies and some new features.

During the last period the new maintenance version 5.4.2 and the new stable 
version 5.5.1 have been released. We have also decided to stop further 
development on the old branches 5.1.x, 5.2.x and 5.3.x. 

We have decided to decouple ServiceMix Plugins from ServiceMix 4 code and 
maintain them a separate subproject. The source code has been migrated
from svn to git repositoriy. A new fix version 1.3.1 of Maven Depend Plugin
has been released. We have also released 3 sets of OSGi bundles.

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------
Currently 49 committers and 22 PMC members in the project. No new PMC members
nor committers were added in the last 3 months. Last committer addition was 
Wim Verreydt on July 05 2014. Last PMC addition was Krzysztof Sobkowiak on 
July 05 2014. 

Community Objectives
--------------------
We're not expecting too much dependency updates to become available for the 
5.4.x, but we do plan to keep our release schedule going with the 5.4.x, 
5.5.x and 5.6.x (the new development branch) releases. We plan to keep a 
steady release schedule and keep up with new fix releases of our dependency 
projects. 

In the new period we are going to focus on the further development, stability 
and maintenance of ServiceMix 6.

Our goal for the next period is to start the development of the new ServiceMix 
7.x line and release the first stable version from it.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- We released the 1.2.4 bugfix/point release on July 7th.

Community & Project:

- 2.x work has slowed as of late.  The hope is to resume significant work this
  month and into January.  Cleanup needs to occur before final release
  candidates can go out.

- Mostly everyone wants to move the project to ASF Git.  We'll hopefully do
  this before the next board report!

- Project is mostly stable and in maintenance/bugfix mode until a 2.0 release
  can be made.  No significant feature development is planned on 1.x.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Storm Project  [P. Taylor Goetz]

## Description: 
   Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation system. 
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## Activity: 
 - The community released stable version 0.10.0 in November. This was a 
   major release that added end-to-end security to Storm, among many other 
   features.
 - We recently added 5 new committers/PMC members and are in the process of 
   adding one more.
 - We received and processed a code donation of JStorm from Alibaba. JStorm 
   is a fork of Apache Storm with the clojure code reimplemented in Java.
 - The community has adopted a plan for merging the JStorm code to the master
   branch of the Storm codebase.
 - The JStorm developers have become active in the Storm community, helping 
   with such things as documenting feature differences between the two 
   codebases, filing related JIRAs and discussing the migration plans on the 
   mailing lists. The lead developer of JStorm (Longda Feng) has been added 
   as a committer/PMC member.
 - The community is currently finishing up the final remaining tasks for the 
   Apache Storm 1.0 release, which we hope to release in the next month.
   
## Health report: 
 - JIRA activity has been relatively high for the last quarter due to 
   activity related to the 1.0 release as well as planning for the JStorm
   merge.
 - There has been a significant uptick in activity on the dev@ mailing list.
   This is in part due to the addition of the JStorm developers and 1.0 
   release planning, but there are also a number of new contributors that 
   have begun submitting patches.
 - The 1.0 release will represent a major milestone for the project, with 
   many new features and performance improvements.

Attachment BG: Report from the Apache Tiles Project  [Mick Semb Wever]

## Description:
 Apache Tiles is a free open-sourced templating framework for
 Java applications. Based upon the Composite pattern it is built to
 simplify the development of user interfaces.

## Activity:
 Activity in the Tiles community remains slow, slowing down from last quarter.
Questions and issues are still generally addressed quickly.
There lags some documentation edits that should be published.
Otherwise the majority of traffic remains on StackExchange and within the Spring
community.

## Health report:
 The Apache Tiles project remains in the "action required" health status for
apache projects. The few active members are aware of the state of the project
and most of our attention goes toward keeping a stable project still
communicating with users and developers that have questions. 
Little time goes toward trying to increase the project's momentum.

## Issues:
 there are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:
 - No new changes to the LDAP committee group or committership since last
   report.

## Releases:
 - No releases were made this quarter. The project remains due for a patch
   release.

## Mailing list activity:

 - users@tiles.apache.org:
    - 149 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 14 emails sent to list (17 in previous quarter)

 - dev@tiles.apache.org:

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Tuscany Project  [Jean-Sebastien Delfino]

Apache Tuscany is an SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA.

ISSUES
Community activity is very low.

RELEASES
Last release was Tuscany SCA 2.0.1, 10/3/2013.

COMMUNITY ACTIVITY
Last committer addition was Sebastian Millies, 12/4/2012.

There has been only two commits in 2015, one from infra to fix broken download
links and one from a Tuscany committer adding a DOAP file.

Mailing list traffic was almost non-existent this year. Only a few discussions
of JIRA issues and a post from an Emeritus Apache member interested in getting
back and maybe work on Tuscany, 

So recently we've tried a few things to revive the project. Luciano Resende
initiated a discussion with the Fabric3 community to see if they'd be
interested in merging back with Tuscany to create Tuscany 3.x, but it looks
like that discussion has stalled. We also started to discuss a Javascript
Node.js implementation of Tuscany SCA for micro-services. I indicated I'd have
some spare time to work on it during my vacation. We now have a new repo for
that implementation and I'm planning to start working on it during the
holidays and see if that Node.js work generates new interest in Tuscany in the
community.

BRANDING

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

## Description: 
VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 - There are a few minor issues to finish up for the next release, Apache VCL
        2.5. The only showstopper is an issue to resolve related to the
        addition of Windows 10 support in the upcoming release [1]. We had
        hoped to release 2.5 by the end of the year but this will have to be
        pushed back until after the new year.
   
## Health report: 
 - User list traffic has been surprisingly low since July. Our last release
        was in April and we saw an expected increase in traffic the following
        from April to June as users upgrade.  I would have expected traffic to
        taper off more gradually.
 - Dev list traffic has been about normal considering we haven't had a flurry
        of activity preceding a release.
 - I am concerned about stagnation and level of diversity among the project's
   committers and PMC members. These concerns were brought up on our dev list
   in a thread I started earlier this week to discuss this report [2].
   Unfortunately, I failed to give the community much time to respond before
   this report was due so I'm hopeful more replies will come. Two
   committers/PMC members did share my concerns. One person shared a possible
   contributing factor [3] but no ideas were expressed as of yet on how to
   improve it. I do have some ideas we could try but wanted to first solicit
   input from others to get an idea of the level of interest and engagement. I
   would like the community to attempt to discuss this further and try to work
   to improve the health between now and when our next report is due in March.
   At this time, I do not feel intervention from the board is required. That
   said, we would certainly welcome any input from members who want to chime
   in on our dev list with advice or bring up topics more appropriate for the
   PMC to discuss on our private list.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Ross Gardler]

## Description: 
Whimsy is a set of tools and a website to access them that help automate
various ASF administrative tasks or information lookup activities.

## Issues: 
We are currently working with infra to conduct a limited experiment in using
GitHub as our primary development location. This experiment is conditioned
upon several factors:

* This is ONLY available to the Whimsy PMC
* The Whimsy project reports monthly on progress and issues surfaced
* The primary goal is to determine if the ASF can capture and retain (all)
necessary information related to our goals of establishing provenance of any
work performed.

Work is progressing. It is causing some churn for the infra team who are
needing to rework a considerable amount of their existing GitHub support (see
infra report).

The infra team feel that it is necessary to enforce multi-factor
authentication. This has met some (seemingly) mild resistance within the
Whimsy community as it potentially impacts contributors with an existing
GitHub account used in other contexts. This does not impact other projects
using GitHub as a mirror.

## Activity: 

Incubator agenda reminders discussion appears to have petered out. Board
agenda reminders discussion never quite got off the ground - at least not on
dev@whimsical; there was a brief discussion on board@

New repository on GitHub: https://github.com/apache/whimsy 
a) ASF hosted clone is not yet available 
b) whimsical site (via gitpubsub) is not yet set up 
c) auto deploy (also via gitpubsub) is not yet set up 
d) updated VM (based on Ubuntu 14.04) is available, but set up is not
   yet complete.

Development:
  a) updates to ICLA-lint (clr) and public JSON data (sebb).
  b) board agenda reminders is largely complete (rubys).
  c) exploratory rewrite of secretary mail function has been posted in
     a branch (rubys).

## Health report: 
The community remains small and focused, there is active oversight from
numerous PMC members on both the project code and the GitHub experiment.

## PMC and Committer changes: 

- Currently 10 committers, all of whom are PMC members. 
- Craig L Russell was added on Sun Dec 13 2015 

## Releases: 

There are no formal releases of Whimsy code, although it is frequently
deployed on ASF hardware.

## Mailing list activity: 

- dev@whimsical.apache.org:  
- 15 subscribers (up 3 in the last 3 months): 
- 282 emails sent to list (100 in previous quarter)

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

Fixed an issue reported by the Apache Tomcat community and made a
few improvements to strengthen secure processing in Xerces. There
were a few questions again about having a release. It's long
overdue but we need volunteers to help make it happen.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 75+ posts on the j-dev
and j-users lists since the beginning of August 2015.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

Three JIRA issues reported by the community were fixed in the
last quarter. No other development occurred.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 40+ posts on the c-dev
and c-users lists since the beginning of August 2015.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-C 3.1.2 (March 19th, 2015).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development
activity over the reporting period.

XML Commons

No activity of the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in February 2015 (Xerces-C)
and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

No new PMC members in the last four months. The last two additions
to the PMC were in May 2010.

Two committers committed changes to SVN in the last quarter.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.

Attachment BP: Report from the Apache Yetus Project  [Sean Busbey]

Apache Yetus provides libraries and tools that enable contribution and
release processes for software projects.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD'S ATTENTION

None at this time.

RELEASES

None to date.

ACTIVITY

No new PMC additions in the past three months.

Last PMC addition was formation on September 16, 2015.

Added new committer Kengo Seki on December 01, 2015.

The community is closing in on our first release. We've cleared up
several issues found during testing and are coming to consensus on a
temporary build process for release artifacts.

Mailing list traffic is very low, with most project activity on the issue
tracker. Folks showed up on the list just fine for the announcement of our
committer, so I presume things will shift back to the list as we need to
discuss project direction.

## Description
Apache Zest is a community based effort exploring Composite Oriented
Programming for domain centric application development.

## Activity
Apache Zest made a presentation at ApacheCon EU 2015, on short notice by two
of its PMC members after the PMC Chair were unable to travel from China.
Otherwise, the quarter has been somewhat slow and quiet, with work mostly
focusing on 3.0 features, and re-examining the design of even the most core
features.

## Issues
There are no issues that requires the Board's attention, but as Chair of the
PMC, I would like to highlight that difficulty to attract new committers is
becoming a concern of the PMC for its long-term viability.
  
## Health report
The sudden drop in number of mails from previous quarter is large due to many
release-related mails in previous quarter.
