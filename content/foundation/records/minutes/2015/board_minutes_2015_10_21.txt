 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The main discussions during the last month have been related to the
       Incubator. After a lengthy thread, which is now closed, the conclusion
       seemed to be that there was no immediate board-level issue to be
       addressed, and concrete proposals have been appropriately raised on
       the Incubator lists.

       As Ross mentions, I'll be in Beijing tomorrow for the Apache Roadshow
       event, giving an Apache Way presentation (combined with some amount of
       the State of the Feather).

    B. President [Ross]

       Thank you to Brett Porter and David Nalley who will be covering for me
       in Korea (David) and China (Brett and David) this month as I still
       struggle with resolving the issues that prevent me from travelling at
       present.

       Most of our EA time was taken up with TAC and ApacheCon this month. No
       significant actions to report.

       Fundraising
       ----------------

       Fundraising continues to improve processes in response to issues
       identified. New sponsors are in the pipeline. One platinum sponsor has
       chosen not to renew.

       Separately from VP Fundraising activities I have had the opportunity
       to speak directly to three separate current and potential sponsors in
       the last couple of weeks. All three have the same feedback, it can
       essentially be boiled down to two things: 1) why should we sponsor,
       there is no measurable benefit to us beyond code and we get that
       anyway and 2) why are you spending so much money on infrastructure
       when perfectly good options, such as GitHub. Item 1) is a difficult
       one to answer since we don't give anything in return for sponsorship
       (and we are in agreement this should not change). Item 2 seems easy,
       but in 2 of the three cases when I responded with our usual "we need
       to self host for X, Y, Z reasons" they responded to the effect of "but
       we use GitHub for our canonical repositories, we don't have those same
       concerns".

       I will explore these issues in the coming months with the appropriate
       VPs and, if appropriate, bring proposals back the Membership and/or
       board as appropriate.

       Marketing
       =======

       The usual tick-tock from marketing plus the rather surprising (almost)
       universal acceptance of the proposed logo redesign.

       My thanks go to Sally for working on this redesign. I look forward to
       the minor refinements that are likely to emerge based on the Members
       feedback.

       Brand Management
       ===============

       Thank you to the Directors who have reviewed the proposal to register
       Tomcat in additional geographies. I see there are enough approvals at
       the time of writing. Assuming no concerns are raised during the prior
       to or during the meeting VP Brand Management will proceed with the
       requested registrations.

       Thank you to the Tomcat PMC, VP Brand Management and, in particular,
       Mark Thomas for drawing up a clear justification for their request in
       response to my "devils advocate" attempts to channel any potential
       Directors concerns. Mark was very professional and patient in his
       responses and I believe the experience has helped clarify the criteria
       under which non-US registrations should be considered.

       Documentation and guidance for brand management. Resources are indexed
       from http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/resources

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       Welcome to Daniel Takamori,  a new part-time infra team member
       (filling an open position). For more see
       https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/dear_apache.

       Infra budget needs some adjustment, some lines are over budget
       (specifically replacing hardware, cloud infrastructure, and build farm
       costs). Overall the predicted spend is within approved budget. David
       is working with Virtual to ensure there is no impact on our overall
       impact on our annual budget. In addition there is the possibility of
       in-0kind donations covering the increased spend in these lines.

       With this focus on retiring/replacing old machines a significant
       amount of technical debt has been paid back.

       All services met the SLA despite some failures that needed to be
       managed this month - http://status.apache.org/sla/

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ======================

       At the time of writing there is no TAC report.

       Thank you to Gavin McDonald who has stepped down from the chair role
       in TAC after seven years. Gavin did a fantastic job of getting TAC off
       the ground, something I myself attempted (but failed) prior to his
       engagement. Gavin felt that some new blood would be beneficial to TAC,
       in this context I'm pleased to report that Nick Burch has returned to
       the committee after a few years break. Nick brings lots of historical
       knowledge but also a renewed energy.

       Nick and the team will be exploring ideas for increasing the impact of
       TAC. The first task is to understand how our own assistance and that
       of the Linux Foundation can be better aligned.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

        Work is progressing to finish off the Wells Fargo account closing.
        The Treasurer has sent an email to Wells Fargo (after yet another
        customer care representative change) to close out credit cards. The
        final step is for the Treasurer to make his way into a branch and
        transfer the remaining funds.
        
        The Treasurer’s Office and Virtual are finishing processing and set
        up of some paperwork with Citizens for the Foundation’s Business
        Signature credit cards.
        
        AR reports are being sent to VP, Fundraising for visibility into
        sponsor payment lifecycle and status. Virtual is assisting with the
        preparation.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Most of the cleanup of icla.txt public names versus ldap full names
       has been completed. There is more work to do to clean up all of the
       missing/unsigned iclas.

       In September, 91 iclas, five cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       ApacheCon

       We just completed ApacheCon Europe in Budapest 2 weeks ago. Attendance
       was disappointing, but Angela speculates that was a combination of
       being up against Strata, and the Syrian refugee situation, that
       contributed to this, and estimates that we would have had up to
       another 50% attendance were it not for these influences. As it was, we
       had 432 in attendance for Big Data, and about 200 for Core.

       We heard a number of people say that the split into two events was
       confusing and poorly explained. This was primarily at the CFP time -
       ie, which event to submit talks to, and how the talks were selected.
       But it was also confusing for attendees, who may have signed up for
       one event and then been unable to attend the other.

       In the future, we plan to have a single CFP and a single event, but do
       marketing for the various content tracks, such as 'ApacheCon Big
       Data', 'ApacheCon Search', or 'ApacheCon Web'. Sponsors report that
       this makes it a lot easier to support an event when it is clear what
       the content is, and thus who the audience will be, which is validation
       of what we've been saying for years. We will also have content
       category based CFP selection committees, which will work with Angela
       and Craig to select the content for the next event. Talks will be
       tagged as belonging to various major categories, and selection will be
       divided up in that manner to produce these
       conferences-with-a-conference.

       TAC is another area that suffered considerable confusion, as may be
       reported elsewhere. In future events, we are going to try to have
       Angela work much more closely with TAC, and with Melissa, to eliminate
       the confusion caused by having two separate sources of travel
       assistance.

       The CFP for ApacheCon North America will be announced soon, once
       changes have been made to the CFP to reflect the above decisions.

       ApacheCon Europe 2016 is still in limbo. Given the poor attendance in
       Budapest, there are financial considerations. We are, however,
       reaching out to a number of sponsors, and if we can obtain promises of
       a certain level of sponsorship, we will move forward with planning
       that event. Several locations are being investigated at this time.

       FOSDEM

       FOSDEM has been announced, and Apache has submitted a proposal for a
       table to promote the ASF. We have requested two tables, one of which
       will be dedicated to the ASF, and the other which will rotate among
       projects which wish to show up to promote their specific community.
       Apache OpenOffice has committed to being present, and we have interest
       expressed by other projects.

       Apache Retreats

       There has been the beginning of a discussion of reviving the Apache
       Retreat concept. A venue was suggested in conversations at ApacheCon,
       and that is being further investigated. No firm plans have been made
       at this point. Discussion is ongoing on the ComDev mailing list.

       OSCON

       We have received initial contact from Joshua Simmons, a representative
       of OSCON regarding what changes would need to happen to secure the
       ASF's participation in OSCON next year. This conversation is still
       just beginning, but Ross provided considerable feedback regarding our
       experience at this year's event.

       they promise to do better.

       The consensus response is to remove them as Mentor and ask
       them to earn merit if they want to participate as Mentor in
       the podling in future.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

ApacheCon and TAC: It was a very successful week.  We had a total of 11
TACers, 10 of which were first-time recipients of the program.  All shared
their enthusiasm and appreciation for being there and expressed that it was a
wonderful experience and they learned a lot.  Through the sessions and
discussions with other attendees, many have expressed their eagerness to join
in on different projects. As usual, booth traffic was very busy. I will be
assisting Nick in the TAC “re-boot” effort.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Presented two updated brand education sessions at Apache:Big Data and
ApacheCon Core in Budapest.  Questions both at the sessions and in the halls
at the conference show that we still need to improve education for PMCs and
committers in Apache projects.

Published updated and annotated site map and resources for branding policy and
practices, as well as a trademark registration cost guideline.  Site map
includes links to brand-related education and presentations:

http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/resources

Signed non-exclusive, annual renewable licensing agreement with Litographs, a
garment, poster, and printed goods vendor for use of Apache project marks in
exchange for a percentage of royalties.  The detailed agreement uses similar
terms that we've provided to independent Member shops in the past, but can
serve as a solid model to better memorialize other requests from third parties
who wish to produce non-computer related goods promoting Apache communities
using Apache marks.

Working with the President, please see the Tomcat PMC's additional report
requesting authorization to use existing Brand budgeted funds to pay for
several international trademark registrations of their TOMCAT mark (which
we've already applied to register in the US).  I fully support the Tomcat
PMC's request.

Looking forward, we are still evaluating the Brand budget situation given the
unexpected loss of our pro bono counsel support.  It will take some time to
see what the expected monthly expenses for DLAPiper support will be given our
level of work and our discount structure.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

The fundraising activities continue. We have conversations with 3 potential
sponsors and we expect one to close very soon.

Due to the concerns expressed last month we identified a few gaps in the
execution and we are taking the following steps:

* we are still behind on our receivables; if our execution would be flawless,
we'd be on target, as Tom indicated. That is not the case yet.
* we identified a communication issue as we do not know the payment status of
outstanding invoices and as such we do not know if/when to send reminders.
With KAM and accounting@'s help we made the convention to send bi-weekly
reports to vp-fundraising@.
* there is a lack of clarity on who and how to send reminders. I had a
conversation with Tom where we agreed on how to coordinate it.
* we identified a gap in the information about renewals and as a result, one
platinum renewal fell through the cracks. The reminder is now sent, but we
are taking steps to close the gap.
* following on a recommendation from Ross, we started to update our process to
consider end of fiscal year and the budgeting process of ours sponsors. Tom
will provide the information in the following weeks (update: Tom just sent the
list, didn't have time to review yet).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget with no vendor payments due at this
time.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally Khudairi
forwarded the proposed revised ASF logo, which was strongly welcomed
by the majority of Members who provided feedback. Work continues with
the designers (donated by HotWax Systems and LucidWorks) on
fine-tuning the logo and comprehensive visual system, with completion
anticipated before the end of the calendar year.

III. Press Releases: no announcements were issued via the newswire
service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during this
timeframe.

IV. Informal Announcements: 4 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 26 items were tweeted on @TheASF. No new videos
have been updated on the ASF YouTube channel. 4 Apache News Round-ups
were issued, with a total of 54 weekly summaries published to date.

V. Future Announcements: no announcements are in development. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing
to announce major project milestones and/or "Did You Know?" success
stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more
information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 16 media requests, including
several briefings at Apache: Big Data and ApacheCon Europe. The ASF
received 1,411 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's
clip count of 844.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 7 analyst queries, including
briefings at ApacheCon Europe. Apache was mentioned in 38 reports by
Gartner, 7 reports by Forrester, 33 reports by 451 Research, and 12
reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: the events in Europe are complete, both
Apache:Big Data and ApacheCon:Core enjoyed solid media and analyst
participation. Special thanks to Rich Bowen and Shane Curcuru for
their participation during the events, as well as to Ross Gardler for
taking pre-event interviews.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no formal
activities at this time.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 8 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and continue to receive gratis
news release distribution in the UK by Pressat.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Date:
By:
Reviewed by:


New Karma:
==========
Infrastructure has added Daniel Takamori as a part-time staff member. 
You can read more here: https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/dear_apache
This is a backfill of the part-time contract position that expired in 
May of this year.  

Finances:
==========
I spent some time talking with the Virtual folks about our rate of 
expenditure in some specific GL Accounts - those used for replacing
hardware, cloud infrastructure, and build farm costs. While we are 
currently close to plan in terms of totals, the rate of spending has 
increased dramatically, and failing either a reduction in spending, 
or in-kind sponsorships (one of which we are working on), we will 
be over budget in those specific categories. That said, we are 
significantly underbudget overall

Operations Action Items:
========================
N/A

Short Term Priorities:
======================
N/A 

Long Range Priorities:
======================
Automation
----------
We've made small, regular strides in increasing our automation efforts,
 but nothing particularly report-worthy. 

Resilience
----------
Much work around backups, both improving the scope as well as the quality 
of our backups is ongoing. We are backing things up, but need to figure out 
a retention policy, and that work is yet to be done.  

Technical Debt
--------------
We've made significant strides in migrating workloads off of aging machines.
While we have a long way to go, progress is occurring. Most notably by end 
of month we should have everything in place to retire the last remaining 
machine at our Florida Colocation facility and cancel that contract. 

Monitoring
----------
After last months significant gains, we are seeing benefits brought on 
by monitoring, but not necessarily additional gains in the monitoring. 

General Activity:
=================
ApacheCon Europe happened in the past month, and a number of Infra
volunteers and staff members attended. 

We suffered a second LDAP outage, that required editing corrupted
data and restoring it. This caused a brief outage. 

Mail system proof of concept work continues, though the largest
blocker at the moment is ensuring that a broader-than-the-ASF 
community cares about Ponymail. 

Uptime Statistics:
==================
See http://status.apache.org/sla/ for details.

Despite some needed LDAP maintenance that caused a brief outage, overall 
we met or exceed all of the SLAs this month.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

ApacheCon Europe
----------------
TAC had a successful conference, helping 11 people make the event who
otherwise couldn't have, and helping them develop their skills, contacts and
confidence in the process. We're in the process of collecting their feedback
at the moment, but so far all seems positive. Final costs should be
available by next month.

Committee
---------
After an epic run of 7 years at the helm, sadly Gavin McDonald has stepped
down as TAC Chair. Everyone on the committee is very grateful for his time
and effort as chair! Nick Burch has taken over the role.

Melissa Warnkin was added to the committee just after Budapest.

Next steps
----------
A meeting was held in Budapest to discuss ways to better get the message
about TAC out, beyond the "usual circles", and notes were circulated to the
list. We are thinking of doing a much bigger push for stories from
successful past recipients, to be shared. Some of these will go on the site,
many will be classified by their project areas, and used to build more
personalised/relevant messages on TAC for projects to spread. (Generic
mailings to projects have mixed successes). We will also hopefully be able
to feed some of these back to sponsors as evidence of successes that their
funding permitted.

There is also discussion on scoring and assistance offerings, to try to
ensure that Vancouver has a broader group of people funded. Part of this
will hopefully be driven by better outreach, but some may need some tweaks
(eg childcare has been identified as one issue for some). We are considering
trying some more targetted outreach towards students as well.

We have a call with the LF in 2 weeks to discuss Vancouver, we expect to
open applications shortly after that. We are aiming to tie our dates to the
CFP ones, so that accepted speakers have a chance to apply if they need it,
and to avoid the confusion of both TAC and LF offering travel funding. More
details on that next month. Our rough plan is to open application soon, for
the organised, but do most of the publicity nearer the time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Henry Story (bblfish@) has joined the Credentials Community Group.
This is the first member of the group for ASF, so the foundation
agrees to the standard community group conditions.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

A formal ASF Release Policy has been drafted and it is in the process of
being reviewed. My expectation is to make it official within a month's
timeframe. Many thanks to Marvin Humphrey for his work in this effort.

JIRA tickets continue to be closed.

I will be working with our legal counsel regarding the proposed
Bylaws update regarding the 2/3rds majority question.

No issues requiring board attention.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 9: Report from the Apache Security Team Project  [Mark J. Cox]

Some concern last month due to non-response of TomEE to a security
issue we passed to the PMC list on 21st May 2015 which had no response
or ack to date.  Please can board remind TomEE PMC of their need to
follow the security process in a timely manner.

Short stats for September 2015, a very quiet month in which we
received:

6     Support question
3     Security vulnerability question, but not a vulnerability report
10    Phishing/spam/proxy/attacks point to site "powered by Apache" or

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Accumulo Project  [Billie Rinaldi]

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust,
scalable, high performance data storage system that features cell-based
access control and customizable server-side processing.  It is based on
Google's BigTable design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop,
Zookeeper, and Thrift.

Summary
The project is active and there are no Board-level issues at this time.
Two new committers have been added since the previous report. We have
made two releases and have overhauled the license and notice files so
that each release artifact has its own tailored license and notice (as
opposed to a single all-encompassing L&N for all).

Releases
Version 1.6.4 was released on 10/3/2015.
Version 1.5.4 was released on 9/20/2015.

Activity
The number of subscribers to the user list increased by 4 to 395 and the
number of subscribers to the dev list decreased by 6 to 225. Mailing list
activity has been lower than in the previous quarter, but lists are still
active.

In the past 3 months, there have been 226 commits to the master branch
from 13 authors, 4 of whom are not yet committers.

After the recent release of 1.5.4, we have retired the 1.5 branch. For
the upcoming 1.7.1 release, 108 of 149 issues have been resolved.

Community
Dylan Hutchison and Russ Weeks were added as committers and PMC members
on 10/7/2015.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache ActiveMQ Project  [Bruce Snyder]

## Description:
   Apache ActiveMQ is a popular and powerful open source messaging server.

## Description: 
   Apache Airavata is a distributed system software framework to manage 
   simple to composite applications with complex execution and workflow 
   patterns on diverse computational resources.  
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment F: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Henri Yandell]

## Description:
 - The Attic is where projects slumber when their communities fade away.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Three project moves to the Attic were completed (Whirr, DirectMemory
   and Click), and Deltacloud is mostly done (first Git based project
   to enter the Attic). Sebb has done sterling work rescuing the lost
   Jakarta websites from the Internet Archive.

## Health report:
 - We're reacting well to projects moving to the Attic, and it's good to
   see Hervé and Sebb's activity. There's always a project with just a
   little to complete (Deltacloud this time), so we could do that little bit
   better.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 20 PMC members.
 - Hervé Boutemy was added to the PMC on Sat Jul 18 2015

## Mailing list activity:

 - general@attic.apache.org:
    - 34 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 132 emails sent to list (33 in previous quarter)

## JIRA activity:

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Tom White]

Report from the Apache Avro committee

## Description:

   Apache Avro is a data serialization system.

## Issues:

 - The 1.8.0 release failed because committers found several problems
   with the project's license documentation (see AVRO-1722 [1]).
   Problems included: missing required attribution in NOTICE and the
   inclusion of possibly GPL code (see LEGAL-224 [2]). We are in the
   process of fixing these issues before releasing 1.8.0.

## Activity:

 - Close to releasing 1.8.0 (once licensing issues are solved).

## Health report:

 - The community is not keeping up with the number of reported bugs or
   with feature contributions. We need to prioritize reviews with the
   goal of growing the number of active committers.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 14 PMC members.
 - Ryan Blue was added to the PMC on Sun Aug 09 2015

## LDAP changes:

 - Currently 22 committers and 14 committee group members.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================

Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing
  
Issues
======

There are no issues requiring board attention at the current time.

Releases
========

There have been no releases over the last three months. The last release
was in fact towards the end of last year:

 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 15 PMC members on the project with the last additions
in January 2014.

The last new committers were added in May 2014.

Community & Development
=======================

Committer activity remains stubbornly low. Email discussions related to
tickets deemed necessary for the next release continued along with some
discussions of plans for future developments. This resulted in two of
our GSoC students responding indicating an interest in helping out.

Such GSoC students in the short term might be considered the best source
for new additions to the PMC. The current low activity should be thought
of as counter-productive to encouraging the GSoC students' interest and
more generally is a barrier to interest from new developers.

There are currently 7 remaining active tickets that are incomplete and
marked to be in the next release.

Email discussions in general are still decreasing in volume though the
user list does appear to get reasonably timely responses to queries.

We have also experienced some periods of downtime on the main bloodhound
issue tracker which managed to go un-noticed for a few days. This would
have been quicker to spot with heavier use from the developer community
but also points at the need to improve our site monitoring.

Attachment K: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Micah Whitacre]

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running
MapReduce and Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

Project Status
--------------

The project has been moving at a similar pace to the previous quarter, with
34 new JIRA issues logged since the previous board report, with 24 (23 new +
1 old) issues being resolved in that time. The majority of the work on the
project continues to focus on maintenance such as bug fixes with a heavier
focus on rounding out HBase support, building out better Spark support, and
support for Java 8 Lambdas.

The project also successfully release version 0.13.0 this quarter which
featured 27 issues.  The release focussed on several bug fixes but the major
effort was to upgrade to HBase 1.0 and remove support for Hadoop 1.0.

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Community
---------

Community activity continues to be similar with the previous reporting
period.  The user mailing list has maintained a steady rate of questions and
answer (1 per day).  Over the last reporting period the activity on the
developer mailing list has increased (2 per day).

Micah Whitacre was added to the PMC on April 3rd, 2014.
Micah Whitacre was added as a committer on July 11th, 2013.

Releases
--------

* Apache Crunch 0.13.0 was released August 5, 2015

Attachment L: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description:
 Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
 develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
 JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
 XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports
 such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.

## Activity:
With the release of CXF 3.1.0 last reporting period, much of this period was
spent following up on various reports and suggestions as users upgraded.   Also,
a lot of time has been spent upgrading Fediz to the latest CXF version.  This
activity resulted in several patch releases of CXF (3.1.2/3.1.3/3.0.6/2.7.17) as
well as a couple of Fediz releases (1.2.1 and 1.1.3).  The Fediz releases also
addressed a security vulnerability that is now public and on our web site:
http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.html

## Health report:
- The activity in the community is stead.   Questions are answered promptly.
Issues/patches are handled fairly quickly.     We’re looking at some of the
patches to see if there are potential new committers with a discussion on
one already started.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Directory Project  [Kiran Ayyagari]

Current Activity and Status
---------------------------

The last quarter was mainly focused on releasing the first version of Kerby.

A new version of the LDAP API release was discussed and in the preparation to
it there is some bug fixing going on.

We have received an offer to contribute RADIUS software built on top of
ApacheDS, we are still evaluating this offer.

We are thinking of adding two more members to the PMC, the vote is not started
yet.

There were three presentations in the recently concluded ApacheConCore EU, one
each on Fortress, Kerby and ApacheDS projects.

The default JDBM backend used by ApacheDS is causing data corruption problems.
We are seeing a lot of users complaining about it in the recent weeks.
Though we have suggested some workarounds this remains our top priority to fix
the issue by replacing JDBM with the new MVCC backend library, Mavibot.

Currently work is going on to support cross-BTree transactions in Mavibot.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Drill Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:
   A distributed SQL MPP for Hadoop and NoSQL

## Activity:
 - Drill adoption has seen strong increases in the last few months. This is
   expected as Drill is now something useful to end users (as opposed to being
   mostly in development).
 - There have been a number of community events that have been helpful in
   continuing to drive adoption and awareness of the project. This includes
   countless meetups, talks and tutorials at a number of major conferences (such
   as NoSQL Now & Strata/Hadoop World NYC).
 - The community has been primarily focused on addressing user issues for the
   last few months. Activity continues to increase on the user list post the
   1.0 release of Drill.
 - Code contributors are starting to appear more frequently. These new
   contributions are most often focused on extending Drill (such as storage
   plugins, format plugins and udfs)
 - A key corporate contributor has created a new extended test suite for
   Drill. This will likely be considered for incorporation into the Drill
   codebase to provide additional support for product quality goals.

## Health report:
 - Drill's community diversity is increasing as we see a broadening of
   companies sponsoring engineers to work on Drill. This is due to both new
   contributors and existing contributors moving to new companies.
 - New contributors are arriving but we need to continue to ease their
   experience.
   - New contributors currently struggle with a lack of code documentation.
     The community is working on improving this to ease the newbie experience.
   - New (and existing) contributors find Drill's precommit testing
     requirement to be burdensome as the tests typically take 30-40 minutes to
     complete. As such the community is looking at ways to speed this up.

## Issues:
 - There are currently no issues that require board attention.

ACTIVITY

No new PMC members added in the past three months.

Last PMC addition was Sean Busbey on March 25, 2015.

As new PMC, Sean Busbey made a significant impact by evaluating our
compliance with Foundation release policies, found deviations had
accumulated over time, and lead development efforts to fix them. Once
the blockers had been addressed we resumed releases. The bulk of the
work was done on HBASE-14085.

Stephen Yuan Jiang was added as a committer on August 23, 2015.

Andrew Purtell presented at OSCON on July 23, 2015. [1]

We held a developer workshop at the Palo Alto offices of Cloudera on
August 26, 2015 that was well attended. [2]

Nick Dimiduk presented at Apache Big Data EU on September 28,
2015. [3]

We held an un-conference style meetup at Cloudera NYC on September
29, 2015. [4]

We have resumed community sponsored user group meetups. The next
one is scheduled for October 8, 2015. [5]

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 44 podlings currently undergoing incubation.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Josh Elser
  - Sterling Hughes

* New Podlings

  - MADlib
  - Rya
  - Unomi

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - Calcite
  - Brooklyn

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

  - 2015-09-06 Apache Kylin 1.0-incubating
  - 2015-09-14 Apache Brooklyn 0.8.0-incubating
  - 2015-09-14 Apache HTrace-4.0.0-incubating
  - 2015-09-15 Apache TinkerPop 3.0.1-incubating
  - 2015-09-16 Apache Groovy 2.4.5-incubating
  - 2015-09-21 Apache Sentry-1.6.0-incubating
  - 2015-09-22 Apache AsterixDB Hyracks 0.2.16-incubating

* IP Clearance

  - Raytheon BBN Technologies Corp donated POI Visio, an extension module for
    Apache POI. It adds support for the Microsoft Visio .vsdx xml-based file
    format. (Current Apache POI Visio support only handled the older binary
    .vsd format). Post-import, the component will be known as XDGF.

* Infrastructure

  - It seems that an incorrect date in the Board meeting calendar caused the
    report reminders to fire a week early, requiring manual cleanup after the
    correct date was established.  There was discussion of migrating the
    reminders and other Incubator bookkeeping to Whimsy.

* Miscellaneous

  - At the height of Corinthia's crisis, several committers resigned.  The
    mailing lists have since gone silent.  Some IPMC members followed up but
    those efforts do not appear to have been successful.
  - A vote to retire the Droids podling is pending.
  - Various proposals to change the Incubator have been discussed on
    general@incubator.  The one generating the most responses, mostly in
    opposition, is a proposal which would lessen the role of Mentors with
    business affiliations to podlings during Incubator entry and exit votes.
    None of the other proposals have gotten any traction.
  - A proposal regarding the Incubator formulated during ApacheCon EU was
    discussed on board@apache.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There's no significant change since the last month.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The IP clearance process is now complete given that:

  1) Software License Agreements have been collected (and have been filed by
     the ASF Secretary) for the former copyright owners that are no more
     active and involved in the project.
  2) Contributor License Agreements have been collected (and have been filed
     by the ASF Secretary) for the main contributors of the project, that are
     now committers of the incubating project
  3) Notices in the project mailing lists and website have been published to
     announce that the project is now incubating at ASF and to invite
     potential contributors to participate in the new home
  4) License headers have been updated to reflect the new copyright

  Git repositories were migrated to ASF, and development now goes at ASF.

  GitHub integration was configured so that we can receive pull requests.

  Mailing lists were officially moved over to ASF

  Jira was created and marked as the official issue tracker, though old
  issues weren't yet migrated.

Date of last release:

  There was no release from the Incubator yet

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  We only have the initial committers and initial PMC members yet.

Geode

Geode is a data management platform that provides real-time, consistent
access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed butt
architectures.

Geode has been incubating since 2015-04-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

Groovy

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

Groovy has been incubating since 2015-03-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  No issues left before graduating.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No particular issue, but our mentors suggested we think about graduating.
  We still have to launch the vote, but the consensus is positive already.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  I've started collecting the number of subscribers on the users and dev
  lists starting last July (numbers from early July till end of September).
  Groovy users have been continuing to subscribe to our mailing-lists on a
  regular basis.

         Early   end of   end of    end of
         July    July     August    September
  Users: 249     259      273       274
  Dev:   152     156      163       164

  The download numbers, which are also an interesting indicator to see how
  much a project is used, are still on an upward trend.

  Here are the figures totaling downloads from both Maven Central and Bintray
  since the Groovy project entered the incubator (full numbers from September
  not yet available):

  March April May   June   July   August
  643k  759k  877k  1.15M  1.29M  1.34M

  The download numbers doubled since Groovy entered the incubator.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Since the last report 3 months ago, we managed to make two releases.

    1. Groovy 2.4.4 on July 9th, patching an important security issue,
       but the release wasn't yet compliant with all the good practices
       in terms of licenses & copyright information

    2. Groovy 2.4.5 on September 17th, we fixed all the problems of the
       previous release, and we took the opportunity to do a "release party"
       during the SpringOne2GX conference in Washington, DC, to spread the
       knowledge of the new release process across the team, as well as with
       our partners from JFrog.

Date of last release:

  2015-09-17: Groovy 2.4.5

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  We've welcomed a new committer to the project: Keegan Witt.  Keegan is also
  known in our community for his work with the Maven integration for Groovy
  (the GMavenPlus project)

--------------------
HAWQ

HAWQ is an advanced enterprise SQL on Hadoop analytic engine built around a
robust and high-performance massively-parallel processing (MPP) SQL framework
evolved from Pivotal Greenplum Database.

HAWQ has been incubating since 2015-09-04.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce our first Apache Release
  2. Finalize infrastructure Migration and ICLAs from committers
  3. Expand the community, increase dev list activity and adding new
     committers/pmc members

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  We have only just started the incubation, everything seems to be starting
  up, nothing urgent at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  This is our first report, after having been approved for incubation roughly
  2 wks ago.

  1. Most of the core contributors have completed their ICLA's and have
     established apache ids.
  2. Several presentations and meetups at ApacheCon EU and Strata aimed at
     growing interest in the project
  3. Formal announcements from Pivotal and press briefings related to the
     move of the project into Apache aimed at growing awareness and interest
     in the project.
  4. Outreach to parties that have expressed interest previously in our open
     source initiatives
  5. Still very much at the early stages of community development, we're just
     starting to get rolling.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  This is our first report, after having been approved for incubation roughly
  2 wks ago.

  1. Initial code drop has been provided to Apache
  2. Core infrastructure has been setup including: mailing lists, git, jira,
     wiki, website
  3. 62 messages on our developer list, 3 messages on our user list
  4. 16 jiras filed, 10 open, 1 reopened, 4 resolved, 1 closed - 1 issue
     unassigned
  5. 7 commits in total, including initial commit
  6. Most discussed items on the mailing list:
      - addressing issues with getting jira configured to allow issues to be
        assigned to users
      - discussion of usage of alternate communication channels, e.g. chat.
      - discussion of RTC vs CTR models for dev process

Date of last release:

  We have not had a release yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Most of the initial list of committers have been onboarded, but there are
  still a few more outstanding.  We have not yet added any new members on top
  of the initial committer list.

MADlib

Big Data Machine Learning in SQL for Data Scientists.

MADlib has been incubating since 2015-09-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce a first Apache release.
  2. Finalize infrastructure migration and ICLAs from committers.
  3. Expand the community, increase dev list activity and add new
     committers/pmc members.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Just started incubation, nothing specific to report at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are approximately 2 weeks into the incubation process.

    1. So still at early stage.
    2. Most of the core contributors have completed their ICLA's and have
       established apache ids.
    3. Several presentations and meet-ups at ApacheCon EU and Strata NYC to
       discuss MADlib move to ASF governance.
    4. Formal announcements from Pivotal, press briefings and blogs related
       to the move of the project into Apache aimed at growing awareness and
       interest in the project.  Specialty press have picked up the story and
       reported widely.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Early activity:

  1. Initial code drop provided to Apache
  2. Core infrastructure is in the process of being migrated from existing
     infrastructure: mailing lists, git, jira, wiki, website

Date of last release:

  No release yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Most of initial list of committers have been on-boarded, some still
  outstanding.  No new members added on top of the initial committer list.

Myriad

Myriad enables co-existence of Apache Hadoop YARN and Apache Mesos together
on the same cluster and allows dynamic resource allocations across both
Hadoop and other applications running on the same physical data center
infrastructure.

Myriad has been incubating since 2015-03-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Determine the best way to take github pull requests or ReviewBoard patch
     (chains) and apply/commit them to the Myriad git repo. We're looking at
     Mesos' apply-review.sh script, but I wonder if there's something else
     out there we should be considering. Is there a way to make github
     'Merge' integration just work, even through the mirror?
  2. Vote in and onboard new committers. Two are in progress, one from a new
     contributing organization.
  3. Prepare our first release under Apache. We'll update the code's
     copyright/namespace and packaging, but we still need to learn the other
     elements of the Apache release process. Is this "DRAFT" still the best
     resource? https://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None beyond the above-mentioned.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - Mailing list traffic has significantly increased from 60-80
    messages/month in April-July to 171 in August and 227 in September. Some
    of that could be JIRA integration, but we still have 17 unique human
    authors now, up from 13 in July.
  - Increasing participation in our biweekly community syncs. We now get
    around 7-11 participants, up from the 5-8 we were getting in May-July.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - Finally got the SGA from Paypal and migrated our source to Apache git!
    Still need to figure how to integrate it into our commit workflow.
  - Resolved 14 JIRAs: http://s.apache.org/3dc
  - Merged the following PRs (from the old github repo)
      * Multi-project build changes (PR#108)
      * Improved unit testing (PR#112)
      * Myriad Logo update (PR#113)
      * Dynamically configurable NM Ports (PR#102)
      * Fine-grained scaling (PR#91)
      * Upgrade to Hadoop 2.7 (PR#116)
      * Complete Myriad HA Implementation (PR#123)
      * Run MyriadExecutor as NodeManager AuxService (PR#118,123)

Date of last release:

  Santosh will release manage the Myriad 0.1.0 release, our first release
  under Apache. We created a 0.1.0 version tag in JIRA, and targeted some
  pre-release issues for Apache copyright/namespace changes. We'll try to
  merge in some outstanding PRs, but there are no other feature blockers, so
  we hope to cut our first release candidate this month.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  - One new committer has been privately nominated and voted in, awaiting
    IPMC Board approval. Then he/she still has to accept the invitation.
  - Another is in the midst of voting this week.

OpenDocument Format (ISO/IEC 26300 == ODF) documents

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Rob Weir (robweir):
  
    No report submitted, though I did remind the PPMC.   I sense some "report
    fatigue" since they missed the July report deadline, submitted then in
    time for August, but lacked a mentor sign off, and then submitted again in
    September and did get sign off.

  Drew Farris (drew):
  
    Kudos to robweir activity as a mentor, however this project could use
    another mentor. Generally little traffic or activity.

  Nick Burch (nick):

    Project has recently added a committer, which is good, but otherwise the
    level of activity remains too low. I've heard rumours of development
    happening in private elsewhere, but unless that effort returns to the
    project and activity improves, I think we're going to have to look at
    admitting defeat and retiring the podling soon.

OpenAz

Tools and libraries for developing Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)
Systems in a variety of languages.

OpenAz has been incubating since 2015-01-20.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Confirm 1.0.0 as the first release
  2. Get website up to attract more attention
  3. Vote to confirm if any JIRA's are needed to be closed for 1st release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  P. Taylor Goetz (ptgoetz):

    The OpenAz report is pretty sparse and has not been signed off
    by any of the podling's mentors. dev@ mailing list activity is
    extremely low (15 messages in the past 3 months). I would recommend
    the top priority be for the project to expand the community.

  Colm O hEigeartaigh (coheigea):

    Agreed that activity is very sparse. It seems that most of the initial
    committers in the proposal have not joined the project. I think we will
    try to get the website up and running, triage some items to be done for
    an initial release, and then get the release done in the next quarter.
    Hopefully that will drum up more interest in the project.

Wave

A wave is a hosted, live, concurrent data structure for rich communication.
It can be used like email, chat, or a document.

  [ ](wave) Christian Grobmeier

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Marvin Humphrey (marvin):

    Wave's report was deliberately not signed off by its Mentors.  Mentor
    Upayavira engaged the Wave community about the possibility of retiring.
    The community preferred to continue; a timeline for making an incubating
    release was discussed.

  Upayavira (upayavira):
    As Marvin observed, I'm doubtful that Wave has the momentum to make
    any significant change nor to progress towards graduation. The community
    will need to meet some targets - the immediate one is to make a release 
    before the next board report is due.

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

## Description:

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in
Java.

## Activity:

Since the last report we have released Apache Isis 1.9.0, with the usual
clutch of new features [1].

The mailing list activity is steady.  The number of new subscribers this
quarter is lower than in previous quarters, but is still rising.

A "companion" open source project [2], to develop a custom DSL for Apache
Isis, has released its first betas.  This work - implemented using  Eclipse
Xtext [3] - is unfortunately not being done particularly collaboratively, but
we are advertising the betas on the mailing list.  It is nevertheless
encouraging that Isis as a project has attracted this attention for what is
quite a substantial piece of work.  There is at least a possibility that that
work might be contrbuted back to ASF/the Isis project in the future.

Work has also *just* started on developing a new viewer component [4] for
Apache Isis, based on the Vaadin framework.  This work is being done by a
Vaadin employee (like Google, they get their own 10% time and this individual
has chosen a Vaadin/Isis integration as his paid-for side project).
It is too early to know if this work will end up being contributed to ASF
or not, but it will be released as open source and under the Apache v2
license.

Finally, two of the Apache Isis committers entered a 2 day "RAD Race"
competition in the Netherlands, pitching our skills against 7 other teams,
all of which were using proprietary CASE tools.  We didn't win, but we
acquitted ourselves well.  A write-up is available [5].

[3] http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/
[4] https://github.com/alejandro-du/vaadin-viewer
[5] https://github.com/incodehq/radrace2015


## Health report:

Project activitity is broadly the same as previous quarters, in all the
various categories (commits, JIRA tickets, mails).   The rate that
new subscribers to the mailing list has perhaps slowed a little.

We are very aware that we remain a very small community and somewhat
unfashionable project, and are still somewhat searching for our audience.
Unfortunately we have had very little luck in getting talk proposals accepted
at various conferences.  We would seem to be in somewhat in a catch-22
situation... conferences aren't accepting us because they've not heard of
the framework, and people haven't heard of the framework because they've not
seen us at conferences.  However, we hear nothing but praise from those
users who have "discovered" us, so are not overly discouraged.

We have contacted "Software Engineering Radio" podcast with a view to seeing
if a talk might be arranged; nothing is likely on that front for at least
6 months, however.

We hope to publish an article or two writing up the RAD RACE, to help raise
awareness of the framework, as well as tell an interesting story.

Attachment X: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Phillips]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

Project Status
--------------

Development activity in the last quarter has quietened down a bit and
has shifted towards updating existing popular providers and extending
recent Google and Microsoft contributions. The user community remains
active, with regular questions from a diverse set of users being
discussed on the mailing list.

An important recent step was the successful integration of the first
major change to jclouds core code carried out without the involvement
of one of the original core developers.

Community
---------

Last committer: 2014-07-30 (Andrea Turli)
Last PMC member: 2015-09-20 (Zack Shoylev)

Community Objectives
--------------------

* Identify and complete the remaining major changes to be included
in jclouds 2.0
* Complete, extend and harden providers recently graduated from the
jclouds labs repo
* Encourage and supervise, where necessary, new contributors to grow
the committer base

Releases
--------

jclouds has carried out one release in the past quarter: 1.9.1 was
released on 2015-08-06.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Jena Project  [Andy Seaborne]

## Description:
   A framework for developing Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
   in Java.

## Activity:

The major release mentioned in the last report happened at the end of
July. This release included a number of incompatible changes including
making all java packages come under org.apache.jena, migrating to Java8,
and requiring persistent data to be reloaded.

Such changes have the potential for a lot of users@ email but this time, so
far, only a small number of migration questions have been raised.

Ongoing development of Jena includes development of a major new component
for an in-memory storage sub-system.  This is being developed via
discussions on the dev@ list.

## Health report:

Activity is at around its normal levels, with September on the users list
being towards the upper end of "normal" and dev list being a little less
busy.  Given a recent release, this is normal.  Issues on JIRA continue at
a steady rate.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache JMeter Project  [Sebastian Bazley]

## Description:
  Pure Java application for load and functional testing

## Activity:

 JMeter has dropped support for Java 6, and there have been many
 improvements to the code to get ready for the next release.

 The JMeter Twitter account has 2153 followers as of 3rd Oct 2015.
 This is about 230 more than at the time of the previous report (July)

 The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
 with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
 developers.

 Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
 the committers.

## Health report:

 The project has been perhaps a bit quieter over the summer (holidays etc),
 but there is still steady activity.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache JSPWiki Project  [Juan Pablo Santos]

## Description:
   A feature-rich and extensible WikiWiki engine built around the standard
        J2EE components (Java, servlets, JSP).

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Quiet quarter regarding ML activity, although conversations on releasing
   2.10.2 spun quite a burst of activity to include new functionality for
   this release.
 - We have to retake conversation on releasing 2.10.2. There shouldn't be
   too much trouble with it.

## Health report:
 - As said before, it has been a quiet quarter, but this happens from time
   to time; all JSPWiki developers work on it on their free time, plus this
   quarter we've had few questions on MLs, hence little activity.
 - There is still plenty enough people to answer questions / vote on
   new releases, etc., though.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in
C# and targeted at .NET runtime users.

== Summary ==

We continue to yo-yo in community involvement. Our report dated 6/10, we saw a
significant up tick, but that faded as we got very close to a 4.8.0 release.
Some of us have all the tests passing and some don't so we are close in the
Lucene.Net.Core project.

The status of the associated libraries are very behind - next up is the
Analysis code.

No progress was made on a website refresh (that we wanted to launch with
4.8.0)

We are struggling to pull it over the line. We had a number of core committers
check who said they should be freeing up to help this quarter (now only 2
months elft

Pushing on 4.8.0.
- Approximately 7 commits in the last quarter to move our port along
(resolving tests)
- Currently we have ~5 failed failing tests to fix (down from ~80 last report.
Also depends on environment still, we are trying to tighten that up)
- Some additional libraries that help users make the most of Lucene.Net
(Analysis, Suggest, Highlighters, QueryParser, Codecs and a few others)

Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for
dynamic programming languages.

Issues requiring Board attention:

  None.

Activity:

  Over the last quarter, Lucy development continued to move forward towards
  the long-planned 0.5.0 releases of the Lucy search engine library and the
  Clownfish symbiotic object system.  There were two active contributors:
  Nick Wellnhofer, who focused on preparing the Clownfish public API, and
  Marvin Humphrey, who focused on Go bindings for Clownfish and Lucy.

  A new release would help to draw attention to the project, but existing
  community activity remains steady.

Health report:

  Commit activity this quarter was average.  The number of emails sent to
  the dev list dropped, and the number of actual design conversations
  dropped more, as the use of Github pull requests increased.  Most commits
  this quarter were in areas where design consensus had previously been
  established.

  Grouping commits into pull requests has made review easier, compared with
  reviewing messages to the commits list, since ASF commit emails arrive out
  of order and with noisy subject lines.  Furthermore, a well-crafted
  abstract in the initial pull request email's abstract communicates intent
  more effectively, and we are making good use of Travis and Appveyor CI.

  * As announced previously, we are starting to release 3.x.x line of plugins
    with Maven 3 and Java 6 minimum requirements (no more compatible with
    Maven 2.2.1 and Java 5).

  * We did an automatic Jira cleanup, closing isues that did not have any
    activity for 3 years with a message proposing to reopen if necessary.
    On 600 issues closed, approx 15 issues were reopened, often with complaints
    about our attitude. We understand and are not completely happy with this
    way of handling issues reported by users but did not find better way to
    purge old history that was de-facto closed (and often without user feedback
    when trying to work on it, but not always as reopenings prove).

  * This year, we had one talk about Maven during ApacheCon: CORE Europe,
    and a few Maven developers were present to discuss and work/party together.

  * The PMC is working on revitalizing: change habits (invite active
    committers, resign when not active), discuss if more formal changes are
    useful, rephrase "binding/non-binding" in votes summary that
    gives the wrong impression that some votes don't count (when they are in 
    fact only "non-legally binding").

Attachment AM: Report from the Apache Onami Project  [Nino Martinez Wael]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Onami is a project focused on the development and maintenance of a set
of Google Guice extensions not provided out of the box by the library itself
nor the Google developers team, such as integration with 3rd part frameworks
or extra functionalities.

MILESTONES

Since last report, there have not been new components releases.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Discussion of the Onami state.

COMMUNITY

Users community is quiet silent.

ISSUES

It's time for attic, we have had an open discussion on the developers list,
both on how many pmcs where active and what could be done. as it is now, the
best direction are for Onami to be moved to attic. As there's not enough
committers for an active PMC. And there's not really been any activity for a
long time.

Thanks for the opportunity and the possibility for Onami as an Apache project.

Attachment AO: Report from the Apache OpenMeetings Project  [Maxim Solodovnik]

## Description:

      Video conferencing, instant messaging, white board and collaborative
   document editing application.


## Activity:
 - The constant activity in mailing list, JIRA and commits. I believe the
   project is as active as it was previosly.

## Health report:
 - We just performed a release, so I expect increasing of email activity, both
   feedback and issues :) Unfortunately we have no new commiters so far, but I
   hope we will have some before next report.

## Issues:
 - The only issue with the project is "too few" active commiters (only 2
   actually) I would appreciate any help/ideas on how can we increase the
   amount of active developers of the project.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache OpenOffice Project  [Dennis E. Hamilton]

For quarter-to-quarter comparison consistency, this October 2015 report
rolls-up, updates, and expands material from the September 2015 Interim
report.

                -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

Apache OpenOffice is an open-source, office-document productivity
suite providing six productivity applications based around the
OpenDocument Format (ODF). OpenOffice is released on multiple
platforms and in dozens of languages.

STATUS
======

The Project is working urgently toward maintenance release 4.1.2.
There is continuing adjustment to the change of Chair for the second
time in 2015. Warning signs around sustainability and disconnects across
the community are being brought gingerly to community-wide attention.

ISSUES FOR BOARD AWARENESS
==========================

The Board needs to be aware of Community concerns, Sustainability
warning signs, and other matters reported in the Issues sections, below.


RELEASES
========

There is no release in the July - September quarter.

Release 4.1.2 is now anticipated in October 2015, using an accelerated
approach.

Complete Release History
  2014-08-21 4.1.1
  2014-04-29 4.1
  2013-10-01 4.0.1
  2013-07-17 4
  2013-01-30 3.4.1 refresh (8 more languages)
  2012-08-21 3.4.1 incubating
  2012-05-08 3.4   incubating


ACTIVITY
========

Release Effort and Plans
------------------------

Developer focus is on provision of the Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2
maintenance release.  This will extend to localization, web site
updates, and provision of any associated security advisories.

Non-4.1.2-release-blocker issues and some anticipated features are
targeted for the future Apache OpenOffice 4.2 release.  There
is no anticipated date at this time.  To accelerate 4.1.2, some but
not all 4.1.2 blockers and additional feature developments have been
triaged to 4.2.

Community Operations
--------------------

The Apache OpenOffice community has three main pillars: development, support,
and end-user services.  The pillars are permeable, with interdependencies
from end to end.

For AOO, the provision of authenticated binaries as part of Apache releases
is not a mere convenience.  It is overwhelmingly the purpose of the project
in its openoffice.org origin and as brought to Apache, however much
downstream use of the code base is also desired and supported.

For context, by the end of August 2015 there were 41 million downloads
of AOO 4.1.1 since its release one year earlier.

   87.7% were for Windows
    9.1% were for Macintosh
    3.2% were for everything else, including Linux

A virtuous cycle of learning and improvement best extends out to those users,
circling back via end-user services, support functions, and the developer
community.

Currently, the pillars operate semi-independently in what has been typical of
operations since the beginning of the project at Apache.


PMC/COMMITTERS
==============

PMC
---
The AOO PMC consists of 26 individuals as of 2015-09-30

   19 have remained continuously out of the
      23 from TLP formation in October, 2012.
    7 are new or returned PMC members

    6 of the current PMC are Apache Software Foundation
      members, including the original Chair

  2015-02-13 Dennis E. Hamilton joined the PMC
  2015-02-11 Jan Iversen returned to PMC as Chair
  2015-01-03 Mechtilde and Dr. Michael Stehmann joined the PMC
       The last preceding addition was on 2014-01-16

   2015-09-09 Ian Lynch (ingotian) deceased May, 2015
   2015-08-23 Jan Iversen retired
       The last preceding retirement was on 2014-08-30

PMC membership history is available in PDF at <http://s.apache.org/Tw8>.

Committers
----------

There are 139 committers as of 2015-09-30.  Twenty-four have registered PGP
keys.

   2015-08-06 Manik Malhotra added
   2015-07-27 Gavin McDonald added
       Last previous committer addition was Tal Daniel on 2014-04-29

   2015-09-23 Ingrid von der Mehden (ingrid), deceased 2013-06-12
   2015-09-09 Ian Lynch (ingotian), deceased May, 2015
   2015-08-23 Jan Iversen resigned
       Reduction in committers is generally not tracked.
       That's introduced now.


ISSUES
======

The lack of progress on all fronts in the project has been a
continuing issue.  Obstacles are being identified and brought before
the entire community for its wisdom in identification of consensus-
based direction.

Development
-----------

The ability to make "hot" maintenance releases on a compressed schedule for
critical defects and mitigation of security vulnerabilities remains to be
introduced post-4.1.2.  More compression and an abbreviated release process
are required to be able to make a hot update in around 30 days or less by
avoiding all feature enhancements and non-urgent fixes and using an existing
release as base.

    ACTIONS: Follow through with PMC to develop a slip-stream release setup
        that is always in hand regardless of what feature release development
        is underway.  Have in place as soon as possible after release 4.1.2.

There is an issue with respect to release dependencies based on optional
presence of a Java JRE of the same bit-ness (x86 or x64) as the installed
AOO binaries.  Absence of the corresponding JRE denies full functionality
(i.e., operation of the embedded help system and ability to use the default
database created by the OpenOffice Base application).  Although no JRE is
distributed with AOO, the dependency remains and is inadequately "optional"
according to Apache principles.

     ACTIONS: Verify the optionality consideration. Determine ways to
        avoid surprising and confusing the users.

Community
---------

At the moment, the various pillars (development, support, and end-user
service) are served by different individuals although a few notable
contributors work across the full span.

There is no consolidated organization of expertise (i.e., on the PMC) where
the diverse interests of contributors of all kinds, including end-users, are
aligned to address end-to-end project issues and direction.

Considering that the end-user population is dominated by Windows (87.7%)
and Macintosh (9.1%), it is a concern that the key developers have their
greatest affinity and direct experience with the least-popular platforms
(3.7%) in contrast.  It is also a concern that development does not keep
pace with the evolution of the dominant platforms and arrival of their new
variants.  Failure to do so blocks achieving ubiquitous presence in store
systems and other provisions that inspire end-user confidence and take-up.

Issues brought to the developer and user lists about usage are addressed by
volunteer users, sometimes unevenly.  Discussion is yet to begin on improved
coordination of issues across the Bugzilla, lists, wiki and forums.  There
is much room for more-reliable capture of issues and consistent provision of
resolutions and work-arounds.

There are clear misalignments that must be identified more closely and then
addressed.  A noteworthy example is the presence of long-standing (over
years) usability issues involving crashers for which no repairs have been
provided.  In the face of that, supporters of lists and forums have developed
manual power-user-class workarounds that are provided when the issues are
regulary reported anew.

   ASSESSMENT. The current arrangement is incoherent.  Separate actions
     among the pillars are sometimes at cross purposes, especially around
     usability issues that confront non-expert (i.e. most) users.
   ACTIONS
     Broaden participation and coordination among the PMC so that those
   with expertise on particular areas provide consultation and have their
   concerns heard.  Have all apprised of the overall picture so that impacts
   on areas of individual focus are better understood.
     Continue obtaining and presenting measures that expose recuring
   problems in the context of overall activity so that pain points can be
   appraised in a realistic manner aligned with the purpose of the project.


Sustainability
--------------
The following warning signs are noticed with regard to
sustainability.

CUSTOM IT SUPPORT.  The Project has not maintained consistent
support of the servers that is has agreed to operate as part of its
agreement with Infra. The services are at risk. (See Infrastructure
in the next section.)

RELEASE MANAGEMENT.  A single Release Manager has undertaken all
releases up until now.  On the stepping down of that RM, Andrea
Pescetti has stepped in for 4.1.2 and others are needed to rotate
into Release Management duties thereafter.

SKILL DEVELOPMENT. The learning curve required to contribute
effectively to the current code base has proven to make it difficult
to develop or attract experienced developers to the project. While the
ASF is traditionally about the people and not companies, the AOO
project is evaluating engagement with companies that might
have a strategic reason for contributing skills to the project.

EXISTING CAPACITY. The depth and breadth of developer coverage of
the code base will be assessed after the sprint toward release 4.1.2
can be reviewed and development and QA capacity assessed.

ISSUE CLEARANCE AND TECHNICAL DEBT.  Analysis of bugzilla status
since the inception of that database provides the following portrait
of issue legacy as of 2015-08-05

 * the oldest unresolved issue is #497 created on 2001-03-02
 * 24115/121298 (20%) issues are unresolved from before November,
              2012 commencement as a TLP
 * 2232/5139 (43%) issues unresolved of new issues from November,
              2012 through July, 2015
 * 192/452 (42%) issues unresolved of those created in the first
              seven months of 2015

There are a number of factors that impact the quality of these
statistics (PDF details at <http://s.apache.org/OEy>).  There is
every reason to fear that, after suitable filtering, the rate
of technical debt accrual is even greater than 42-43%.

The disposition of bugzilla issues will continue to be monitored
along with discussion of improved coordination across the user-facing
activities of the project.

   ASSESSMENT [2015-09-30]
     LACKING QU50: The project strives to respond to documented bug reports
        in a timely manner.

PMC OPERATION.  There is reduction of PMC-inessential discussions. There is
honoring of the principal that PMC-inessential topics one is unwilling to
discuss in public are not worth discussing in private.  Now the inhibition
to discuss community issues in public needs to be addressed.

COMMITTER/PMC AVAILABILITY. The list of OpenOffice commmitters does not
appear to reflect available, active committers.  A census of available
PMC/committers and their areas of commitment is called for.

  ACTION: Determine which committers/PMC failed to update their accounts
       during the past reset.  Determine which PMC/committers are no longer
       subscribed to the AOO dev list.  Confirm absence of participation
       and adjust accordingly.  Engage the remainder with regard to
       available capabilities and their capacity.  Complete in the
       October-December 2015 quarter.

Infrastructure Issues/Needs
---------------------------
Apache OpenOffice, by long-standing agreement with Apache Infra,
takes responsibility for the custom MediaWiki and Forum servers
operating on Infra-provided VMs.  Limited support is achieved;
more is required.  Although operational, the software is out-of-
date.

   There is also need to support buildbots from within the project.
   ACTION From 2015-09 Report. Clarify the situation and achieve a
sustainable arrangement in consultation with Infra.  Identify at least
temporary relief, with solid arrangement by January.
   PROGRESS: No progress in September.
   NEXT STEPS: To be carried out in the October-December 2015 Quarter.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Orc Project  [Owen O'Malley]

## Description:
   A high-performance columnar file format for Hadoop workloads.

## Issues:
 - Progress in separating out the Java ORC reader & writer from Hive has gone
   slowly. The progress on HIVE-10171 is currently 19 of 24 sub-taskes done.
   Part of the problem has been a lot of conflicting activity in the ORC code
   base from the development of LLAP. The LLAP branch has merged, which should
   slow down the churn on the code base.
 - The project needs to make a release soon to start developing the community.
   The release is blocked by getting the Java code out of Hive.

## Activity:
 - The Java ORC reader & writer, which are still in Hive, had 142 commits
   in the last 3 months.
 - The C++ ORC reader has only had 2 commits.

## Health report:
 - The activity is low. There are users asking for the Java release, which we
   are working on.

## Description:
  The Apache PDFBox library is an open source Java tool for working with
  PDF documents.

## Activity:
- after a long time of hard work we decided to cut a release candidate for
  2.0.0 this october. As we are down to 6 open tickets I'm quite optimistic
  that it'll really come true

Attachment AY: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Jim Jagielski]

## Description:
   STeVe is a system for managing a plethora of vote mechanisms, most notably
   the STV (Single Transferable Vote) method used in the ASF board elections.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Minor work on pySTeVe has been done, but the bulk of the program is, for the
   time being, considered stable, and so development has slowed down.
 - Suggestions to run some mock elections with ASF committers trying out the new
   system has been proposed, but not yet carried out.
 - We are discussing when/if/how to release the pySTeVe component.
 - Jim Jagielski has decided to step down as VP, and proposed Daniel Gruno to
   replace him in this role (see special order 7B). The PMC extends its thanks
   to Jim for the work he's done as VP.

## Health report:
 - The community remains healthy, albeit in a sort of hiatus state. This is
   likely due to ASF elections being about half a year away.
 - PMC remains alive and responsive when needed.

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 8 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Rich Bowen at Mon Apr 20 2015

## LDAP changes:

 - Currently 8 committers and 8 committee group members.

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [René Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made two GA releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.24.1 - security fix release (2015-09-15)
* Struts Annotations 1.0.6 - switch processing from APT to Annotation
Processor API (2015-09-29)

The Struts team made two BETA releases in the last quarter, for the
upcoming Struts 2.5 framework line
* Struts 2.5-BETA2 - bug fixes, security fixes and improvements over
BETA1 (2015-09-28)
* Struts 2.5-BETA1 - first public test version including consolidations,
deprecations, dependency upgrades and new feature additions (2015-07-17)

Within the reporting period we saw vivid development and feedback
activity. Work on Struts 2.5 moves forward quickly, with a first GA
version probably soon to be released. Struts 2.5 includes new features,
consolidations and dependency upgrades along with dropping support for
already deprecated APIs and framework parts. It is considered a
milestone release towards Struts 3, which is supposed to include major
new features as well as breaking changes.

We addressed two security issues in the last quarter, one of which lead
to a security announcement advising users to  switch off debug mode in
production environments [1], the other being addressed by Struts
2.3.24.1 security fix release [2].

We continue to see positive effects from our switch to a git-based
workflow being mirrored on GitHub, along with accepting external
contributions via pull requests combined with properly filed and
documented JIRA tickets. There is a significant rise in high quality
contributions by non-committers. The PMC is currently in the process of
voting on committership invitation for one of these individuals.

The Apache Struts project was also represented at ApacheCon EU: core at
the beginning of October. PMC member Johannes Geppert gave a talk
targeting the upcoming Struts 2.5 release and combining Struts 2 with
AngularJS.

No new committers or PMC members have been added in the last quarter.
Last PMC addition was on 2015-05-12, last committer addition on 2014-01-06.

We have no issues that require board assistance at this time.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Hiranya Jayathilaka]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

No new committers or PMC members were nominated during this period.
Latest Synapse committer was elected on December, 2013. Latest Synapse
PMC member was elected on December, 2013.

Releases
========

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on
January, 2012.

We continue to work with the Axis2 community on getting an Axis2 release
out, which has been a significant blocker for releasing Synapse. Note
that we are waiting for the Axis2 1.7 release which will be based on the
current SVN trunk of Axis2. This is necessary since the current Synapse
code depends on Axis2 trunk. The last Axis2 release (1.6.3 released
on June 2015), is a maintenance release based on the Axis2 1.6 branch.
This branch dates back to May 2011, and we haven't used it in Synapse
since our 2.1 release in January 2012. We used Axis2 1.6.1 in that
last release of Synapse, and we had to backport Synapse code from
Axis2 trunk to the 1.6 branch to make it happen. Since then both
Axis2 and Synapse trunks have evolved significantly, and we are now at a
position where backporting Synapse to Axis2 1.6 branch is no longer easy
nor makes sense.

Overall progress towards Axis2 1.7 and Synapse releases has been slow but
steady. Issues have been fixed/resolved more aggressively
than usual, and some of the build issues that have been affecting both
projects have been resolved. Overall, there have been multiple positive
signs that an Axis2 1.7 release is imminent.

Board Issues
============

None identified


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  We have begun to discuss the process of a change in project lead, as
  Howard Lewis Ship's involvement in the project has markedly
  decreased over the last year or more.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.8) has been released 20
  Nov 2014.  We have made available the a series of beta builds of the
  upcoming 5.4 release, (most recently, 5.4-beta-35, on 23 Aug 2015),
  following successful votes.

  Although a consensus has been reached to pursue a release candidate, the
  effort is currently stalled.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is slow. Questions are answered
  with participation of not only the core contributors but also by the
  community at large. Discussion focuses especially around new
  features of the upcoming 5.4 release. There are also occasional
  announcements concerning third-party libraries developed entirely
  outside the Tapestry team.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4
  which will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other
  new features.  At this point we are primarily looking at fixing bugs
  (from our large backlog) and documenting the significant new
  features.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 25 Apr 2014, and
  subsequently been voted into the PMC (2 Mar 2015).

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Tcl Project  [Massimo Manghi]

## Description:
 - Apache Tcl is an umbrella for Tcl-Apache integration efforts. Current
   projects are

 * Rivet
 * Websh

## Issues:
 - Even though websh has been so far maintained we agreed to
   discontinue the support of this subproject since there is no
   active interest in continuing its development. Apache Tcl
   will soon be comprising a single Tcl based project (Apache Rivet)

 - We will undertake next month a new campaign on the Tcl related
   communication channels (groups, IRC, etc) seeking for new
   contributors. Even though we are striving to keep up with the web
   programmer expectations we are aware Tcl has long lost attractiveness
   as a language for the web. That's the basic obstacle we are meeting
   to convince people to adopt our tools for their web programming.

## Activity:
 - Bug reports continue to be filed at a slow pace but we are
   responding to every new issue opened. We are doing new
   improvements to the development branch of mod_rivet.

 - RPMs for rivet 2.2.3 were made available with help of Petr
   Gajdos for SuSE Linux, Scientific Linux, RedHat, CentOs 6-7, and
   Fedora 22-23 on OBS.

## Mailing list activity:

   Activity on the mailing lists appears to be consistent with
   the traffic of previous quarters

 - websh-dev@tcl.apache.org:
    - 15 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 2 emails sent to list (6 in previous quarter)

 - rivet-dev@tcl.apache.org:
    - 48 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 70 emails sent to list (108 in previous quarter)

 - site-cvs@tcl.apache.org:
    - 5 subscribers (up 0 in the last 3 months):
    - 21 emails sent to list (33 in previous quarter)


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 10 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Brice Hamon De Crevecoer at Tue Nov 25 2014

## Releases:

 - Apache/Rivet released 2.2.3 on May 21st. We'll probably roll out a 2.2.4
   release in a few weeks
 - Websh is maintained but no new artifacts were released after
   3.6.0b5 (2009-09-24)

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Tez Project  [Hitesh Shah]

## Description:
  Apache Tez is an effort to develop a generic application framework which
  can be used to process arbitrarily complex directed-acyclic graphs (DAGs) of
  data-processing tasks and also a re-usable set of data-processing primitives
  which can be used by other projects.

## Activity:
  There is general momentum within the community to continue to fix
  issues as well as make performance improvements for the 0.6 and 0.7
  maintenance lines as well as the mainline master branch.
  The main master branch had a recent alpha release for the 3rd-party
  plugins work from TEZ-2003 and work continues on that to
  stabilize the feature/APIs for a future alpha/beta release.
  In addition, there were enhancements for the UI to support a more
  dynamic version with live updates to track the progress of Tez DAGs.

## Health report:
  The community is quite healthy. There have been 2 releases in
  the past quarter. The user@ list is active with questions raised
  by various users and generally prompt replies from the contributor
  community. Bikas Saha will be giving a talk on Tez at
  ApacheCon Europe in the Big Data track.

## Issues:
There are no issues that require the Board’s attention at this time.

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Traffic Server Project  [Leif Hedstrom]

## Description:
 Apache Traffic Server is an HTTP proxy server and cache, similar to Squid
 and Varnish in functionality and features.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
 - Our Fall 2015 Summit is planned for Mon-Tue Nov 16-17. A "barcamp" is
   planned for Sun Nov 15 as well. For more details see

      https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TS/Fall+2015+Summit

## Health report:
 - The lack of new committers has been discussed, and we have at least 3 more
   candidates that we are considering for vote. But we are seeing normal
   activity both on releases, contributions and mailing lists.
 - The PMC voted to remove 6 PMC members that were unreachable or unresponsive
   to several emails. This was a "Special Orders" agenda for the July 2015
   board meeting (see Item E). The removed PMC members are welcome back at any
   time. This explains the drop in PMC members compared to previous report.

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of
REST style web services. The core server runtime is based on the
JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client
runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side
runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.

There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.

Community:
The Wink project has a small community which is not very active. We have
had discussions on how to increase community activity, but nothing so far
has really been successful, the project continues to be a in a state where
it’s a mature project with steady but low user questions/answers on the
mailing list and a patch here and there. I believe Wink is a mature project
with active users and we should not consider any retirement actions at the
moment. Last svn activity shows most recent patch applied in march 2015.

Releases:
* Last release was Apache Wink 1.4.0 which was released on September 15, 2013

Committers or PMC changes:
* Voted Gerhard Petracek was added as a Wink committer in August 2013.

Trademark/Branding:
* No known issues.

Legal Issues:
* None

Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Wookie Project  [Scott Wilson]

Apache Wookie develops software related to implementation of the W3C
Widgets family of specifications.

ISSUES
As mentioned in previous reports, activity in the project has declined and is
now at a minimum with some questions from users and implementers but little on
the development side and also the community has not grown since 2013. The
reasons for this remain the same, in particular the lack of non-proprietary
adoption of the W3C widget specification.

FUTURE
We have begun a discussion within the project community on whether Wookie
should move to the attic; we will hold a vote on this before the next
reporting session.

RELEASES
Wookie 1.0 was released on 24th February 2014.

ACTIVITY
Work is still being undertaken on Wookie 2.0.

COMMUNITY
Our last committer and PMC member added was Steve Lee on 21st February 2013.

the Apache Hadoop project to our dedicated project resources. The community
has created a basic website with a contribution guide and are working to
complete blockers on our first release.

Mailing list activity is low but healthy, with several discussions around
project organization during our first month.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache Tomcat Project  [Mladen Turk]

This report from the Apache Tomcat PMC is being made at the recommendation of
V.P. Brand to support the Tomcat project's request for additional funding to
register our trademarks in the EU, India and China. This is in addition to our
registration in the US that is already in progress.

The funding required to meet this request is a one-off cost of $2,465.

The driver for this request is the desire of the Tomcat PMC to reduce the
ongoing impact of trademark infringements and to reduce the risk to the Tomcat
community of a future significant dispute over the project's marks.

The regions in this request for registration have been selected based on where
we see the greatest concentrations of the Tomcat community.

The board may think that since Tomcat has been in existence since 1999 that
the marks are well known and that there is no need to register the marks. The
Tomcat PMC strongly disagrees with this view. The longevity of the Tomcat
project means that a large eco-system of products has built up around Tomcat
and the size of that ecosystem increases, rather than decreases, the
likelihood of infringement.

The Tomcat PMC already has experience of handling multiple infringements of
the project's marks. We continue to concerned about any infringement due to
the potential harm it could cause to the community. The risks to the community
include:
- Potential users of Tomcat put off by their poor experience or the poor
experience of others with a low quality product intended to be used with
Tomcat that, due to the infringing name, is assumed to be a product of the ASF
and therefore indicative of the quality of ASF products.
- Potential users of Tomcat drawn to other products because those products
provide similar functionality to Tomcat and use an infringing name which
(deliberately or not) confuses users into thinking they are using Tomcat when
they are not.
- Resolving infringements requires significant volunteer energy which is then
not available to support the community. This reduces the quality of community
support and thereby makes Tomcat less attractive.
- Specifically for China, that operates a first to register rather than first
to use system, there is a significant risk that another organisation registers
Tomcat. That would cause us all sorts of problems that would require large
amounts volunteer energy to resolve as well as placing additional demands on
infrastructure.

All of these risks boil down to reducing the size of the Tomcat community and
diverting that community from developing, using and supporting Tomcat. The
smaller the community, the smaller the pool of contributors, the fewer of
those who will advance to committer and hopefully on to PMC member and ASF
member. The fewer committers and PMC members the community has, the greater
the risk to the long term survivability of the project.

To be clear, we are not saying that the Tomcat community is struggling to
survive under a flood of trademark infringements. We are saying the trademark
infringements have had, and continue to have, a negative impact on the project
and that registering our marks would reduce the ongoing impact and reduce the
risk of a future, more significant, trademark dispute.

It is also worth pointing out (with the notable exception of China) that
registration is not required in order to successfully resolve a trademark
dispute. However, as we explain later, registration does reduce the likelihood
of infringement and simplifies the process of resolution. Where the infringer
contests the issue, registration significantly reduces the time and cost of
resolution.

To date, the Tomcat PMC has resolved disputes using one of the following
paths:

1) A polite request to the product owners to change the name with which they
happily complied.
2) As 1) but the product owner had gone AWOL. In such cases the company
hosting the product (e.g. Apple, Google etc.) had to be approached to request
that the product is taken down.
3) A polite request to the product owners which is met with a "That trademark
isn't registered. I can do what I like." response. The PMC then has to take
the time to educate them that this is not that case and, eventually, the
product name is changed.
4) A large(ish) corporation has a commercial product based on Tomcat and the
sales/marketing team are keen to emphasis this to sell their product based on
Tomcat's reputation. This normally results in multiple small to medium
infringements over a long period of time. It has been resolved by an ongoing
engagement by the PMC with the infringing company to educate as to what is
allowed and to encourage the company to put processes in place to reduce /
eliminate future infringing. Depending on the frequency and serious of the
infringements, support from V.P. Brand / ASF lawyers may be requested to get
the message across to more senior figures.

1) Is easy to fix and not a great drain on the project since it only takes a
few minutes to send a polite e-mail.

2) Depends a lot on the hosting company. Some are easier to work with than
others. Resolving these usually takes a couple of hours.

3) We have had several of these and they can take up a fair amount of
volunteer time (days) to resolve.

4) We have only had one of these but it took weeks of volunteer time and
support from V.P. Brand to resolve. It also requires ongoing monitoring to
ensure that the issue remains resolved.


The benefits to the Tomcat PMC of registering our marks are as follows:
- less volunteer energy required to resolve 'simple' infringements since a
registered mark negates the whole "But that mark isn't registered"
counter-argument;
- less volunteer energy required to resolve 'simple' infringements since a
registered mark simplifies the trademark infringement reporting process for
most large 'hosting' providers (e.g. Google, Apple, etc.)
- less corporate infringements (and hence less volunteer energy required to
resolve them) since a registered mark will appear in the searches performed
when selecting product names and corporations tend to give registered marks a
wider berth than unregistered ones;
- significantly reduces the potential for us to lose the right to use the
project mark's in China;
- should an infringer refuse to stop their infringement (we haven't had this
happen yet but it feels like only a matter of time) a registered mark greatly
simplifies the resolution process (and makes it a lot less expensive).

On that last point, there have been a couple of occasions where it felt like
it was 50/50 whether the infringing party was going to stop the infringement.
Fortunately, so far, continued dialogue has resulted in the right outcome.
However, it does feel like only matter of time before an infringer refuses to
stop their infringement. Having the marks registered before that happens will
save us both time and money in that case.
