 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       The availability of a new tool to help projects prepare their reports
       has been very successful, with several projects making use of it and
       including a note of thanks. Hopefully this will help take care of the
       regular comments about release/committer/PMC change dates. However,
       the board will need to continue to monitor reports that seem to become
       driven by the template and don't offer insight into project or the
       health of the community based on those data points.

       Preparations are in full swing for the Annual Members Meeting next
       week, being held earlier this year as discussed in previous reports.
       Despite a slightly shorter period of time for nominations, we have
       received a solid number for both the board and for new members.

       I'd like to thank the board for all their hard work over the last 10
       months, and for enjoying a productive working relationship together.
       I wish all the same to the incoming board. It has again been a joy to
       serve you as Chairman and I thank you for the opportunity.

    B. President [Ross]

       Exec assistant contract and financial package with Virtual as a PEO
       has hit a snag, we will likely not hit April 1st.

       I have added a proposed budget a discussion item and ask the board to
       evaluate this and provide feedback for the incoming board to consider
       next month.

       Melissa has been very busy with ApacheCon preparations this month. She
       has also received detailed information from VP Brand Management that
       allows her to assist with processing requests. 

       Fundraising has progressed with selecting a CRM solution. They have
       opted to use the free services of Zoho. This will be used for managing
       sponsor relations and will replace the spreadsheet previously
       maintained by Melissa. In addition sponsorship years will be aligned
       to our financial year in the future. This will simplify the account
       management process. An update of the "thanks" page is also underway.

       Marketing proceeds as usual with no specific items of note.

       Infrastructure hit a few issues this month resulting in two services
       falling below the SLA (people.apache.org with 98.83% and the moin moin
       wiki, with 93.31%). There has been some concern over the handling of
       outages of the download service. The root cause was undocumented
       manual steps in the configuration of these services, this has now been
       rectified. The current hot topic is the proposal to retire the CMS
       service, our projects have been asked to provide feedback, after which
       infra will decide how to proceed. 

       VP Brand Management has enlisted the support of our EA to help clear a
       backlog of trademark requests from our projects. This has resulted in
       an increase in activity relating to US registrations. A risk analysis
       is underway, as is the creation of a list of marks the foundation has.
       This list will eventually be used to provide a prioritized list based
       on the risk analysis document.

       VP Brand reached out to one PMC indicating this would cause a problem
       as their requirements would require significant budget. I have
       communicated to the PMC in question that this is not necessarily the
       case since this is a proposed budget requiring feedback from VP Brand.
       Furthermore, I asserted that the President and the Board will welcome
       requests for additional funding if it is necessary.

       VP Brand has reached out to all PMCs outlining the importance of brand
       management. he has also asked Melissa to follow up with all PMCs who
       have previously expressed an interest in registering their brand. As a
       result a few PMCs have begun the process of registering their marks.

       No TAC report was submitted this month. This is a regular occurrence.
       Melissa reports everything is on track thanks to the work of the
       committee in particular Jan Iverson who is working hard to coordinate
       the committee volunteers. Once again Nick Birch has stepped in to
       address a financial mis-step in paying for reserved flights. Melissa
       is monitoring the situation and ensuring Nick is reimbursed ASAP.

       This year the TAC committee spotted an applicant who provided
       incorrect information in their application. The committee, with full
       support of the VP, decided to withdraw their application as a result.
       My thanks go to the TAC team for their vigilance.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        The Treasurer’s Office worked with Virtual to handle
        remittance for TAC flights in coordination with the EA.
        
        The Treasurer worked with VP, Brand and Virtual to 
        provide a detailed Brand financial/spending report.
        
        The Treasurer’s Office worked with the President to provide
        a monthly accounting for officers to check spending against
        the budget. In addition the office worked with the President
        to provide input for the President’s budget for the new FY.
        
        The 990 for Apache’s taxes has now been finalized working
        with Virtual and the CPA.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       The work of secretary continues apace. All proxies for the March
       members' meeting received as of March 18 have been filed. A total of
       20 proxies are now filed.

       In February, 66 iclas, seven cclas, and three grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       Not much to report this month. Doing last minute promotion for
       ApacheCon and filling slots as speakers cancel for one reason
       or another.

       Early bird pricing ends on the 21st.

       I can now confirm that about 6 of the original Apache Group
       will be in attendance, and leading a nostalgic panel to
       celebrate httpd's 20th birthday.
       
       The CFP for ApacheCon Europe will be opening very soon,
       probably before ApacheCon North America.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]
    
       I participated in a couple marketing/PR events under my title
       this past month, but otherwise: quiet as usual.

                             =======

    Shane: 
      Any time a PMC requests registering their trademarks in the U.S. the
      registration will be approved.  But if there are extraordinary legal or
      filing costs, the PMC will need to justify it.

    Ross: 
      The key point is that the PMCs take the lead to register the marks.

Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, tm-registrations@, and board@) and following-up with
appropriate personnel.

Fundraising:  
• Work continues with Hadrian on past-due and upcoming renewals 
• Will be migrating the information from the spreadsheet over to Zoho CRM
• Payment received from a platinum sponsor
Virtual:
• After discussions with Ross and Tom, it was agreed that I will be switching
over to a Virtual employee
• Had discussions w/Virtual’s HR folks and completed the paperwork for them to
proceed
ApacheCon and TAC:
• I’d like to give a great shout out to Jan Iversen for all of his hard work
and diligence with the handling of the TACers! Thank you, Jan!!
• With the exception of one (waiting to receive a passport), all flights have
been booked.  Despite the fact that it took approximately two weeks to get the
wire transfer sent/received, we were lucky in that the original estimates of
the fares remained the same (we usually get zapped here with fares going up).
• The initial payment for the flights didn’t cover all of the flights, so Nick
decided rather than waiting for another transfer and risk the flights going
up, he put the remainder on his credit card.
• For the first time since I’ve been assisting TAC, we overturned and withdrew
an acceptance due to discovering false information that was submitted on the
application.  The applicant did not disclose the fact that he was receiving
financial aid from another source and tried to hide it and deny it after he
brought it up.  The TAC judges ruled on dismissing him, and Gav as VP of TAC
supported that decision.
• Working with the hotel now for securing the TACers lodging; sent the
financial information to Nick in order to request a wire transfer. 
• I’ve registered the TACers for the conference using Craig’s cc and submitted
that info to Accounting.
• Collaborated with Sally on giveaways
• Working with LF regarding the booth logistics
• Made hotel reservations for two Infra personnel and Sally Trademarks:
• Now that there is a clear process in place, work has resumed with Trademarks
• Sent several follow-up emails to PMCs that had previously expressed interest
in registering their projects’ marks.  As a result, a few have progressed into
the stage of their application being submitted to the USPTO.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

## Budget:

I hope the board will approve the President's submitted Brand budget, based on
actual past year spend.  The board should be aware that if many projects
request registrations - especially any projects that may require additional
legal support - I expect we may make an additional budget request in the
future at that time.

The actual spend for the past year is lower than expected due to several
factors, both in speed of execution for existing registration questions, as
well as some billing delays from counsel (i.e. where we were billed much later
than I had expected for previous services).

## Operations:

Unblocked the ™-registrations@ process for handling PMC questions about
registrations, which resulted in several earlier requests now being processed.

Posted Apache Branded Social Media Guidelines/Best practices, based on the
excellent guidelines the Apache CloudStack project; we hope all Apache
projects will find them useful.  Review welcomed before pushing them out.

  http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/socialmedia

Posted Apache Project Branding Best Practices and emailed to PMCs.

  http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/register

Working on trademarks@ as well as with DLAPiper counsel to prepare information
on risk analysis for our current trademark policy and our current low rate of
registrations for projects overall per the board and President's request. 
Note: I do not expect full details available for this month's meeting.

Requested operations@ generate a full listing page of trademarks for all
Apache projects.  If this is not practical for our own infra to perform, I
would recommend that we add budget to create this in the future.

Requested a detailed cost accounting from DLAPiper per request of
Treasurer/Virtual for use in future audit.

## Registrations: 

Our registration application for HADOOP in Korea has been formally refused due
to a pre-existing registration for similar claimed software products. Korea is
a first-to-file country.

At the request of the relevant PMCs, we submitted US registration applications
for: PDFBOX, CTAKES, HBASE.

The OpenMeetings, Traffic Server, Tomcat, CouchDB, DeltaSpike, and Spark have
requested to register their project names; we're still coordinating getting
all the information needed to counsel.

The Cassandra PMC has requested to register their mark, however we are waiting
for a third party consent to be signed before proceeding to prevent any
problems.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Jim Jagielski]

See Melissa's report for more details.

Since last board meeting:
* made formal proposal to use zoho for our crm needs.
* proposal was accepted, all interested parties got user accounts.
* we expect to have all data moved from google before the end
  of the week
* another proposal was made in collaboration with Virtual to 
  align the sponsorship year with our fiscal quarters. The goal 
  is to simplify both accounting and subscription management.
* the collaboration with Virtual works very well and we're getting
  very efficient with the execution. Thanks Lynsey and Tom!

* we will next focus on the process and iron out the details
  in Apr, at ACNA; most of us will attend; this is the major focus 
  for next month
* second is updating the "thanks" page to use Daniel's template;
  there are some (minor) technical hurdles in mixing mdtext and
  html. Ideally the page should be generated, but that's a longer 
  shot.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
N/A

Finances:
==========
$135.40 - Hetzner.de
$285.00 - Silicon Mechanics
$1267.11 - Amazon Web Services
$17.49 - Dotster

Operations Action Items:
========================
N/A

Short Term Priorities:
======================
Codesigning
-----------
There have been several signing events in the past month. 
4 total signing events for Tomcat 8.0.19 and 8.0.20. 
1 total signing event for OpenMeetings 3.0.4

Machine deprecation
-------------------
We continue to make progress in moving services off of some
of our oldest hosts. 

VMware issues
-------------
We experienced repeated network failures on one of our newer
VMware hosts. This took down most or all services on the host
repeatedly. This appears to be related to time issues, and seems
to have settled down, though we continue to watch it closely. 

Backups
-------
The new backup service is moving along well. 7 of our hosts are 
currently backed up by the new service. Our goal is to have all
of the hosts backed up by end of the year and deprecate our 
Florida colo and the machine running there. 

Long Range Priorities:
======================
Automation
----------
We've made good progress on a number of automation fronts. 
The work to automate Confluence has been done, and the service will 
move hosts in the coming weeks. 
A number of our SSL Endpoints have now been puppetized, as have services
like asfbot, svngit2jira, and gitpubsub. 

Resilience
----------
We haven't made a lot of progress on this front in the past month aside from
the ongoing automation efforts. 

Technial Debt
-------------
We've run into a bit of technical debt surrounding CGI pages. This had a
deleterious affect on a number of projects. Several pieces of debt from
this were discovered. The first was that a contractor had been manually
setting the executable bit across hosts. The second was that the CMS was
not picking up and communicating permission changes even when set 
appropriately. There had been a custom CGI module written in the past, and 
we initially spent a large amount of time trying to get that to work in our
new environment to much frustration. In the end, we decided that having to 
bear responsibility to maintain a custom module was more technical debt that
we were amassing. In the end we set the executable bit for a number of
projects by using svnadmin karma. We believe these issues to now be resolved.

Monitoring
----------
In the past month we've uncovered a few holes in our monitoring that has
resulted in users pointing out problems to us. We are still working to 
fill those holes. 
 
General Activity:
=================

CMS
-----
As mentioned in last month's report; we are struggling to find a solution
for the CMS which is on an aging physical host. We've sent a request for 
comments on some of our proposed solutions to PMCs and operations@
http://s.apache.org/iL4

Uptime Statistics:
==================

Overall, the total uptime for 2015 fell by 0.05% this month, mostly
contributed to by some issues with one of the VMWare hosts, as well as
people.apache.org growing slightly more unstable (though nothing alarming).
We currently have two services with uptime below the SLA (people.apache.org
with 98.83% and the moin moin wiki, with 93.31%), while the remaining 26 in
the uptime sample are above the SLA. The bad performance of the wiki is due
the fact that the moin moin wiki was not designed to scale well, thus
resulting in a lot of >30s response times - not errors per se, but still
counted towards its uptime.


Type:                Target:   Reality, total:  Reality, month:  Target Met:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Critical services:   99.50%             99.65%           99.44%      Yes/No
Core services:       99.00%             99.83%           99.84%      Yes
Standard services:   95.00%             98.95%           98.82%      Yes

Attachment E: Report from the Apache APR Project  [Jeff Trawick]

The Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project creates and maintains
software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface
to underlying platform-specific implementations.  The sub-projects
which are released somewhat regularly are APR and APR-util.  In addition,
the APR-iconv sub-project is commonly used but has not had a release
since 2007.

Releases
========
The project has not produced any releases this quarter.  APR 1.5.1 was
released on April 21, 2014.  APR-util 1.5.3 was released on November 18,
2013.

A maintenance release of APR is needed, and should be anticipated this
quarter.  (This is essentially the same statement as in the prior APR
board report; no release was prepared since that report.)

Community
=========
Currently APR has 64 committers and 38 PMC members.

New PMC members: none
The last new PMC member was added in November of 2013.

New committers: none
The last two committers were added in June of 2014.

From reporter.apache.org:

 - dev@apr.apache.org:  
    - 360 subscribers (down -5 in the last 3 months): 
    - 60 emails sent to list (71 in previous quarter) 
   
 - bugs@apr.apache.org:  
    - 18 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months): 
    - 28 emails sent to list (65 in previous quarter) 

Activity
========

Mailing list activity has been the lightest in this quarter (thus far) as
in any quarter in the history of the project.  (The same statement was 
valid for the previous quarter.)

Commit activity is low.

Seven bugs were opened during the reporting period.  Only one bug has had
any developer followup (closure or discussion) during the period, and only
because the chair noticed a problematic bug report while preparing this
report.

Issues
======
There are no board-level issues at this time.  That being said, project
members should be aware of the need to react more quickly to users, at the
very least to offer encouragement to those submitting patches in hopes of
growing the developer community.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache BookKeeper Project  [Ivan Kelly]

BookKeeper is a distributed, reliable, and high performance
logging service. The project also includes Hedwig which is
a highly scalable Pub/Sub service built on top of ZooKeeper
and BookKeeper with strong durability guarantees.

= Project Status =

We made a press release, announcing our move to TLP, through the
foundation on 2015-01-27. This triggered Yahoo to publish a blog post
about their internal usage of BookKeeper in their cloud messaging
service.

Development activity finally picked up at the end of February after a
couple of months of being slow, due to the Christmas period and some
committers changing jobs.

= Releases =
Our last release was 4.2.4, released on 2015-01-22.

A release candidate for 4.3.1 was released on 2015-02-13, but it did
not pass due to some flakiness in tests. We are currently addressing
the flakiness and should cut a new candidate soon.

= Community Status =
There have been no committers added since we became TLP (2014-11-19),
though we are currently in the process of adding one committer.

The last committer added, when we were a subproject, was Rakesh
Radhakrishnan on 24th July 2014.

No infrastructure issues.

51 subscribers in dev@bookkeeper.apache.org
67 subscribers in user@bookkeeper.apache.org

Attachment K: Report from the Apache BVal Project  [Matt Benson]

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases. Last release was v0.5 in September 2012.

### Activity ###
Our activity level certainly does not mark us as a glamorous project; there has
been a single commit since the report of Q4 2014. Mailing list traffic is
nonexistent. Once again, there is little reason to fear we would be unable to
release from a voting perspective, but our current level of developer "steam" is
such that a release vote is not a concern for the immediate future. All hope is
not lost but volunteer burnout is certainly a factor.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.
Last PMC member added Q4 2013
Last committer added Q3 2013

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Deltacloud Project  [Marios S. Andreou]

Apache Deltacloud defines a web service API for interacting with cloud
service providers and resources in those clouds in a unified manner. In
addition, it consists of a number of implementations of this API for the
most popular clouds. It also provides an implementation of DMTF CIMI,
and tools around that API to help make it more easily consumable.

-- Releases/Development --

1.1.4 - in progress
1.1.3 - 2013-04-22
1.1.2 - 2013-03-13
1.1.1 - 2013-02-13
1.1.0 - 2013-01-15

-- Overall activity in the past quarter --

Thanks very much to Chris Mattmann and Brett Porter for reaching out on
behalf of the board. So the reality of the situation is that none of the 
current PMCs or committers have cycles to dedicate to Deltacloud. Given this 
I believe the best course of action is to move Apache Deltacloud to the attic. 

I have started a voting thread to this effect on the deltacloud private list 
which closes on Wednesday 11 March 2015 @ 1200 CET. [1]

-- Last committers and PMC members elected --

Change of PMC chair 29 May 2013
(Marios S. Andreou takes over from David Lutterkort)

Tomas Sedovic (August 2012) and Dies Koper (December 2012) voted in as
committers.

Dies Koper was voted into the Deltacloud PMC in July 2013.

[1] Hey folks:

so I think it is pretty obvious that none of us have the cycles to look
this way any more. The board is asking about the progress of the project
since (unsurprisingly) the last few board reports have reported no
progress. At this point I am heavy-heartedly proposing that we retire
the project to the Apache Attic [1] and simultaneously dissolve this PMC.

Vote:

Move Apache Deltacloud to the Apache Attic [1] (where 'move' means
putting into motion the process @ [2])
*and*
Dissolve the Apache Deltacloud PMC,

Vote closes Wednesday 11th March 2015 @ 1200 CET.

Thanks everyone for your guidance, efforts and contributions to
Deltacloud.

all the best, marios

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Flex Project  [Alex Harui]

Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based
applications for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.

RELEASES
-Apache Flex SDK 4.14.0 was released on 1/26/14.
-A vote for Apache Flex BlazeDS 4.7 was in progress.

-Apache Flex Tour De Flex Component Explorer 1.2 was released on 11/28/14.
-Apache Flex Tool API 1.0.0 was released on 11/20/14
-Apache Flex Squiggly 1.1 was released on 10/26/14
-Apache Flex Installer 3.1.0 was also released on 7/14/14.
-Apache FlexJS 0.0.2 was released on 7/17/14.
-Apache Flex FalconJX 0.0.2 was released on 7/17/14.

ACTIVITY
Activity in Apache Flex is becoming more diverse.  While there is still
work going on fixing bugs in the existing Adobe Flash Platform-dependent
code base, and on FlexJS, a version of Flex that is independent from the
Adobe Flash Platform, the past three months saw contributions to the
Installer, the preparation of a BlazeDS release, and discussion leading
towards a PMD release, a new Installer release, and a 4.14.1 bug fix
release.

In the past two months, it feels like activity has slowed a bit:
- The gap is widening between bugs filed vs bugs fixed and the bug fix
  rate is slightly slowing.
- We’ve had two months of lower email traffic on dev@, but that might
  just mean there are fewer long controversial discussions.
- We only elected two new committers and didn’t promote anyone to the PMC.

IP Issues
In the course of reviewing the 4.14.0 release, we found several IP issues,
one with the release artifacts itself, and the other in one of our Git
repos.

The source artifact was missing attribution for some of the W3C code we
bundle from Batik.  The binary artifact bundled other binaries and hadn’t
copied all of the content from NOTICE files from the bundled binaries.  We
also found that some of the jar files in the binary artifact were missing
or didn’t have the right LICENSE and NOTICE files bundled into the
artifact.

We think we’ve addressed all of these issues, but are wondering whether we
have to go back and fix older releases.

Also during the release review, a PMC member did a full review of one of
the Git repos that has a subset of its files bundled into the source
artifact.  He discovered that some of the files that don’t go into the
release had IP issues.  These files were brought in during incubation, but
because they never got released, they never got a serious IP review.  I’m
wondering if we missed a step before graduation where we were supposed to
review every file.  There are probably other files in other repos that
might have the same issue.  What is the priority level on doing such a
review?

The main issue was that there was public domain content in some of the
test media that didn’t have attribution anywhere.  There was much debate
on how to deal with the headers on some of these files.  There was also
some content that was copyright to Adobe, the UN or NY Times.  This
content has been replaced.  Adobe’s legal team was notified since the
donated code came from a SourceForge repo and thus had the same missing
attribution.  Adobe chose a different way to provide attribution for the
public domain content.

Code Donation Update
-Swiz donation is still pending.  The donor has not filed the paperwork.
The main issue was collecting signatures from the many major
Contributors who have all moved on to new things.

COMMUNITY
-Aaron Nash, Maxim Solovodnik were added as a committers.
-Latest analytics include around 2000 hits per day on the website during
the work week (less on weekends).  That’s about the same as previous
report.
-There were more than 4,500 installs of 4.14.0 in the month its release.
-More than 40,000 people have run the Tour De Flex application.  Tour De
Flex is a set of examples folks use to learn how to develop Flex
applications.
-The number of people subscribed to the dev list has fallen from 854
about a year ago to 799 now.

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache Gump Project  [Stefan Bodewig]

Apache Gump is a cross-project continuous integration server.  Gump's
intention isn't so much to be a CI server but rather a vehicle that
makes people look beyond their project's boundaries and helps the
projects to collaborate.

Gump is written in Python and supports several build tools and version
control systems.  The Apache installation of Gump builds ASF as well
as non-ASF projects and their dependencies.  It started in the Java
part of the foundation but also builds projects like APR, HTTPd and
XMLUnit.NET.

== Summary ==

Gump has learned to use Gradle to build projects.

Gump seems to create useful results for the few projects that use it.

== Releases ==

Gump has never done any releases.  One reason for this is that the ASF
installations of Gump work on the latest code base almost all of the
time following its "integrate everything continuously" philosophy.

== Activity ==

One of the projects (Hamcrest) built by Gump recently switched to
Gradle as its build tool so we had to catch up.  After figuring out a
way to integrate Gradle, we realized the new Hamcrest version wasn't
compatible with the old one (it's a new major release, so that's to be
expected) and we had to provide a packaged up version of Hamcrest 1.3
anyway.  This means the only gradle build we've got doesn't do much
more than validating Hamcrest can be built.

This quarter was the first time a project tried the support for
different git branches that has been present for some time.

As more long running test projects have been added we needed to change
vmgump's configuration to perform three runs a day rather than four.

=== Mailing-List Statistics ===

general@gump.apache.org:
Currently: 49 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months) (139 emails
sent in the past 3 months, 135 in the previous cycle)

commits@gump.apache.org:
Currently: 20 subscribers (down -1 in the last 3 months) (142 emails
sent in the past 3 months, 81 in the previous cycle)

== Changes to the Roster ==

All ASF committers have write access to the metadata that configure
the ASF installations.

The last changes to the PMC have seen Konstantin Kolinko and Mark
Thomas join in November 2014.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Roman Shaposhnik]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are currently 38 podlings undergoing incubation. Aurora is considering
graduation and two new podlings (AsterixDB and CommonsRDF) joined the
Incubator. Due to the low activity level, Kalumet community is thinking about
retiring Kalumet from the incubator.

It seems that Wave podling may need some help. It is not clear whether the
community is any closer to graduation or a different option needs to be
explored. The community indicated that they are close to producing their
first release. That said, the report has not been signed and we may want
to solicit additional cycles to help the community come up with a plan.

Incubator PMC voted in a new Chair (Ted Dunning) and a resolution has
been submitted to the board.

A discussion thread on Groovy entering incubation process has started.

AsterixDB

Apache AsterixDB is a scalable big data management system (BDMS) that 
provides storage, management, and query capabilities for large collections 
of semi-structured data.

AsterixDB has been incubating since 2015-02-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Bootstrap podling
  2. Get SGA signed from UCI and others.
  3. Code drop and start actively using lists.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No, just getting started.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Right not working on everyone's account setup, code submission and 
  SGA and answering questions. Also getting discussion set up on mailing
  lists as they were recently created.


How has the project developed since the last report?

  No last report.

Date of last release:

  No Releases yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No elected PMC and/or committers

--------------------
BatchEE

The Apache BatchEE project aims to provide a JBatch implementation 
(aka JSR-352) and a set of useful extensions for this specification.

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase the community
  2. Improve our documentation

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No, activity is still moderate but the project code itself is stable


How has the community developed since the last report?

  We again got patches and had questions on the mailing list.  No new
  committer though.


How has the project developed since the last report?

  BatchEE already gets used in real world projects.  It is now also part of
  Apache TomEE-2.0 which will target JavaEE-7 as soon as we get the JavaEE
  TCK.  Please note that the TCK issue doesn't affect BatchEE as the JSR-352
  spec and TCK are licensed under ALv2 (txs IBM!).

  Mark Struberg presented BatchEE on ApacheCon and will speak about it again
  at JavaLandConf in Germany in March.

Date of last release:

  2014-08-09 batchee-0.2-incubating

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  during inubation. We are still watching a contributor who pretty regularly
  ships small patches. Too less to pick him though.

    Mailing list activity is very light.  Podling might be struggling with
    growth aspects (community & release).

--------------------
Brooklyn

Brooklyn is a framework for modelling, monitoring, and managing applications
through autonomic blueprints.

Brooklyn has been incubating since 2014-05-01.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Grow the community
  2. More diversity of the committers/PPMC (currently biased towards
     employees of a single organization)
  3. Following up our first release with further, regular, releases

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Our community continues to grow slowly but surely, and every month
  receives interest and contributions from new community members.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Code continues to be proposed and merged at a high rate. We are
  satisfied with our technical velocity.

  We plan to follow up our December release with a further release
  as soon as we can, and following this up with regular releases.

Date of last release:

  2014-12-23 (apache-brooklyn-0.7.0-M2-incubating)

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No change since 2014-07-02.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Integrate the project in the ASF infrastructure and get adopted
     the Apache Way. 
  2. Evolve the current design towards achieving agreed goals. 
  3. Build a community around the project, establishing relations with
     related projects, both at ASF (Jena, etc) and out (Sesame). 

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Nothing to report.

Corinthia

Corinthia is a toolkit/application for converting between and editing common
office file formats, with an initial focus on word processing. It is
designed to cater for multiple classes of platforms - desktop, web, and
mobile - and relies heavily on web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript for representing and manipulating documents. The toolkit is
small, portable, and flexible, with minimal dependencies. The target
audience is developers wishing to include office viewing, conversion, and
editing functionality into their applications.

Corinthia has been incubating since 2014-12-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Discuss and decide on a medium-term roadmap
  2. Finalize source structure change (easy access for new developers)
  3. Get the first release out

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be

Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Due to the low activity level, Kalumet community is thinking about
  retiring Kalumet from the incubator.

Community Developement:

  Apache Kalumet 0.6-incubating version has been released.  However, due to
  some misunderstanding, the release vote has not been completed by 3 IPMC.
  Especially, some legal files issues have been raised.

  We are preparing a 0.6.1-incubating release to fix the legal files and
  submit to IPMC vote.

  We are in the way of promoting the documentation on the website.

Project Development:

  We are preparing the 0.6.1-incubating (plan for December, 27) to fix the
  legal files issues raised on 0.6-incubating release and have a complete
  IPMC vote.

  We are preparing the 0.7-incubating release with the development changes.

  A new contributor has been identified and started to work on some issues
  and refactoring of the webconsole (mockup provided using Vaadin).

  Local branches have been created containing:

  - new model and REST API
  - new webconsole (remove of Echo framework)

  These local branches will be merged on the 0.7-incubating branch (master).

  Before Graduation:

  - The documentation has been updated and aligned with the 0.6-incubating
    release. The documentation will be promoted on the website and "linked"
    in announcement e-mails as soon as the 0.6.1-incubating release has been
    voted.
  - The 0.7-incubating release will fix the graduation issue, especially in
    term of license (removal of Echo2 framework for the UI).

  Post Graduation:

  - Kalumet scripts. It's the extension of the "software" concept globally
    to all Kalumet resources. It will allow users to create custom
    deployment/update plan, with a set of fine-grained steps.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of:

  None so far.

  1. Create a release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

  Not grown. However the project aims to become a sub project of Apache
  Logging again.  Community growth is not much a matter for this podling, as
  long as there are a few active contributors.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Not much: Some approach has been made to push towards a release, but there
  wehere no updates regarding this approach for the last weeks. There
  currently doesn't seem to be any public development, though support is
  given, bugs are tracked and some patches have been applied.

  Drew Farris (drew): 
  
     One active mentor this month. There was some delay in obtaining
     sufficient PPMC/IPMC votes on this month's release. The project
     currently appears to have a single active developer, however I concur
     with the comments on potential community growth as indicated in the
     report. It looks like things are headed in the appropriate direction to
     attract new users and developers. Congratulations on the release.

TinkerPop

TinkerPop is a graph computing framework written in Java

TinkerPop has been incubating since 2015-01-16.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. We need to fully migrate to Apache infrastructure -- Migrating GitHub
     to JIRA is all that is left. This should happen next week.
  2. We need to get our SNAPSHOT deployment going -- AsciiDoc, JavaDoc, and
     SNAPSHOT jars. We have Jenkins works for us, just need to go the final
     mile.
  3. We need to release 3.0.0.M8. This will be a great milestone showing
     that TinkerPop is full-on Apache and producing like a well oiled
     machine.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Everything has been going smoothly since the last report. While the
  processes are slower than we would like, they are moving along. Getting
  past the infrastructure migration will be a big win for us.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have not grown our committer pool. Currently it is still only Marko,
  Stephen, and James. Those individuals that were committers when TinkerPop
  was outside of Apache are currently providing pull requests. When we get
  past the infrastructure migration process, Stephen and I plan to recommend
  a few long term TinkerPop developers to join as committer pool and thus,
  grow the developer community.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have migrated from GitHub to ApacheGit. We have migrated our website
  from http://tinkerpop.com to http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/. We
  have migrated our GitHub presence to Apache GitHub
  (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tinkerpop). We have prepped our
  source code with ASF preamble headers and have gutted all "non-Apache
  compliant" dependencies (save for one -- we are working with our mentors
  on this). Finally, on the development front, the developers are coding
  every day.

  3. The project needs to attract more developers and users.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None at this time.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community has been slow to develop.  There are still many people
  downloading and using the software, we have seen several bug reports and
  questions, but there has not been much contribution by new members.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The code for the release has largely been finalized.  We believe that
  major legal and technical issues have been overcome.  Only a few finals
  steps remain. The project blieves that we are finally ready to make a
  release.

entirely an automated port, so this project will never require a lot of
developers.  The user community is active.

No releases were made last quarter.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Lucene.Net Project  [Prescott Nasser]

Apache Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in 
C#  and targeted at .NET runtime users.
 
== Summary ==

As last reported, we were concerned with the stagnant nature of our PMC. 
That concern is fading as we've seen a large uptick in community invovlement
from both the current commiters/PMC members as well as the greater community.

- Continous Integration is now fully configured
- We're still looking at website refresh

Pushing hard on 4.8.0.
 - Approxmiately 200 commits in the last quarter to move our port along
 - 4 community members submitted patches to the port (who are not commiters
   or PMC members)
 - Currently we have ~120 failing tests to fix, as well as some additional 
   libraries that help users make the most of Lucene.Net (Suggest, Analysis,
   Highligthers, QueryParser, Codecs and afew others)
 - Mailing list messages are also on the up tick.

== Crowdfunding ==

One of our PMC members (Itamar Syn-Hershko), is working on launching a crowd 
funding campaign to allow him to finalize the work he has been tirelessly 
putting into the 4.8.0 release. The PMC is supportive of his efforts.

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard.

A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014. We have extended the
coverage for the IETF JOSE specifications (that is strictly correlated to
OAuth 2) as JWS
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-36). The
current intention is to extend the coverage to the JWE part. Users activity is
growing slowly but steadily (the user@ mailing list has got new messages from
new users). We got some feedback from some users about our not too clear
documentation.

Hence we are planning to improve this area.

COMMUNITY

PMC composition has not changed since graduation We have voted one new
committer Jasha Joachimstha in January 2015

Attachment AR: Report from the Apache OODT Project  [Tom Barber]

Apache OODT is a software framework as well as an architectural style for the
rapid construction of scientific data systems.  It provides components for
data capture, curation, metadata extraction, workflow management, resource
management, and data processing.

RELEASES/DEVELOPMENT

• OODT-0.8.1 on 2015-02-13
• OODT-0.8 on 2014-12-25
• OODT-0.7 on 2014-09-19

We resolved 22 issues in JIRA [JIA] for release 0.8 and 12 issues for 0.8.1.

We resolved 11 issues in JIRA since the release of OODT-0.8.1 and look
forward to including these in OODT-0.9.

We shut down our user@oodt.apache.org mailing list [MAI] after concern by
a board member that, given its mere trickle of traffic, it was potentially
splintering our community.  Our dev@oodt.apache.org list remains popular.

We have replaced the old Apache OODT website with the new version developed by
the community based on the Apache CMS which will allow much more flexibility 
with website changes and maintenance.

Attachment AT: Report from the Apache OpenNLP Project  [Joern Kottmann]

The Apache OpenNLP library is a machine learning based toolkit for the
processing of natural language text. It supports the most common NLP
tasks, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging, named entity extraction, chunking, parsing, and coreference
resolution. These tasks are usually required to build more advanced text
processing services.

Development
------------------
The team is still working on releasing the next release.
In the last three month two release candidates where tested.
A couple of bug where fixed after each of the two iterations. A third
release candidate will be prepared soon.

The development team stayed active over the last three month and
participated in the testing and bug fixing effort.

Community
---------------

The community stayed active with the usual amount of traffic on the user
mailing list.

OpenNLP received a summarization component as a contribution
from Ramakrishna Soma and incorporated it into the sandbox. 

Two students approached the project and would like to develop a
Word Sense Disambiguation system as part of GSOC 2015. 

There are no new PMC members.

Mark Giaconia was added as a committer in October 2013 and is active 
since then.

Releases
------------
The last release OpenNLP 1.5.3 was released on 15.4.2013.

Issues
--------
There are no board-level issues at this time.

Development of the first OpenWebBeans-1.5.x (CDI-1.2) version is already
finished.  We are finished with the SE parts and fully pass this part of the
TCK. We are currently working with the Apache TomEE team to solve tte last few
broken CDI-1.2 TCK JavaEE web-profile tests. Once we finished those tasks
(probably in the next 2 weeks) we will ship a 1.5.0 release.


Releases
The last release was OpenWebBeans-1.2.7 on 2014-12-09

Discussions.
Nothing which requires board attention.

Community

Attachment AV: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe M. Chiasson]

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since 2014-12.

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

The work to support the 2.4 branch has finally been fully merged back on
trunk, with the remaining few little issues mostly ironed out.

Two PMC members have already volunteered to be release managers for the
next release but work on rolling out an RC1 has been delayed pending
investigation into a couple of issues raised on the development mailing
list, triggered by a renewed interest in the svn trunk upon hearing of
news of the impending release.

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites that can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

A new release should appear shortly before the new release of
mod_perl 2.X in order that third-party Apache::* and Apache2::* Perl
module authors can adapt in time to the forthcoming mod_perl 2.X
release by making use of the recently added -D APACHE24 option.

No new Apache-Test releases since 2014-12.

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Apache-SizeLimit 0.97 was released on Apr 02, 2012

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since 2014-12.


--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Apache-Bootstrap 0.07 was released on Jul 13, 2009

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since 2014-12.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Apache-Reload 0.12 was released on March 31st, 2012

No new Apache-Reload releases since 2014-12.


-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

Apache-DBI 1.12 was released on June 12nd, 2013

No new Apache-DBI releases since 2014-12.

-- Development --


mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
fixes are applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

Work on the httpd-2.4 branch has come to a standstill, as all work on that
branch completed and was merged into the trunk.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, except for the ocasional
obscure bug report, or general user questions.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened since the last report.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Pivot Project  [Roger Whitcomb]

## Description: 
   Apache Pivot is an open-source platform for building installable Internet 
   applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and
   usability features of a modern user interface toolkit with the
   robustness of the Java platform.
   
## Activity: 
 - Very slow this last quarter -- most of the dev list emails were from
   the Jenkins build farm.  We did pick up one user list subscriber and
   had a couple of issues raised from (apparently) new users, though.
 - A new maintenance release (2.0.5) is in discussion, but probably
   some time away still.  A new major release has gotten very little
   attention, although some ideas have been put forward.
   
## Issues: 
 - Using the new Apache Report template -- thank you very much!
 - The migration of Apache-Extras is getting closer. 
 - It has come up (again) in discussions about whether Pivot is ready
   to be moved to the Attic.  As I am actively using it, I am not
   willing for that, but very few new people seem to be interested, so
   as a project we seem to be "mature".  I have seen discussions around
   other Apache projects that may be in similar straits, and since we
   still are able to come up with 3 PMC votes I think for now we should
   remain. Open to Board feedback on this. The possibility of recruiting
   some active users to committership (as was suggested by the Board
   the last time I raised this issue) essentially went away as the
   people in question went silent. My own experience with Pivot is
   that it works "well enough" (although I have a number of ideas
   for improvement), so I *think* our users have mostly built their
   applications, they work, they are happy, and then they move on.

## PMC/Committership changes: 
 - Currently 9 committers and 6 PMC members in the project.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache ServiceMix Project  [Krzysztof Sobkowiak]

Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that
unifies the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF and
Karaf to provide a complete, enterprise-ready ESB powered by OSGi.

Project Status
--------------
The project focus of Apache ServiceMix is the assembly of the integration
container, the actual functionality is being maintained in related projects
like Apache Karaf, Apache CXF, Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ.

Activity on the mailing lists and in JIRA has been a bit slow over the year
change, but is picking up again now that we're planning to do new releases.

We have focused on providing users with latest and greatest technology and 
worked on upgrade of Karaf, Camel and CXF versions. Apart from the first  
release on the 5.4.x branch, based on Karaf 2.4.x, we have released 2 transition
releases on 5.2.x and 5.3.x branches to help people choose the right upgrade
path from the current maintenance release.

We have also released the first preview of ServiceMix 6.0.0, which is based on 
Karaf 3.0.x and includes numerous new features.   

We have decided to decouple ServiceMix Bundles and ServiceMix Specs from
ServiceMix 4 code and maintain them a separate subprojects. We have also
migrated the source code from svn to git repositories. 

There are no outstanding issues requiring board attention.

Community
---------
Since the last board report Krzysztof Sobkowiak has been approved by the board 
as a new PMC chair (February 18 2015). No new PMC members nor committers were 
added in the last 3 months. Last committer addition was Wim Verreydt on July
05 2014.
Last PMC addition was Krzysztof Sobkowiak on July 05 2014. 

Community Objectives
--------------------
After the 5.4.0 release, the goal is to make the branch 5.4.x as a new stable
line of ServiceMix. We plan to keep a steady release schedule and keep up with
new fix releases of our dependency projects.  

We're also working towards further 5.x releases and a 6.0.0 release to
provide our users with major version upgrades of Karaf, Camel, CXF. 

At the same time, we plan to do some work in order to update the documentation
and migrate it to Asciidoc.

Releases
--------
 - A set of 106 OSGi bundles on December 18 2014 
 - Apache ServiceMix 5.2.0 on January 13 2015
 - Apache ServiceMix 5.3.1 on January 24 2015 
 - Apache ServiceMix 5.4.0 on January 24 2015 
 - Apache ServiceMix 6.0.0.M1 on January 31 2015

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Shiro Project  [Les Hazlewood]

Apache Shiro is a powerful and flexible open-source application security
framework that cleanly handles authentication, authorization, enterprise
session management and cryptography.

We have no issues that require Board assistance at this time.

Releases:

- No new releases since our previous 1.2.3 bugfix release on
  25 February 2014.  A 1.3 release may be possible as an interim
  before 2.0, but development work last quarter has targeted the 2.0
  branch.

Community & Project:

- Mailing list traffic remains steady compared to last quarter.

- Efforts towards a 2.0 distribution remain active on a separate dev branch.
  Changes are ongoing, and we hope to make a 2.0 release soon!

- One of the PMC members, Les Hazlewood, joined the JEE Application Security
  expert group (JSR 375) where hopefully some security ideas from Shiro will
  influence the specification as well as benefit Shiro by ideas discussed in
  the expert group.

Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for semantic content
management.

There are no issues which require board attention at the moment.

The development pace slowed down a little. The core developers
seem to have less time to spent on Stanbol at the moment.
Therefore, the development towards version 1.0 is delayed and
no releases were cut lately. The project is still in process of
preparing a 0.12.1 maintenance release.

Subscribers on the dev list: 232

No new committers or PMC members were elected but the
project is currently in the phase of voting to invite a candidate
as a new committer.

Last new committer was
  Antonio David Perez Morales on Jan 14th, 2014
  
No new PMC member was elected since the graduation of Apache Stanbol on

Attachment BH: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Hiranya Jayathilaka]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

No new committers or PMC members were nominated this quarter. Latest
Synapse committer was elected on December, 2013. Latest Synapse PMC
member was elected on December, 2013. 

Releases
========

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on 
January, 2012.

Board issues
============

Despite our best of intentions, we continue to find it difficult
to do a new release. The libraries we depend on (Apache Axis2 and 
related projects) haven't been released in a while, and releasing 
them on our own also seems to be a challenge. We are also seeing 
a significant drop in the activity level in our code base. Last 
commit has been made on 21st of September 2014. It appears that 
our community members are either busy, or they have shifted their 
interests to other endeavors. 

Given these circumstances, we would like to get the opinion of
the board on how we should proceed.

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.7) has been released 2013-04-29.
  We have made available the a series of beta builds of the upcoming 5.4
  release, (most recently, 5.4-beta-26, on 9 Jan 2015), following successful
  votes.  A release candidate is expected in the coming quarter.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is fair. Questions are answered with
  participation of not only the core contributors but also by the community
  at large. Discussion focuses especially around new features of the upcoming
  5.4 release. There are also frequent announcements concerning third-party
  libraries developed entirely outside the Tapestry team.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4 which
  will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other new features.
  At this point we are primarily looking at fixing bugs (from our large backlog)
  and documenting the significant new features.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 25 Apr 2014, and
  subsequently been voted into the PMC (2 Mar 2015).

PMC and committer diversity

  PMC and committer diversity is good. To our knowledge no two committers share
  the same employer. Levels of contribution vary over time. 

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org" - completed

   - TM missing from logo
 * "Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date" - completed

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

Attachment BO: Report from the Apache VCL Project  [Andy Kurth]

DESCRIPTION

VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A self-service
web portal is used to request resources and for administration. VCL became a
TLP on June 20, 2012.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

* A vote is currently underway to release VCL 2.4 [1].
* We had hoped to finish the release shortly after the previous board report
  was submitted in December. This was delayed for a few reasons:
** Underestimation of work remaining.
** Significant problems which needed to be corrected which were introduced
   subsequent to the previous release [2].
** Some final features were finished such as support for NAT. This is a
   fairly complex addition and required additional time to work our some
   problems.
* We have worked to make it easier for people to test the release by making
  a VM image available with scripts which automate updating the code to
  trunk [3].

RELEASES

* None

Attachment BR: Report from the Apache Wink Project  [Luciano Resende]

Apache Wink is a project that enables development and consumption of
REST style web services. The core server runtime is based on the
JAX-RS (JSR 311) standard. The project also introduces a client
runtime which can leverage certain components of the server-side
runtime. Apache Wink delivers component technology that can be easily
integrated into a variety of environments.


## Activity: 
The Wink project has a small community which is not very active. We have
had discussions on how to increase community activity, but so far activity
continues on the low side. Having said that, I believe Wink is a mature project
with active users and we should not consider any retirement actions at the
moment. Last svn activity shows couple jiras patches being applied.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.
 - There are no Trademark/Branding known issues at the moment.
 - There are no Legal Issues known at the moment.
   
## PMC/Committership changes: 
   
 - Currently 17 committers and 15 PMC members in the project. 
 - No new changes to the PMC or committership since last report.
 - Voted Gerhard Petracek as a Wink committer in August 2013.
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 1.4 on Mon Sep 16 2013 
   
## Mailing list activity:

Attachment BS: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

Development activity has been low over the last four months
with a few commits for copyright updates and one minor bug
fix.

As pointed out on the mailing list, a new release is long
overdue but need more folks to volunteer their time to make
it happen.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 75 posts on the
j-dev and j-users lists since the beginning of November 2014.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

With the addition of a new committer, development activity
increased significantly in February. Many JIRA issues were
resolved and preparation began for a new release.

Mailing list traffic has been increasing with roughly
185 posts on the c-dev and c-users lists since the
beginning of November 2014.

A release candidate for Xerces-C 3.1.2 was recently made
available and a vote is expected soon. The latest release
is Xerces-C 3.1.1 (April 27th, 2010).

Xerces-P

Nothing in particular to report. There was no development
activity over the reporting period.

XML Commons

Some minor activity on the mailing list in the last quarter,
including a new JIRA issue (against the XML APIs) which was
opened this month.

Committer / PMC Changes

One new committer (Scott Cantor) was added to Xerces-C in
the last quarter. The most recent committers were added in
February 2015 (Xerces-C) and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

No new PMC members in the last quarter. The last two additions
to the PMC were in May 2010.

Three committers committed changes to SVN in the last quarter.

Apache Project Branding Requirements

The project logo still needs a "TM" to be added to it.
