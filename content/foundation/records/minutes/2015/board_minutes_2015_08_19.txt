 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       I have nothing additional to report this month, other than what is
       already covered throughout the agenda.

    B. President [Ross]

       Nothing particular important to report this month. Mostly the
       operations side of the foundation is flowing smoothly. 

       Headlines:
       * On behalf of the ASF Membership and the broader open source
       community I would like to extend our sympathies to the family and
       friends of Nóirín Plunkett who passed away on July 29th 2015.
       http://www.apache.org/memorials/noirin.html
       * Proposal to purchase a laptop for our EA (from Presidents
       discretionary)
       * OSCON booth was successfully executed but of questionable value
       * D&O Insurance has been renewed with no break in coverage
       * A large (potential) infrastructure sponsor is causing the
       fundraising team to evaluate our current policies for sponsor
       recognition
       * Uptime statistics for core services are now available at
       http://status.apache.org/sla/ - I recommend taking a look standard,
       core and critical services have all met their SLA in the last 5
       reporting periods
       * TAC has been brought in on time despite the late start to the
       process

       OSCON
       ======

       Our booth at OSCON was well staffed by volunteers ably coordinated by
       Geoff Corey who stepped in to replace Melissa who was unable to
       travel. In recent years we have debated whether having a formal
       presence at the OSCON provided significant benefit to the foundation.
       I've been somewhat split on this. I am no longer split (though have
       not consulted everyone involved at this point). The "not-for-profit"
       pavilion this year was an afterthought for the event as a whole. It
       was physically separated from the main expo floor and not signposted.
       I found many people who simply didn't know it was there. This had the
       result that the majority of foot traffic were people who actively
       sought out the pavilion. Consequently, in my stints on the booth I did
       not have a single conversation with people not already connected with
       one or more of our projects.

       Executive Assistant
       ===============

       Melissa has been very busy this month with TAC arrangements (see
       below) in addition to her usual duties. I would like to thank Melissa
       for going above and beyond for the foundation despite having to attend
       to some personal issues as well.

       For some time Melissa has been struggling with an old and failing
       laptop. EVP and I are in agreement that we need to purchase a laptop
       for the foundation, to be used by Melissa for foundation activities.
       We currently do not have a budget for this and thus I propose to pay
       for it from the Presidents discretionary budget ($500-$1000 price). We
       will then budget for this to be replaced every two years with the
       outgoing laptop becoming part of the "event in a box".

       Brand Management
       ===============

       As previously reported we no longer receive pro-bono support for
       trademark registrations. VP Brand Management has entered into an
       agreement which involves a capped spend to ensure we remain in budget.

       Fundraising
       =========

       In the monthly budget report Virtual indicated that Fundraising was
       significantly behind schedule. However, the budget is calculated based
       on averages over the year, rather than actual expected income dates.
       VP Fundraising reports that this has indeed been a slow quarter but
       that it does not reflect an expected drop in annualized revenue.
       Starting in the next budget cycle we should seek to provide a finer
       grained budget (which, with our improved record keeping, should be a
       relatively simple affair).

       As we become more pro-active in our outreach to sponsors we are
       increasingly seeing feedback that they want "more" in return for their
       sponsorship. I remain firm in my opinion that we will not provide
       anything that risks upsetting the neutrality of the foundation and its
       projects. Hadrian as one VP Fundraising is exploring options that we
       might be able to entertain. Hadrian and I met at LinuxCon to discuss
       the issue. It is my opinion that the requests are coming in because
       first contact with new sponsors is often with marketing rather than
       engineering contacts within companies. This is something that Hadrian
       and I will explore further in order to validate or invalidate as
       appropriate.

       That being said, we continue to report new sponsors on an almost
       monthly basis, including this month. All in all Fundraising is in good
       shape.

       Marketing
       =======

       "Business as usual."

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       Some problems with mail archives have been uncovered. There is no lost
       data, but archives are not correctly being built. Investigations are
       ongoing.

       Monitoring of services is now provided by an external service,
       resulting in an increased level of visibility into our services.

       Uptime statistics, previously manually created and reported most
       months, have now been fully automated. Results can be viewed at
       http://status.apache.org/sla/

       Travel Assistance Committee
       ======================

       No report has been submitted. However, the EA report includes details
       and since I volunteered to help for ApacheCon EU I have higher
       visibility than in previous cycles.

       I want to explicitly thank our EA for her tireless work ensuring that
       the very late start in the process did not result in us failing to
       deliver assistance where needed. As a result we have TACers attending
       our event from Korea, France, Russia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Australia,
       Netherlands, India, Denmark, China, Toronto and France. The amount of
       work in processing the paperwork for TAC recipients should not be
       underestimated. We tend to assume the work is in the evaluation of
       proposals, but this is a tiny fraction of the work involved (though,
       naturally we are grateful to the team for their work here too).

       It should also be noted that our Virtual have also been very flexible
       in ensuring payments were made out of cycle for flights and hotel
       bookings.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


       No objections from any board member to use President's
       discretionary funds to purchase new laptop for EA.

    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        The Treasurer's Office is working to reduce PayPal chargebacks which
        since 2013 have cost $1855.00 plus $720 in fees.  Thanks to Virtual
        for their help in analyzing this and reaching out to PayPal. Based
        on our investigation, the chargebacks happen because people do not
        recognize the name on their statement.  Current Statement name:
        APACHESOFTW. There is an 11-character limit on this name as well
        as a 19 character longer optional that is not currently used.  We
        are investigating using the domain name “APACHE ORG” with the
        assumption that a period is not an acceptable character with no
        longer choice.
        
        We also identified that the paypal donation buttons on a.o and AOO
        website were incorrectly setup as item/services to be shipped/provided
        instead of as donations.  The a.o button has been updated however
        AOO has made the change but a CMS bug must be resolved before it
        can be published.
        
        Virtual is working on the Fiscal Q1 May-June-July 2015 report.
        
        Virtual has reached out to the CPA re: 4.30.15 YE for the
        ASF and requested the 990 questionnaire.  The need for an extension
        will be handled before the Sept 15th deadline.  Virtual also added
        that they keep track of all 990’s for all our clients.  And that
        the questionnaire for this year should be very similar to the one
        for last year which we helped facilitate for ASF.  Books and records
        are present for the entire year last year, so there should be very
        few questions we will need the Treasurer’s assistance with.
        
        The Treasurer’s Office processed a donation of $4K. 
        The Office suggests that a thank you is sent due to the size of the 
        donation and we will work VP, Fundraising to discuss.
        
        Virtual has transferred the remaining funds in Amazon Payments into
        the ASF's operational account at Citizens.  In a few more months,
        they will change the account email to accounting@ instead of the
        individual ASF member email that it was under before.
        
        The Treasurer would like to thank for Kevin McGrail, Assistant 
        Treasurer, who led the preparation of this report.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       July was another reasonably busy month, with two documents per day to
       record. In July, 62 iclas, five cclas, and two grants were received
       and filed.

       Still no progress on filing ICLAs via email/web. Secretary
       will make more of an effort to get this back on track.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       Very uneventful month. I expect to meet with Angela today or tomorrow
       and get Apachecon Vancouver rolling.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

A quieter month than usual for requests, but running a little behind due to
summer vacation time.  Thanks as always to members helping to constructively
answer questions.

Secured agreements allowing registration applications of APACHE in Norway and
Australia to proceed.

Signed updated engagement letter with DLAPiper outlining their new cost
structure.  Operationally they will continue providing services we need,
however registration related items are no longer pro bono, but will be charged
at a discounted rate with a monthly cap to limit our expenses.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

This was a slower quarter reflected in a much lower income than usual. There
are a few reasons for that, including a very good previous quarter and the
summer. I don't think there are any reasons for concern at this point, nor a
need to reevaluate our budget or direction.

RedHat is now a sponsor (again) and I did not receive a notification about the
payment.  For the reason the logo is not yet up the thanks page (but it will
be before the board meeting). I was close to sending a reminder, but I asked
Lynsey first. We need to make sure communication works the way we planned.

Last month I had a proposal to remove the 'nofollow' restriction for links for
all sponsors (including bronze). In the absence of any feedback, I will assume
there are no objections and will update the site accordingly.

Another important topic is that we had numerous discussions with a potential
sponsor, who is interested in a very large contribution, but they also need
help that falls beyond what the ASF usually does (and in some cases beyond
what the ASF can do). While the discussions will continue, and I have high
hopes of being able to get them on board, we need to continue the discussion
about our pitch to the sponsors. I heard the same questions from at least half
a dozen potential sponsors in the past couple of months and they are not easy
to answer.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
==========
None


Finances:
==========
LastPass: $168
Dinner meeting with Lance from OSUOSL $65.50
Cloud Services: $4619

(The cloud services cost was somewhat inflated by the fact that we purchased
reserved instances (roughly $1k was due to this.) However, it reduces our long
term payout somewhat dramatically) 


Operations Action Items:
========================


Short Term Priorities:
======================
- Sort out mail archives not updating for certain lists
- Figure out and solve emails supposedly being denied from certain senders


Long Range Priorities:
======================
- Mailman/HyperKitty proof-of-concept, implement ASF account design into it
- Revisit unified logging with a new machine setup
- Fully deprecate the remaining few large non-config-mgmt boxes


General Activity:
=================

Mail archives
-------------
An issue has arisen where certain mailing list archives have not been
updating with emails from August. The issue has been narrowed down to the
mod_mbox list database not updating, despite the raw data being present on
the archive servers. While the investigation is not complete, we have
uncovered some permission and shell environment issues that are related to
it, and expect to be able to solve this issue before the next report.

infra@ ML split
---------------
It has been suggested, and agreed upon, that the infrastructure mailing list
be split into a development and a commit part, so as to not burden people,
who are only interested in the former part, with the latter. This split is
expected to be implemented in the coming weeks.

infra@apache.org                   -> dev@infra.apache.org
infra-dev@apache.org               -> dev@infra.apache.org
infra-cvs@apache.org               -> commits@infra.apache.org
infrastructure-private@apache.org  -> private@infra.apache.org
root@apache.org                    -> root@infra.apache.org  

The root@ address is not a list (but an alias) and will remain so.

We intend to keep the old addresses working, but forward them to the new
list addresses. Also, as infra@ is currently privately archived we will not
make those archives public. Going forward however, they will of course be 
made public. 


Mailman3/Hyperkitty update
--------------------------
Work has been progressing, and the most recent activity has been a discussion
on how we will implement authentication and maintain the concept of 
/private-arch/ (where foundation members are entitled to interrogate any 
private mailing list). This feature is fairly unique to the ASF and as such 
no mailing list provider has this capability natively.  

The PoC has been stood up, and is accepting mails for a couple of test domains
as soon as the platform is ready for people to look at it, and test it,
further information will be shared at that time.

Monitoring
-----------
We're now using Datadog as a SaaS monitoring service. It's done a decent job
of getting us a decent baseline of metrics. This has given us an increased
level of visibility, at least into the systems that are managed by
configuration management. 

Uptime Statistics:
==================
Going forward, uptime statistics, as they relate to our SLAs, have now been
fully automated and can be found at: http://status.apache.org/sla/

While primarily done to save us from using 3-4 days of contractor time on
these statistics every year, we also felt that there were no compelling
reasons to not have this publicly available ahead of report time, as both
our SLAs and the uptime data itself have (technically) been publicly available
for a long time in its raw form.

To sum up quickly, all service level goals have been reached for the past
5 reporting cycles:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cycle:     | Critical (>=99.5%) | Core (>=99%) | Standard (>=95%) | Average
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mar - Apr  |   99.52%           |  99.81%      |   99.14%         |  99.58%
Apr - May  |   99.83%           |  99.96%      |   99.22%         |  99.75%
May - Jun  |   99.72%           |  99.67%      |   99.32%         |  99.59%
Jun - Jul  |   99.50%           |  99.13%      |   99.65%         |  99.34%
Jul - Aug  |   99.50%           |  99.87%      |   99.80%         |  99.77%

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Also reported just last month and there have been no changes since
then - Abdera is in maintenance mode with minimal activity. I believe
there are at least three PMC members providing oversight still.

The last release was over two years ago, the last commiter / PMC
member addition was Nov 2011.

No board issues.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache ACE Project  [Marcel Offermans]

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to
centrally manage and distribute modular software components,
configuration data and other artifacts to OSGi based and related target
systems.
 
Releases:
 * April 22nd, 2014: ACE 2.0.1 release.

Statistics:
 * Last committers added: March 27th, 2012
 * Last PMC members added: June 18th, 2013
 * Mailing list activity (dev+users) for last 4 months: 14 msgs
   (previous 3 months: 30 msgs)
 * Commits for last 4 months: 48
   (previous 3 months: 8)

Activity:
 * Some improvements to the website after user feedback.
 * Enhancements to the way the agent reports certain errors.
 * Accepted a few patches by a user (we are watching to see if he keeps
   contributing).
 * Made the handling of user tags a bit more strict, to prevent names
   that could not be properly stored in XML.
 * Upgraded to DM4 (which is a core internal component).

Notes:
This report was late last month, so it it sent in a month later than
the normal reporting schedule.
Last time the board asked some questions about community activity and
specifically adding "new blood". We are actively trying to engage
users that are contributing suggestions and patches. Hopefully that
will lead to new committers. Traffic is still relatively slow.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache ActiveMQ Project  [Bruce Snyder]

*HornetQ IP clearance has been completed 100% 
**HornetQ code base migrated to ActiveMQ Artemis
***Eliminated all HornetQ references 
***The code base is now 100% an ActiveMQ project
*Discussion around development methodology differences between the 5.x code
 base and the ActiveMQ Artemis
**Garnered fairly active participation from many committers
**It did result in a good description of the commit then review process that
  was agreed upon on the mailing list which was then documented at
  http://s.apache.org/zD7
**There were also good discussions around code formatting setups to make
  working on the various codebases within ActiveMQ more consistent and easier to
  pull ideas and code back and forth
*ActiveMQ Artemis code base is now receiving contributions from a wider scope
 of people (beyond just the original HornetQ contributors)
**Long standing committers from the 5.x project are starting to contribute to
  ActiveMQ Artemis
*Active collaboration between 5.x development and ActiveMQ Artemis development
 is now taking place 
**ActiveMQ 5.x features actively being migrated to Artemis 
***Test framework from 5.x migrated ActiveMQ Artemis 
***Migration of the MQTT protocol from 5.x to ActiveMQ Artemis 
**Also discussion is taking place to improve the the 5.x code base with regard
  multi-protocol detection on a single socket based on ideas from Artemis and
  Apollo
*PMC is actively working toward diversifying the community by inviting more
 committers to the project
**Christopher Shannon was added this month
**Three others added since May 2015
*Artemis 1.0 was successfully released 
**Work is on-going for the 1.0.1 release
*Back in the April report, one PMC member voiced the following concern:
*"At least one member of the PMC, as well as several members of the community,
 feels strongly that disagreements and concerns are not getting addressed in a
 manner that will move the community toward consensus." 
**While this comment is true, the community member who was raising these
  concerns has gone silent
* Initiated discussion to address past issues from some community members as
  instructed by the board 
** Result so far is zero replies

Development:

With most of Cassandra 3.0 development complete, but with release
stalled by continuing difficulties in finishing CASSANDRA-8099 (a
rewrite of the storage engine around CQL principles rather than the
old Thrift API), we decided to release the-features-formerly-known-
as-3.0 as 2.2 as soon as possible, followed by a 3.0 release later
based on 8099.  

2.2 has now been released successfully.  I summarized the new features
in [1].

Attachment I: Report from the Apache Celix Project  [Alexander Broekhuis]

## Description:
   OSGi framework implementation in C.

## Activity:
 - Plans for a next release has been made. Lots of bugfixes and updates
have been done.
 - Travis build (https://travis-ci.org/apache/celix/) has been set up to be
able to have some CI for Celix.
 - Support for Apache Celix on Android (based on a Docker builder) has been
committed.
 - Pepijn Noltes and Bjoern Petri will give a presentation about Apache
Celix (and Apache Felix / Apache ACE) @ ApacheCon Europe.

## Health report:
 -  Mailing activity has been low the last month. Apache Celix is a small
community and it is the holiday season so this is within expectations.
 -  Number of commits is increasing, which is a good sign. There are some
plans about a next release and this is also needed because the last release
is over an year old.

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Report from the Apache Community Development Project  [Ulrich Stärk]

## Description:
 The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping
 people become involved with Apache projects

   
## Activity:
 It has been a silent period (July) with little activity

  GSoC is approaching the pencils down date with final
  evaluations due Aug 28. Of the 56 students that started,
  49 made it through the midterm evaluations. For the first
  time in our GSoC history we had to deal with a mentor not
  submitting their evaluation on time. The situation was
  resolved with no negative consequences for the ASF. The
  resaon for this mishap was a combination of oversight on
  the mentor's side as well as lack of communication on the
  admin's side.

 ACEU is prepared from our side. All schedules are done.
  
## Issues:
 No issues require board attention at this time.
  
## PMC/Committership changes:
   
 Currently 19 committers and 21 PMC members.
 
  Sebastian Bazley was added to the PMC in Aug 2015

Attachment M: Report from the Apache Continuum Project  [Brent Atkinson]

Apache Continuum is an enterprise-ready continuous integration server with
features such as automated builds, release management, role-based security, and
integration with popular build tools and source control management systems.

Activity 

As expected, activity remained low since last report. The spike in issue tracker
and commit activity seen two periods ago was driven driven by a single
contributor with some, but limited, additional activity seen in the issue
tracker and mailing lists. Work towards the 1.5 release has stalled, with a
single issue remaining. A release based on current state may be possible, but
will require the necessary PMC votes, an unknown given the failure of the 1.4.3
release due to lack of votes.

Board Issues

 - None at this time. However, failure to release 1.5 next period due to lack
   of PMC votes will likely result in a recommendation for a board-initiated 
   move to the Attic due to a non-functioning PMC.

PMC/Committership changes

 - Currently 18 committers and 13 PMC members in the project.
 - No new changes to the PMC or committership since last report. 
   
Releases

 - Last release was 1.4.2 on Fri Jun 13 2014

Attachment O: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------
Since the last report in May, email and commit activity continues to move
along slowly. We’ve had a new Gradle Plugin contributed from other Apache
projects using Gradle. Some work needs to be done to get everything building
properly and cut a formal release.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low.

Community
--------- 
The last committer was elected in August, 2012. In September 2013
Phil Ottlinger was elected to join the PMC.


Releases
-------- 
Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was
released in September, 2013.

Community Objectives
-------------------- 
Release RAT 0.12, progress has already been started on
this. Release Apache Whisker 0.1 Find more committers

Attachment P: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Thomas Andraschko]

## Description:

   Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
   (Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
   which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
   which are missing in the CDI core spec.

   DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
   Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

   DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like
   Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly,
   Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also on
   simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
   with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.
  
## Activity:

   We receive contributions from the community on a regular basis.
   We added a new module for proxy generation based on ASM to enable e.g. CDI
   interceptor execution on the proxy instance.  We also did a lot of bug
   fixing including security bugs.
  
## Health report:

   The community and developers activity remains high.
  
## Issues:

   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
  
## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:
  
 - Currently 32 committers and 18 LDAP committee group members.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache DeviceMap Project  [Reza Naghibi]

(submitted by Bertrand Delacretaz representing the DeviceMap PMC, whose chair
has resigned with immediate effect [1] )

DeviceMap has reached the minimal viable number of PMC members with only three
of them remaining, after two PMC members, including the current PMC chair,
resigned this week based on seemingly unresolvable difficulties between them
and another PMC member [1] [2].

A resolution to establish a new chair is provided along with this report.

With this and very low activity in the project it looks like the Attic might
be the next step.

However, the PMC would like to give it some time before making a final
decision, in case something positive happens in the next few months.

The PMC will observe the project's activity and health for the next three
months and review the possible move to the Attic based on what happens between
now and our next report, which is due for the board's November meeting.

Attachment S: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Francis De Brabandere]

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows 
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development 
than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient 
database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety 
and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

In the past three month we have received several contributions from new 
users as well as suggestions for improvements and some bug reports.
We have already added the contributions to the project trunk and we have 
added some more improvements and fixes.
At the moment we are in the process of preparing a new release.

Changes in committers or PMC members

There have been no changes in committers or PMC members during the last 
months.

Issues

There are no issues that require the board's attention at this time.

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

  There was almost zero activity on the dev mail list.

  One PMC member (me) was present during the quarter. Immediately following
  our last (May) report, another PMC member indicated their presence.

  At this report, three other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Activity: Idle
  3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  I added a few comments to our issue tracker regarding some license 
  improvements for any upcoming release.

  I made some commits for some improvements to documentation and examples,
  and better explained searches at JIRA to help people to navigate our
  issue tracker.

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

Incubator PMC report for August 2015

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and codebases
wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 43 podlings currently under incubation.

Generally things have been going well although podlings that are very quiet
has continued to accumulate, likely requiring action in the next few months.
The Ignite graduation discussion was long and some of the community was
surprised a bit by some opinions about the podling. The discussion has
precipitated yet another discussion about reorganizing the Incubator, but I
personally think that the discussion and proposal are better served by
increasing the communications between the Incubator at large and the podlings
to move such exposure to a diversity of opinions earlier in the life of the
podlings, possibly by encouraging more shepherding.

No board action is required on this topic at this time.

* Community

AsterixDB

Apache AsterixDB is a scalable big data management system (BDMS) that provides
storage, management, and query capabilities for large collections of
semi-structured data.

AsterixDB has been incubating since 2015-02-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Migrate issues from Google Code
 2. Do an Apache release.
 3. Grow community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 1. The most urgent issue right now is to migrate the issues from the
    Google Code tracker to the ASF JIRA (INFRA-9954) as Google Code turns
    read-only on Aug 24. The issue was open with sporadic activity for
    some time. Recently, the frequency of the interactions with infra has
    increased significantly (thanks!), but the problem is not solved yet.
 2. There was a discussion on the use of a Gerrit instance hosted at UCI
    for code reviews in this project. After an initial assumption that this
    was contrary to Apache policy and the subsequent
    a) clarification on how Gerrit is being used (every AsterixDB commit is
       explicitly made by a committer to the ASF git repo - not by Gerrit),
    b) configuration of Gerrit that all notifications are sent the the
       project's mailing list, and
    c) addition of a step at Gerrit account creation that requires that an
       ICLA is on file at the ASF
    the current state of the discussion is that this is
    a) not contrary to policy but also
    b) not ideal as the regular workflow depends on non-ASF resources.
    Ideally the code review tool would be hosted by infra, but capacity is
    an issue.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 Getting more requests on opportunities to contribute and also some
 contributions.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 - New website is up

BatchEE

BatchEE projects aims to provide a JBatch implementation (aka JSR352) and a
set of useful extensions for this specification.

BatchEE has been incubating since 2013-10-03.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

   Did not report (3rd time in a row). Low mailing list activity.

--------------------
Blur

Blur is a search platform capable of searching massive amounts of data in a
cloud computing environment.

Blur has been incubating since 2012-07-24.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1.  At this point we need to have more releases, more often.
 2.
 3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 No

How has the community developed since the last report?

 - Subscriptions: user@ - 55[-2]; dev@ - 67[0]

How has the project developed since the last report?

 Many bug fixes, plus a release vote was called.  It did not pass due to
 some licensing issues with a javascript library in a web application that
 is apart of the Blur project.  It has recently been resolved, we will call
 a vote for a new release in the beginning of August.

Date of last release:

 2014-07-29 (The vote for the 0.2.4 release was called on 2015-07-02)

Calcite

Calcite is a highly customizable engine for parsing and planning queries on
data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like access, and in
particular a SQL interface and advanced query optimization, for data not
residing in a traditional database. (Renamed from Optiq on 2014-09-30.)

Calcite has been incubating since 2014-05-19.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Add more PPMC members.
 2. Demonstrate community robustness by rotating project tasks among
    multiple project members.
 3. There is no third thing. We are almost ready to graduate.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 None.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 The last report was in April. (We are reporting a month late, because
 we missed the July report.)

 In July, there were 148 messages on dev@, 37 commits, 44 issues
 created, 39 issues resolved by 10 contributors.

 Diversity is improving. The 1.4 release will be the first release for
 which Julian Hyde was not release manager.

 Julian Hyde won best lightning talk at XLDB 2015 in May with the talk
 "Apache Calcite: One planner fits all".

 Tom Barber spoke about Calcite at ApacheCon NA in April.

 Collaborations with other Apache projects continue:

 * Phoenix has built a remote JDBC driver using Calcite’s Avatica
   component.
 * Phoenix is replacing their SQL parser & planner with Calcite.
 * Samza is developing support for streaming SQL queries using
   Calcite for parsing and planning.
 * Kylin upgraded from 0.9.2 to 1.3.
 * Collaboration with Hive and Drill continues.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 We completed releases 1.2 and 1.3, and are preparing 1.4.

Date of last release:

 2015-05-30 apache-calcite-1.3.0-incubating

 Ted Dunning:

   This is turning into a serious community. They should consider
   graduation.


 johndament:
   Podling seems to be in good shape.  They may want to consider
   beginning the graduation process.

Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer

CMDA provides web services for multi-aspect physics-based and phenomenon-
oriented climate model performance evaluation and diagnosis through the
comprehensive and synergistic use of multiple observational data, reanalysis
data, and model outputs.

Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer has been incubating since 2015-05-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Start developing at the ASF
 2. Start using ASF JIRA
 3. Get code pushed to ASF Git repo

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 N/A

How has the community developed since the last report?

 See below

How has the project developed since the last report?

 CMDA has not really gotten started at the ASF yet. Very little has changed
 since the last report. The most important thing is getting the community
 started. At the moment the CMDA JIRA is completely empty and the code base
 has yet to be pushed to the git repo. Mailing list activity is largely
 non-existent and there's no website up for the project yet. Hopefully
 these hurdles will be crossed during this next month so that more active
 develop can start for the project.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Do first release
 2. Grow user and contributor base
 3. Increased committer activity

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 * Performing the initial release remains the most important milestone.
   However, the majority of the known tasks for this have been completed.
   The remaining tasks are related to documentation.  We are able to
   generate a signed, versioned source release from the build system.

How has the community developed since the last report?

 * A couple new contributors have submitted patches.  One of these has been
   committed and the other is nearly ready to be committed.

How has the project developed since the last report?

 * The build system has been updated to provide tasks for generating
   signed, versioned source releases.  Documentation has been updated as
   well with instructions on how to do this.
 * Apache DataFu has been updated to run against Hadoop 2.  There was an
   issue running the Hourglass integration tests against Hadoop 2, which
   had been blocking this update.
 * A couple new patches from two new contributors for Pig UDFs have been
   submitted.  One of these is an improvement to the HyperLogLog UDF
   cardinality estimator that makes it much more efficient.  The other is a
   helper for getting a tuple out of a bag.
 * A patch has been submitted for a UDF to incrementally process
   date-partitioned data in Pig.  This provides similar functionality that
   is available in Hourglass.

Date of last release:

 * Not yet released

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

 * November 2014

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

 Ted Dunning: 
 
   The generation of signed releases on shared hardware has historically
   raised serious security questions from infra. I think that this process
   needs to be vetted very carefully.

Sentry

Sentry is a highly modular system for providing fine grained role based
authorization to both data and metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop cluster. 

Sentry has been incubating since 2013-08-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. Encourage more feature and direction discussions on the dev list rather
    than jira.
 2. Continue reporting on time 
 3. Improve release schedules

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?

 * Community has fixed all the issues raised except for the ongoing efforts
   mentioned in the previous section.
 * Community has released Sentry 1.5.1 after fixing the earlier release
   issues. 
 * Making project direction more visible: Created a roadmap page on wiki,
   so that there is one place every one can see what is community working
   on or aspiring to work on.
 * Project is now doing monthly reporting

Tamaya

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

 1. We need more active contributors.
 2. We ​must ​provide support for Java EE​.​
 3. We ​must release more often.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be aware
of?
​  ​​No.

How has the community developed since the last report?
 Streamlining all features and preparingthe first release took more
​  ​time as​ originally suggested due to absences of​ key people involved.
​  ​It has shown that​ additional committers are urgently needed.
 There were several ​that have shown interest,​ but unfortunately this
​  ​did not lead to​ ​additional contributors.

 We hope that presentations at ApacheCon,​ ​Devoxx and several other
​  ​conferences as​ well as articles at JAXenter and more will
​  ​help to improve the community until end of​ ​year.

How has the project developed since the last report?
 We have now an agreed core set of APIs and ​extensions that provide a
 healthy and usefule base for the future. The extensions are all
​  well tested​ and documented​, so we should be able tome come up
​  if a good quality with our first release. The first release
 0.1-incubating is now in the vote on PMC, so we are
 now on track to further wider community awereness for our
 project. Anatole has a article series on the topic in the
 biggest​ German technical paper and also will blog regularly
​  on it, once the release is out. As a star spec lead his
 network should definitively help to grow community then.​

Date of last release:

 None. But first release is discussed in the PMC as of now​,
 so within the next 1-2 week it should be out​.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

ManifoldCF PMC Chair: Karl Wright (kwright@apache.org)
Date: August 2015

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 1.9 and 2.1 release on
May 3 and 4, 2015.  The next pair of major releases is scheduled for August
31, 2015.

ManifoldCF is still in the position of supporting both a legacy set of releases
(1.x), and a non-backwards-compatible set of releases (2.x).  The 1.10 release
is planned to be the last major release of the 1.x series of releases.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Kishore Kumar on April 28, 2015.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has moderately active.  Most of our connectors now have
significant use cases and constituencies.  We are participating in Google
Summer of Code this year, and expect new connectors to come from that.  Dev
list comments for this period centered around the ManifoldCF 2.1 and 1.9
releases, and occasional user questions.  I am unaware of any mailing-list
question that has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

Release upload to the dist.apache.org svn repository is quite slow, and takes
well over an hour for a single ManifoldCF release candidate.  We raised this
issue with Infra originally by posting to the Infra list, but did not manage to
resolve it.  The problem was originally noted in uploads to people.apache.org.
We were told to migrate to svn for release candidate availability, which we did,
only to find that it was no faster than uploading to people.apache.org.  I
finally raised a specific ticket - INFRA-9519 - when it became clear that no
progress had been made.  Infra has responded that this is a known issue that
they need to work on long-term.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We submitted ManifoldCF to the trademark
registration service and received word that our trademark application is now
pending.

Attachment AJ: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012 and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.

The last quarter was again relatively quiet. The frequency on the mailing
lists increased with questions and queries answered by the core development
team, but and only small changes to the codebase have been made.

We are still struggling to grow the community. More than two years passed
since we welcomed a new committer. The PMC is actively looking for candidates
to grow the community.

For the 2015 GSoC we started with two student projects:
* For "RDF HDT implementation for Sesame RIO" (MARMOTTA-593), the student did
not pass the midterm review. This was mainly because of the code quality and
lack of communication.
* For "Proposal to Implement GeoSPARQL in Marmotta" (MARMOTTA-584), the
student successfully achieved the milestones for the midterm review, and now
he is moving towards refining and adding the pending features. If the project
development continues as expected, by end of summer Marmotta could add
GeoSPARQL support to the next release.

Subscribers to the projects mailing list:
    dev@marmotta.a.o: 86 subscribers (+3 since last report, 2015-05)
  users@marmotta.a.o: 99 subscribers (+6 since last report, 2015-05)

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Onami Project  [Nino Martinez Wael]

DESCRIPTION

Apache Onami is a project focused on the development and maintenance of a set
of Google Guice extensions not provided out of the box by the library itself
nor the Google developers team, such as integration with 3rd part frameworks
or extra functionalities.

MILESTONES

Onami-Persist 1.0.0 has been released

CURRENT ACTIVITY

One of the comitters (Eric Charles) have breached the silence and we have
begun talking again. Discussing release plans. This could spark the project
again.

Reporting were delayed because of summer vacation (with no internet
connection), sorry.

COMMUNITY

Silent

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time and we'd suggest
postponing move to attic to end of the year to see if we get it going again.

## Description:
   Library implementing XML Digital Signature Specification & XML Encryption
   Specification

## Activity:
 - Version 2.0.5 of the Java library was released over the last quarter,
   containing a few bug fixes. Following some discussion, we agreed to continue
   to support the 1.5.x branch of the Java library until next year.

## Health report:
 - Apache Santuario is a stable and mature project that is actively managed by
   the PMC. However, project activity is rather quiet.

## Issues:
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes: 
   
 - Currently 16 committers and 6 LDAP committee group members. 
 - No new changes to the LDAP committee group or committership since last 
   report. 
   
## Releases:

Attachment AZ: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

   Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
   geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of coordinates
   for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other relevant spatial
   needs.

## Activity:

 - Completed the support of Well Known Text (WKT) version 2,
   a.k.a. ISO 19162.
 - Added a few more map projections.
   Documented what is done and what remain to be done in [1].
 - Started tests using the Geospatial Integrity of Geoscience Software
   (GIGS) test suite [2].
 - Next Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) meeting will be in September 2015
   [3]. Of special interest to Apache SIS is the API ad hoc (we may do a
   talk) and the Coordinate Reference System standard working group.
 - Proposed Apache SIS talk for ApacheCon in Budapest (September 2015) has
   been accepted [4].

# Actions that need to be taken:

 - We have been asked by the board to ask OGC if they can give free
   membership to the Apache foundation. Martin plan to ask when he will
   attend to the next OGC meeting.
 - Regarding our question asked in a previous report (how to protect a
   namespace in Maven central from deployment by peoples who do not own
   that namespace), we have been suggested to ask on the Maven user list.
   This has not yet been done.

## Statistics:

 - Line of code count according cloc: about 138,128
 - Line of comments count according cloc: 169,168

## Health report:

 - Most of current commits activity come from 1 or 2 developers. One way
   we try for addressing this issue is documenting extensively the code.
   SIS has a comment:code ratio of 1.23 : 1. This high ratio come mostly
   from javadoc and from other comments explaining the rational behind
   non-trivial implementations, especially in relationship with
   international standards or historical usages. Our hope is that SIS
   attractivity will cross some threshold after a sufficient amount of
   functionalities become available.

## Issues:

 - If Martin asks at OGC for free membership for Apache foundation, OGC may
   ask for a contact person at Apache for discussing the details of the deal.
   We are not sure what to answer to that question.

## LDAP committee group/Committership changes:

 - Currently 19 committers and 19 LDAP committee group members.
 - No new LDAP committee group members added in the last 3 months
 - Last LDAP committee group addition was Marc Le Bihan at Fri Apr 03 2015
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months
 - Last committer addition was Marc Le Bihan at Wed Dec 03 2014

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It 
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. 

Project status: 

- We posted our 1.4.0 release in June, with contributions from 210
  developers. The biggest addition was support for the R programming
  language, along with many improvements in debugging tools, built-in
  libraries, SQL language coverage, and machine learning functions
  (http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-1-4-0.html).

- We posted a Spark 1.4.1 maintenance release in July.

- We've started the QA process for Spark 1.5.0, which should be
  released in around one month. The biggest features here are large
  performance improvements for Spark SQL / DataFrames, as well
  as further enriched support for R (e.g. exposing Spark's machine
  learning libraries in R).

Latest releases:

July 15, 2015: Spark 1.4.1
June 11, 2015: Spark 1.4.0
April 17, 2015: Spark 1.2.2 and 1.3.1

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Steve Project  [Jim Jagielski]

Note:
   This month's report was drafted by Daniel Gruno and approved by
   Jim Jagielski.

Description: 
   STeVe is a system for managing a plethora of vote mechanisms, most notably
   the STV (Single Transferable Vote) method used in the ASF board elections.
   
Activity: 
 After a successful annual members meeting, many new ideas came up and were
 discussed in the project. A new branch, called pySTeVe, was created with the
 purpose of providing a unified web UI for setting up, voting and tallying
 votes/issues with a modular architecture that allows numerous new ways of
 voting. Of particular note is that pySTeVe is Python based, rather than
 Perl. No official release has been made yet, but we are confident that
 this will happen before the next annual meeting.
 
 An online demo VM has been set up at https://vote-wip.apache.org/, which can
 be used by Apache projects to both test pySTeVe and hold online votes on
 issues. With infra's support, this VM is scheduled to host the next annual
 members votes as well.
   
Health report: 
 The project is currently in a summer holiday hiatus, but has seen a great
 influx in code, committers and discussion since the annual meeting. We are
 confident that there is sufficient oversight in the PMC.
   
Issues: 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  Our last PMC addition was in March 2014.
  
  On July 12, 2015, Holden Karau (ID: holden) was added as a
  committer. Holden worked on Subversion before its move to the
  Foundation, so while she is "new" here, this is a return from
  hiatus to work on Apache Subversion's Scheme bindings.

* Releases

  Since our report in May, the community has made multiple releases:
  
  - On June 9th, our second release candidate for 1.9.x line (1.9.0-rc2)

  - On July 14th, our third candidate (1.9.0-rc3)

  - On August 5th, 1.7.21 was released to remedy two security issues:
      CVE-2015-3184 and CVE-2015-3187
    Note that the 1.8.x was "current" at the time, so releases to 1.7.x
    are made only to fix security issues or severe/critical bugs.

  - On August 5th, 1.8.14 was released to remedy the same CVEs noted
    above for the 1.7.21 release. These two releases were complicated
    by working with Apache HTTPD and their CVE-2015-3185 fixes, but
    only from a release/publication standpoint. The two communities
    worked well together.

  - On August 5th, the first release to the 1.9.x line was made (1.9.0).
    Release notes at:
      http://subversion.apache.org/docs/release-notes/1.9.html
    This moves the 1.7.x line to "unsupported", and the 1.8.x line will
    only see future releases to fix security/severe/critical bugs.

  - On August 14th, 1.7.22 was released to fix a test case, so that
    our 1.7.x series can be set aside cleanly.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiricco]

## Description:
    Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities
    in enterprise environments.

## Activity:
    New users keep popping up in mailing lists, asking for support with
    various deployment scenarios.

    Presentation "Building Open Source Identity Infrastructures" has been
    accepted at ApacheCon: Core Europe 2015, which will directly 
    involve showing Apache Syncope references.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.7) has been released 2013-04-29.
  We have made available the a series of beta builds of the upcoming 5.4
  release, (most recently, 5.4-beta-26, on 19 Jan 2015), following successful
  votes. A release candidate vote has completed, and a first release candidate
  will be made available in the next few days.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is slow. Questions are answered with
  participation of not only the core contributors but also by the community
  at large. Discussion focuses especially around new features of the upcoming
  5.4 release. There are also frequent announcements concerning third-party
  libraries developed entirely outside the Tapestry team.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4 which
  will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other new features.
  At this point we are primarily looking at fixing bugs (from our large backlog)
  and documenting the significant new features.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 25 Apr 2014, and
  subsequently been voted into the PMC (2 Mar 2015).

PMC and committer diversity

  PMC and committer diversity is good. To our knowledge no two committers share
  the same employer. Levels of contribution vary over time.

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org" - completed
 * "Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc." - completed
 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing
 * "Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in footers,
   etc." - completed
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo
 * "Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date" - completed

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Tuscany Project  [Jean-Sebastien Delfino]

Apache Tuscany is an SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA.

ISSUES
- Community activity is very low.

RELEASES
- Last release was Tuscany SCA 2.0.1, 10/3/2013.

COMMUNITY ACTIVITY
- Last committer addition was Sebastian Millies, 12/4/2012.

- Mailing list traffic is almost non-existent with only two discussions of JIRA
issues on the dev list this year, although we just got one interesting post this
month from an Emeritus Apache member interested in getting back to it and maybe
work on Tuscany.

- There has been only two commits in 2015, one from infra to fix broken download
links and one from a Tuscany committer adding a DOAP file.

- Given the lack of activity, Luciano Resende has initiated a discussion with
the Fabric3 community to see if they'd be interested in merging back with
Tuscany to create Tuscany 3.x. The discussion is progressing, hoping to have
an update next month or a post to our list from the Fabric3 folks with the
outcome of the discussion and their input.

- We've also chatted about a Javascript Node.js implementation of Tuscany SCA
for micro-services. We're planning to start a discussion on the dev list on
this topic once we get input from Fabric3 as they may be interested as well.

BRANDING
- The project needs to update logos with ™.

## Description: 
   Java-based template engine 
   
## Activity: 
   We had a bump in activity this last quarter, leading to a new committer and a
   committer joining the PMC. More talk than work, but still good to see

 - Maurice (Mike) L. Kienenberger was added as a committer on Mon Jun 01 2015 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - No releases in the last quarter.
   
## Mailing list activity:

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Ross Gardler]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment BM: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can upgrade the project to address the newer XPath and XSLT standards.

We are in process of doing integration builds to incorporate the Xerces-C
patches. There continues to be activity on the Xalan-J project.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature product.  There is little development activity other
than patch maintenance.  Most of the activity is in the Xalan-J subproject.
There are some participants reporting on their build and deployment issues.

We continue to get about 20 messages per month on our development mailing list.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

The XML project in the attic still references an older Xalan-J release
and is still found by the Google search engines. We are researching a
solution.

We still have enough active members to vote on releases and other PMC issues.
We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.

Attachment BN: Report from the Apache Xerces Project  [Michael Glavassevich]

Xerces-J

There was no development activity in the two months since the
previous board report. There were a few inquiries about a patch
on an old JIRA issue from members of the community who may be
willing to help with getting it integrated. We've yet to respond
but that might be an opportunity to find some new contributors.

Mailing list traffic has been low; roughly 25 posts on the j-dev
and j-users lists since the beginning of June 2015.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-J 2.11.0 (November 30th, 2010).

Xerces-C

and c-users lists since the beginning of June 2015.

No new releases this quarter. The latest release is
Xerces-C 3.1.2 (March 19th, 2015).

No activity of the reporting period.

Committer / PMC Changes

The most recent committers were added in February 2015 (Xerces-C)
and May 2009 (Xerces-J).

No new PMC members in the last two months. The last two additions
to the PMC were in May 2010.

No committers committed changes to SVN in the last two months.

Apache Project Branding Requirements
