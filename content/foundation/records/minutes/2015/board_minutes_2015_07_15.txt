 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       It has been a relatively quiet month.

       We still have a few missing project reports. There has been good
       progress on resolving some outstanding action items. We also have a
       good number of resolutions to consider in this meeting.

    B. President [Ross]

       It's summer and it seems there are a number of missing reports this
       month. In addition I'm somewhat distracted by a changing day job role
       at present. So a shorter report this month…

       Budget: Virtual have uncovered an error in the budget spreadsheet that
       resulted in one of the Infrastructure expenses not being included in
       the total. They are verifying the remaining formula and will provide
       an updated document as soon as possible. The expected discrepancy is
       $10,000. I will submit a revised budget to the board next month if
       necessary,

       Executive Assistant: OSCON is progressing almost as planned.
       Unfortunately for health reason Melissa will not be able to attend.
       She is seeking to ensure the booth has adequate coverage. I want to
       thank Melissa for looking after the ASF at this time but have
       reassured her that we expect her to put her health first.

       Brand Management: No report at time of writing. Shane had previously
       indicated that this would be a slow month for personal reasons. I am
       unaware of any immediate issue requiring attention.

       Fundraising: No report at time of writing. I am aware of one new
       sponsor approaching the team as a result of my recent trip to China.
       To my knowledge the annual report has not, at this time, been sent out
       to sponsors. This is something I hope to work with VPs fundraising to
       resolve in the coming weeks
       (OSCON being the ideal opportunity to discuss issues arising from the
       report with sponsors). I've offered to send it out myself if
       necessary.

       Marketing and Publicity: Having completed the site refresh Sally has
       begun work on updating the ASF logo and identity system. She expects
       to deliver 2-3 distinct visual systems for review by the end of the
       summer. Naturally I expect this to cause quite some discussion, those
       wishing to have input prior to this first milestone should contact
       press@ though I feel that letting Sally work on a proposal and then
       incorporating broad feedback after review was productive with the site
       redesign.

       Infrastructure: Buildbot showed some suspicious network traffic and as
       a result the infra team took the service offline as a precaution. A
       full post-mortem is still to be conducted but there is no expectation
       of damage. A new buildbot is now active on new hardware. Continued
       progress towards improve configuration management for services. Our
       GeoDNS service is currently down prompting a plan to replace with an
       externally managed service in the future.


       Travel Assistance: No report has been submitted. Earlier this month it
       was brought to my attention that the Linux Foundation were concerned
       that TAC applications for ApacheConEU had not been opened. With the
       help of TAC volunteers and Melissa's guiding hand we have opened
       applications with a very tight schedule. I have stepped up to assist
       with the process under Melissa's guidance.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]

        A request made to the Treasurer's Office to add the records for the
        2013-2014 Taxes has been fulfilled.
        
        The Treasurer's Office is considering how to pay more attention to
        PayPal Chargebacks.
        
        There are remaining funds in Amazon Payments that Virtual will
        proceed to transfer into the ASF's operational account at Citizens.
        
        Cash at Jun 30th 2015 was down $142.9K from last month’s ending
        balance (May 2015) of $1,780.9K primarily due to the May and June
        payables were released in June and there were no Sponsor payments
        made in June 2015.  The June 2015 ending cash of $1,638K represents
        a cash reserve of 18.8 months based on the current year’s budgeted
        average monthly spending for FY15-16 YTD of $88.9K/month.
        
        The Treasurer's Office, Virtual, and Phil Steitz has moved ongoing
        donations for Amazon to its new Amazon Simple Payments platform and those
        payments are being recorded in the ASF Citizen's primary account.
        The balance in Amazon prior to the platform change to Simple Payments remains
        in Amazon.  Virtual is working with Amazon to take care of this.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       Secretary continues to be busy, although not at the earlier pace. In
       June, 66 iclas, five cclas, and three grants were received and filed.

       A few PMCs have inquired about the Web ICLA process. They have
       requested to prioritize this activity.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       The CFP for ApacheCon Europe has closed and the talk selection process
       has begun. We hope to announce a schedule soon so that event promotion
       can begin in earnest. Shortly after that, we will announce the CFP for
       ApacheCon North America. We continue to be very pleased with our
       relationship with the Linux Foundation.

       We will have a presence at OSCon again this year, and the booth will
       be staffed by a number of volunteers while the expo hall is open. I
       will be in attendance, and hope to have time to work the booth myself.

       FOSDEM dates have been announced - 30 & 31 January 2016  - and there
       has been some talk about Apache having a presence at the event,
       building on OpenOffice's presence in past years.

    F. Vice Chairman [Greg]

       Sam's work on Whimsy has enabled easy review/management of the Action
       Items held by Directors and other Officers. His tech solution has
       obviated any need for a social/manual solution. ++Kudos.

    * Greg: Any info about the community?
          [ ACE 2014-07-16 ]
          Status: their OCT and FEB reports noted activity within their
                  ecosystem. this month is a bit low, but that may just be slow;
                  the PMC does note/report upon their larger work.

    * Greg: find out if TCK is holding up progress
          [ MyFaces 2014-10-15 ]
          Status: it did. our efforts (via dkulp) did not unblock TCK access.
                  this month's report indicates downstream has generally moved
                  to another platform. the community has low activity, which has
                  exacerbated the situation.

             informed?
          [ OpenMeetings 2015-05-20 ]
          Status: Did a release after the May report with 4 PMC votes. Assuming
                  they keep an eye on activity and continue submitting reports
                  on time, I don't see any issue here.

          question

          Status: Responded to their question. Nothing board level to address
                  IMO, we can close and address any follow up on list.

    * Brett: Why no FOP releases?
          [ XML Graphics 2015-05-20 ]

                  would be in September).

ATTACHMENTS:

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 1: Report from the Executive Assistant  [Melissa Warnkin]

Daily monitoring of all email activity (ea@, fundraising@, trademarks@,
treasurer@, comdev@, tm-registrations@, and board@) and following-up with
appropriate personnel OSCON:
•	All of the logistics completed
•	As it turns out, due to medical issues, I will be unable to attend OSCON;
however, I will be coordinating with the folks who have volunteered their
services re staffing the booth and booth set up and tear down
•	I will be able to use my unused flight ticket for Budapest; therefore, that
expense will not be a loss.

ApacheCon and TAC:
•	Applications opened on July 4th and will close on July 17th 
•	Gav, Jan, Daniel, and Ross have volunteered their time to be judges
•	We will be working on a very tight timeline; however, I have confidence in
our team in completing our tasks on schedule!
•	Gav sent an email to the community seeking more TAC volunteers; to date, we
have three new recruits


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

Fielded a broader array of questions on trademarks@ this month, especially
some interesting questions from PMCs about registrations, appropriate logos
and conflicts, and a number of good discussions from PMCs about proper usage
of Apache marks by third parties.  Thanks to Mark Thomas among others for
helping to answer questions.

DLAPiper, for reasons unrelated to our work, can no longer provide pro bono
handling of our docket and new registrations (although they can continue to
serve as pro bono counsel for trademark questions).  They can offer us a flat
and discounted monthly rate to continue at the same level of docketing and
registration services, which I plan to continue with.  Other counsel were
approached to see if they could perform these services for our projects pro
bono or cheaper, but they report they are not able to.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

Due to unfortunate personal issues I am a behind in sending 
the reports and reminders. I plan to finish it this week, 
hopefully before the board meeting.

There are actually 3 potential new sponsors we are talking to, 
one referred by Ross, the other by David and one by myself. 
Things look very promising at this point.

I need to provide some feedback to trademarks@ on the use of 
'nofollow' links. I intend to propose relax the requirement to use 
'nofollow' links for sponsors (only!). That means that allowing follow 
links for silver sponsors as well (others already use follow links). 
I am not sure if such a decision should be made by the 
President or the Board and whom else (trademarks@ maybe?) 
should be involved.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: Sally Khudairi submitted an invoice to the ASF Accounting
team for 50% of the new NASDAQ GlobeNewswire service agreement for
press release distribution through 2017. 

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: as the new
apache.org stylesheets have been successfully launched during
ApacheCon/Austin this past April, Sally has begun to work on updating
the ASF logo and identity system. HotWax Systems and LucidWorkds have
donated creative teams to help with this effort –they are: Kenneth
Paskett (who led the apache.org stylesheet project) and Lisa Dae from
HotWax Systems, and Fran Lukesh from LucidWorks. The two creative
teams have agreed to collaborate on this effort (and are working with
Mike Bates of HotWax Systems as well), with the aim of delivering 2-3
distinct visual systems for review before the end of the Summer. In
addition, Sally is also preparing the ASF Operations Summary for Q1 of
the 2015 Fiscal Year (May-July). 

III. Press Releases: no formal announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, or announce@apache.org during
this timeframe. 

IV. Informal Announcements: 7 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 39 items were tweeted on @TheASF. No new videos
have been updated on the ASF YouTube channel. 6 Apache News Round-ups
were issued, with a total of 42 weekly summaries published to date. 

V. Future Announcements: we are working on an upcoming announcement
with a podling preparing to graduate from the Incubator. Projects
preparing to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs
wishing to announce major project milestones and "Did You Know?"
success stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for
more information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution. 

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 5 media requests, and are working
with the SD Times on a feature on NoSQL solutions. The ASF received
973 press clips over this time period, vs. last month's clip count of
955. 

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst queries. Apache was
mentioned in 15 reports by Gartner, 12 reports by Forrester, 33
reports by 451 Research, and 6 reports by IDC. 

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: Sally helped promote the deadlines for the
"Apache: Big Data" and "ApacheCon: Core" events in Europe, and has
also helped with Travel Assistance notifications and publicity. 

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: no activities at
this time, as Sally’s work with the Texas Linux Festival and OSCON are
complete. She is considering additional ways to help promote the many
Apache project-based events outside of the ApacheCon umbrella. 

X. Newswire accounts: we have 13 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and continue to receive gratis
news release distribution in the UK by Pressat.

Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

New Karma:
========== 
None

Finances:
==========
$2930 - Rackspace cloud
$60 - Dotster
$66 - Hetzner
$3336 - AWS

Operations Action Items:
======================== 
N/A


Long Range Priorities:
======================

Automation
-----------

While the general spread of configuration management continues, 
the major increase has been with adding Confluence as a puppet 
managed service. The Buildbot master and Jenkins master have 
started the move to being completely managed by configuration management. 

Resilience
---------- 

This month we've reduced the disparate number of SSL proxies. We
now have three, identical, SSL end points, all capable of serving 
the same content. With some upcoming work around GSLB, this should prepare us
to have an additional level of resilience for the many 
services behind the proxies. 

Monitoring
---------- 

We didn't make much progress on this front this month. 

Technical Debt
-------------- 

Our GeoDNS instance failed this month. This service routes
users to the closest web server, SVN deployment, or rsync host based on where 
they are in the world.  The underlying host went offline and we were 
unable to resurrect it. We are awaiting assistance from smart hands 
in Europe to do so. In the meantime we've disabled the service, which is
shunting all users to single instance of thse services. We'll be 
moving this service to an external provider with substantial 
redundancy in the future. 

General Activity:
=================

Bugbash
------- 

Infrastructure has run two bugbashes in the past month. Over the
course of both days, 39 bugs were resolved. 

Buildbot Security Issue
----------------------- 

As noted in the blog, we were alerted to some aberrant
network traffic originating from our buildbot master. 
While we were able to fix the underlying issue we 
also realized that an abundance of caution dictated that we should rebuild the
machine. We also were approaching the EOL of the hardware. This led to the
decision to take the pain and rebuild it. As of this writing the post-mortem
on the incident hasn't occurred. 
But, findings will be reported when it happens. 


Jenkins
------- 

Our Jenkins master has been suffering from disk I/O issues and we
opted to change the underlying file system. While we 
were down for that operation we took the opportunity to begin the process of
puppetizing the host. The restoration of data 
to the host took much longer than planned, but the final 
outcome appears to be performing much better. 

Uptime Statistics:
==================

Contractor Details:
===================

Gavin McDonald

- Oncall Duties: remove some snapshots on hades to free up some disk space. 
We are only keeping around 1 months worth of snapshots on all repositories now
due to the space issue.
- Upgrade Confluence Wiki to latest version - documentation created in cwiki
- Migrate Buildbot to a new buildbot-vm - documentation created in cwiki
- Begin work on and local testing of buildbot master module
- 66 Jira tickets worked on closing 53 - some longstanding CMS related tickets
resolved.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Gavin McDonald]

The Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) exists to help those that would like to
attend ApacheCon and/or other ASF Sponsored events, but are unable to do so
for financial reasons.

Current Event(s)
----------------

ApacheCon EU Budapest

Everything is going fine and we are on track to provide another successful
event.

We have judges in place and have started scoring applicants (applications
opened on July 4th). To date we have 13 applications in and we have 5 days to
go before applications close so we are getting a great response. Another
reminder will go out to committers@ and pmcs@ on Wednesday.

Overall Activity since last report
----------------------------------

Plenty of activity this month on the mailing lists as we gear up to ACEU 15.

The webapp needed updating to start taking in applications but now that is 
done things are on track. 

After a call for help on members@ we have had a few more volunteers turn up to
assist with various tasks. Some of which does not begin until after the
judging period ends.

We had a question about what are the actual requirements needed to apply for
assistance. Although some of this is available on apache.org/travel we
provided much more detailed information about the requirements and application
process on our Wiki at 

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TAC/Application+Criteria 

which we hope clarifies things further.
 
How has the community developed since the last report?
------------------------------------------------------

No members have joined or left. 

There are currently 20 subscribers to the main mailing list. (6 up on last
month)

number of subscribers to the dev list increased by 4 to 231. Mailing lists
are active.

In the past 3 months, there have been 590 commits from 22 authors, 12 of
whom are not yet committers. The Accumulo website has had 100,000 views
since the beginning of the year, 56% of which were from first-time
viewers.

After three recent releases, we are just beginning to plan for future
releases. We have also discussed retiring the 1.5 branch.

Community
Ed Coleman, Sean Hickey, and Vikram Srivastava were added as committers
and PMC members on 5/14/2015.

The Accumulo Summit in April was successful, with over 300 attendees and

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Aries Project  [Jeremy Hughes]

Apache Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an
enterprise OSGi application programming model.

## Releases

After some discussion at the end of May, we resolved to alter our release
process. The new process means we'll be compromising slightly on OSGi
semantic versioning at the bundle level in favour of making the release
process simpler and easier to do often.

The following releases have been created with dates they were promoted to
maven central:

* Apache Aries Transaction Manager (transaction-manager) 1.2.0 2015/05/09
* Apache Aries Parent POM (parent) 2.0.1 2015/06/08
* Apache Aries JPA 2.0.0 (jpa) 2015/06/19
* Apache Aries Subsystems API 2.0.1 (subsystem-api) 2015/06/29
* Apache Aries Subsystems Core 2.0.1 (subsystem-core) 2015/06/29
* Apache Aries Subsystems Bundle 2.0.1 (subsystem-bundle) 2015/06/29
* Apache Aries Blueprint Parser (blueprint-parser) 1.3.1 2015/06/02
* Apache Aries Blueprint Web (blueprint-web) 1.1.1 2015/06/02
* Apache Aries Blueprint no-OSGI (blueprint-noosgi) 1.1.1 2015/06/02
* Apache Aries Subsystems API 2.0.2 (subsystem-api) 2015/07/03
* Apache Aries Subsystems Core 2.0.2 (subsystem-core) 2015/07/03
* Apache Aries Subsystems Bundle 2.0.2 (subsystem-bundle) 2015/07/03
* Apache Aries Transaction Manager (transaction-manager) 1.2.1 2015/07/10

## Project update
A new module containing an implementation of the OSGi Async service has
been contributed.

Jean-Baptiste Onofre & Christian Schneider added to the PMC on 2015/04/10
New committers: Giuseppe Gerla 2015/05/26

User list activity has decreased over the past few months, whereas the
dev@ traffic remains fairly consistent. This may be due to Aries 'library'
nature.

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment H: Report from the Apache Attic Project  [Henri Yandell]

## Description:
 - The Attic is where projects slumber when their communities fade away.

## Activity:

Activity has been low. While little new has been added this quarter 
(Lenya retirement), there are still items on the task list from Q1 or 
earlier.

 - Lenya is now in the process of being moved into the Attic.
 - Whirr is still in the process of being moved into the Attic.
 - Five retired Jakarta websites need regenerating.
 - Retirement of 3 Web Services projects needs closing out.

## Issues:
 - Lack of activity is the primary issue. A request was made to members@ 
   for assistance with Lenya which resulted positively, but hasn't happened 
   for Lenya yet. Hervé has asked for access to fix up Attic project DOAP 
   files (the PMC has voted to invite him to join).
 - A secondary issue is whether the Attic needs to setup anything to avoid 
   similar situations to the loss of the Jakarta websites (both in terms of 
   noticing the loss and making replacement simple).

## PMC changes:

 - Currently 21 PMC members in the project.
 - Sebastian Bazley was added to the PMC on Sun Mar 22 2015

## Mailing list activity:
  
 - general@attic.apache.org: 
    - 33 subscribers (up 1 in the last 3 months):
    - 37 emails sent to list (18 in previous quarter)
  
## JIRA activity:
  
 - 3 JIRA tickets created in the last 3 months
 - 2 JIRA tickets closed/resolved in the last 3 months 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Report from the Apache Avro Project  [Tom White]

Apache Avro is a cross-language data serialization system.

== Issues ==

There are no board-level issues at this time.

== Community ==

Since the last board report in April, 32 Jira issues were filed and 12
resolved, a slight increase from the last report. Mailing list activity
remains at around a hundred messages total per month.

No new committers have been added since January 2015.
No new PMC members have been added since September 2012.

== Releases ==

There have been no releases this quarter. Avro 1.7.7 was released in July
2014. Tom White has volunteered to be the release manager for the 1.8.0
release, and we have started discussing what will be in it.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Report from the Apache Axis Project  [Deepal Jayasinghe]

The trunk and the 1.6 branch have been fixed so that they are buildable with
Java 7, removing an important obstacle from the release process.  An Axis2
1.6.3 release is finally out with 7 binding and 1 non-binding votes, so we had
no problem of finding quorum to vote on the release.  That is clear evidence
that the project is able to provide sufficient oversight over releases.

Regarding the security issue reported on Axis 1.4 (with the subject “security
vulnerability in axis 1.4”) was bogus and we were unable to reproduce it.  We
have already responded back to the person who reported the issue as well as
security@apache.org. 

In terms of development we have closed over 75 issues (applied many pending
patches) and received several new patches. 

Community
===========
During past few weeks Axis2 was able to boost it community participation, both
user and developer lists were quite active. More importantly we were able to
bring three new contributors (Asanka Dissanayake, Andun Sameera, Ravi
Undupitiya) and they have already started contributing to the project. 

Axis2/c project also got a new community (Nadir Amra, Giorgio Zoppi, Rinil
Rushab, and Ilya Tutski) around it and have created a roadmap for the project
and they have agreed to work toward it. 

We also voted Hiranya (from Synapse) as an Axis committer with 14 binding
votes.  This is another evidence that Axis has enough quorum to keep the
project active.

Issues
===========
We have started discussion on moving inactive sub-projects to Attic or Archive.
We will include the resolution in next board report. 

Given the progress we have made in the project we would like to see the
possibility of switching back to quarterly report schedule. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Report from the Apache Bloodhound Project  [Gary Martin]

Project Description
===================
Apache Bloodhound is a software development collaboration tool, including
issue tracking, wiki and repository browsing.

Issues
======

There are no issues requiring board attention at the current time.

Releases
========
There has no release over the last three months. The last releases
were: 

 * apache-bloodhound-0.6 (16th July 2013)
 * apache-bloodhound-0.7 (23rd August 2013)
 * apache-bloodhound-0.8 (11th December 2014)

PMC/Committer Changes
=====================

There are currently 15 PMC members on the project.
 * PMC members:
   * Last additions were in January 2014.
   * No further changes since last report.
   
The last new committers were added in May 2014 for the GSoC scheme.
 
Community & Development
=======================

Committer activity has remained low and so progress towards the next release
remains slow. Recent emails to the Bloodhound dev list have looked to discuss
the tickets sheduled in the current milestone and tickets are in progress.

As previously reported, the INFRA ticket for the broken read-only nfs mount
of the svn repository remains incomplete, leaving Bloodhound's repository
browser out of commission.

As in other areas, progress towards upgrading the main Bloodhound issue
tracker to the newest version has also been slow. As part of this effort,
problems with the stability of the two demo sites were looked into. One of
the demos has subsequently been disabled.

The user email list activity has dropped back considerably as the effect of
the previous release properly passed by.

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Crunch Project  [Micah Whitacre]

Apache Crunch is a Java library for writing, testing, and running MapReduce
and Spark pipelines on Apache Hadoop.

Project Status
--------------

The project has been moving at a similar pace to the previous quarter, with 33
new JIRA issues logged since the previous board report, with 24 (22 new + 2
old) issues being resolved in that time. The majority of the work on the
project continues to focus on maintenance such as bug fixes but also
improvements to upgrade 
the technology stack such as HBase and Java.

The project also successfully release version 0.12.0 this quarter which
featured 35 issues.  The release focussed on several bug fixes but also
improvements to the projects Scala and Spark support.

There are no board-level issues at this time.

Community

The user mailing list has maintained a steady rate of questions and answer (1
per day). 
Over the last reporting period the activity on the developer mailing list has
increased (2 per day).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Report from the Apache CXF Project  [Daniel Kulp]

## Description: 
    Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
   develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and
   JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP,
   XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports
   such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.
      
## Activity:
 - CXF 3.1.0 was released this quarter which brings  a bunch of useful 
   additions as well as updates the codebase to Java7 level (dropping 
   support for Java6). 
 - With CXF 3.1.0 released (and the subsequent 3.1.1 bug fix release), a ton
   of work was done to update the extension projects (Fediz, DOSGi) to use 
   the new version and get releases out. 
 - The CWIKI upgrade did cause some issues with the websites as the 
    storage format changed a bit for some macros.  Some work was done
    to start using the REST interface to confluence instead of SOAP to
    make this process easier to maintain and update in the future.
 -  A user submitted a public JIRA with a list of 10 potential security 
    issues. (likely found via static code analyze tool)  This caught us 
    off guard a bit and we had to scramble to analyze each one quickly
    due to the public JIRA.   Only one of the 10 was found to actually
    be a potential runtime issue with the rest being non-issues (code path
    to the code would not allow insecure parsing, one case of code never
    even being called/dead code), or issues in the command line tools 
    which, while needing to be fixed, are less severe of a threat.   In 
    any case, the issues were addressed, but the community was 
    definitely a bit annoyed and having to "drop everything" and look
    at it immediately due to the public nature of the logged JIRA.  We 
    have a link on the site to the security page describing how to 
    properly report security vulnerabilities, not sure what else we
    could have done.
   
## Issues: 
 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

Attachment V: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Chris Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

In YARN, work generalizing node labels, improving Docker support, and
implementing v2 of the timeline server made progress. Support for resizable
containers also appears on-track. A proposal for federated YARN clusters has
design docs and some preliminary code in a branch.

In HDFS, the erasure coding work continues to make progress in a branch. The
object store also has a design doc for discussion and a preliminary set of
patches has been committed to a branch. A native client and prototype HTTP/2
protocol have also made progress in branches.

In Common, work refining the test-patch scripts has expanded its scope to
become a separable component that could support other projects in the
ecosystem. Work revising the native build for Solaris also expanded to remake
much of the native build infrastructure. The S3 filesystem shim was also
updated extensively.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD’S ATTENTION

We are considering a three month temporary ban, or some form of
moderation, for a corrosive participant on our user@ and dev@ mailing
lists, and are likely to achieve consensus on one of those options.
Since the public discussion started I have received several private
mails confirming the negative impact this individual is having on our
community, in the words of one: “[He] kept me quiet for months on the
mailing lists and JIRAs for fear of saying something wrong and getting
called out for it.”

AsterixDB

Apache AsterixDB is a scalable big data management system (BDMS) that
provides storage, management, and query capabilities for large collections
of semi- structured data.

AsterixDB has been incubating since 2015-02-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Do an Apache release.
  2. Migrate issues from Google Code
  3. Grow community

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No, moving steadily.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  A little more outside interest in the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - JSON file for Google code issues imported into AsterixDB to use
    AsterixDB for transformation and migration
  - Draft for a new version of website available
  - Development is ongoing

Date of last release:

  No Releases yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  No new elected PPMC and/or committers since entering incubator.

--------------------
Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer

CMDA provides web services for multi-aspect physics-based and phenomenon-
oriented climate model performance evaluation and diagnosis through the
comprehensive and synergistic use of multiple observational data, reanalysis
data, and model outputs.

Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer has been incubating since 2015-05-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Get all initial committers/IPMCers ICLA filed
  2. Get all initial committers/IPMCers on the mailing lists
  3. Get code into ASF repo

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  No change, see below.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  CMDA is still in spin up mode. 4 out 7 initial members have ICLAs on file.
  Mentors are working with the rest to move this forward. The project has
  JIRA and git setup. Code and development still need to be moved. The
  mailing lists are setup but not all of the initial members have
  registered.  Again, mentors are working to help move this forward.

Date of last release:

  None yet

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  None yet

--------------------
Geode

Geode is a data management platform that provides real-time, consistent
access to data-intensive applications throughout widely distributed cloud
architectures.

Geode has been incubating since 2015-04-27.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Expanding the community to include contributors and committers outside
     of Pivotal
  2. Execute and manage the project according to governance model required
     by the "Apache Way"
  3. Have our first Apache (incubating) release (currently blocked on us
     solving JGroups licensing issues)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The issue of publishing the nightly build to DockerHub was brought up so
  we solicited IPMC feedback. There was a great discussion thread and we're
  now taking care of actionable feedback with an ETA within a week or so.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Mailing list activity in June: 208 emails on dev, 28 emails on user. Dev
  currently has 116 subscribers, user has 96. Topics range from Geode
  features and changes to Apache Way and policies affecting our project.

  There are 50 open issues on JIRA, 8 In Progress, 14 Resolved or Closed

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  John D. Ament:
  
    The JGroups licensing issue caught me off guard.  Based on what I read
    about it, it's purely a technical issue and not licensing related
    (though triggered by licensing).  Based on the documentation heavy
    approach I'm concerned that this could be an issue for potential
    contributors (needing to create designs up front for issues).  Code
    changes seem to be going slow, but the fact that they already have a
    great website and nice logo is a good sign for the podling.

--------------------
Groovy

Apache Groovy is a multi-faceted programming language for the Java platform.
Groovy is a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-
typing and static compilation capabilities, aimed at multiplying developers’
productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It
integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your
application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-
Specific Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and
functional programming.

Groovy has been incubating since 2015-03-24

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  The biggest issue we've had to handle was with a subset of our
  documentation (guides written in asciidoc). Parts of the documentation
  have already always been licensed under ASL 2 but the text from asciidoc
  guides has recently had a Creative Commons Share Alike 3.0 license. To
  avoid a potential grey area over whether the software grant implicitly
  changed the licensing terms to ASL 2, we contacted all contributors
  (GROOVY-7470) and they all approved an explicit change to ASL 2 and all
  relevant artifacts have been modified to reflect that change.

  Lack of ASF (incubating) release

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No particular issue right now.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The new Groovy mailing-lists at Apache are doing fine, and it seems a
  large portion of our community have already followed our move here.

  The project has received 19 pull requests this past month,
  and the team has managed to handle and integrate 17 of them.

  This shows an active community is there to contribute to the project.
  Furthermore, since the move to Apache,
  we're also seeing contributions from new developers
  that were not known to us before.

  Groovy committers have also contributed to other Apache projects including
  RAT (contributions of fixes that we needed) and evaluations of Commons CLI
  and Ant release candidates using the Groovy test suites.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Ongoing incremental improvements and bug fixes.

Date of last release:

  No release yet, but progress has been made to make our build process
  comply with Apache rules, in particular with RAT.  We've moved our build
  to use the Gradle RAT plugin (which incidentally we have contributed fixes
  to).  We attempted a release that had to be cancelled, as we had still
  some issues around the usage of JARs in our test resources which have now
  been resolved.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Russel Winder joined as a new committer on the team.

  Another person signed the ICLA, so we should have another one joining soon
  too.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Emmanuel Lecharny:

    Those guys are really doing a good job ! The project is active, new
    committers are being added, they are respectfully following the rules,
    and when they are not complying by mistake, they fix their way of doing
    things. As a mentor, it's a pleasure !

--------------------
Kalumet

Kalumet a complete environment manager and deployer including J2EE
environments (application servers, applications, etc), softwares, and
resources.

Kalumet has been incubating since 2011-09-20.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Justin Mclean:
  
    Did not report this month. Last report (March) project was considering
    retiring. There has been no real activity on mailing list and given lack
    of progress on releases I think we should ask the PMC to consider
    retiring the project.

--------------------
Lens

Lens is a platform that enables multi-dimensional queries in a unified way
over datasets stored in multiple warehouses. Lens integrates Apache Hive
with other data warehouses by tiering them together to form logical data
cubes.

Lens has been incubating since 2014-10-10.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  We had discussion about "where is Lens with respect to graduation" on dev
  mailing list. Most of PPMC and mentors feel that Lens is ready to
  graduate.  http://s.apache.org/rYP

  We intend to start preparing the graduation vote, following the
  discussion.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  NONE

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There have been many new contributors showing interest and participating
  in discussion on dev mailing list and Our user mailing list is growing
  with usage questions.
  
  Apache Lens talk is presented at ApacheCon NA and GIDS, India in April,
  2015 and Hadoop Summit, NA in June, 2015.  Lens meetup with hackathon is
  planned on 11th July.

--------------------
Sentry

Sentry is a highly modular system for providing fine grained role based
authorization to both data and metadata stored on an Apache Hadoop cluster.

Sentry has been incubating since 2013-08-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

     @general and License issue.
  2. Add roadmap page on wiki
  3. Initiate graduation discussion with community and address any concerns
     raised

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Community is working on making 1.5.1 release to fix the previous release
  issue. Most of the other issues raised during the last report have been
  resolved:

  1. Updated incubator Sentry page: Update news,committers list and status
     reports sections
  2. Fixed MarkMail link in sentry mailing_lists page
  3. Added Roles and responsibilities of committers and PPMC:
     http://s.apache.org/xPU
  4. Updates to "How to release”

     4.2. Create checklist for how to vote on release

How has the community developed since the last report?

  Started having more discussions on the dev@ rather than specific jiras. We
  had 115 messages on dev list last month. (Got number from
  http://markmail.org/list/org.apache.sentry.dev)

How has the project developed since the last report?

  There were multiple bug fixes and some new feature work has started. About
  30 issues were created and about 20 resolved(Numbers from jira).

Date of last release:

  2014-08-18

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Colin Ma, Dapeng Sun, Guoquan Shen and Xiaomeng Huang were added as

  P. Taylor Goetz:
    
    Mentors are engaged and have raised a number of issues for the project to
    address prior to graduation. The Sentry community seems to be actively
    working on addressing those issues. One issue (raised by mentor David
    Nalley) that seems yet to be addressed is a lack of on-list discussions
    regarding project direction.

--------------------
Trafodion

Trafodion is a webscale SQL-on-Hadoop solution enabling transactional
or operational workloads on Hadoop.

Attachment Z: Report from the Apache Isis Project  [Dan Haywood]

## Description: 

Apache Isis is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java 
   
## Activity: 

This has been a relatively quiet period, with no new releases, though the
number of subscribers to our users mailing list continues to gently increase.

The most notable activity has been the reworking of our website and 
documentation [1], migrating from the Apache CMS and markdown/html to pure
Asciidoc.  This makes it easier both for the existing committers to maintain,
and for the user community to contribute [2].  Much of the material in the
user guide [3] and reference guide [4] is new.

We anticipate our next release, 1.9.0 either later this month (July) or 
in August at the latest.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time
   
## PMC/Committership changes: 
  
 - Currently 11 committers and 11 PMC members in the project. 
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months 
 - Last PMC addition was Martin Tzvetanov Grigorov at Tue Dec 16 2014 
 - No new committers added in the last 3 months 
 - Last committer addition was Martin Tzvetanov Grigorov at Thu Dec 11 2014 
   
## Releases: 
   
 - Last release was 1.8.0 on Mon Feb 23 2015 
   
## Mailing list activity: 
   
 - users@isis.apache.org:  
    - 129 subscribers (up 7 in the last 3 months): 
    - 297 emails sent to list (440 in previous quarter) 
   
 - dev@isis.apache.org:  
    - 71 subscribers (down -2 in the last 3 months): 
    - 484 emails sent to list (1066 in previous quarter)

Attachment AA: Report from the Apache James Project  [Eric Charles]

The Apache James Project delivers a rich set of open source modules and
libraries, written in Java, related to Internet mail which build into an
advanced enterprise mail server.

ISSUES

There are no issue requiring board attention at this time.

RELEASES

No new release (last release done on 19 March 2013).

OVERALL ACTIVITY

A new committer (Benoit Tellier) has been voted and is actively on different
the different suprojects that makes up the Mail server (mailbox, protocol...).

This covers new functionalities (quota), support of Elasticsearch, Cassandra
mailbox and various fixes to make the build more robust.

Pull Requests coming from Github can also be used to commit into the Apache SVN
trunk.

We don't have a release date for now, but we see other contributors that could
become also committer.

We are still looking on a way to handle vulnerability VU#988628 (not yet made
public). The vulnerability is identified on James 2 which is not the current
target (we concentrate our  limited resources on the upcoming James 3).

COMMUNITY

Last committer was voted on 07 of June 2015.

No new PMC member (Last PMC member was voted on 17 Jul 2012).

TRADEMARKS / BRANDING

Still to do:
Logos and Graphics (include TM, use consistent product logo on web site).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment AB: Report from the Apache jclouds Project  [Andrew Phillips]

A cloud agnostic library that enables developers to access a variety of
supported cloud providers using one API.

## Project Status

jclouds has not carried out any releases in the last quarter. The community 
is currently discussing and preparing for the release of 1.9.1.

   and updating to the latest version of HttpComponents)
 The JMeter user list is active and user requests are generally dealt
 with promptly, either by other members of the community or the JMeter
 developers.

 Likewise the developer list, though of course that is mainly used by
 the committers.

Attachment AF: Report from the Apache Lucy Project  [Marvin Humphrey]

Report from the Apache Lucy committee [Marvin Humphrey]

## Description: 
   The Apache Lucy search engine library provides full-text search for 
   dynamic programming languages. 
   
## Activity: 
   Activity on the Lucy project rebounded this quarter, after a bit of a dip
   last quarter.  The project continues to make progress towards an 0.5.0
   release, with most of the commits focusing on the Apache Clownfish
   symbiotic object system and Go bindings for Clownfish and Lucy.

   Commits are balanced between two main contributors (Nick Wellnhofer and
   Marvin Humphrey).  We are blessed with a number of other long-term PMC
   members who participate periodically and reliably cast release votes.

   It has been some time since we rolled out new features and we are looking
   forward to 0.5.0 and perhaps expanding our community.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache MyFaces Project  [Mike Kienenberger]

## Description: 
   The Apache MyFaces project is an umbrella project of the Apache Software
   Foundation for projects relating to the JavaServer Faces (JSF) technology.
   
## Activity: 
 - Apache Tobago is healthy and active.
 - All other MyFaces subprojects are in maintenance mode with no active
   development.
 - There was no commit activity in most subprojects, and only a couple of
   commits in the others.
 - Patches continue to be submitted, but are not always applied.
 - User and dev mailing list questions are not always answered.
 - Added 1 new PMC member and 4 new committers.

## Issues: 
 - Only Tobago MyFaces PMC members are actively involved with code development,
   although many PMC members monitor the private@ mailing list and vote on
   community changes.  A total of 14 PMC members voted on six community member
   changes, with between six-to-ten PMC members voting each time.  Many PMC
   members monitor the dev@mailing list and release candidates receive the
   necessary votes to be released, with three to five binding votes on average.

 - There were no new committers or PMC members until this reporting period.
   While someone suggested a new committer in November 2014, no one followed
   through with a vote (The individual in question is now one of our new
   committers).  The last time someone other than myself initiated a vote for a
   new committer was Sept 2011.

   We've discussed the committer issue on private back in April, and I proposed
   that we offer commit access sooner in order to retain contributors who are
   interested in the project.  I also offered some ideas on identifying
   potential committer candidates sooner.  We agreed that whenever a
   contributor's patch is applied that we should drop a note to the private@
   mailing list.  Two of our new committers have yet to commit their own
   pending JIRA patches despite accepting the invitation to be a committer, so
   it remains to be seen if our policy to offer commit access sooner will be
   effective.

   Unfortunately, I am still the only one nominating new committers and all
   five candidates were nominated by me.  It's unclear to me what more can be
   done to motivate our current PMC members to become active in this process,
   but those who are applying the patches submitted by contributors should be
   the ones who are also nominating new committers.  As we nominate new PMC
   members, I will try to make the need for the new PMC members to be
   nominating committers more clear.

 - Patches continue to be submitted, but are not always applied in a timely
   manner for most of the subprojects.  Sometimes it's difficult to find
   someone with enough expertise to determine if they should be applied.  In
   the case of Trinidad and PortletBridge, there is no one stepping foward who
   is familiar with the codebase.   The same issue exists for user and
   developer questions on the mailing list for these subprojects.  I've been
   attempting to recruit new developers from those submitting patches and bug
   reports, but we may need to retire these projects.  It's now well-known why
   umbrella projects are not best-practice, but it's unclear how we move away
   from this for inactive sub-projects.  We have discussed the problem on our
   private list while talking about the health of Myfaces in general, but we
   would be interested in any guidance on this from other ASF members reading
   this report.

 - I suggested that Tobago consider becoming an independent TLP, but that there
   was no response from the three members of the Tobago team who are on the
   MyFaces PMC.

 - Concern was once again expressed by one of our developers that the lack of a
   TCK has resulted in the replacement of MyFaces with Mojarra in every
   application server except Tomee.

## PMC/Committership changes: 
   
 - Currently 76 committers and 39 PMC members in the project. 
 - Hazem Saleh was added to the PMC on Fri May 15 2015 
 - New commmitters: 
    - Bill Lucy was added as a committer on Tue Jun 23 2015 (still no commits)
    - Ross Clewley was added as a committer on Mon May 18 2015 (still no
      commits)
    - Thomas Andraschko was added as a committer on Thu Jul 02 2015 
    - Dennis Kieselhorst was added as a committer on Mon May 11 2015 (Tobago /
      very active)
 - One additional contributor was invited and verified on Jun 25 that they
   received our invitation to join, but have yet to respond.

again. They are still some configuration work outstanding.

The same contributor provided a patch to solve a rat-scan issue. We
still have a minor rat-scan issue (6 non-critical files are being
reported)

A PMC member volunteered to be release manager (limited to the
upcoming release), discussion is ongoing.

There will not be a AOO track at apacheCON CORE, since only a few
talks have been submitted.

## Issues:
The lack of progress on all fronts in the project is a major concern,
and the PMC have been trying for some time to find consensus about
the road ahead.

## PMC/Committership changes:
 - Currently 140 committers and 29 PMC members in the project.
 - New PMC members:
    - Dennis E. Hamilton was added to the PMC on Fri Feb 13 2015
 - Last committer addition was Tal Daniel at Tue Apr 29 2014


## Releases:
 - Last release was 4.1.1 on Thu Aug 21 2014

AOO remains committed to bring out version 4.1.2, but no real
work has been done since last report. The issues destined for 4.1.2
have been given a BZ status that allows a faster integration (less
test demand). Digital signing is still a wish for the new release.

Attachment AX: Report from the Apache Shindig Project  [Ryan Baxter]

DESCRIPTION
 
Apache Shindig is an Opensocial Reference implementation in wide use by both
social networks and enterprise software. Shindig graduated from the Incubator
in January 2010.
 
ISSUES
 
The Shindig PMC has no issues that require board attention.
 
COMMUNITY
 
The Shindig community has saw a noticeable decline in mailing list activity as
well as contributions to the code base over the past few months.  Some of this
might have to do with the OpenSocial Foundation being dissolved and portions
of the OpenSocial specification being taken over by the W3C
(http://www.w3.org/2014/12/opensocial.html.en).  The Shindig community has not
seen any contributions due to specification changes coming from the W3C since
the move has taken place. This quarter we have seen a couple (2-3) fixes from
a single community member.
 
COMMITTER/PMC CHANGES
 
No PMC member changes.
 
RELEASES
 
Apache Shindig 2.5.2 was released the 2014-10-26.  The community is currently
working towards a 2.5.3 release.

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache Struts Project  [Rene Gielen]

The Apache Struts MVC framework is a solution stack for creating elegant
and modern action-based Java web applications. It favors convention over
configuration, is extensible using a plugin architecture, and ships with
plugins to support technologies such as REST, AJAX and JSON.

The Struts team made two GA releases in the last quarter:
* Struts 2.3.21.1 - security fix release (2015-05-06)
* Struts 2.3.24 - improvement and bug fix release

Within the reporting period we saw a boost in development activity. Work
on Struts 2.5 has not only started, but it is also next to completion
according to our plans. Struts 2.5 will include new features and drop
support for deprecated APIs and framework parts. It is considered a
milestone release towards Struts 3, which is supposed to include major
new features as well as breaking changes.

No new committers have been added in the last quarter. Christoph Nenning
(cnenning) joined the PMC as a new member (2015-05-12). Last committer
addition was on 2014-01-06.

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Synapse Project  [Hiranya Jayathilaka]

Apache Synapse is a high performance, flexible, lightweight
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and a mediation framework.

Community
=========

No new committers or PMC members were nominated this quarter. Latest
Synapse committer was elected on December, 2013. Latest Synapse PMC
member was elected on December, 2013. 

We had a discussion on our pmc and dev mailing lists about the future
of the Synapse project. While the responses were few, there were
several developers and contributors who showed great interest in moving
the project forward towards another release. 

Consequently, we have started collaborating with the Axis2 community 
more closely. Synapse PMC chair and few other Synapse contributors have 
already started providing patches for various issues in Axis2, and the 
Axis2 team has provided us with commit rights in return. We are hopeful
that this collaborative effort would lead to an expedited Axis2 release,
which in turns would enable a Synapse release. 

Releases
========

There have been no new releases during this period.
The last release of Synapse is version 2.1, which was released on 
January, 2012.

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Tapestry Project  [Howard M. Lewis Ship]

Apache Tapestry is a Java component-based web framework that features high
productivity, great code reuse, robust deployment, and terrific performance.

Any issues for the Board?

  There are no Board-level issues at this time.

When did the project last make any releases?

  The latest stable version of Tapestry (5.3.7) has been released 2013-04-29.
  We have made available the a series of beta builds of the upcoming 5.4
  release, (most recently, 5.4-beta-26, on 19 Jan 2015), following successful
  votes.  A release candidate vote was run and failed; a new RC vote is currently
  in progress.

Describe the overall activity in the project over the past quarter.

  Activity on the user mailing list is fair. Questions are answered with
  participation of not only the core contributors but also by the community
  at large. Discussion focuses especially around new features of the upcoming
  5.4 release. There are also frequent announcements concerning third-party
  libraries developed entirely outside the Tapestry team.

  Activity on the dev mailing list is medium.

  The focus of development currently lies on the upcoming Tapestry 5.4 which
  will bring major improvements in JavaScript support and other new features.
  At this point we are primarily looking at fixing bugs (from our large backlog)
  and documenting the significant new features.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

  Jochen Kenmade has been voted in as a committer on 25 Apr 2014, and
  subsequently been voted into the PMC (2 Mar 2015).

PMC and committer diversity

  PMC and committer diversity is good. To our knowledge no two committers share
  the same employer. Levels of contribution vary over time.

Project branding or naming issues, either in the project or externally.

  No known issues.

Branding requirements progress:

 * "Project Website Basics: homepage is project.apache.org" - completed
 * "Project Naming And Descriptions: use proper Apache forms, describe
   product, etc." - completed
 * "Website Navigation Links: navbar links included, link to www.apache.org
   included" - License and Security links are missing
 * "Trademark Attributions: attribution for all ASF marks included in footers,
   etc." - completed
 * "Logos and Graphics: include TM, use consistent product logo on your site"
   - TM missing from logo
 * "Project Metadata: DOAP file checked in and up to date" - completed

Legal issues or questions:

  None.

Infrastructure issues or strategic needs:

  None.

  Comcast has Open Sourced a management portal around Traffic Server:

      https://github.com/Comcast/traffic_control

  This was announced on our mailing list, and it's unclear at this point if
  the project will stay on Github, or move to ASF. We will keep both the

Attachment BJ: Report from the Apache Tuscany Project  [Jean-Sebastien Delfino]

Apache Tuscany is an SOA framework based on OASIS OpenCSA and SCA.

ISSUES
- Community activity is very low.

RELEASES
- Last release was Tuscany SCA 2.0.1, 10/3/2013.

COMMUNITY ACTIVITY
- Last committer addition was Sebastian Millies, 12/4/2012.

- Mailing list traffic is almost non-existent with only two discussions of JIRA
issues on the dev list in 2015.

- There has been only two commits in 2015, one from infra to fix broken
download links and one from a Tuscany committer adding a DOAP file.

- Given the lack of activity, in May we discussed moving to the Attic on the
private list, with three +1, one 'wouldn't object' and a new idea from Luciano
Resende to approach the Fabric3 community and see if they'd be interested in
merging back with Tuscany to create Tuscany 3.x. Luciano is pursuing this, but
we don't have an update yet.

- I also indicated that I may be able to find a bit of time for Tuscany again
and started another discussion a few days ago on the private list asking if
folks would be interested in working on a lightweight Javascript implementation
of Tuscany SCA for micro-services, to attempt to get some action again in the
project. Two PMC members, Simon Nash and Luciano, showed interest in discussing
this on the dev list, so I will move that discussion there.

BRANDING
- The project needs to update logos with ™.

integrated into a variety of environments.

## Activity:
The Wink project has a small community which is not very active. We have
had discussions on how to increase community activity, but so far activity
continues on the low side. Having said that, I believe Wink is a mature project
with active users and we should not consider any retirement actions at the
moment. Last svn activity shows couple jiras patches being applied.
  
## Issues:
 - There are no issues that require Board attention at the moment.
 - There are no Trademark/Branding known issues at the moment.
 - There are no Legal Issues known at the moment.
   
## PMC/Committership changes:  
   
 - Currently 17 committers and 15 PMC members in the project.
 - No new changes to the PMC or committership since last report.
 - Voted Gerhard Petracek as a Wink committer in August 2013.
