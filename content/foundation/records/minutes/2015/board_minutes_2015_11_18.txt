 4. Executive Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Brett]

       Last month I attended Apache Roadshow - China in Beijing and spoke
       about the Apache Way. The event was well executed, and it was helpful
       to meet a number of Apache contributors, and other individuals
       interested in understanding more about how the ASF operates. I hope
       the success of the event will provide an opportunity for it to
       continue in future years, particularly with an increasing number of
       local Apache committers that can present and collaborate. My thanks to
       the organisers, and to David, Aaron, Niclas, and other Apache
       committers that gave keynote presentations or spoke about projects at
       the event.

       Earlier this month I had a call with some large organisations seeking
       to open source a new project and looking for information about the
       various foundations. I walked them through the principles of the
       Apache Way, incubation process, and foundation structure; I'll guide
       them towards the Incubator list and proposal process if anything
       further arises.

       A relatively busy month for the board with some discussion around
       source code control policy, which is listed later in the agenda.

    B. President [Ross]

       First I would like to observe there have been a few significant
       activities relating to China. This is, in part, a result of my trip
       there last year in which I was invited to speak at a number of
       conferences and to meet with a number of business leaders in the
       country. We have seen out first two major contributions from Chinese
       companies (not counting the ill-fated academic initiative of a number
       of years ago). We have a new Silver sponsor with Chinese headquarters,
       and we had our first Apache Roadshow for a great many years (1,400
       attendees with a further 3,370 watching the live stream, full report at
       https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/summary_of_the_apache_roadshow
       There are a great many people involved with these successes, my
       own part was only to raise our feather. Thank you to everyone
       involved, it is fantastic to see the Apache Way benefiting from these
       new contributions. I'm aware of a number of other activities on the
       horizon too.

       Financials are looking good. Last month we reported a significant
       variance in budget vs actual. We also reported that this was likely
       due to our lack of accurate timing information for sponsorship income.
       This appears to be the case as this month actuals are coming more into
       line with budgets. I remain satisfied that we are in good shape. Full
       reports are provided monthly to the treasurer and presidents office
       and can be viewed in SVN.

       Executive Assistant
       ===============

       Two main activities in addition to the usual work:

       1) Working with a proof of concept events app built by Rich and
       myself. This app pulls event details from meetups.com. Melissa is
       working with VP Marketing to work out how best to use this data and
       enter it into our events calendar (currently the meetups events appear
       at http://www.apache.org/events/meetups.html)

       2) Working with Linux Foundation and TAC to remove applicant confusion
       of sources of travel assistance

       Brand Management
       ===============

       VP Brand indicates the "complexity of issues being brought up
       continues to grow" while the number of enquiries is decreasing. This
       was the intended result of pushing brand management to PMCs. Issues
       reaching brand management are being dealt with in reasonable
       timeframes.

       Fundraising
       =========

       A busy month: 3 new sponsors (1 platinum, 2 silver) and others in the
       pipeline.

       Last month I sought input on some feedback we've had from existing and
       potential sponsors. Much of the discussion focused on one specific
       aspect (GitHub and infrastructure) of the feedback rather than the
       broader desire to better message what we do with sponsors money. There
       were, however, some very useful observations made, that will no doubt
       strengthen our messaging to sponsors.

       Some issues with the CRM system have been identified and VP
       Fundraising has indicated the need for support from the operations
       team to resolve. We will work on this and report back next month.

       Marketing and Publicity
       ==================

       Work progresses without incident or special highlight this month. We
       remain in good stead with prompt and appropriate response to all media
       relations work.

       Infrastructure
       ==========

       people.apache.org is going to be retired. There will be a new web only
       service on home.apache.org. Committers will have three months to move
       content to the new service. Shell access will not be provided. PMC
       chairs will be provided with a VM for managing records etc.

       I feel I should stop reporting on the "yay, look at the results of the
       config management work", but then who would say thank you ;-) This
       month the team needed to replace the unified logging system as it was
       not coping with volume. The replacement was a 5 node cluster which
       took less than 24 hours to configure and bring online as a result of a
       high level of reuse in the config scripts. Great work!

       Unfortunately the long run of improvements in meeting SLAs is over.
       This month an LDAP outage resulted in critical service SLA not being
       met (99.39% against a target of 99.5%). The team seek to ensure this
       particular failure is better addressed in the future.

       Uptime data: http://status.apache.org/sla/

       Travel Assistance
       ==============

       TAC is reviewing the questions for ApacheCon NA. It is not expected
       that there will be significant revamp this time around due to changes
       in the team the desire to think carefully before taking action.
       However, a number of improvements are being considered.

       The team are focusing on casting the net further afield and thus
       increasing the quality of candidates (though quality of selected
       candidates has always been high). There is some thought of expanding
       the TAC budget, but this will not be requested until a clear plan and
       justification has been drawn up. Early comments are welcome.

       The team worked with the Linux Foundation to better align the
       foundations assistance for attendees. It was decided that LF would not
       invite applicants during the registration and CFP processes.  Instead
       they will direct applicants to the ASF who will evaluate and share
       details of any candidates we feel are strong but cannot fund do to
       resource limitations. LF will then evaluate independently and
       potentially offer assistance.

       Additionally, please see Attachments 1 through 6.


    C. Treasurer [Chris]
    
        The Treasurer’s Office is reviewing paperwork from a book
        publisher regarding donation paperwork and working with VP
        Sponsorships to determine how/who/if it should be signed.
    
        Our contracted CPA is working to review the ASF's finances
        and the results are expected by end of year in order to
        complete the 990 by February 2016.
    
        The Treasurer’s Office is working with Virtual to set up a
        telecon before EOY to review the variances that we are
        seeing in the expenses as compared to budget.
    
        The following financial update is provided by Virtual:
    
        Cash at October 31st 2015 was $1,531K, which is up $75.1K
        from last month’s ending balance (September 2015) of
        $1,455.9K.   The October 2015 cash balance is up $109.3K
        from the October 2014 month end balance of $1,421.8K.  The
        October 2015 ending cash of $1,531K represents a cash reserve
        of 17.4 months based on the current year’s budgeted average
        monthly spending for FY15-16 of $87.8K/month (which is up
        about a 1/2 month from last month’s number).  The cash
        reserve for the ASF continues to be very healthy at over
        17 months, based on this fiscal year’s monthly spend rate,
        as compared to the ASAE industry benchmark of 6 months. The
        current forecasted Year End Cash reserve is 16.5 months;
        again is a very healthy number (if all remains equal to the
        Cash Forecast).
    
        Regarding the Cash P&L, the Foundation’s total revenue YTD
        through October 2015 was $232.3K which is -$190.2K behind
        budget ( $23.2K is Public donation and $167K is sponsorship).
    
        Expenses, on an YTD cash basis are a bit behind budget at
        $102.9K less than plan.  This is due to underspending vs
        Budget in G/A, Sponsored Attendees and Infrastructure,
        though this could just be timing though we are six months
        into the Fiscal year. The Treasurer's Office will set up a
        call with Virtual to review the variances in the expenses
        as compared to budget, as it will be beneficial to forecasting
        for the last six months of FY 2016.
    
        On an accrual basis the 2016 YTD revenue is behind YTD 2015
        by $-104.5K.  YTD expenses on an Accrual basis, for 2016
        were about $-4.2K less than 2015, due to spending less in
        G/A YTD, year over year.  This leaves Accrued Net income
        for YTD 2016 behind YTD 2015 by $-100.3K as compared to YTD
        through September which was $-138.8K year over year, which
        is an increase in accrued net income of $38.5K year over
        year.
    
        Regarding the bottom line the Foundation on an YTD Cash
        Basis has generated a Net loss of $-205.2K, vs a budgeted
        net loss of $-117.9K for FY 2016 YTD. Comparing this to FY
        2015 YTD, which had a Cash Basis Net loss of $-74K, it
        leaves ASF, behind YTD 2015 by $131.2K.  This however is
        significantly better than the September variance year over
        year which was $249.1K worse than September of last FY, or
        an increase in Net income of $117.9K for the same time
        period.

       Jim observes (again) that there seems to be a substantial
       amount of money still sitting in Wells Fargo demand deposit
       account.

       Chris expects that the account will be closed and the funds
       moved to Citizens shortly. The issue is that a personal
       appearance at Wells Fargo is necessary in order to close the
       account.

    D. Secretary [Craig]

       A number of discrepancies (around 100) have been found in the
       contributor license records of the foundation, thanks to some new
       tooling in the whimsy project. 

       These discrepancies are being addressed. Cases of non-committers
       without iclas on file will be contacted to request new iclas, and if
       not received, the records will be removed. Cases of committers without
       iclas on file will be contacted to request new iclas, and if not
       received their accounts will be disabled.

       In October, 105 iclas, four cclas, and two grants were received and
       filed.

    E. Executive Vice President [Rich]

       We expect a CFP for ApacheCon North America to be published any day
       now, at which point we will start actively promoting it to our
       communities.

 8. Discussion Items

    A. Discuss whether or not incoming podlings and direct to TLP projects may
       consider having canonical repository outside of ASF infrastructure.

    B. Very much related to the previous discussion item, Sam would like
       to propose, as an experiment, that the Whimsy PMC be permitted to
       propose and explore with the Infrastructure team to have bidirectional
       flows with GitHub, with the following conditions to be in place
       for the duration of the experiment:

         1) The infrastructure team has in place "pushevent" GitHub hooks that
            will notify the committee (via the commits@ mailing list) of all
            such events.  Included in these emails will be an identification of
            the "pusher".  This mailing list will continue to be archived, and
            serve as a push log.

         2) Ability to "push" to either repository will be limited to
            ASF members.

         3) Pull requests will only be accepted for individuals with an ICLA
            on file.

      Sam believes that the above is more than sufficient to ensure that
      we can identify an appropriate ICLA to cover all commits.  Additionally,
      he notes that there are no known (or expected) downstream consumers
      of Whimsy.  He further notes that majority of Whimsy PMC is expected
      to attend this board meeting.

      Sam's summary, in the hopes that this will focus discussion:

      Jim and Sam generally agree on what data must be captured for provenance
      reasons. Greg feels less is required, and Roy even less.

      Greg proposes repository immutability as a mechanism for implementing
      this requirement, and Jim agrees. Bertrand notes that this is an
      implementation detail. While clearly a viable choice (and workable for
      many, including all projects that have chosen SVN), imposing this on all
      projects (particularly Git ones) is something that David and Sam feel is
      as workable as the 18th amendment to the US Constitution (Prohibition).

      Greg proposes formalizing the requirement in the form of a board
      resolution. While Sam feels that it is time to take action, he is
      ambivalent about doing so in that form; despite this, Sam has proposed
      an alternate form of Greg's resolution that retains all the requirements
      but omits the implementation. Roy feels that both resolutions should be
      tossed in favor of providing a set of directions. What Sam would prefer
      is to green-light experiments (small, reversible steps) which will give
      us more experience and data.

      Draft resolutions (an an accompanying FAQ for the second one) can be
      found at: http://s.apache.org/ZWZ

    Discussion on 8A. Canonical repositories outside ASF infrastructure 

    Greg is opposed to allowing canonical repositories outside ASF Chris offers
    that provenance is the major issue regardless of where the code is stored
    Brett thinks that "canonical" needs to be defined or we need to use another
    word to describe the intent; even though initial pushes are somewhere else,
    ASF needs to know the source of all changes Sam notes that "repositories
    outside ASF infrastructure" is already the practice, apparently in
    disregard for policy Jim thinks that svn is canonical but github reflects
    reality Sam states that projects are building releases outside asf and then
    putting stuff back into asf svn and changing history, making the tracking
    of changes difficult Shane thinks that we need to make a resolution to fix
    this Greg is not ready to vote on a resolution Chris agrees we are not
    ready to vote today Jim compares this situation to using LGPL; we need to
    take action where practice conflicts with policy; the fact that projects
    are doing it is not a change to policy; they are ignoring policy. But how
    to address it: make it clear what the policy is, and communicate to PMCs.
    Chris agrees with Jim; folks are clear on LGPL because it’s well
    communicated but there is no clear guidance on use of github; although
    we’ve made some guidance on github; pmcs are not willfully violating policy
    Jim is concerned when the use of github puts us at risk Chris states that
    we’re not trying to solve the problem for expert users, but for incoming
    users (and new PMCs) that don't necessarily know the policy David thinks
    that PMCs understand the policy but think it’s obsolete because of github;
    and by the way, github plans to deprecate some features that we depend on
    to implement our policy Jim says that is's hard to grok distributed
    (github) version control driving policy decisions. We should focus on
    canonical repository; policy cannot be obsolete just because of new
    technology David says the policy as written refers only to svn; there is no
    distributed vc system mentioned Brett proposes to continue discussion on
    board list and perhaps consider a resolution for next month once there has
    been sufficient discussion of the issue and proposed solution David
    observes that infra needs more guidance on how to proceed with git Ross
    agrees on the need to resolve current infra git situation Action item Ross
    to focus a new board thread on resolving current infra git situation

    Discussion on 8B Proposal for Whimsy PMC to explore ways of using git and svn

    Sam would like to do more thinking and exploring how to use git and svn
    together Ross agrees if we change the discussion to “limited experiment”
    Chris supports the "limited experiment" Jim supports the "limited
    experiment" Rich is concerned that other PMCs might think “why not our
    project too” but “limited” will help defuse this issue David supports the
    experiment; infra needs real feedback real soon Sam proposes to put whimsy
    on a monthly schedule while the experiment runs and will give Ross
    information for the report Brett confirms that the sense of the board is to
    let the Whimsy limited experiment begin

Attachment 2: Report from the VP of Brand Management  [Shane Curcuru]

I was invited to be a panel speaker on "Community Trademark Policies" at the
annual SFLC Law Conference [1] at Columbia Law School. The feedback there and
from other sessions at ApacheCon make it clear that the gap between how our
policies are supposed to work, and the actual knowledge of our policies - both
among lawyers and committers alike - is still wide.  This gap is not unique to
the ASF, but it does affect us differently from other software non-profits in
that we have hundreds of separate project communities and thousands of active
committers - all as volunteers.

The trademarks@ list was quieter than usual, although the complexity of issues
being brought up continues to grow.

A competing USPTO registration application for XSTREAM HADOOP [2] was
discovered, and the Hadoop PMC has requested that we have counsel work to
object to the application.

APACHE is now officially a registered trademark in Norway, reg # 284311.

Attachment 3: Report from the VP of Fundraising  [Hadrian Zbarcea]

This was an intense month for Fundraising. After a long
negotiation we closed one platinum [1], and two silver [2]
sponsors.

We also made some progress in catching up on outstanding
invoices. There is one platinum sponsor who indicated that
he wants to continue the sponsorship [3].

There are two other companies that indicated strong
interest in becoming sponsors.

After last months report, there were a few threads on the
mailing lists, a couple of them even constructive but no
concrete actions yet. There were a few very valuable
facts mentioned that I am using in my talks to potential
sponsors that seem to make a difference (for instance
the legal activities projects are shielded from). I hope
something more concrete will be fleshed out in the coming
weeks in the area of community building (non ApacheCon
events, etc) which is ASF's sweet spot.

While the outreach part is going very well, I am not
very happy with the CRM part. After a talk reated to the
way we sent bulk mail (for the annual report), I
discovered that the zoho notifications are not reliable
and at this point I do not trust them. I will need Melissa's
and accounting@'s help for the rest of the month to
reconcile our records [4]. I will also need Melissa and
possibly Ross (advice) on how to handle the talks with
sponsors prior to their budget planning [5].


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 4: Report from the VP of Marketing and Publicity  [Sally Khudairi]

I. Budget: we remain within budget; Sally Khudairi is reviewing a
vendor invoice received at the end of October, and will be following
up with the Virtual team as appropriate.

II. Fundraising/Branding/Marketing/ComDev liaison: Sally is working
with Fundraising regarding a new Platinum Sponsor, and is beginning
work on the Foundation Operations Summary for the Second Quarter of
Fiscal Year 2016 (August-October 2015).. She continues to work with
Fran Lukesh of LucidWorks and Lisa Dae of HotWax Systems on the new
ASF logo and comprehensive visual system; the targeted completion date
is before the end of the calendar year.

III. Press Releases: the following announcements were issued via the
newswire service, ASF Foundation Blog, and announce@apache.org during
this timeframe:

- 10 November 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation announces Apache™
Cassandra™ v3.0
- 27 October 2015 --The Apache Software Foundation announces Apache™
Tajo™ v0.11.0

IV. Informal Announcements: 3 items were published on the ASF
"Foundation" Blog, and 25 items were tweeted on @TheASF. No new videos
have been updated on the ASF YouTube channel, however the organizers
of the Apache Roadshow Asia in October have posted the presentations
from that event online under a separate account/channel. 6 Apache News
Round-ups were issued, with a total of 60 weekly summaries published
to date.

V. Future Announcements: three announcements are in development, and
are anticipated to be disseminated within the next two weeks. Projects
planning to graduate from the Apache Incubator as well as PMCs wishing
to announce major project milestones and/or "Did You Know?" success
stories are welcome to contact Sally at <press@apache.org> for more
information. Kindly provide at least 2-weeks' notice for proper
planning and execution.

VI. Media Relations: we responded to 8 media requests, and are
updating our media/analyst contact database accordingly. We have
experienced a small handful of incoming urgent media queries to which
we had responded immediately to, but subsequent communications had
gone dead with the journalist. The ASF received 1,335 press clips over
this time period, vs. last month's clip count of 1,411.

VI-a. Public Relations: as has been the case since the incorporation
of the Foundation, Sally receives occasional phone calls regarding
"private citizen" issues/questions regarding certain Apache
projects/products. Whilst the number of queries have grown by an
average of 3 calls per month since Apache OpenOffice coming on board,
the number has spiked considerably over the past 6 months with
complaints of the presence of Apache products on mobile devices.
Whilst these interactions have been mostly harmless interruptions, the
level of urgent and angry calls over the past few weeks have become
both disruptive and upsetting: frustration is one thing, abuse is
another. Sally will explore options for a dedicated phone line for
ASF-specific queries that will allow for more efficient screening.

VII. Analyst Relations: we responded to 2 analyst queries, and had an
internal review with Forrester on an upcoming Cloud report. Apache was
mentioned in 29 reports by Gartner, 9 reports by Forrester, 23 reports
by 451 Research, and 10 reports by IDC.

VIII. ApacheCon liaison: no activities are planned at this time. Sally
worked with the organizers of the Apache Roadshow 2015 - China to
publish the event's summary on the Foundation blog.

IX. (Non-ASF) Industry Events and Outreach liaison: Sally is working
to place a spokesperson (ASF Member) at a corporate event in Germany,
and is liaising on several smaller events.

X. Newswire accounts: we have 6 pre-paid press releases with NASDAQ
GlobeNewswire through the end of 2016, and will likely be paying for a
service extension to the current contract. We also continue to receive
gratis news release distribution in the UK by Pressat.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 5: Report from the VP of Infrastructure  [David Nalley]

Operations Action Items:
========================
Infrastructure discovered that many projects were using git in an
innovative manner. The majority of these uses bypassed the 
normal expectations that we had set about protected branches and
tags. As a temporary measure, to get us back to the same level of 
assurance as expected, we disabled the ability to delete branches
and tags. This has caused a bit of murmuring as it is disruptive to the
way that many projects use git. Infrastructure awaits guidance 
about policy around VCS, history, etc. 

We've added a new cloud provider, Leaseweb, that should provide
some additional capacity in the US and Europe.



Short Term Priorities:
======================
We've had an increased focus on tickets in the past month.
Tickets are being created faster than we can deal with them
when viewed from a monthly perspective. Hopefully as we are
adding additional capacity we'll address this and get it back
under control.


Long Range Priorities:
======================
Automation
----------
Automation hasn't been at the top of the list this month.
Nonetheless we've made some gains in this arena. We've added
a good deal of the generic build slave and buildbot master
configuration to puppet.
We've also puppetized the new home.a.o service.

Resilience
----------
The past few months has given us a good opportunity to prove out our backups
and ability to respawn infrastructure. We've gone through multiple moves of
critical systems, most notably SVN; proving that our backups work as intended
and that configuration management works well for those hosts.


Technical Debt
--------------
Web space for committers (currently hosted on people.apache.org) is being
moved to a new home, aptly named home.apache.org, in the continued effort to
phase out the minotaur server. Committers will be given 3 months to move their
contents, after which people.apache.org will stop serving personal content and
redirect to home.apache.org. We have opted for asking people to individually
move their content due to the sheer amount of potentially unwanted old files
that currently reside on minotaur (taking up 2TB of space). This will be a web
hosting server only, shell access will not be allowed. We plan to set up a VM
for PMC Chairs later on, for performing LDAP operations, but the free-for-all
approach that minotaur has is unlikely to be offered in the future, due to the
unmaintainability of it.  Once this is in place, the only other major
component we need to remove from minotaur is our DNS service, and we can then
retire the aging machine.  We will be publicizing the above very broadly in
the coming weeks as we start the countdown clock.

Monitoring / Logging
--------------------
We have had to retire our initial unified logging cluster due to the
incredibly high amount of logs coming in (estimated 20 billion entries per
year), which was choking on disk read/write speeds, first and foremost. A new
5-node cluster with faster SSD disks has been put in as a replacement,
requiring less than 24 hours to set up and put into production thanks to our
configuration management systems and some snappy work done by the team. This
new cluster is henceforth known as 'Snappy'. We will most likely be cutting
down retention time to 3-4 months as a precautionary measure, so as to only
store somewhere around 5-6 billion records at any given time. As we mainly
need "current" logs (within the last month) for our work, this is an
acceptable compromise for us, considering the alternative would be more than
doubling the cost of the cluster.

General Activity:
=================
On-boarding the newest member of the team is ongoing, and has proven to be a
very smooth task, with every member of staff pitching in to provide guidance
and help.

The mail archive PoC has been on a hiatus, with the two lead designers being
away on travel at various times, but as the systems have been running by
themselves in the background, they have provided valuable debugging information
for optimizing and further developing them. We remain convinced that we are on
the right track in terms of software to use for the next generation of mailing
lists, as we have not seen sufficient evidence of other alternatives operating
at the same scale the ASF does.

Uptime Statistics:
==================
See http://status.apache.org/sla/ for details.

The critical services SLA was not met this month due to an LDAP outage that
caused our "LDAP Sync" checks to fail for an extended period of time. While the
LDAP service was not itself unavailable, we will be looking into better ways to
ensure that we act faster when nodes go out of sync or stop functioning. The
overall SLA was however met. In practice this had almost no effect on users, but
didn't meet our own internal standard.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment 6: Report from the Apache Travel Assistance Committee  [Nick Burch]

ACEU 15
-------
All survey results are in, and have been recorded in SVN. No major changes in
process were identified from these.

Travel Insurance was one area that was identified as needing better
explanation + explicit confirmation. The application notices and question have
been tweaked, and an additional short + clear pre-booking email drafted for
this.

ACNA16
------
Melissa and Nick had a very useful call with the LF 2 weeks ago. The plan is
for the LF to remove their own travel funding stuff from the CFP, to avoid
confusion, and direct all speakers towards TAC for funding. As we did at a
previous event, TAC will then notify the LF of any speakers who don't qualify
under TAC criteria, and the LF can give TAC the money for any of those they
want. That way, there's only one place to apply, one point of contact, one set
of flight bookings etc. (LF would contribute to the costs, so it won't cost
the ASF any more, just make it easier for people outside to understand)

We're still waiting to hear the CFP dates before we can finalise things and
open applications. We aim to keep applications open until just after speaker
notifications, to allow speakers a chance to apply for our/LF funding, so we
can't open until CFP dates are final. The question and application form
updates, and post-accpetance email updates, recommended from Budapest have
already been done though, and are deployed ready for the dates.

Outreach
--------
In Budapest, there was a meeting to discuss better outreach and publicity for
TAC, which was fed back to the list and discussed. Two key things from that
was that personalised messages to communities, and applicant stories, are felt
to be much more powerful than blanket mails. We're therefore planning to reach
out to past applicants, and not only ask them to announce the applications as
before, but also give us mini-interviews that are more story/effect based.
We'll then work with Sally to help get more targetted message out about
ApacheCon and TAC (eg group the Student stories together, group the Big Data
ones etc)

We also had some ideas for targetting user/dev list announcements based on
these stories and project classifications, but that might have to wait for a
future event. We do need to tread a fine line between getting the message out
to our wider community even if a project skips the "please forward" mail, and
not spamming communities with non-specific info. Where we have a past-TACer on
a community to forward the message with some personalisation everything is
good, it's our other hundred-odd projects we need semi-automation for!

Commitee
--------
No new committee members

Attachment 7: Report from the VP of W3C Relations  [Andy Seaborne]

Nothing to report.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment 8: Report from the Apache Legal Affairs Committee  [Jim Jagielski]

A busy month for me personally, which has affected the timing of
some Legal Affairs items. Of primary importance is that I am
letting the board know that post-meeting, my plan is to officially
accept the draft release policy (http://www.apache.org/dev/release-draft.html).
I also anticipate increased legal activity around the proposed
version control policy as well.

We received a request for immediate takedown of an email message on
one of the Tomcat mailing lists; it was not approved since it does not
fall within the exceptional circumstances criteria in:

    http://www.apache.org/foundation/public-archives.html

We also received another subpoena this month, this one directed to Ross
and related to "Data Engine Technologies LLC vs IBM" (6:13-cv-00859-LED).
A copy of the above was provided to Ross. I am awaiting direction from Ross
on how he wishes to respond.

Attachment A: Report from the Apache Abdera Project  [Ant Elder]

Apache Abdera provides Java implementations of the IETF Atom
Syndication Format and Publishing Protocol specifications.

Abdera is in maintenance mode with minimal activity. I believe there
are at least three PMC members providing oversight still. This quarter
the only things going on were some misfiled and spam JIRA's the PMC
members dealt with.

The last release was over two years ago, the last commiter / PMC
member addition was Nov 2011.

No board issues.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Report from the Apache Ambari Project  [Yusaku Sako]

## Description:
- Apache Ambari simplifies provisioning, managing, and monitoring of Apache
Hadoop clusters.

## Issues:
- There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
- Since the last report in August 2015, the community has been focused on
  stabilizing the 2.1 line and produced two maintenance releases
  2.1.1 (281 JIRAs resolved) and 2.1.2 (380 JIRAs resolved).
  Currently, stabilization work for 2.1.3 is underway as well as new
  feature development in trunk.
  On the community outreach front, Ambari Hackathon was held on Oct 17.
  The event was a great success; more than 30 developers participated,
  with a good mix of seasoned Ambari developers as well as new, to
  teach/learn about Ambari's extensibility and build new modules
  (e.g., Ambari stack definitions and Ambari Views) utilizing these
  extension points.

Attachment C: Report from the Apache Ant Project  [Conor MacNeill]

Apache Ant is a Java based build tool along with associated tools. It consists
of 4 main projects:

- Ant core and libraries (Antlibs)
- Ivy - Ant based dependency manager
- IvyDE - Eclipse plugin to integrate Ivy into Eclipse
- EasyAnt - Ant and Ivy toolbox to support build processes

o Release Status

Core
--------- 
Ant 1.9.6 followed on July 3, 2015 and is the current release

Ivy
------- 
Ivy 2.4.0 was released on December 26, 2014
Ivy-DE 2.2.0 was released on November 22, 2013

EasyAnt
------------- 
The current release is still from the Incubator 0.9-Incubating.

o Committers and PMC

Jean-Louis Boudart was added to the PMC on Dec 6th, 2013

Stephen Haberman was made a committer on October 12th, 2015

o Community

There is some concern about patches and bug fixes not being applied in a
timely manner for the Ivy sub-project. I believe a number of the original Ivy
committers are no longer active. In response we have added Stephen Haberman as
a new committer (he is an existing Apache committer). I’m hopeful that Stephen
can both address the backlog and identify suitable new committers who can be
added to help move the Ivy sub-project forward.

The remainder of the project remains quiet.

Attachment G: Report from the Apache Calcite Project  [Julian Hyde]

Calcite is a highly customizable engine for parsing and planning
queries on data in a wide variety of formats. It allows database-like
access, and in particular a SQL interface and advanced query
optimization, for data not residing in a traditional database. As a
framework, Calcite’s audience is fairly small, consisting mainly of
developers building data engines (Drill, Phoenix, Hive for example).

Calcite graduated from the Apache Incubator on October 21, 2015.  We
have completed the transition incubating to top-level infrastructure.

We aim to release on about a monthly schedule, although it often slips
to bi-monthly. The last release was 1.4 (incubating) in September and
we will release 1.5 this month, with about 100 JIRAs fixed.

No committers or PMC members appointed since graduation.

Mailing list, JIRA and git commit activity are at an all-time high (in
October there were 46 commits from 12 contributors, 42 issues created,
49 issues resolved, 168 mails on the dev list (which does not include
commits or jira traffic)). There is a steady flow of patches, and
there seems to be an up-tick in inquiries into novel uses of the
project since graduation.

We are investigating whether we are compliant with Apache branding
guidelines.

Attachment J: Report from the Apache Cocoon Project  [Thorsten Scherler]

## Description:
   Web development framework: separation of concerns, component-based.

## Issues:
none

## Activity:
Last release was 2.1.12 on Thu Mar 14 2013 and last PMC addition was on
Fri Jul 06 2012.

The reactions on our last draft board report on the private list have
shown that we are still fully running as a project and therefore I did
not started a discussion whether to move to the attic or not.

Most recently there is some effort to update cocoon 2.2 with Java 8 and
Spring Framework 4.2, some pmc member and as well some devs are getting
involved in the discussion. Further we have setup a jenkins job to build
the 2.2 branch.

Further Francesco Chicchiriccò has opened a ticket INFRA-10458  for a
"Replacement VM for cocoon.zones.apache.org".  He asked on our list if
for more people wish to have access but got no response.

Project status:

* 3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

## Description:
The Community Development PMC is responsible for helping people become
involved with Apache projects

## Issues:

No issues require board attention at the moment.

## Activity: No updates regarding ApacheCon since the EVP report in October.
We are still waiting for a CFP and a unified ApacheCon NA website.

GSoC 2015 has concluded. This year we accepted an all-time high of 56
proposals of which 49 passed midterm and 47 final evaluations. Unfortunately
we were not able to send any candidate to this year's mentor summit because no
mentor expressed interest and all admins as well as other PMC members were
unable to attend.

Attachment M: Report from the Apache CouchDB Project  [Jan Lehnardt]

## Description:
   NoSQL document database using HTTP, JSON, and MapReduce

## Issues:
 - there are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
 - Finally final preparations for the major 2.0 milestone, including:
   - major overhaul of test suites to acommodate new clustering facilities
     while rataining as many integration tests as possible.
   - implementation of the last missing bits in the 2.0 API.
   - start of plan to release a beta release to the larger community.

 - Major discussion (again) about the future of the “CouchApps”-aspect
   of CouchDB. Current resolution: CouchApps are not part of the project’s
   focus at this point, but we have created a new mailing list where
   CouchApp enthusiasts can continue their discussion and maybe even
   work on improvements without disrupting the mainline efforts of the
   project. — Special thanks to Greg Stein for advice on this.

## Health report:
 - We’ve added new PMC members Michelle and Garren in recognition of their
   continued overall contributions to the project.
 - dev@ mail activity is down from the summer quarter because we switched
   from discussing what needs to be done for the upcoming 2.0 release to
   doing the things that need to be done for 2.0.
 - notificatoins@ traffic is up nearly 2x for the same reason.

## PMC changes:

Attachment N: Report from the Apache Creadur Project  [Brian E Fox]

Apache Creadur creates and maintains a suite of open source software related
to the auditing and comprehension of software distributions. Any language and
build system are welcomed.

Status
------
Since the last report in July, email and commit activity continues to move
along slowly. There have been some discussions about adding a new committer
but a vote hasn't been called yet. The .12 release is still in search of a
release manager.

Creadur is primarily used by other Apache projects to help check for
conformity to ASF standards. This is why the project team is primarily
comprised of members and committers from other ASF projects.  The risk of the
project foundering is therefore very low.

Community
---------
The last committer was elected in August, 2012. In September 2013 Phil
Ottlinger was elected to join the PMC.


Releases
--------
Apache Rat  0.11 was released in August, 2014 Apache Rat 0.10 was released in
September, 2013.

Attachment O: Report from the Apache DeltaSpike Project  [Thomas Andraschko]

## Description:

   Apache DeltaSpike is a portable JSR-299 CDI
   (Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java) Extension library
   which contains lots of useful tools and helpers
   which are missing in the CDI core spec.

   DeltaSpike is not a CDI-container itself, but a portable
   Extension library which can run on all CDI-containers!

   DeltaSpike is tested and runs on many Java EE Servers like
   Apache TomEE, Red Hat JBoss Application Server, JBoss Wildfly,
   Oracle WebLogic, Oracle Glassfish, IBM WebSphere, and also on
   simple Servlet containers like Apache Tomcat or Jetty in combination
   with either JBoss Weld or Apache OpenWebBeans.

## Issues:

   There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:

   We receive contributions from the community on a regular basis.
   For 1.5.0 we completely refactored the JSF window handling feature.
   We also did a lot of bugfixing (including security fixes) and added many
   improvements to existing functionality.

## Description:
  Device Data Repository and classification API (established November 2014)

## Issues:
  There are no issues requiring board attention at this time

## Activity:
   In the last three months two releases have been made. The project's
   activity decreased drastically after the PMC had reached the minimal
   viable number of PMC members.

## Health report:
   The project is still minimally viable, with 3 active PMC members, but at
   risk if anyone leaves without new PMC members being elected.

Attachment Q: Report from the Apache Drill Project  [Jacques Nadeau]

## Description:
   A distributed SQL MPP for Hadoop and NoSQL

## Issues:
 - Not at this time.

## Activity:
 - The Drill development community has decided to move back to ~monthly
   releases after having a long gap between the 1.1 and 1.2 releases.
 - A lot of work is currently focused on continued stabilization of the
   codebase as we see larger and more complex user deployments.
 - The community released 1.2 in October and is in the process of releasing 1.3.
 - Some recent new features like access to JDBC sources have drawn in new users.
 - The community is working on a new ValueVector initiative that will broaden
   collaboration on a piece of the Drill codebase. This should help increase
   cross-pollination between the Drill community and other Apache projects.
 - Some recent committers have shown great Apache mentality so it seems likely
   we will add new PMC members shortly. (something that we haven't done since
   we graduated)
 - The community is actively voting on adding a couple new committers whose
   primary contributions are doc and social media related rather than code
   development.
 - We've added two new committers in the last quarter.


## Health report:
 - The community members get along well and are productive.
 - We continue to see nice growth in the user community.
 - New developer contributions have been less frequent that we would like to
   see.
 - Some new developers have found it hard to get started. As such, we continue
   to try to make efforts to ease the effort required around becoming a casual
   contributor. This includes:
   - trying to speed up the unit test suite
   - reducing the memory requirements for the unit test suite
   - switching to a pull request contribution model as opposed to a
     reviewboard/patch model
   - improving developer documentation
   - exploring options for how to ease effort executing the extended test suite
   - marking Newbie tasks on JIRA


## PMC changes:

 - Currently 16 PMC members.
 - No new PMC members added in the last 3 months
 - Last PMC addition was Parth Chandra on Tue Nov 18 2014

## Committer base changes:

 - Currently 25 committers.

Attachment R: Report from the Apache Empire-db Project  [Francis De Brabandere]

Apache Empire-db is a relational database abstraction layer that allows
developers to take a more SQL-centric approach in application development
than traditional ORM frameworks. Its focus is to allow highly efficient
database operations in combination with a maximum of compile-time-safety
and DBMS independence.

Progress of the project

We had a bad health score of -7.55 'URGENT ACTION REQUIRED' and took action.
Part of that low score was due too technical issues with our project name
containing a dash. Further we decided to invite 2 extra committers to the
project.
We are happy to report that this brought more activity to the project and
our score is now 3.47 'Healthy'

Changes in committers or PMC members

2 committers were invited and accepted:
Jan Glaubitz
Ivan Nemeth

Issues

While discussing the score issue Benson Margulies mentioned this:
  I recommend taking the bull by the horns and having your chair call
  into the next board meeting and asking them, point blank, if they are
  unhappy. If not, things continue as they are. I predict that so long
  as you remain an active, responsive, group, large enough to have
  release votes, that the board will be contented.
Therefore we explicitly ask the board if there are any concerns regarding
our project and it's rather low membership count and moderate activity
level.

Releases

Latest release was Apache-Empire-db 2.4.4 released on 19/Aug/2015.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Report from the Apache Etch Project  [Martin Veith]

Attachment U: Report from the Apache Forrest Project  [David Crossley]

Apache Forrest mission is software for generation of aggregated multi-channel
documentation maintaining a separation of content and presentation.

Issues needing board attention:
  None.

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.
  Last modified: 2013-04-08
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

New committers:
  None.
  Most recent addition: 2009-06-09

General status:
  The most recent release is 0.9 on 2011-02-07.

  Two PMC members responded to the notification from Infra about potential
  denial of service via the download mirrors script. Forrest was already
  configured correctly, so nothing to do.

  One PMC member (with some minor assistance from me) attended to the
  re-establishment of our demonstration server following Infra setting up a
  new jails machine.

  A nasty avenue for unusual spam to our mail list was investigated by me
  and Infra, with assistance from one of our mail moderators.

  No activity on the user mail list. However it never gets used much anyway.

  The only activity on the dev mail list was the issue tracker notifications
  regarding the new jail server upgrade.

  Three PMC members were present during the quarter.

  At this report, five other PMC members responded to my draft report.
  This confirms that there are sufficient people hanging around for us to
  potentially be able to make a decision or encourage new contributors.

Project status:
  Activity: Low

  3+ people have indicated presence, so has sufficient oversight.

Security issues reported:
  None.

Progress of the project:
  The Forrest demonstration server was upgraded to keep our own testing and
  demonstration facilities happening. Commenced the updating of the
  documentation for its management.

  Further tweaks to our issue tracker explanatory documentation.

Attachment Y: Report from the Apache Hadoop Project  [Christopher Douglas]

Hadoop is a set of related tools and frameworks for creating and managing
distributed applications running on clusters of commodity computers.

In YARN, support for resizeable containers (YARN-1197) merged to trunk and
branch-2, where its development continues. Application priorities
(YARN-1963) and the v2 timeline server (YARN-2928) continue to make
progress. Failover, HA, and rolling upgrade support were polished. Some
issues related to resource-aware scheduling advanced, tentatively. Support
for Docker containers (YARN-3611) improved, trending toward support for
multiple runtimes (YARN-3853).

In HDFS, support for erasure coding (HDFS-7285) merged to trunk. Many
improvements focused on improving interactions between features (storage
policies, upgrade domains, erasure coding, etc.). Separation between the
namespace and block management, years in development, has received renewed
attention (e.g., HDFS-8966). HDFS also separated its client(s) into a
separate package. Another native client implementation (HDFS-8707) has made
steady progress.

In MapReduce, bug fixes, stability improvements, and documentation comprised
most of the activity. It remains in maintenance mode.

In Common, Hadoop dev support scripts were rewritten and split into Yetus, a
new TLP. The s3a and wasb filesystem bindings also received many bug fixes
and improvements. Portability of native code improved.

The community continues to stabilize the 2.6.x and 2.7.x branches (currently
voting on 2.7.2), and has discussed a 2.8.0 release. It also opened a
discussion of patch workflows, as alternatives to JIRA/patch files/RTC.
While the Github integration is currently enabled, project members are
working with other communitities and infra on alternatives (e.g., Gerrit).

Attachment AC: Report from the Apache Ignite Project  [Dmitriy Setrakyan]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AD: Report from the Apache Incubator Project  [Ted Dunning]

The Apache Incubator is the entry path into the ASF for projects and
codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts.

There are 47 podlings currently undergoing incubation.

With 702 messages to general@incubator, October was one of the heaviest
months for email traffic in a long time.

Podlings nearing graduation received extra scrutiny this month, presumably
as an indirect result of various recent proposals to rework graduation to
include more structured review.  Such evaluations of podling readiness,
while illuminating, put stress on the Mentors and contributors to the
podling under the microscope and raise the overall tension in the
Incubator.

Another topic of discussion was disengaged Mentors.  An initiative to engage
Mentors privately when podlings do not report for two months or more yielded
positive results, with some Mentors reaffirming their commitment and others
officially moving on.

* Community

  New IPMC members:

  - Tom Barber (magicaltrout)
  - Patrick Wendell (pwendell)
  - Reynold Xin (rxin)
  - Phil Sorber (sorber)
  - Julien Le Dem (julien)
  - Jacques Nadeau (jacques)

  No one left the IPMC this month, but a handful of Mentors have stepped
  down from their posts with various podlings.  Most of the resignations
  were from Mentors who had become inactive, so the Incubator's rolls have
  become a bit more accurate.

* New Podlings

  - Eagle
  - Mynewt
  - Concerted
  - SystemML

* Graduations

  The board has motions for the following:

  - Brooklyn
  - Groovy
  - Kylin
  - REEF

* Releases

  The following releases were made since the last Incubator report:

  - 2015-10-05 Apache Johnzon 0.9.2-incubating
  - 2015-10-07 Apache Singa 0.1.0
  - 2015-10-14 Apache AsterixDB 0.8.7-incubating
  - 2015-10-14 Apache REEF 0.13.0-incubating
  - 2015-10-23 Apache Kylin 1.1-incubating
  - 2015-10-28 Apache TinkerPop 3.0.2-incubating
  - 2015-10-30 Apache Apex v3.2.0-incubating
  - 2015-10-31 Apache Slider 0.81.1-incubating

* IP Clearance

  - Taobao (China) Software Co., Ltd and several individuals donated Alibaba
    JStorm, "A fork of Apache Storm with Clojure code replaced with Java,
    and several other improvements".

  A discussion calling into question what responsibilities -- if any -- the
  Incubator should have with regards to IP Clearance eventually went quiet,
  leaving the status quo intact.

* Miscellaneous

  - Droids has retired.
  - Kalumet has retired.
  - The Corinthia community is voting on retirement.

* Credits

  - Report Manager: Marvin Humphrey

Apex

Apex is an enterprise grade native YARN big data-in-motion platform that
unifies stream processing as well as batch processing.

Apex has been incubating since 2015-08-17.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Release Apex-Core, and Apex-Malhar on ongoing basis.
  2. Grow contributors beyond the initial set.
  3. Move to using Apache JIRA

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The project is still using the original Atlassian instance of JIRA.
  INFRA-10144 has tracked the Apache JIRA migration request since August.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  The community is very engaged with the development of the project. There
  have been 788 messages on dev@ for October.

  The community has been active building meetup groups in various locations:
  http://s.apache.org/jKT

  - Number of meetups: 6 in total so far: 4 in USA cities and 2 in Indian
    cities
  - Total members in worldwide Apache Apex meetups: 495
  - Events: 1 in Oct; 4 scheduled in Nov: CapitalOne presentation in
    Chicago; DataTorrent presentation in Pune; GE presentation in San Ramon;
    PubMatic presentation in San Jose;

  Future: Planning to start meetups in more cities, and be able to organize
  2-3 events a month.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The first release under incubation passed voting. Apex (Core)
  3.2.0-incubating was released 2015-10-30.  The community is currently
  discussing roadmap for upcoming releases.

  Various metrics are as follows:
  +---------------------------------------------------+
  |   Metric                         | Core  | Malhar |
  +---------------------------------------------------+
  | Non Merge Commits                | 159   |   39   |
  | Contributors                     |  15   |    9   |
  | Jira New Issues                  |  58   |   19   |
  | Resolved Issues                  |  34   |   30   |
  +---------------------------------------------------+

  The next release target is Apex Malhar with release candidate expected
  fist week of November.

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Chris Nauroth (cnauroth):

    The community continues to show great, open development activity on the
    mailing list.  The first release was handled well with careful attention
    to detail when IPMC members requested a second RC with some changes.  I
    would like to request that the infra team prioritize completion of the
    JIRA migration tracked in INFRA-10144.

  Alan Gates (gates):

    There have been some questions regarding which committers in the project
    are also on the PPMC.  Originally only 6 developers were proposed for
    initial committers, but as part of the entry to incubation this was
    expanded to the current 30+.  The understanding of some in the project
    was that the PPMC still only consisted of those original 6, while the
    other ~24 devs were just committers.  The mentors have explained that it
    does not work this way.  The community is talking through how to
    approach this disconnect.  The mail thread is at
    <http://s.apache.org/qsV>.

--------------------
AsterixDB

Apache AsterixDB is a scalable big data management system (BDMS) that
provides storage, management, and query capabilities for large
collections of semi-structured data.

AsterixDB has been incubating since 2015-02-28.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Do an Apache release that can also provide binary artifacts with
     correct LICENSEs and NOTICEs.
  2.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The discussion on the use of an external Gerrit instance for code
  reviews is considered to be resolved.
  The current workflow ensures that
  a) The ASF git repository is the canonical repository for the project.
  b) Only committers can manually commit changes to the ASF git
     repository.
  c) All discussions on the Gerrit instance are sent to
     notifications@asterixdb.incubator.apache.org.
  While it would be good to also have the Gerrit instance run on ASF
  hardware, this is neither necessary to document the provenance of the
  code nor to enable list members to follow and participate in the
  activities of the project. Also, there seems to be no infra capacity
  to provide a Gerrit service.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  - A paper on AsterixDB was presented at VLDB'15.
  - A deep-dive introduction to AsterixDB was given at the first
    workshop on Big Data Open Source Systems (BOSS'15).
  - Chris Hillery was added as a committer on Oct 20.
  - Increased traffic on the users list.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  - All Google Code issues were migrated to the ASF JIRA and triaged.
  - The discussion on the use of an external Gerrit instance for code
    reviews is considered to be resolved.
  - AsterixDB 0.8.7 and the associated Hyracks 0.2.16 were released.

Date of last release:

  2015-10-22 AsterixDB 0.8.7
  2015-09-22 Hyracks 0.2.16

Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer

CMDA provides web services for multi-aspect physics-based and phenomenon-
oriented climate model performance evaluation and diagnosis through the
comprehensive and synergistic use of multiple observational data, reanalysis
data, and model outputs.

Climate Model Diagnostic Analyzer has been incubating since 2015-05-08.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase email and communication traffic
  2. Build a CMDA website at Apache
  3. Learn more about Apache way

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  The project is still in its nascence and the PPMC is still learning the
  Apache way and moving out of JPL/CMU centric development. The project team
  wants to do a good job they are just moving along slowly.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  More commits and code are being done on the Apache Git repo, almost
  exclusively. They still come in bulk rather than incrementally.  Also
  notes from meetings held between JPL and CMU project members are being
  flushed to the list to increase awareness and participation.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. Deployed to the Amazon Cloud (AWS);
  2. Students from the 2015 JPL center for climate sciences summer school
     used the Amazon Cloud deployment for class projects;
  3. New design and implementation of front end web interface for
     flexibility and to facilitate provenance;
  4. Acquired new ECMWF data;
  5. Created a knowledge graph based on provenance accumulated from the 2015
     Summer School usages;
  6. New services to come soon: Random Forests and Empirical Orthogonal
     Function Analysis (EOF).

  More code is coming. Need to do a website, and start to use
  issue tracking, etc.

Cotton

Cotton is an Apache Mesos framework for running MySQL instances.

Cotton has been incubating since 2015-06.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Increase project communication on mailing lists, JIRA
  2. Attract new project contributors and committers
  3. Establish a first release at Apache

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  Development of Cotton has largely been inactive for the last two months,
  due to limited time from the original developer and community engagements
  including MesosCon Seattle and MesosCon Europe.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  There has been limited participation on the mailing lists and JIRA,
  however a discussion on the private@ list was established about this issue
  and there's a desire to keep the project in the incubator and be more
  proactive in building community in the coming months.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  * Apache Cotton was presented at MesosCon, available for viewing on
    YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFS8-mt8alU

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Ted Dunning (tdunning):

    There was a bit of confusion about the graduation vote (which passed,
    but not unanimously). IPMC and Kylin project members are working to fix
    the issues to the satisfaction of the IPMC member who voted -1.

  Marvin Humphrey (marvin):

    The issue that was raised by the IPMC Member voting -1 was acknowledged
    as legitimate by multiple IPMC members, and a plan of action was
    proposed which was endorsed by one of the Kylin Mentors.  So while there
    may have been differences of opinion about urgency, the matter has been
    guided steadily towards a constructive resolution.

    (update) The -1 has been changed over to a +1 and the issue resolved.

MADlib

Big Data Machine Learning in SQL for Data Scientists.

MADlib has been incubating since 2015-09-15.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Produce a first Apache (incubating) release.
  2. Expand the community, increase dev list activity and add new
     committers/pmc members.
  3. Execute and manage the project according to governance model required
     by the "Apache Way”.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  None

How has the community developed since the last report?

  1. Meetup 10/1/15 @ Pivotal Labs, New York, NY:  “MADlib and HAWQ for
     Advanced SQL Machine Learning on Hadoop” http://s.apache.org/VbG

     IoT” http://www.meetup.com/Pivotal-Open-Source-Hub/events/225426787/

How has the project developed since the last report?

  1. All known issues related to IP cleanliness described in
     https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/MADlibProposal have been fixed and
     pushed to the Apache repo.
  2. All software activity tracking has migrated to Apache MADlib JIRA from
     previous tool.  18 JIRAs created and 2 resolved in last 30 days.
  3. All commits and code are now being done on the Apache Git repo.
  4. Three new quick start guides have been written: i) install, ii) user,
     and iii) developer.  The goal is to make it easier to onboard new
     community members.
  5. A new Greenplum DB sandbox VM with MADlib pre-installed has been
     created and made available publicly at
     https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpdb-sandbox-tutorials.  The goal is to
     make it easier to onboard new community members - they can download and
     start trying MADlib right away with no install/setup.
  6. A "catchup JIRA" was filed
     https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MADLIB-912 in order to catch up
     between the time of the code grand to Apache and bringing in dev work
     that was already in flight at the time.  We apologize for any
     inconvenience in clubbing together these multiple items; it was a
     one-time operation.

Date of last release:

  No release yet.

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Rya

Rya (pronounced "ree-uh" /rēə/) is a cloud-based RDF triple store that
supports SPARQL queries. Rya is a scalable RDF data management system built
on top of Accumulo. Rya uses novel storage methods, indexing schemes, and
query processing techniques that scale to billions of triples across
multiple nodes.  Rya provides fast and easy access to the data through
SPARQL, a conventional query mechanism for RDF data.

Rya has been incubating since 2015-09-18.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Populate the website for the project
  2. Become familiar with the release process and have a first release as
     part of the Apache
  3. Create a "how to" document to explain the ways new contributors can
     become involved in the project, so we increase the size of the
     community.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  All initial committers submitted their ICLAs and are subscribed to the dev
  and private mailing lists. There are 32 subscribers to the dev list.  The
  initial committers are learning to use the Apache infrastructure and
  processes.  We gave a presentation on Rya at Duke University, trying to
  increase awareness about the project.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  Infrastructure is now set up (mailing lists, repositories, JIRA, etc)
  Getting the code reviewed for final publication took about 3 weeks, which
  was longer than we expected, but the code is now imported into the Apache
  git repository.  We are working on creating a website for the project.

Date of last release:

  Not applicable - the code was just imported into Apache repository

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Sean Busbey (busbey):

    Getting things started took a bit, presumably due to the review needed
    to get the code out, but the fledging community has been responsive to
    feedback. The next month should give a better idea of how strong a hand
    the mentors will need to use.

--------------------
Slider

Slider is a collection of tools and technologies to package, deploy, and
manage long running applications on Apache Hadoop YARN clusters.

Slider has been incubating since 2014-04-29.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Getting more external users
  2. Getting more diverse set of developers
  3. Getting more diverse set of committers/PMC

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We are seeing traction in the community with a number of new users
  requesting improvements in deployment and management of applications
  using Slider.  Patches were submitted by a couple of new contributors.
  We still have to get those people into long term coding, and then bring
  them in to the committer group.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We released a slider-0.81.1-incubating bug fix release with 30 JIRAs
  resolved and have begun discussing the 0.90.0 release.

Tamaya

Tamaya is a highly flexible configuration solution based on an modular,
extensible and injectable key/value based design, which should provide a
minimal but extendible modern and functional API leveraging SE, ME and EE
environments.

Tamaya has been incubating since 2014-11-14.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Make the project known in projects world-wide.
  2. Release more often.
  3.

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have new people joining the mailinglist and also starting
  discussions for possible future involvement. We had quite broad
  feedback in the Java EE space, since we added full blown CDI
  support to Tamaya. We are looking forward to gain new committers
  within next reporting period hopefully.
  During ApacheCon Europe different projects found our approach
  very interesting. We also have a request from a JUG in Switzerland
  going to present the project as well several conferences that accept
  the topic as well.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  The project's API has proven to work very well. Many, also complex
  extensions were written and we started to add support for very
  important eco-systems (JavaEE, Spring, OSGI).
  I think we can release the next release before X-Mas the latest.

Date of last release:

  2015-08-22

When were the last committers or PMC members elected?

TinkerPop

TinkerPop is a graph computing framework written in Java

TinkerPop has been incubating since 2015-01-16.

Three most important issues to address in the move towards graduation:

  1. Add more members to the PMC.
  2. Add more members to the committer list.
  3. N/A (unless the mentors have ideas?)

Any issues that the Incubator PMC (IPMC) or ASF Board wish/need to be
aware of?

  No. Recently, we have really appreciated Daniel Gruno's (mentor) efforts
  to get our development community more connected by setting up an Apache
  HipChat account for us and interacting with us in a more real-time fashion
  on various procedures/policies of Apache in a proactive manner. This has
  helped to explain to us (through doing) what is required of Apache.

How has the community developed since the last report?

  We have 2 new committers: Jason Plurad and Matthew Frantz. We are in the
  process of [DISCUSS] about two other potential committers.

How has the project developed since the last report?

  We have since instantiated a 'review-then-commit' model. Daniel Gruno
  (mentor) worked with us to set the appropriate policy documentation and
  thus far, it has been going very well.

  In terms of the adoption of TinkerPop, note that Amazon recently announced
  that they use Apache TinkerPop for their order fulfillment network (1
  trillion edges). This is very public discussion of our technology (videos
  + blog posts) should help to attract development talent.

  We have compiled a list of the other Apache technologies that TinkerPop
  works with: Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark,
  Apache Giraph, Apache Atlas, and Apache Falcon. We bring this up to
  identify the integration of Apache TinkerPop into the greater Apache
  ecosystem.

  The following articles/presentations/blogposts were provided about
  TinkerPop from TinkerPop members since the last report:

Shepherd/Mentor notes:

  Daniel Gruno (humbedooh):

    I will note that despite HipChat and other direct message platforms
    involved, the async messages, especially revolving around larger
    community/project issues have been on the rise over the past 3 months,
    up 71% compared with the 3 months before that, as evident from
    <http://s.apache.org/Atz> (this is discounting git and jira messages). I
    see this as a positive signal that the podling is working towards a more
    open and inclusive discussion pattern. New committers are being
    on-boarded, and I hope to see more PPMC members join the ranks soon.

Attachment AI: Report from the Apache Libcloud Project  [Tomaž Muraus]

Libcloud is a Python library that abstracts away the differences among
multiple cloud provider APIs.

Issues

We have a lot of user and contributor activity (a lot of one time
patches), but we had some problems with reaching voting quorums in
the past.

We eventually reached it, but it took longer that we would have liked.
The main problem / root cause is lack of activity from some PMC members
(we currently have around 3-4 PMC members which are active and cast
votes on regular basis).

To mitigate this, we have just recently invited some active contributors
to join us as committers and PMC members. We hope this will make reaching
voting quorums in the future easier.

Releases

- Libcloud v0.18.0 on August 13th, 2015
- Libcloud v0.19.0 on October 30th, 2015

Community

- Last PMC addition was a new committer on March 17th, 2015
- We are also in process of adding 3 new PMC members (votes have passed,
  we have sent notifications to the board a couple of days ago)

Log4j 2 remains an active project. The overall
community is healthy and friendly.

Log4j 1.x has reached its "End Of Life". Press release was drafted with
Sally from ASF Press.

Log4cxx is still active at the Incubator.

In general, all subprojects are healthy despite the community didn't grow
much in the past months.

Attachment AK: Report from the Apache ManifoldCF Project  [Karl Wright]

ManifoldCF PMC Chair: Karl Wright (kwright@apache.org)
Date: November 2015

Project description
==============

ManifoldCF is an effort to provide an open source framework for connecting
source content repositories like Microsoft Sharepoint and EMC Documentum, to
target repositories or indexes, such as Apache Solr, OpenSearchServer or
ElasticSearch. ManifoldCF also defines a security model for target
repositories that permits them to enforce source-repository security policies.

Releases
========

ManifoldCF graduated from the Apache Incubator on May 16, 2012.  Since then,
there have been numerous major releases, including a 1.10 and 2.2 release on
September 7 and August 31, 2015.  The next major release is scheduled for
December 31, 2015.

ManifoldCF is no longer in the position of supporting both a legacy set of
releases (1.x), and a non-backwards-compatible set of releases (2.x).  The
1.10 release was meant to be the last major release of the 1.x series of
releases.

Committers and PMC membership
=============================

The last committer we signed up was Tugba Dogan on September 7, 2015.

Mailing list activity
=====================

Mailing list has moderately active.  Most of our connectors now have
significant use cases and constituencies.  We participated in Google Summer of
Code this year, and received two new connectors from that effort.  Dev list
comments for this period centered around the ManifoldCF 2.2 and 1.10 releases,
and occasional user questions.  I am unaware of any mailing-list question that
has gone unanswered.

Outstanding issues
==================

Release upload to the dist.apache.org svn repository was formerly quite slow.
We raised this issue with Infra roughly a year ago.  Recently, Infra has
reported that the problem is fixed.  This is something we will certainly
explore for the next release in December.

Branding
========

We continue to believe we are now compliant with Apache branding guidelines,
with the possible exception of (TM) signs in logos from other Apache products
that don't have any such marks.  We submitted ManifoldCF to the trademark
registration service and received word that our trademark application is now
pending.

Attachment AL: Report from the Apache Marmotta Project  [Jakob Frank]

Apache Marmotta, an Open Platform for Linked Data.

Apache Marmotta was founded in December 2012 and has graduated from the
Incubator in November 2013.

Another low activity quarter, with only few messages on both, user@m.a.o and
dev@m.a.o. Still, a small but high quality discussion with new community
members on perfomance and proposals for improvement has started.

Our GSoC-2015 student ("Proposal to Implement GeoSPARQL in Marmotta"
MARMOTTA-584) passed the final exam and his code is currently integrated in a
separate branch. We hope to merge it into the main codebase for the next
release.

Subscribers to the projects mailing list:
  dev@marmotta.a.o: 86 subscribers (+0 since last report, 2015-05)
  users@marmotta.a.o: 102 subscribers (+3 since last report, 2015-05)

Releases:
  2014-12-05 (3.3.0)

Attachment AN: Report from the Apache Oltu Project  [Antonio Sanso]

Board Report, Oltu PMC

Oltu PMC Chair: Antonio Sanso (asanso@apache.org<mailto:asanso@apache.org>)
Date: November 2015

DESCRIPTION

Oltu is a project to develop a Java library which provides an API
specification for, and an unconditionally compliant implementation of the
OAuth v2.0 specifications. OAuth is a mechanism that allows users to
authenticate and authorise access by another party to resources they control
while avoiding the need to share their username and password credentials.

MILESTONES

Apache Oltu 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014.

Apache Oltu Oauth2 module version 1.0.1 was released September 24th 2015

CURRENT ACTIVITY

The core part of the project related to 'The OAuth 2.0 Authorization
Framework' (RFC 6749) is pretty stable due the fact RFC 6749 is now a
standard. A stable version 1.0 was released on March 3rd 2014 and some minor
releases are going out regularly for bug fixing. The current intention is to
extend the coverage to the JWE part and potentially the JWK specification
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517). Users activity is growing slowly but
steadily (the user@ mailing list has got new messages from new users). We got
quite some feedbacks from users (included patches). The answer from Oltu dev
seems to be a bit slow though. The overall coding activity is also slow. The
reason might also be the fact the OAuth specification is stable for a while
(being an RFC) hence also the code is stable.

COMMUNITY

PMC composition has not changed since graduation We have voted one new
committer Jasha Joachimstha in January 2015  (31/01/2015)

ISSUES

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

Attachment AP: Report from the Apache Open Climate Workbench Project  [Michael James Joyce]

Apache Open Climate Workbench is a tool for scalable comparisons of remote
sensing observations to climate model outputs.

Project Activity:
Development has remained fairly stable since the last report. There has
been an increase in new contributors showing up with contributions
on Github, but at the moment we haven't seen any that are sticking around
for extended periods of time. The PMC is keeping an eye out for potential
new committer votes.

The team pushed out a 1.0.0 release in late September which included
a large number of new features that were integrated since our last
release in January 2015. The team has a rough plan laid out for the
next release (1.1.0) and has been pushing forward towards it.

Issues for the Board:
None

When was the last release:
0.5 - 14 January 2015
1.0.0 - 23 January 2015

Attachment AQ: Report from the Apache OpenJPA Project  [Pinaki Poddar]


-----------------------------------------
Attachment AR: Report from the Apache Perl Project  [Philippe M. Chiasson]

-- mod_perl 1.0 --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

No new mod_perl 1.x releases since 2014-12.

--- mod_perl 2.0 --

mod_perl 2.X is designed to work with all httpd 2.X branches.

Steve Hay has taken the role of release manager and has released mod_perl 2.0.9.

This release is the first new release in quite a while, and it has been long
awaited.

It mostly includes bugfixes and necessary changes to keep up with newer Perls
and httpds.

Perl 5.22.x isn't supported yet, but work on that front has been started.

Steve Hay still deserves special credit for his great work driving this forward.

--- Apache-Test --

Apache-Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites that can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications, and
includes support for Apache modules written in C, mod_perl, PHP
and Parrot.

As planned, prior to the release of mod_perl-2.0.9, a new release
of Apache-Test was made.

Apache-Test 1.39 was released on Apr 21, 2015

--- Apache-SizeLimit --

Apache-SizeLimit is a popular component in most mod_perl production
environments.  It is used to kill off large httpd child processes
based on various environmental triggers.

Apache-SizeLimit 0.97 was released on Apr 02, 2012

No new Apache-SizeLimit releases since 2014-12.


--- Apache-Bootstrap --

Apache-Bootstrap is a framework to make it easier to build perl
module distributions for different mod_perl versions.  It encapsulates
code developed over the years by mod_perl developers to make
maintaining Apache::* and Apache2::* modules in the same distribution easy.

Apache-Bootstrap 0.07 was released on Jul 13, 2009

No new Apache-Bootstrap releases since 2014-12.


--- Apache-Reload --

Apache-Reload is a popular component in most mod_perl development
environments, used to refresh compiled code in the perl interpreter
without completely restarting httpd.

Apache-Reload 0.13 was released on May 09, 2015


-- Apache-DBI --

Apache-DBI is a popular component in many mod_perl deployments. It
is used to provide transparent database connection pooling to clients
using DBI.

Apache-DBI 1.12 was released on June 12nd, 2013

No new Apache-DBI releases since 2014-12.

-- Development --

mod_perl continues to be a healthy development community, though
as a mature and stable product development moves at a naturally
slower pace than in years past.  Bugs are found and discussed and
fixes are applied with due consideration for our production userbase.

The 2.0.9 release has created healthy activity, and adresses many of
the bugs reported.

-- Users --

The mod_perl users list is seeing little activity, except for the ocasional
obscure bug report, or general user questions.

Patches and bug reports are few, but keep on coming.


-- PMC --

No noteworthy PMC events happened since the last report.

The PMC has currently 11 members

Attachment BA: Report from the Apache SIS Project  [Martin Desruisseaux]

## Description:

Apache Spatial Information System (SIS) is a Java library for developing
geospatial applications. SIS enables better representation of
coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or other relevant
spatial needs. The SIS metadata module forms the base of the library and
enables the creation of metadata objects which comply with the model of
international standards. The SIS referencing module enable the
construction of geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing such
as axis, projection and coordinate reference system definitions, along
with the associated operations which enable the mathematical conversion
of coordinates between different systems of reference.

## Activity:

  * The port of existing code to SIS is continuing and new code is
    created (about 10,000 lines of Java code and 12,300 lines of comment
    since previous report).
  * The French version of developer guide is expanded with a new section
    about coordinate transformations [1] with the help of blogs that we
    wrote. All new content will be translated to the English version of
    the developer guide later (speed depends on volunteer time).
  * We had a session at the ApacheConf BigData conference in Budapest.
    However attendance was low (about 5 persons).
  * Together with Marmotta, we submitted an entry for the Open
    Geospatial Consortium (OGC) blog about some Apache projects related
    to geospatial standards. At first the blog was targeted to SIS, but
    we proposed to extend the scope to Marmotta since they did an
    implementation of GeoSPARQL.
  * OGC Chief Engineer and CTO posted on dev@community-dev mailing list
    a Call for interest for a spatial session at Apache Big Data North
    America [2]. Relevant Apache projects could include Accumulo, SIS,
    Marmotta, Solr, Tika, Magellan and NiFi among others. For now this
    call of interest did not yet got reply accept by peoples who are
    already supporters of such session.

## Issues:

(I'm not sure if the board is the appropriate place to ask)
Is there any thing that we could do for increasing awareness about the
above call for interest (e.g. would some other lists be appropriate)?

## Health report:

The project is reported as healthy by the report helper (score of 7.55).
We saw an increase in the activity of two commiters other than the
chair, but the proportion is still unbalanced. One reason may be that
the majority of current development is still a port of code from an
existing project (the code ported to SIS is deleted from the old
project), and only about 20% of that code has been ported. An other
reason may be the complexity of some parts (e.g. the map projections)
which we try to address by writing the developer guide.

## PMC changes:

  * Currently 19 PMC members.
  * No new PMC members added in the last 3 months.
  * Last PMC addition was Marc Le Bihan on Wed Dec 10 2014.

## Committer base changes:

  * Currently 20 committers.
  * Rémi Maréchal was added as a committer on Tue Sep 08 2015

## Releases:

  * Apache SIS 0.6 has been released in September 2015.
  * Apache SIS 0.7 targeted for beginning of 2016, after the
    "referencing by coordinate" module will be mostly finished.

## Mailing list activity:

Attachment BB: Report from the Apache Spark Project  [Matei Zaharia]

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It
offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R as well as a rich set of
libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics.

Project status:

- We posted our 1.5.0 release in June, with contributions from 230
  developers. This release included many new APIs throughout Spark,
  more R support, UI improvements, and the start of a new low-level
  execution layer that acts directly on binary data (Tungsten). It had
  the most contributors of any release so far. Full release notes are at
  http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-1-5-0.html.

- We made a Spark 1.5.1 maintenance release in October and a Spark

Attachment BC: Report from the Apache Stratos Project  [Lakmal Warusawithana]

## Description: 
Apache Stratos is a highly-extensible Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) framework
that helps run Apache Tomcat, PHP, and MySQL applications and can be extended
to support many more environments on all major cloud infrastructures.  

## Issues: 
Currently this in not a major issue, but this may become mainstream near
future. Stratos support run application on both virtual machines and
containers. Container support is  implemented on top of kubernetes project.
Stratos provided autoscaling and composite application support on top of
kubernetes. Kubernetes project is running very healthy with larger community
support. (more than 500 code contributors) They are going to  support all
features that provided by Stratos on top of them. Since Kubernetes also
opensource project, PMCs have some concern of duplicating effort on same
space. Stratos may need to identify right space and move forward collaborating
with other opensource projects like kubernetes.

## Activity:
All 5 GSoC projects are successfully completed. Stratos 4.1.0 major release
done.  Which included two main features, docker container support and
composite application model.  Community discussed doing biweekly minor
releases and successfully executed and end up doing 4 minor releases (4.1.1,
4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4). Also improved automated test coverage significantly,
which help to do releases without recurring major effort on testing.

Attachment BD: Report from the Apache Subversion Project  [Greg Stein]

Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as
an open-source, centralized version control system characterized by
its reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of
its model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide
variety of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale
enterprise operations.

* Board Issues

  There are no Board-level issues of concern.

* Community

  Our last PMC addition was in February 2014 (kotkov)
  Our last committer addition was in September 2015 (luke1410).

  The community remains active on its mailing lists:
    * almost 800 subscribers to users@ with over 100 messages per month
    * over 300 subscribers to dev@ with about 250 messages per month

* Releases

  Apache Subversion 1.9.1 was released on September 2, 2015.
  Apache Subversion 1.9.2 was released on September 23, 2015.

  Development continues on 1.10.x, with over 400 commits per month. No
  target date or feature set has been defined.

* Issue Tracker Moved

  The Subversion community did not move its issue tracker when it
  entered the Incubator and later become a TLP. We continued to use
  our original tracker on tigris.org. With some heavy lifting by our
  member Ivan Zhakov, the issues were ported over to the ASF's Jira
  instance, and the old tracker has been locked/closed.

Attachment BE: Report from the Apache Syncope Project  [Francesco Chicchiriccò]

## Description:
    Apache Syncope is an Open Source system for managing digital identities
    in enterprise environments.

## Issues:
    There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:
    New users keep popping up in mailing lists, asking for support with
    various deployment scenarios, even for areas where traditional identity
    management is not very common (say physical access control management) or
    new geographic locations (South Africa, Colombia).

    Presentation "Building Open Source Identity Infrastructures" was given at
    ApacheCon: Core Europe 2015, showing Apache Syncope references, with good
    feedback both during speech and afterwards (Twitter, LinkedIn, SlideShare).

    While keeping bugfix activity on branch 1_2_X, it is fair to say that most
    of current work is done on master targeting 2.0.0.
    Someone has already asked, via user ML, if release date was already
    planned but, since there is still a significant amount of work to be
    completed, we will probably go for one or more intermediate milestone
    releases.

    In the last months we are featuring an IRC channel, setup with help from
    Infra and properly archived.

## Commiter / PMC changes:

  - Currently 19 committers and 9 LDAP committee group members.

Attachment BF: Report from the Apache TomEE Project  [David Blevins]

Apache TomEE delivers enterprise application containers and services
based on, but not limited to the Enterprise JavaBeans Specification
and Java Enterprise Edition Specifications.

The user list continues to be active with most queries resolved quickly.

We welcome new contributor Daniel Cuhna who has submitted patches via
GitHub pull requests, and hope he will continue to contribute to the
the project. We continue to encourage new contributors to join and
support them as much as we can.

The development pace of the project continues to be slow and focused on
maintenance.  TomEE 1.7.2 (released in May) continues to be the most
popular download.

Work has been progressing on TomEE 7 to implement the Java EE 7 web
profile, but continues to be hindered by the lack of a Java EE 7 TCK.

The community is working towards a maintenance release of the 1.7.x
codebase (1.7.3) which provides some key bug fixes and is looking
to provide a first milestone release of TomEE 7, which has been
eagerly awaited by the community for some time, but delayed due to bugs
identified with the integration with upstream libraries. Both are
planned for the next few weeks.

The PMC has taken action to address repeatedly late board reports.  A
private SVN repo was requested where board reports can be placed and
contributed to by all the PMC.  A special thank you to Jonathan
Gallimore for being a primary contributor to this report.

Last release was 1.7.2 on 2015-05-22.  Last committer was added
November 2013.  Last PMC addition, 4 new members on 2015-08-11.

Attachment BI: Report from the Apache Usergrid Project  [Todd Nine]

Usergrid is Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) composed of an integrated database
(Cassandra), a query engine (Elastic Search), and application layer and client
tier with SDKs for developers.

Activity

Development continues on the 2.0 release.  Stabilization and bug fixes from
the results of large scale testing are in progress. Bug fixes are still
applied to 1.0, as well as new functionality to allow migration from 1.0 to
2.0.

Short summary of Usergrid activity over past month

No new committers in past month


When was the last PMC member and committer added to the project?

George Reyes voted onto PMC on 2015-10-02

When was the last release made by the project?

2015-07-16 - apache-usergrid-1.0.2-incubating

Issues

Changes to Apache Git have hampered our development process. Specifically, we
create a feature branch per JIRA ticket.  This ticket is then reviewed in a
pull request by 1 or more committers, and then accepted into master.  Without
the ability to delete these branches after a merge, our repository is
increasing in obsolete branches.  This also causes issues when a branch is
improperly named on creation.

Mailing list activity: 

- dev@usergrid.apache.org:  
- 90 subscribers (up 7 in the last 3 months)
- 1679 emails sent in the past 3 months (2420 in previous quarter)

Attachment BK: Report from the Apache Whimsy Project  [Ross Gardler]

## Description: 

Whimsy is a collection of applications that run on infrastructure resources to
assist the personal productivity of members of the board and executive staff.

## Summary

After a few false starts the infrastructure for Whimsy is now mostly set up.
SVN is still an issue - see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-10399.
This has resulted in a proposal to use bidirectional flows to GitHub as the
canonical repository. See Discussion Item B.

The PMC needs to focus on increasing the diversity of contributors to the
project. Recently, Sebb and Craig have begun to make contributions. 

## Issues: 

See Discussion Item B.

The project source is in a non-standard location in the repository source tree
and mirrored at github. 

The infrastructure that Whimsy runs on needs improvement. Infra has some
difficulty supporting the production use of the tool because of its
non-standard deployment; a SLA is not in place for the service; and tracking
performance and responding to issues is difficult. 

## Activity: 

The project is still mostly the work of a single committer
(thanks Sam), though there is adequate oversight from the PMC.

## PMC changes:

- Currently 9 PMC members.
- Last PMC addition was Sebastian Bazley on Sun Nov 16 2015

## Committer base changes:

- Currently 9 committers.
- Last addition: Sebastian Bazley on Sun Nov 16 2015

## Releases:

No formal release. Project is deployed internally to Apache hardware.

## Mailing list activity:

- dev@whimsical.apache.org:
- 13 subscribers (up 2 in the last 3 months):
- 207 emails sent to list (27 in previous quarter)


## JIRA activity:

Attachment BL: Report from the Apache Xalan Project  [Steven J. Hathaway]

The Apache Xalan Project develops and maintains libraries and programs 
that transform XML documents using XSLT standard stylesheets. Our subprojects 
use the Java and C++ programing languages to implement the XSLT libraries. 

Xalan is a mature project, but we are hoping to acquire more committers
who can upgrade the project to address the newer XPath and XSLT standards.

We are in process of doing integration builds to incorporate the Xerces-C
patches. There continues to be activity on the Xalan-J project.

ISSUES FOR THE BOARD
  None.

CURRENT ACTIVITY

Xalan is a mature product.  There is little development activity other
than patch maintenance.  Most of the activity is in the Xalan-J subproject.
There are some participants reporting on their build and deployment issues.

We continue to get about 20 messages per month on our development mailing list.

We have proposed a Oregon State University - Capstone project to assist in
the Xalan-C integration builds.  The proposal was not accepted by students.

We are still trying to get more participants to report on their integration
build attempts.  Work is continuing to perform integration builds using
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 through 2015.

MEMBERSHIP

Changes in the PMC membership:
  None.

Last new committer:
  May 2014

PROJECT RELEASES

Xalan Java 2.7.2  April 15, 2014
Xalan C/C++ 1.11  October 31, 2012

Publishing of project releases was refreshed Oct 30, 2014.

OTHER ISSUES

We would still appreciate more active persons to build Xalan-C tests.

We continue to get requests for Xalan to support XSLT version 2.  The
Xalan libraries currently support XSLT version 1.  Feature ugrades and
migration will require more than a few committers.

BRANDING ISSUES
  None.
