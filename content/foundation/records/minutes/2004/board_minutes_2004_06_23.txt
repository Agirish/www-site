 4. Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Greg]
    
       Prefacing his comments with the observation that there was nothing
       of significant interest to report, Greg reported that the agreement
       with Robin Wagner for pro-bono legal services has been concluded.
       She will be providing 10 hours per month pro-bono, and then bill at
       a rate of $150 per hour for work beyond the 10 hours.  Greg will be
       committing the final agreement to the Foundation CVS.  Also, there 
       are three official contacts, currently Greg, Brian and Geir.

       Brian suggested that we ensure transparency by posting copies of
       traffic between the ASF and Robin to the legal mailing list.  There
       was general agreement, and Dirk agreed to provide help in decrypting
       all CC-ed messages to plaintext for list distribution automatically.

       Greg is going to take further discussion of this offline to work out
       the mechanics of this process with Dirk, Robin and the three official
       contacts.

       There were no further questions for comments for Greg.

    B. President [Dirk]

       Dirk reported that he's seeing a slight increase in questions, both 
       public and private, pertaining to interpretation of contention 
       between the CLA and the Apache License 2.0 when there is a corporate
       entity employing the contributor.

       The issue is that clarification is needed around the interpretation 
       that the concept of 'entity' in AL2 includes a employing corporation
       of a contributor.

       The proposed solution is a clarifying statement from the ASF that 
       indicates that the CLA is the governing agreement wrt the concerns 
       about the AL2.0 'entity' language.

       Geir asked if the statement resolved the issue if there really is one,
       and Dirk confirmed that it wouldn't, but rather establish our intent.
       Sam inquired about the need for further action, and Dirk suggested
       that he didn't believe it necessary at this time, but wanted to report
       the increasing frequency of concern to make the board aware.  We may 
       wish to have a resolution for next board meeting on the subject of
       a declaration or patch.

       There were no further questions for Dirk.


    C. Treasurer [Chuck]

       Absent.
 
    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]

       Absent.

 5. Special Orders

    A. Public Relations Committee

       WHEREAS, The Board of Directors deems it to be in the best
       interests of the Foundation and consistent with the
       Foundation's purpose to establish an ASF Board Committee
       charged with handling public relations, managing the Apache
       brand and image, performing outreach and announcements, and
       raising funds as necessary tasks to sustain the operation of
       the Foundation and assist the creation and maintenance of
       open-source software for distribution at no charge to the
       public.
       
       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that an ASF Board Committee, to
       be known as the "Public Relations Committee", be and hereby is
       established pursuant to Bylaws of the Foundation; and be it
       further

       RESOLVED, that the Public Relations Committee be and hereby is
       responsible for organization and oversight of efforts to handle
       public relations on behalf of The Apache Software Foundation,
       including trademark licensing and other issues regarding
       management of the Apache brand and raising of funds, but
       excluding the ApacheCon conferences (which shall remain a
       responsibility of the Apache Conference Planning Committee);
       and be it further

       RESOLVED, that Brian W. Fitzpatrick shall serve at the
       direction of the Board of Directors as the chair of the Public
       Relations Committee and have primary responsibility for
       management of the projects within the scope of responsibility
       of the Public Relations Committee; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the persons listed immediately below be and
       hereby are appointed to serve as the initial members of the
       Public Relations Committee:

         Aaron Bannert
         Brian Behlendorf
         Shane Curcuru
         Lars Eilebrecht
         Justin Erenkrantz
         Brian W. Fitzpatrick
         Geir Magnusson Jr.
         Steven Noels
         Cliff Skolnick
         Greg Stein
         Susan Wu

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Apache
       Fund-Raising Committee is hereby terminated.


     Greg noted that this is the same resolution as last time, for the
     most part.  Brian and Dirk noted that they still had reservations
     but willing to move forward and help. (Geir had indicated same in his
     commit message when adding to PRC).

     By unanimous vote, the PRC was approved.


    B. Individual Contributor License Agreement

       WHEREAS, Project Management Committees within The Apache
       Software Foundation have an immediate need for an approved text
       to be used as a Contributor License Agreement.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Individual Contributor
       License Agreement attached hereto as Attachment T may be used
       by all Project Management Committees within The Apache Software
       Foundation.


      See discussion notes below for "C. Corporate Contributor License 
      Agreement"

      Dirk left the meeting at 11:03 PDT.  At this point, quorum was 
      maintained by Brian, Geir, Stefano, Sam, Greg and Sander.

      By unanimous vote, the new Individual Contributor License Agreement
      was approved.

    C. Corporate Contributor License Agreement

       WHEREAS, Project Management Committees within The Apache
       Software Foundation have an immediate need for an approved text
       to be used as a Corporate Contributor License Agreement.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Corporate Contributor
       License Agreement attached hereto as Attachment U may be used
       by all Project Management Committees within The Apache Software
       Foundation.


     Both Corporate and Individual agreements were discussed together.  There
     was concern from several that they had been recently posted to the license
     mail list, but Sam noted that they were posted right after May board 
     meeting, and that recent activity only had to with a set of concerns by Brian.

     Brian had a concern regarding two changes in the Corp CLA that appeared to
     create a loophole, but was satisfied with the response from Jennifer
     Machovec, the proposer of the changes, that there was no loophole as the
     issue in question was dealt with by the Individual CLA, and since a Corp CLA
     never stands on it's own - there is always a Individual CLA for the
     contributor - there is no problem.

     It was suggested to bump to next month to give time for more consideration,
     but Sam noted that he didn't believe much would happen in another month
     since nothing happened in the last month.  General agreement.

     Brian and Greg suggested adding a version number, and based on a question from
     Stefano, it was clarified that new revisions wouldn't necessarily require a 
     re-signing by existing CLA signatories.

     By unanimous vote, the new Corporate Contributor License Agreement
     was approved.
   

    D. Change of Jakarta PMC Chair

       As Geir Magnusson Jr is resigning because of accepting Geronimo
       PMC Chair, the Jakarta PMC has voted to propose Henri Yandell
       as the new Jakarta PMC Chair.  We offer the following
       resolution for board approval :

       WHEREAS, the membership of the Apache Jakarta Project
       Management Committee (PMC) have recommended Henri Yandell to
       serve as chairman of the Apache Jakarta PMC; and

       WHEREAS, the previously appointed chairman of the Apache
       Jakarta PMC, Geir Magnusson Jr, has stepped down from his
       position as Vice President, Apache Jakarta, in favor of Henri
       Yandell's appointment to that position.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Henri Yandell be and
       hereby is appointed to the office of Vice President, Apache
       Jakarta, to serve in accordance with and subject to the
       direction of the Board of Directors and the Bylaws of the
       Foundation until death, resignation, retirement, removal or
       disqualification, or until a successor is appointed.

     By unanimous vote, the Change of Jakarta PMC chair was approved.

    E. Establish SpamAssassin PMC

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it to be in the best
       interests of the Foundation and consistent with the
       Foundation's purpose to establish a Project Management
       Committee charged with the creation and maintenance of
       open-source software related to identifying unsolicited email,
       for distribution at no charge to the public.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a Project Management
       Committee (PMC), to be known as the "Apache SpamAssassin PMC",
       be and hereby is established pursuant to Bylaws of the
       Foundation; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the Apache SpamAssassin PMC be and hereby is
       responsible for the creation and maintenance of software
       related to identifying unsolicited email; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the office of "Vice President, Apache
       SpamAssassin" be and hereby is created, the person holding such
       office to serve at the direction of the Board of Directors as
       the chair of the Apache SpamAssassin PMC, and to have primary
       responsibility for management of the projects within the scope
       of responsibility of the Apache SpamAssassin PMC; and be it
       further

       RESOLVED, that the persons listed immediately below be and
       hereby are appointed to serve as the initial members of the
       Apache SpamAssassin PMC:

         Theo van Dinter <felicity@apache.org>
         Duncan Findlay <duncf@apache.org>
         Justin Mason <jm@apache.org>
         Daniel Quinlan <quinlan@apache.org>
         Malte S. Stretz <mss@apache.org>

       and hereby is appointed to the office of Vice President, Apache

       hereby is tasked with the creation of a set of bylaws intended
       to encourage open development and increased participation in
       the Apache SpamAssassin Project.


     Stefano noted that the list of the PMC was small.  Concerned about size,
     and Greg concerned that there are no members participating.  General
     question was about the diversity of the community.  Sander noted that
     they were conservative about granting new committer access.  It was 
     noted that incubation went well for them, and the the holdups had to 
     do with trademark issues.

     Greg reported that trademark issues were cleared up - that documents
     are in process or already filed with the USPTO.  The trademarks were
     transferred from Network Associates, and it was noted that Network
     Associates retains a license to use them.  We are working to get 
     copies of the transfer documentation so we have the agreement here on
     file.

     Sander will continue to monitor the project.

     By unanimous vote, the creation of the SpamAssassin PMC was approved.


    F. Change of Cocoon PMC Chair

       As Steven Noels resigned from the Cocoon PMC chair, that PMC has
       voted to propose Sylvain Wallez as the new Cocoon PMC chair. We
       therefore offer the following resolution for board approval :

       WHEREAS, the membership of the Apache Cocoon Project Management
       Committee (PMC) have nominated Sylvain Wallez to serve as
       chairman of the Apache Cocoon PMC; and

       WHEREAS, the previously appointed chairman of the Apache Cocoon
       PMC, Steven Noels, has resigned his position as Vice President,
       Apache Cocoon, in favor of Sylvain Wallez's appointment to that
       position.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Sylvain Wallez be and
       hereby is appointed to the office of Vice President, Apache
       Cocoon, to serve in accordance with and subject to the
       direction of the Board of Directors and the Bylaws of the
       Foundation until death, resignation, retirement, removal or
       disqualification, or until a successor is appointed.

      By unanimous vote, the Change of Cocoon PMC chair was approved.

    G. Establish the Apache XMLBeans PMC

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it to be in the best
       interests of the Foundation and consistent with the
       Foundation's purpose to establish a Project Management
       Committee charged with the creation and maintenance of
       open-source software related to XML-Java binding based on full
       XML Schema support and full XML Infoset fidelity, for
       distribution at no charge to the public.

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a Project Management
       Committee (PMC), to be known as the "Apache XMLBeans PMC", be
       and hereby is established pursuant to Bylaws of the Foundation;
       and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the Apache XMLBeans PMC be and hereby is

       related to XML-Java binding based on full XML Schema support
       and full XML Infoset fidelity, based on software licensed to
       the Foundation; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the office of "Vice President, XMLBeans" be and
       hereby is created, the person holding such office to serve at
       the direction of the Board of Directors as the chair of the
       Apache XMLBeans PMC, and to have primary responsibility for
       management of the projects within the scope of responsibility
       of the Apache XMLBeans PMC; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that the persons listed immediately below be and
       hereby are appointed to serve as the initial members of the
       Apache XMLBeans PMC:

         Cliff Schmidt 
         Eric Vasilik

         Ken Kress
         Cezar Andrei

       RESOLVED, that all responsibility pertaining to the Incubator
       XMLBeans sub-project and encumbered upon the Apache Incubator
       PMC is hereafter discharged.


     There was concern noted about the makeup of the community, that 
     there was an overrepresentation of BEA on the PMC.  Sam noted
     with general agreement that with Ted and Dims on the PMC, we can 
     be assured that any problems will be dealt with or escalated to
     the board.

     Without further discussion, the Creationg of the XMLBeans PMC
     was approved through unanimous vote. 

   
 6. Discussion Items


    Consideration of discussion items was tabled until after committee
    reports were reviewed.

    Discussion returned after Committee Reports at 12:04 PDT
  
    A. Status of formal response to JBoss

    Greg will have response reviewed by Robin, and Geir will continue
    to augment URLs with contents of URLs in the document.  Sam and
    Geir are in favor of publicly posting the document once
    reply is sent.

    B. Status of TCK J2EE license

    Geir continues to work with Sun.  Plan is to post on Sunday on
    Geronimo site the existing NOTICE if not resolved with Sun (or
    the new NOTICE if resolved.)   If not resolved, Sam has requested
    that a note to some effect indicating ASFs problems with the NOTICE,
    and one or more examples of our proposed solutions.

    Geir has requested a status review before doing that in the event 
    that progress is being made.  Will follow up with email on board 
    list at the time if appropriate.

    C. Should we pursue Directors and Officer's Insurance?

    Greg noted that historically, the opinion was that it wasn't worth
    it.  Sam asked that the issue be revisited.  Plan is to do 
    independent research to find out what other non-profits do,
    figure out a order-of-magnitude cost, and revisit the issue 
    in the June meeting.

 7. Committee Reports

       There were concerns about legal issues surrounding Rhino and 
       the resulting effects on the project, such as a committer
       quitting (Christopher Oliver).  

      Stefano noted that the current path is away from the problem
      as they are dropping further work w/ Javascript and will 
      only support for backwards compatibility, and be distributing
      an MPL-ed distro to support that.

      Leny was discussed, and Stefano suggested that it be a TLP
      to remove any political friction between it and the Cocoon 
      PMC in the event it wants to support other technologies in
      the future.

    
    C. Apache HTTP Server Project [Sander Striker]
       (tabled May, 2004 report)

       See Attachment C

ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Ant Project

Releases:

Ant 1.6.1 has been released addressing the few major bugs reported in Ant
1.6. The release has generated very few bug reports to date and has been
well received.

There has been recent discussion on Ant 1.7 features. As the 1.6.1 release
is proving very stable, there should be a reasonable development period for
1.7 to look at the usage and improvement of the new 1.6 features such as
<import>, antlibs, etc.

Community:

The community is healthy and there is no discord to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

Cocoon
------

- Steven Noels has indicated his intention to step down from PMC chair.
Bertrand was nominated but indicated his lack of continous time in the next
few months. Nominations are still undergoing.

- Cocoon 2.1.5 was released May 25, 2004. Mostly a bugfix release (a problem
with the persistency of cached object was found and corrected) and further
migration of the Woody form framework to the Cocoon Forms framework.

- Pier Fumagalli reported the migration of VNUnet.com (one of the most
important news sites) to a cocoon-based site in 3 weeks. Given the size
and load of that site, Pier is also finding (and correcting) several
misbehaviors in the core parts of the component handling system.

- The community sent congrats to the three new elected ASF members David,
Bertrand and Gianugo and to the new ASF director Stefano.

- Wiki spamming is becoming a serious problem. We are considering blocking
public write access to the wiki as a result. Also, we would like to move
the wiki from cocooondev.org to the ASF-hosted wiki farm and operation
is undergoing. Given the popularity of ASF's websites, we wonder how the
Infrastructure team plans to handle Wiki spamming on the MoinMoin installation.

- On the social side, Christopher Oliver has decided to friendly quit the
project due to the legal friction generated by his patches to Rhino. No
flames were generated, even if this leaves us with a core piece of the cocoon
architecture as a non-official fork, basically with nobody maintaining it,
licensed under the MPL and hosted on a non-apache site (cocoondev.org).

Talks have been started with the Mozilla folks to relicense Rhino under an
ASF-redistribution-friendly license, and while there seems to be a genuine
willingness from their side, the administrative burden has been shifted back
to us, the energy contributed towards this effort is minimal, and we should
be careful not to let this become a permanent issue.

Lenya
-----

The Apache Lenya project has been busy the last few months to get the 1.2
release out. The project saw an increase in mailing list traffic for both the
user and developer lists; the number of sites deploying Lenya is growing. Dale
Christ was voted in as a new commiter, while Thorsten Scherler became an active
commiter again. A public demo site [1] turned out to be a useful resource for
users to try out Lenya and for developers to quickly confirm bug reports. A
Sprint [2] brought developers together for 2 days in Zurich to work on Repository
Integration. The sprint was very productive and will be repeated in the future.

The notion of translating the Lenya documentation came up, while a non-english
mailing list proposal was rejected over fracturing concerns.

Attachment C: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project

Basically nothing of significance to report to the Board from
the HTTP Server project for last quarter.  No legal issues,
no quarrels, few releases.

There have been the following releases:
 - apache-1.3.31
 - httpd-2.0.49
 - mod_python 3.1.3
 - Apache-Test 1.08, 1.09, 1.10 and 1.11

The documentation end is busy as always, as is httpd-test.

We've gained a few committers during last period as well as
expanded the PMC.

There has been some discussion on moving the code from CVS
to SVN; apache 1.3 is the first codebase to move over.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache Logging Project

* The log4j team is working feverishly towards an alpha release for
version 1.3 which will incorporate a large set of new features. We are
also working with projects dependent on log4j, such as
commons-logging, to ensure backward compatibility.

* Log4j's Chainsaw tool is now accessible via Java Web Start.  The
Logging Services PMC is committed to exploring and evaluating new
ideas for enhancing functionality and productivity of System
Administrators / Monitors.

* The log4cxx prokect updated its licence to Apache 2.0. It released
version 0.9.7, it's first version under the Apache Logging Services
umbrella.

* Log4net now supports building under the Mono Beta 1 runtime.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Perl Project

-- Releases --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

Nothing much happening on that track.  No new mod_perl 1.x releases
since the last report.

---

The mod_perl 1.99 series is a development track designed to become
mod_perl 2.0; it works with httpd 2.0.x.

Recent releases:

  1.99_13 - Mar 08, 2004

---

Apache::Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications.

Recent releases:

  1.10 - April 18, 2004
  1.09 - March 8, 2004
  1.08 - February 24, 2004


-- Development --

Development on mod_perl 2.0 and Apache::Test is moving at a healthy
pace. Now working on polishing the API so we can get ready for the 2.0
release hopefully somewhere in summer.

-- Users --

As always the mod_perl users list is thriving. Though usage is
declining a bit recently, with 1.5M or 4.8M sites depending on which
survey you look at.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache XML Project

General Comments

A fairly quiet quarter on the overall project front, although good
activity within most of the sub-projects. Much effort has gone into
discussion around the Federation proposal, and this is where the PMC
has been concentrating its efforts.

The project has voted in a new sub-project - JuiCE?. This is a JCE
provider based on OpenSSL? with an initial code-base donated by
Internet2. It is ramping up in the Incubator, although sorting out
CLAs for the initial committers has taken longer than expected. As we
transition to a Federated model, it is likely that this will move with
the XML-Security project - possibly into a security or crypto related
TLP.

XMLBeans is also getting closer to release from Incubator, and is
currently working through how to ensure a balanced committer
group. Again, the Federation issue has caused some discussion around
whether XMLBeans will come out of the incubator as a TLP within the
XML Federation, or as a sub-project to start with.

PMC

The PMC has been focussed on executing the Federation proposal. Four
proposals are currently being concentrated on :

    * Xerces: There has been much discussion around how the language
      based parser implementations would come together in the overall
      project, and how other "sub-projects" might work in with
      them. This is not so much a discussion of whether or not it
      should be done as a discussion around how the mechanics will
      work.
    * AxKit: The AxKit team have done a lot of work detailing out an
      operating model for a new TLP. The team seems comfortable with
      the idea of a move, so I am hopeful we may have a resolution to
      put before the board at the next meeting. 
    * XML Graphics: Batik and FOP are looking to create a consolodated
      PMC. Batik has been very quiet lately (all committers otherwise
      engaged), which has lead to discussions as to whether or not to
      just go with FOP in the intial move.
    * Xalan: This started up using the same model as Xerces. Fairly
      much on hold whilst we work through the issues with Xerces.

Much of the effort with all of these has been around ensuring people
are very clear about what this means and why it is being done. Most of
the sub-projects are fairly comfortable with the way things work today
and need to be comfortable that we are not causing them unnecessary
overheads by heading down this path.

My feeling has been that it is important to take as much time as it
needs to ensure everyone is comfortable with what is going on, so I've
not been trying to push people into moving fast.

Issues needing attention:

The JuiCE? effort needs to put a submission to BIS for exporting
cryptographic code. We also need to make a submission to Sun
requesting a code signing certificate (to enable the crypto in the
provider in later JDKs). This will require a statement from the ASF
indicating that we understand we are bound by the US export
laws. Given we do understand this, the PMC chair will be signing on
behalf of the ASF.

Axkit

Work continues toward a 1.7 release:

    * Optimized Provider class interfaces to reduce redundant
      processing during style extraction phase.
    * Fixed bug that resulted in undesireable redirection for certain
      URLs when the AxHandleDirs? option is set to On.
    * Accepted for review 2 user-submitted patches to extend the
      directory listing interface to allow for greater flexibility
      (richer metadata).
    * Additional smaller bug fixes/general code clean-up. 

Much discussion surrounding AxKit's potential migration to a Top-Level
Project resulted in a consensus for a proposed Mission Statement and
Project Guidelines. Details here:
http://axkit.org/wiki/view/AxKit/TLPGuidelineProposal

More informally, the AxKit development team and larger users community
was excited to hear that one of our users, running modest hardware and
the latest version of AxKit, was able to cope with the load associated
with a good old fashioned Slashdotting without dropping a single
request.

Batik

Some discussion has started on moving Batik to the XML Graphics Top
Level Project.

Commons

There were no official releases in the Commons project recently. We
have had some volunteers from Xalan helping out to migrate to the 2.0
license and fixing up some documentation. Note that if most XML
projects decide to move to their own PMCs that Commons will need to be
careful to either get enough attention from the PMC or should move to
the Xalan PMC (since Xalan re-ships most of the 'common' code here).

FOP

2 new committers: Clay Leeds and Simon Pepping.

Still working slowly towards a 1.0 developer release with no date in
sight, however. Changed to Apache Licence 2.0 for CVS HEAD and
alt-design branch, the maintenance branch is frozen and hasn't been
upgraded.

Forrest

We continue to make solid steps towards the 0.6 release:

    * Changed to Apache License 2.0 in source files and commenced
      investigation of the distributed libaries.
    * Lots of work has been done to eliminate the copying of resources
      during build time
    * Forrestbot2 nearly ready for general use
    * Build system refactorings
    * Working on a more maintainable skin configuration system
    * Commenced discsussion (i.e. at internal Proposal stage) about
      Forrest becoming a top-level project

Xalan-C++

Xalan-C++ 1.8 was released on May 3, 2004.

Xalan-C++ version 1.8 is an implementation of the W3C Recommendations
for XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0 and the XML Path Language
(XPath) Version 1.0. It was tested for compatibility with the
Xerces-C++ XML parser version 2.5.0.

The release included:

    * Upgrade from Xerces-C 2.4 to Xerces-C 2.5
    * Build support for the new platforms Cygwin, HP-UX 11.00 on Itanium
    * Project files for supporting Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
    * Additional changes to the Xerces Deprecated DOM support. This is
      another step towards phasing out the support for Xerces Deprecated
      DOM. Users are encouraged to modify their applications to interface
      with the new Xerces DOM support. For more information on the effects
      of these changes to your build environment, see
      http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c/readme.html#xercesdepdom 
    * Implemented optimizations to significantly improve the
      throughput of the ICU-enabled "format-number" function.
    * Changes in the XML Serializer, the serializer will no longer put
      a newline after the xml header tag unless indent="yes". See
      bugzilla 24304 and 28386. 
    * Apache 2.0 License updates
    * Bug fixes 

Details are at http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c/readme.html.

A new committer, Dmitry Hayes, was nominated and voted in as a
committer on Xalan-C++ on February 19, 2004.

Xalan-J/XSLTC

Xalan-J 2.6.0 was released in February 29, 2004 (yes the 29-th). It
was tested for compatibility with the Xerces-Java XML parser version
2.6.2 which is packaged in the distribution.

The release included:

    * The usual bug fixes
    * Improvement in translet initialization time
    * Addition of a translet versioning mechanism
    * Changes that allow XSLTC to use other DTM implementations
    * Changes in the XML Serializer, the serializer will no longer put
      a newline after the xml header tag unless indent="yes". See
      bugzilla 24304.
    * Addition of a TransformThread? sample that demonstrates how to
      use different transformers on different threads and in different
      modes.
    * Upgrade to Xerces-Java 2.6.2
    * Elimination of "enum" as a name to allow compilation under JDK 1.5
    * Upgrade to the Apache Software License Version 2.0 (some License
      clean up is continuing)

Two new committers have joined, Sarah McNamara?, and Joanne Tong who
were nominated and voted in as committers on Xalan-Java in late
February, and early March of 2004.

Xerces-C++

We released Xerces-C 2.5.0 on 16th February. This was primarily a bug
fix release, but as binary compatibility was not maintained a major
version number was used. We have switched over to using JIRA for issue
tracking and all bugs have been moved across from Bugzilla. We have
not yet migrated to the Apache 2.0 license; that is planned well in
advance of the next release. Xerces-C 2.6.0 will be out in the late
summer / early autumn.

Extensive discussion has been occuring over how Xerces would operate
as a top level project.

Xerces-J

On February 20th, we released Xerces-J 2.6.2. As well as containing a
few performance improvements and several minor bug fixes, this release
fixes several bugs which a number of users encountered with version
2.6.1. Soon after this release we successfully completed migration to
the Apache 2.0 license.

Recently the committers decided that we would adopt JIRA for issue
tracking. Existing bug reports from Bugzilla have been migrated to
JIRA. The next Xerces-J release, 2.7.0, is planned in the near
future. Development items include the latest versions of SAX, DOM
Level 3, JAXP and XInclude.

In the last month or so, the committers in all the Xerces-*
communities have been discussing the possibility of converting Xerces
to a top-level project. We're hoping to have a resolution to present
to the Board by the next meeting; the consensus so far has been that
this is a good idea, though there are still some details with respect
to organization that need to be worked out.

Xerces-P

Nothing to report for this period. No decision has been made on any
level wheter Xerces-P should be made a sub-project of Xerces-C.

Xindice

    * Changed to Apache License 2.0
    * Obtained software grant for Xindice Eclipse plugin (currently in Attic)
    * Released Xindice 1.1b4 

XML-Security

Released 1.1 of both the C++ and Java libraries. In both cases, the
major advance has been an implementation of the W3C's XML Encryption
standard.

A large amount of performance work has been done by Raul Benito.

Finally, we voted in a new committer (Vishal Mahajan).

-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Fund-Raising Committe

The last quarter saw the donation of a sizeable amount of new
hardware: 4 servers "loaned indefinitely" to us from IBM, spearheaded
by Sam Ruby.  HP donated a server in Europe by means of Gianugo
Rabellino, and Cliff Skolnick donated of a server to be setup by Ben
Laurie in the U.K as a CA.

The placement of Jinx's link and logo is still under discussion, with
efforts being made to improve communication on both sides.

Susan Wu has joined the committee on the press side and has already
sent out one press release, with a plan for regular releases in the
future.

This will be the last board report for the fund-raising committee as
there has been a proposal to merge fund-raising and press activities
under a Public Relations committee.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

-PMC Actions-

* Niall Pemberton is elected as a Struts Committer.

* Two new subprojects (our first) are approved. One that utilizes BSF
  so that "Actions" can be scripted rather than expressed as Java
  code. Another is a port of Cocoon's Control Flow to
  Struts. Infrastructure details are being addressed. The initial code
  for both projects were developed by a Struts PMC member, Don Brown,
  who is filing a code grant to the ASF. Both codebases are ready for
  release testing.

-Significant threads-

* Compiling Struts from source and running the Cactus tests continues
  to be a challenge for some developers. Completing the move to Maven
  should help.

-Releases-

* Stable release: 1.1 (29 June 2003).

* Next anticipated release: 1.2.1

* Anticipated time-frame (if any): Awaiting stable release of a
  dependency (Commons Validator).

-Roadmap-

* Struts 1.x will remain based on Servlet 1.2/JSP 1.1 (evolution).

* Struts 1.3.x will introduce the "Struts Chain" request
  processor. Some packages, like the taglibs, will be released as
  separate subprojects.

* Struts 2.x will be based on Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 (revolution).

* The Apache Struts repository will be rationalized to accomodate
  subprojects and Maven once a stable Struts 1.2.x release is available.
  Subprojects will be the unit of release. Each subproject will be a
  distinct Maven "artifact". Pending this step, the website and
  repository remain under jakarta.apache.org.

* For more see <http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/status.html>.

-Mailing list Subscriptions-

* User 1851
* User digest: 874
* Dev: 713
* PMC: 14

-Wiki Posts-

* 103 new posts; 175 total (since Apr 8)

-CVS Activity-

* Timeframe: 38 days, Total Commits: 25 Total Number of Files Changed: 57.

-Showstoppers-

* A stable 1.1.3 release of the Commons Validator.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache Avalon Project

While Avalon isn't on the list of projects to report, I wanted to at
least give a small status report in light of some of the recent
proposals sent from this direction.  Current status:

1. Excalibur TLP Proposal.
   This was submitted to the board last week by Leo Simons.  The
   proposal has the full support of the Avalon PMC.  The new project
   would take control of the Excalibur and Fortress codebases from
   Avalon.

2. Merlin TLP Proposal.
   WITHDRAWN.  At the same time of the Excalibur TLP proposal, there
   was a Merlin TLP proposal from Avalon.  This proposal has been
   withdrawn by the Merlin team and Avalon PMC.

3. Avalon status in general.
   Avalon will continue to support the core Avalon framework and the
   Merlin container as the "reference implementation" of Avalon.
   The Phoenix codebase has been moved into SVN along with the rest of
   Avalon but remains fairly inactive.  Any other for significant
   changes in Avalon (ie: an Avalon "federation" project, etc.) have
   been dropped for the time being.

It was mentioned before that Avalon needed a bit of a "kick" to get
things back into order again.  Well, there's been plenty of kicking and
I hope that with the Excalibur TLP we'll start seeing even more positive
results.

I'd also like to thank the board for your advice and patience while
we've dealt with these proposals and matters.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache APR Project

The APR project has several new committers this quarter, which
we hope is helping to alleviate the "falling-through-the-cracks"
problems we reported last quarter.

Work continues on test suite improvements, and David Reid has
been helpful in pushing through toward a 1.0 release candidate.

No new-subprojects or new problems to report.  The biggest
remaining hurdle is still the "it has to be perfect" syndrome,
which we are attempting to actively combat.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Avalon Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache Commons Project

Let this space be blank, because there's nothing of interest to report.

(Make of that what you will.  I brought up my concerns before to the board last
time, which caused yet another pointless thread that I don't care to rehash
again because it produced nothing fruitful then and unlikely to do so now.)

-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Excalibur Project

Excalibur got off to a silent start! With Greg's message not making it to the
committers mailing list at first, a few days went by inactively. It then took
us and infrastructure the better part of two weeks to get all the neccessary
infrastructure in place. Then it took some more time to get everyone on the
mailing lists and set up using svn (which is new for most excalibur
developers). Infrastructure bits that have been set up now include:

 * user accounts, unix group
 * svn
 * website, dns
 * mailing lists
 * jira
 * wiki

Development of excalibur (which had come to a near full-stop as part
of avalon) is now slowly recommencing. Long-awaited bug fixes and
feature additions are slowly drippling in. Discussion is just starting
on the medium-term and long-term goals surrounding our codebase
(besides the obvious goal of maintainance of the existing, mature
code). Some of our committers haven't been active together for a long
time, so high anticipation and enthusiasm are coupled with careful
re-acquaintance.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Gump Project

We've been very happy playing with the new machine and brutus has been
turned into the "official" Gump instance, i.e. the one that is sending
nightly nag mails when things go wrong and that people use as
reference.  Many thanks to Sam Ruby and Leo Simons who provided
personal infrastructure for this purpose in the past.

The speed of Brutus combined with a new way to generate the website
dynamically allows us to run Gump more than once per day and has
already led to some new uses, like sending out "good news nags" when
things are no longer broken. Notifications are also now sent "when
first detected" (as well as on the nightly 'official' run) which can
dramatically shorten the detection/discussion/resolution cycle.

Gump has assisted in detecting a number of issues, including a big one
with log4j deprecation which raised excellent discussion and awareness
on Apache's and "good" deprecation/release policies. More information
is available on Gump's Blog[1].

Gump has started to successfully build its first live project using
Maven, we hope to extend this success to Geronimo soon. The main
integration issue is that of 'artefact id' (how a collection of code
is identified). This is good practical community work; a precursor to
an (automated/shared) Apache Repository[2].

Gump is starting to see more 'personal Gumps', as folks install Gump
for their own private (and public) projects.

          but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you
          are personally aware and which are associated with any part of
          Your Contributions.

       6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
          except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
          support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
          applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
          Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
          OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
          limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
          MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

       7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
          You may submit it to the Foundation separately from any
          Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and
          of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited
          to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which
          you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
          "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

       8. You agree to notify the Foundation of any facts or circumstances
          of which you become aware that would make these representations
          inaccurate in any respect.

Attachment U: Corporate Contributor License Agreement

                          The Apache Software Foundation
                   Corporate Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement")
                          http://www.apache.org/licenses/


       Thank you for your interest in The Apache Software Foundation (the
       "Foundation"). In order to clarify the intellectual property license
       granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Foundation
       must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been
       signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms
       below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well
       as the protection of the Foundation and its users; it does not change
       your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

       This version of the Agreement allows an entity (the "Corporation") to
       authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to the
       Foundation and to grant copyright and patent licenses thereto.

       If you have not already done so, please complete and send an original
       signed Agreement to The Apache Software Foundation, 1901 Munsey Drive,
       Forest Hill, MD 21050-2747, U.S.A. If necessary, you may send it by
       facsimile to the Foundation at +1-410-803-2258. Please read this
       document carefully before signing and keep a copy for your records.

       You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
       present and future Contributions submitted to the Foundation. In
       return, the Foundation shall not use Your Contributions in a way that
       is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit
       status and bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except
       for the license granted herein to the Foundation and recipients of
       software distributed by the Foundation, You reserve all right, title,
       and interest in and to Your Contributions.

       1. Definitions.

          "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
          authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
          with the Foundation. For legal entities, the entity making a
          Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by,
          or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a
          single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control"
          means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
          management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or
          (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding
          shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

          "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including
          any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
          submitted by You to the Foundation for inclusion in, or
          documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the
          Foundation (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
          "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
          communication sent to the Foundation or its representatives,
          including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
          lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems
          that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Foundation for the
          purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
          communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated
          in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
          of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Foundation and to
          recipients of software distributed by the Foundation a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
          Your Contributions and such derivative works.

       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Foundation and to recipients
          of software distributed by the Foundation a perpetual, worldwide,
          non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
          stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
          offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s)
          alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to
          which such Contribution(s) were submitted. If any entity institutes
          patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your
          Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes
          direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or
          Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

       4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
          license. You represent further that each employee of the
          Corporation designated on Schedule A below (or in a subsequent
          written modification to that Schedule) is authorized to submit
          Contributions to the designated Work(s)on behalf
          of the Corporation.

       5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
          creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

       6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
          except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
          support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
          applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
          Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
          OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
          limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
          MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

       7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
          You may submit it to the Foundation separately from any
          Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and
          of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited
          to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which
          you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
          "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

       8. It is your responsibility to notify the Foundation when any change
          is required to the list of designated employees authorized to submit
          Contributions on behalf of the Corporation, or to the Corporation's
          Point of Contact with the Foundation.
