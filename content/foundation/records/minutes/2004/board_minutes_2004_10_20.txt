 4. Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Greg]

       The ASF appears to be moving along, producing code and
       resolving other issues, as we would hope and expect.

    B. President [Dirk]

       Dirk reported that the ASF also appears to be moving
       along quite well.  Infrastructure support still can
       be a bottleneck, but issues are being resolved.

    C. Treasurer [Chuck]

        Chuck reported that following account balances:

           Business Account:   $93,750.94
           Checking Account:   $ 5,500.00
           PayPal Account:     $ 1,255.51

        Chuck also reported that the ASF taxes were in the process
        of being completed and submitted, after requesting and
        receiving a submission extension.
 
    D. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]

       We continue to get a few CLAs occasionally. Sometimes
       we receive unreadable ones, which is a pain.

       We received a letter from "Car Program, LLC," the company
       handling car donations for the ASF.  We have met the
       requirements for the "optional listing" on their
       website www.donateacar.com, and should be active
       November 2004.  If we decide we do not want to be listed
       on the site, we need to let them know.  I will forward
       this info to the Fund Raising Committee.

    C. Establish the Date and Time for the ASF Member's Meeting

       Jim proposes a time-slot of November 14th, 4:30pm
       (Las Vegas time) @ the Alexis Park for the Annual ASF
       Members Meeting. This has been confirmed as available.

       The proposed date and time were approved by the board. Therefore,
       the ASF Board has schedule an ASF Special Member's Meeting for
       November 14th, 2004 at 4:30pm (Las Vegas local time).  Jim
       will send out such notice and reminders of new-member
       nominations and proxy requests to the members list.

    D. Affirm Intent to Own Copyright to all ASF Distributions

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it to be in the best
       interests of the Foundation and consistent with the
       Foundation's purpose that the Foundation receives assignment 
       of copyright of all contributions to the Foundation

       NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors does
       affirm that ownership of copyright by the ASF is in the best interest of 
       the Foundation, and will work to create documentation  and agreements
       for contributors to the ASF incorporating this basic principle.

       The above resolution created some discussion, not on the
       basic principles, but on how it would affect the current
       impact on new and proposed projects. In particular, such basic
       questions as whether this meant that any and all
       new projects would have to be "delayed for inclusion" until
       the legal ramifications of owning copyright and how it
       affects the current codebase of all ASF projects.  A vote
       was held on whether the ASF should, for the short time being,
       continue "business as usual" regarding the form and wording
       of the ASF Copyright statement as well as accepting new
       projects, codebases and contributions, until such time that
       these questions are answered to satisfaction.  A vote of Yea
       was for continuing "business as usual;" Nay was for holding
       off until the questions have been answered.
       
           Yea: Brian, Dirk, Jim, Stefano, Sander
           Nay: Ken, Geir

       By majority vote, the issue passed.  It should be noted that
       all directors agreed very strongly that the copyright issue
       is extremely important and a high priority issue to be
       resolved.  It is expected that discussion will be held via
       the mailing lists regarding this in anticipation of a final
       resolution in time for the November board meeting.

    E. Appoint Brian W. Fitzpatrick as a Vice President of the PRC

       WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it to be in the best
       interests of the Foundation and consistent with the
       Foundation's purpose to establish the office of "Vice
       President, Public Relations;" and be it further 

       RESOLVED, that the office of "Vice President, Public Relations"
       be and hereby is created, the person holding such office to
       serve at the direction of the Board of Directors as the chair
       of the Apache Public Relations Committee, and to have primary
       responsibility for management of public relations, press, and
       fundraising activites within the scope of responsibility of the
       Public Relations Committee; and be it further

       RESOLVED, that Brian W. Fitzpatrick be and hereby is appointed
       to the office of Vice President, Public Relations, to serve in
       accordance with and subject to the direction of the Board of
       Directors and the Bylaws of the Foundation until death,
       resignation, retirement, removal or disqualification, or until
       a successor is appointed.

       RESOLUTION 5E, Appoint Brian W. Fitzpatrick as a Vice President
       of the PRC, was APPROVED by Unanimous Vote.

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache DB Project

The DB project continues with its primary task of oversight of the OJB
and Torque subprojects.  The mailing lists for both projects remain
active and with no conflict to note.  OJB released a 1.0.1 maintenance
release and continues work towards a 1.0.2 release as well as a 1.1
release.  Torque has tagged a couple release candidates this quarter,
but the 3.1.1 release will likely fall into the first week of next
quarter.

The PMC recently voted for the nomination of Henning P. Schmiedehausen
to serve on the PMC and is awaiting acceptance prior to official
notification.  The PMC also voted to update its bylaws.  The changes
were primarily to clarify the status quo.  I'll finish the report with
the resulting text:

Project Management Committee Bylaws

The Project Management Committee (PMC) was formed by the Apache Board
on 17 July 2002.  The bylaws were last amended on 7 October
2004. There is no preset number of seats on the PMC.  The PMC will
strive to add every committer within DB that, in the opinion of the
PMC as determined by a vote, displays the capability and desire to
help guide the DB project.  The PMC will present the board with a
recommendation of a chairperson from amongst their ranks.  The list of
current members can be found in our <a href="./whoweare.html"> Project
Credits</a>.

Roles

The PMC is responsible for the strategic direction and success of the
DB Project. This governing body is expected to ensure the project's
welfare and guide its overall direction. The PMC may not necessarily
participate in the day-to-day coding but is involved in the overall
development plans, the alleviation of any bottlenecks, the resolution
of conflicts, and the overall technical success of the project.

The PMC is responsible for any and all official releases by any part
of the DB project.  Implicit approval by the PMC for a release can be
assumed if at least three committers voting for the release also serve
on the PMC and there are no negative votes.  Explicit approval by vote
on the PMC mailing list is required prior to the release, if the
preceeding conditions are not met.  The PMC must be notified of all
releases.

The PMC is answerable to the Apache Board with its Chairman serving as
primary liaison.

Meetings

The PMC discusses issues and determines strategic direction via mail
list.  Discussions and votes specific to a particular codebase
associated with a subproject generally occur on subproject dev lists.
All binding votes happen on the PMC list except release votes can
occur on the subproject dev list with a summary of results posted to
the PMC list.

Voting

The call for a vote on issues not detailed here may specify
requirements for passage. The minimum and default requirement for a
passing vote is simple majority of PMC members casting ballots.  The
default voting period is 10 days and the minimum is 7 days unless the
success or failure is arithmetically known.

Membership

PMC members may resign at any time. A committer will remain on the DB
PMC until removed by desire of the committer, action of the board, or
vote by the PMC.  The Chairman may resign as Chairman at any time
without resigning membership to the PMC. The chairperson will serve
until voluntary resignation, action of the board, or vote by the PMC.
The Chairman or any member may be removed from the PMC by a 3/4 vote
of the PMC.

In order to be elected to the PMC, a person must have served as a <a
href="roles.html">Committer</a> and be nominated by a PMC Member. The
nominee must receive 3/4 positive vote with a minimum of 3 positive
votes.  Abstaining or non-participating PMC voters do not affect the
result.

Creation of Subprojects

PMC members may propose the creation of new subprojects. Creation of a
new subproject requires approval by 3/4 positve vote with a minimum of
3 positive votes of the PMC.  Abstaining PMC voters do not affect the
result.  New code enters the DB project in accordance with ASF policy.

(End of bylaws text)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Geronimo Project

The Geronimo community is returning to healthy activity after
a brief slowdown during the summer.  I attribute the slowdown
due to summer doldrums, and that a few major contributors 
found gainful employment during the summer and were focused 
on the new jobs.

The project released milestone release M2, considered by the 
projects as a 'technology refresh' for the larger community.  
This release included :
- many bugfixes
- EAR deployment support (major feature)
- simplified deployment
- MDB support
- JACC support
- EJB 2.1 timers
- hot deployment of WARs and RARs

The big news is that the TCK work is now going formally, with 
steady progress being made.  We have established a private 
email list and private SVN repository accessible to those that 
have signed the NDA.  Progress on the TCK testing is going well.  
We have completed major sections of testing, and working on 
continuing development of the pieces that are missing, as well 
as fixing bugs in the code that is there.

Another bright spot is that we've been successful in working 
with the Apache Tomcat community in bringing basic Tomcat support 
to Geronimo.  We are working to increase the integration to let 
users of Geronimo + Tomcat take advantage of all the deployment 
and management features of Geronimo.

On the community front, while we have no new committers, the 
new activity is bringing both new people, and thus we are 
starting to identify new candidates, as well as bringing back 
older committers that had gone inactive.

We are struggling with the licensing of JavaMail, as we don't 
want to implement this JSR due to the widely held opinion that 
the spec is insufficient for correct implementation, and there 
is no source to reference.  I am [still] working with Sun on 
this.  It appears that a complete fix of the Sun binary license 
won't be possible, so another alternative is being explored.  
Specifically, instead of transferring the RI to the ASF, Sun could 
contribute a copy to help bootstrap a compatible independent 
implementation of the software.  There are difficulties with this 
proposal (hardheaded obstinacy, IMO), but work is still going on.

On the lighter side, I'll note that according to a recent survey 
by The Middleware Company, Geronimo is [amazingly] now more widely 
used in production than Sybase and Borland :)


-----------------------------------------
Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Since the last report to the Board, Lenya has become ready to fly the
nest; and new projects such as Agila, Derby, JackRabbit and iBATIS
have begun Incubation.

Infrastructure bottlenecks continue to effect the Incubator.  I say
this without pointing fingers, since as a member of the Infrastructure
Team, I am one of the people responsible for being or removing those
bottlenecks.  It is simply that we can create a rash of requests for
project resources, and we (the Infrastructure Team) are short-staffed.
One thing that should help will be improved scripts for mailing list
creation.  Hopefully, we will have some time at the Hack-a-thon to
work those tools.

Licensing and other IP related issues were reported as an on-going
topic of discussion in the last report, at which time I mentioned that
it would help to have some legal resource(s) participating with the
Incubator.  IP issues have come up this quarter that make it even more
imperative that we have sufficient legal resources working with the
Incubator, and the ASF in general, to address IP issues.

                           - 0 -

The list of projects in the Incubator is at
http://incubator.apache.org/projects/.
Here are the STATUS reports from the PPMCs that have sent one in.


Status report from the Directory PPMC
======================================

Our last report was posted here:

http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=general@incubator.apache.org&msgNo=3919

Since then we have ...

 o Vetted all IP issues within the project, namely where Snacc4J was
   concerned.  Snickers, the Snacc4J replacement subproject, now
   supports BER and, in a branch maintained by Alan Cabrera, DER as
   well.  Alan Cabrera has been progressing on his ASN.1 compiler but
   for the time being we have hand coded LDAP stubs.  We have also
   integrated the new Snickers based LDAP provider as the default BER
   codec for the ldap-common project.  This is a major step for us on
   the path toward exiting the incubator.

 o We have retrofitted the old LDAPd code base with the newly modified
   ldap-common code along with Snickers.  This primitive precursor to
   Eve now runs as it did while at sourceforge however there are no IP
   issues with this functional server.  Users can now kick the tires
   on an LDAP server that works.  We however see this server as more
   of a demo rather than the real deal which will be Eve.

 o We have also made progress on another major aspect that demonstrates
   the viability of this project: building community.  BTW, all new
   committers have signed and submitted their CLAs which are on file
   and software grants were submitted where appropriate.  We have
   added three new committers to the project of which two are still
   active.

     - Trustin Lee joined us to work on the frontend networking code
       and is making progress adding UDP support to the new SEDA
       subproject.  He will be continuing to work on making Eve's
       front end code serve as a gateway/proxy server to other LDAP
       servers soon.

     - Enrique Rodriguez became a committer as well and is working on
       the new integrated Kerberos server which plugs into Eve for
       network authentication.  He is also persuing the goal of
       writing wrappers for Eve to embed Eve into OSGi containers.

     - Niclas Hedman became a commiter and started work on decoupling
       Eve's backend from Merlin, however some Avalon commitments have
       taken his time.

 o We have begun to pull the backend subsystem out of the sandbox:
   this is almost complete.  A new schema subsystem design has been
   added while making the move.  I have also removed all depenencies
   on Avalon and Merlin while maintaining the wrappers for Merlin.

 o Vincent continues to maintain Janus and is getting into some of the
   LDAP code base while writing unit test cases for them.  Vincent is
   also working on getting all projects rigged into Gump.

 o We added two new subprojects.  The first is called the SEDA
   framework.  It is basically the LDAP frontend networking code with
   all LDAP dependencies removed so it can run any protocol.  In fact
   it can run multiple protocols on the same plumbing.  This is what
   Trustin is working on most of all.  The second subproject is a
   Kerberos server that Enrique and I had been working on just toying
   with from within Eve but it wound up being something very
   attractive so we added it to our project rather than leaving it out
   there.  We don't expect these projects to stay under the directory
   umbrella forever.  We feel this way especially since SEDA can be
   reused anywhere a Java based protocol server is needed and the
   Kerberos server can run in stand alone mode one day.  Until then we
   are comfortable having them here indefinately.

 o On the Naming subproject front, Phil Steitz has integrated Naming
   with Gump.  Phil has been very busy in jakarta-commons working on
   getting an excellent new addition, the commons math project, out
   the door.  Meanwhile he has been supporting inquiries about Naming
   and Jira issues posted on it.

Conclusions and goals ...

[We] are doing really well and are very close to our goals.  Perhaps
before ApacheCon or by the next status report at the latest we should
have all of Eve's parts up and running.  Meanwhile we're growing the
community and getting more comfortable working together to support our
code base.  More people are contacting us about various directory
subprojects than before so ... if we build it they will come.

Status report for Beehive
========================================

Status file is up to date; see
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/public/trunk/site-author/projects/beehive.cwiki,
 or http://incubator.apache.org/projects/beehive.html when site is
regenerated)

Code & Infrastructure
- initial code drop was made in mid-July.  Ongoing development is very
  active.
- over the last three months, we've set up svn, jira, the web site and
  a wiki.
- we're just starting to make more use of jira.
- docs and tutorials have been recently contributed

Legal
- all code shows ASF copyright notice.
- software grant, individual CLAs, and corporate CLAs, are in place
  for all active committers (one initial committer has no account
  while we wait for his employer to complete review of CLA and CCLA)

Community
- Web services metadata subproject has participation from key members
  of Axis community; however, NetUI and Controls subprojects are still
  primarily driven by BEA employees.  We expect this to begin to
  change after getting out an initial release for the community to
  experiment with and digest.  We have several ApacheCon presentations
  that we also hope will invite more non-BEA developers to be actively
  involved.

Release Plans
- The community has decided to cut a pre-1.0 release out for ApacheCon.
  This release will follow the incubation release rules requiring a)
  incubator disclaimer in README and from any download links, b)
  filename to include 'incubating', and c) ppmc vote (providing the
  incubator pmc approval since all interested incubator pmc members
  should be on the beehive ppmc mailing list.
- We've also had a generic release plan proposed and discussed.  Also
  work has started on a roadmap document to make it easier for new
  developers to get the big picture and figure out where they can help.

Status report for MyFaces
========================================

All needed CLAs are on file. A code grant is in transit. Accounts for
the committers have been created. Mailing lists are
created. Committers are subscribed. The Jira setup for the project is
being finalized. The project incubator page is created. Committers are
preparing the SourceForge CVS for import to Apache.

One account's credentials were lost in transit (grantsmith). Request
to root@ to resend the credentials to an alternate address was made
14/Oct/2004.

Status report for iBATIS
========================================

All needed CLAs are on file. Code grants are in transit. Accounts for
the committers are created. Mailing lists are created. Committers are
subscribing. The Jira setup for the project is being finalized. The
project incubator page is created. Committers are preparing the
SourceForge CVS and third-party SVN for import to Apache.

Status report for JackRabbit
========================================

The Jackrabbit project has completed all of the Incubator checklist
items in terms of moving to Apache and getting the IP transfer done.
With the help of Maven, we have a full website set up at

    http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/

with a few link bugs due to the svn/viewcvs integration.  Our big
task from now to graduation is to get the community more involved
in development, planning features, integrating with some of the DB
projects, and scoping out interesting applications to build on top
of the interface.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment D: Status report for the Apache James Project

Mostly quiet quarter.  No releases, nothing particularly exciting
except for watching the Avalon project like a Red Sox fan.

We are planning to import a Java mime parser, add it as a subproject
and incorporate into James at some point.  This is still early on, and
we've run by the incubator checklist.  No issues, but just wanted to
mention it.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Maven Project

o New projects

None.

o New PMC members

None.

o New Committers

Felipe Leme (plugins)
Carlos Sanchez (m1 plugins / m2 core)

o Goings on

Brett is preparing for a 1.0.1 release shortly and a 1.1 release soon
afterward. The 1.1 release will be the first 1.x release to
incorporate code from m2. Post 1.1 maven1 and maven2 will share the
same tools for generating maven's datamodel which is the first step in
the merger of maven2 code back into maven1.

Maven2 development is continuing as per usual and we're shooting for a
first alpha release in late Q1 2004.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

The Struts community has recently released Struts 1.2.4 as the latest
stable version, focused on cleaning up deprecations from previous versions,
refactoring utility classes to improve separability of the core framework
from view tier dependencies, and incorporating the latest Commons libraries
on which we are dependent.

We recently completed a migration of our source code repository from
CVS to Subversion, and are leveraging its capabilities to refactor the
source code into separately releaseable components.  The first such
separate release is likely to be the Struts-Faces integration library
(an adapter between Struts and JavaServer Faces).

The community is busy planning an evolutionary path that focuses on
fundamentally backwards compatible improvements, and a revolutionary
("Struts 2") path that will leverage the industry wide lessons in how
web application frameworks should architected in the four years
since Struts was created.  The discussions are proceeding harmoniously
and productively.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache TCL Project

Not a lot to say here.  All projects are more or less in maintainance
mode for the moment.  Questions on mailing lists are answered
promptly, which indicates that everyone is active and available, but
working on other things.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Conference Planning

ApacheCon 2004 US is less than a month away.  This year we have
more than doubled the number of tutorials being offered, having
them on both Saturday and Sunday.  Unfortunately, the lateness
of publishing the schedule, and some suboptimal tutorial titling,
and who knows what other causes, have resulted in registrations
being disappointingly low.

As of today, there are 245 people registered for the conference.
This includes the speakers, however, and so is misleading.
Historically, there is an uptick in registrations during the
last few weeks before the conference, but I doubt we'll get
many more than 500 delegates, if that.

For keynote speakers, we have Wil Wheaton opening on Monday,
Miguel de Icaza on Tuesday, and Doc Searls closing on Wednesday.
There will also be a Sun keynoter, but, as usual, Sun is quite
delinquent on providing details.

IBM is back as a sponsor, primarily as a result of the Derby
submission and IBM's Data Management Systems' marketing department's
support.  IBM will be sponsoring the Hackathon, and (according to
current plans) an interesting contest challenge.  The fact that
there will be a contest will be broadly announced shortly; the
actual terms of the contest will be announced at the opening plenary,
submission deadline to be Tuesday evening, and prizes to be
awarded during the closing plenary.  The top prize is a maximally
tricked-out latest-model ThinkPad.

The Java Community Process is a sponsor again this year, and in
fact they want to sponsor several thousand dollars' worth of
'scholarships.'

ApacheCon 2005 Europe is tentatively scheduled for 18 July 2005,
in Stuttgart, Germany.

We have received requests from Brasil to bring an ApacheCon event
there (no surprise, this is not new).

Attachment I: Status report for the Security Team


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Avalon Project

In response to the Board's comments and recommendations of 23 Sept
2004:

"The Board hereby requests that the Avalon PMC step up and properly
manage the Avalon framework. Support your existing users of that
framework, including the other projects at the ASF."

The Avalon PMC, in its current condition, is not capable of complying
with this request.  Consequently, the PMC is working with the
Excalibur project to transfer the Avalon framework code and other
Avalon utilities (LogKit and Cornerstone) to Excalibur which has shown
a willingness and capacity to perform such support.

With respect to the Merlin TLP, the proposals have been withdrawn.
The Merlin developers have decided to not further seek TLP status in
the ASF but rather create a fork of Merlin dubbed Metro to be hosted
at DPML.net [1].

Seeing as the development of existing software under Avalon now has or
will soon have new hosts, we recommend to the Board the Avalon project
be closed.  With that in mind, the following points should be noted:

  1. The Apache James project currently uses Avalon Phoenix which has
     not been under active development or support for some time.
     There is a fork of Phoenix at Codehaus.org called Loom.  A
     support solution for James (either hosting Phoenix itself or
     migrating to Loom) should be found before Avalon's closure.

  2. The Metro fork has been announced but is not yet active.  We
     would prefer that Avalon not be closed until the fork is active
     and Merlin users have been notified.

  3. The transfer of code between Avalon and Excalibur has not yet
     taken place, though positive votes on the matter have occurred in
     both projects.

  4. We have not yet determined what site resources if any should
     remain available following Avalon's closure.  An example "closed"
     Avalon site is at http://www.apache.org/~farra/avalon .  We are
     unaware of any policy or precedent we should turn to for this
     decision.

Consequently, we ask the Board give the Avalon PMC until the next
Board meeting (14 November 2004) to handle the points above before
official closure of the project.  At that time, the Avalon project
resources (site, svn repository, mailing lists, wiki, jira, ...) can
be deactivated or made read-only by the infrastructure group.

We appreciate the patience and support of the Board on this matter.
