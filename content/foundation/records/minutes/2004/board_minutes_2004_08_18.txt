       Tabled for next meeting.


 The actual timetable of the meeting did not follow the below
 listing.  In particular, item 6B (regarding Corporate CLAs) was
 actually discussed close to the start of the meeting to accomodate
 Noel's and Jennifer's schedule.  This discussion ran a
 significantly long time, resulting in the numerous "tabling"
 of agenda items.

 
 4. Officer Reports

    A. Chairman [Greg]

       The ASF has been busy over the past month with a number of
       legal issues. We're getting bigger and broader and running into
       more of these issues. Thankfully, many of them are cumulative
       and contribute towards a long-term solution rather than many
       interruptive point-by-point issues.

       We have also spent a good amount of time looking at where we
       want the ASf to go, what kinds of interactions we want to have
       with corporations, and what kind of information flow (or
       limitations) we want to have. The discussion has been very
       good, and is ongoing. An interesting point is that a good
       number of Members have been getting involved in the discussion
       about the broader goals of the ASF.

       The ASF seems to be on a good track although it appears that
       we're bulging a bit at the seams. If we get some better tools,
       then we'll probably be able to scale a bit better, but it is
       certainly interesting to deal with "too big" issues.

    B. President [Dirk]

       No Report.

    C. Infrastructure [Sander]

       The Infrastructure team is battling the same problems as
       reported before.  Infrastructure needs help to get things done.
       The root rotation doens't get filled.  An obvious way out
       is hiring a (parttime) sysadmin; so that the team can focus
       on getting automation tools developed making the job less
       involved.

       That said, Ken Coar offered help in writing mailing list management
       tools.  Also Geir offered to help out with the mailing lists.
       And we are happy to announce that Berin Lautenbach has joined the
       group of roots.

       Hardware wise we gained a switch contributed by Theo van Dinter.
       We are waiting for that to arrive.

       Ajax still doesn't have console access, nor do we have the
       accounts on the power switches to power cycle the box.  SurfNet
       also asked us to work out the reverse DNS on our end, which we
       haven't gotten around to yet.

       DNS is under the Infrastructure's team control again, and we
       are happy to announce that we added to more secondaries, making
       our DNS servers a bit more globally spread.

       A lot of work has been done getting VMware instances up and running
       and this seems to pay off.  Investigation in applicability is ongoing.

       Services hosted on nagoya will be moved off to other boxes, given
       the current (in)stability of some of the services on nagoya.

       eris, one of the new IBM x345s seems to be having some problems.
       Investigation is ongoing.

    D. Treasurer [Chuck]

       No Report.
 
    E. Exec. V.P. and Secretary [Jim]

       The ASF office has been receiving and recording the
       steady stream of incoming CLAs.  At present, the ASF
       office is sharing the same phone number as Jim's home
       office.  The number of calls to that line for ASF-
       related business is starting to increase (the vast
       majority of the calls are completely worthless, of
       course).  To avoid confusion Jim is looking into obtaining
       another phone number exclusively for the ASF.

       Special Order 5 B, Establishment of Apache Metro Project, was
       tabled.

    C. Appoint Brian Fitzpatrick as a Vice President

       Special Order 5 C, Appointment of Brian Fitzpatrick as a Vice
       President, was tabled.  There was discussion on what value
       or additional power this granted to Brian over what he
       currently has.

 6. Discussion Items

    A. Visibility of CLAs

       Desired action: a decision on "how far" visibility reaches.
       Members, officers, committers, and/or the public.

       Discussion Item 6 A, Visibility of CLAs, was tabled.

    B. Corporate CLAs

       It appears that there may be incomplete understanding of what
       the current CCLA requires of the ASF.  It imposes burdens on
       the Foundation that did not apply before.

       Jennifer Machovec, legal council for IBM, was invited to
       participate in a discussion over the current versions of
       the Corporate CLA and recommended changes to it, mostly
       as related to the Derby code donation, as well as to basic
       enhancement and protection.  The revised Corporate CLA
       was to list all employees authorized to contribute code
       as well as the individual projects to which they can
       contribute to.  Jennifer noted that the suggested changes
       provided an "irrevocable donation of code" in any and
       all circumstances, even if the employee had made a
       mistake.

       It was remarked that this would place the ASF under additional
       administrative burdens, monitoring and matching CVS commits
       against the list.  It also tends to move the ASF further and
       further away from the core concept of a "relationship" which
       the ASF has been built on, that of the ASF with regards to
       the individual.  It was remarked that the ASF's "web of trust"
       extends between the ASF and the individual contributor, and,
       at least in the opinion of some directors, that is as far
       as it needs to be.

       It was further discussed that the proposed changes would,
       in the minds of several directors, make the development
       environment with the ASF less healthy and organic, but
       placing restrictions on which projects people could work
       on.  The CLAs were supposed to open the doors for people
       to contribute, rather than close or restrict them.

       Jennifer stated that, in her opinion, this was leaving
       the ASF in a risky position and could leave it open to
       "problems" in the future.  The board's position was that
       taking authority and ownership over controls that should
       really be placed by the individual him/herself or between
       an employee and employer was likely more dangerous and
       risky.  In essence, the ASF works with people who have
       exhibited a high level of trust, and that we can therefore
       trust them to do the right thing.  And if they don't, it
       isn't something that the ASF has monitored or controlled,
       so the impact to us directly is much smaller;  taking on
       those responsibilities opens us up to more risk.

       It was correctly noted that the present Corporate CLA and
       v2 of the Apache License are incompatible.  Jennifer
       stated that she would take our comments under review
       and try to work up another revision.

    C. Derby code drop

       The Derby code is ready to be uploaded to the Apache
       repository, but the legal documents need to be sorted out
       first.  In addition, it appears that an export-control
       form will need to be submitted before the code can be
       published from our site.

       Discussion Item 6 C, Derby code drop, was tabled, mostly
       due to the issues and topics discussed in 6 B.

 8. Unfinished Business

 9. New Business

    It was asked whether the ASF had a corporate seal.  Jim reported
    that he had obtained one when the ASF was initially incorporated
    in 1999 and has it.

    There was some discussion regarding the continued way that
    JBoss is referring to Tomcat.  For example, they are not
    referring to it as Apache Tomcat.  Also, in their descriptions
    they are creating the mistaken impression that they "control"
    or "direct" Apache Tomcat development.  Geir volunteered to
    contact them regarding our concerns.

10. Announcements

    A. Hormel was sent a letter that basically said "thanks for your
       letter." We'll stay in a holding pattern unless/until they do
       something else, or until the SpamArrest trademark case is
       resolved (which will define the resolution of our pending
       trademarks).

11. Adjournment

    Scheduled to adjourn by 1200 PDT -0700. Adjourned at 12:06.


============
ATTACHMENTS:
============

-----------------------------------------
Attachment A: Status report for the Apache Ant Project

o Ant 1.6.2

Ant 1.6.2 was released on July 16th, 2004

Although a minor dot release, this release contained a number of
bug fixes, including improved XML namespace support, consistent reporting
of error locations with build files, reorganization of the xalan related tasks
to remove xalan-1 support, elimination of memory leaks, etc.

A further Ant 1.6.3 release may be necessary to pick up some changes and fixes
which did not make it into the 1.6.2 release.

o Ant 1.7 (CVS Head)

CVS head development continues, of course. There is currently no planned 
release date for Ant 1.7.  

o Nightly builds

Nightly builds have been inactive for a long time (since Sept 2003) and the 
website has recently been changed to reflect this. Traditionally the nightly
builds for Ant were taken from the output from Gump. Changes in Gump's setup
resulted in these becoming unavailable. Whilst Gump runs will soon resume,
the Ant community will need to decide how it wants to provide nightly builds,
considering the potential issues in Gump produced outputs (i.e. reliance on
non-ASF hosted code).

The options would be:

 1. point directly to the Gump produced builds and note the warnings that 
    the Gump team will have in place regarding the reliability of the inputs.
 2. copy Gump outputs relating to Ant into Ant's nightly build area and 
    add suitable warnings in this area
 3. Perform nightly builds (at perhaps some other frequency) in a "trusted"
    environment, whatever that may be - probably a committer machine.
 4. Don't provide nightly builds at all.
 
o Legal Issues

No JSRs, No TCKs, No issues.

o Branches

Ant has traditionally had two branches of development, the current release
branch and the trunk which represents the next release. Whilst we have managed
this in the past, there have been a few instances where changes were not
applied to both active branches. One option would be to not apply all changes 
to both branches piecemeal but to pick up all branch changes in regular merge 
operations and live with the differences between branches between those merge 
points. OTOH, being an open source project both branches are in active use 
by multiple developers/users and there is always pressure to have fixes 
available immediately on both branches. 

o Inactive committers

At the end February I sent an email to 15 inactive committers asking if 
they wished to remain part of the Ant project. I received two replies. I intend,
with the PMC's confirmation to make all such committers emeritus and to remove
them from Ant's avail entry.

o Community

All well on the community front. 

Matt Benson was added to the PMC.

The number of open bugs remains a perennial problem. 



-----------------------------------------
Attachment B: Status report for the Apache Cocoon Project

Community:
- Cocoon version 2.1.5 released in May: it's a bugfix release with minor
  new features. It was re-released as 2.1.5.1 in July when we noticed that
  our build system was not including the license and notice files [1].
- Lenya version 1.2 released in June
- no new committer on Cocoon, one new committer on Lenya
- Lenya proposed as a top-level project
- PMC composition change: new chair, some new members and some resignations.

Infrastructure:
- moved to subversion
- cocoondev.org wiki moved to ASF wiki

Ongoing research work :
- Javaflow (implementation of continuations in Java), which triggered
  the creation of a group to propose a JSR [2]
- the "Kernel", a container for Cocoon blocks,
- "Butterfly", an experimentation to use Spring as a component container
  instead of Avalon

Misc:
- Important new live sites with VNU UK [3] moving all its sites to
  Cocoon (high-traffic sites which where sucessfully slashdotted)

Attachment C: Status report for the Apache Forrest Project

Issues needing board attention
______________________________
None

New committers and new PMC members
__________________________________
None

General status
______________
* Successfully moved to top-level forrest.apache.org
* The community is steadily expanding and contributing.
* A bit hampered by not enough people to get a release out,
and supporting a growing user base on the old 0.5 version.

Issues still to be dealt with by the Forrest PMC
________________________________________________
* Not yet completed our project guidelines. Some of us have
turned our attention to the top-level ASF docs, especially
the "how-it-works" document. We will continue to enhance
those docs, then our project guidelines can just refer.
* This delay with defining roles means that we cannot yet
bring in any new committers or PMC members. We have had
good PMC discussion about the procedure and are now close.

Progress
________
* Created as top-level project, with all that entails.
* Thanks to infrastructure@ for their help with the move.
* Moved from old xml.apache.org/forrest and added .htaccess
* Retained links and association at Apache XML project.
* Started process to move Jira Issues from cocoondev.org
(thanks to Outerthought for getting us started).
* Since creation of user@f.a.o list we have many new users.
* New distribution mirrors for Forrest (still old 0.5.1).
* Ever closer to 0.6 release, we use it for our website.

General observations during last quarter
________________________________________
* Need improved and consistent top-level ASF docs.
* Need guidelines for PMCs to assess licenses and to know
what to do when unlicensed code is committed by accident.
* The process with infrastructure@ to set up a new project
is difficult for everyone. It was a lot of work for us to
get ready and to define our needs, and then a lot of work
in dribs and drabs to get actually established. Don't know
what to suggest, other than we need to encourage more people
to help at infra@ and need to steadily improve the /dev/
web-space to provide guidelines and templates for requests.

Attachment D: Status report for the Apache HTTP Server Project


-----------------------------------------
Attachment E: Status report for the Apache Logging Project

Projects listed in alphabethical order.

- report for the PMC

The Logging Services PMC has focused its efforts on verifying the
legal and proper status of all projects and committers under the PMC's
jurisdiction.  We have been working with the Foundation to ensure all
committers and code are properly covered as far as licensing and
intellectual property rights are concerned.

While the incubation process is ongoing, we have made some progress
towards agreeing on common interfaces and schemas for logging services
in the different programming languages.

- report for log4cxx

Two new committers, namely, Curt Arnold and Christophe de Vienne, have
joined the log4cxx project.

log4cxx version 1.0 should be released within the next quarter. This
version should have the same feature as log4j 1.2.8 but will not
include log4j 1.3 additions.

For the moment, the supported OS/platforms are Linux/Mandrake10,
Windows/MSVC6, Windows/MSVC7.1, Windows/Cygwin, and FreeBSD. We need
testers in order to support Mac OS X, HPUX, and SunOS.

- report for log4j

The Log4j team continued progress towards the next major release,
log4j version 1.3.  We anticipate the first alpha build of this
version within the next quarter.

We have made specific progress in the area of splitting the log4j
distribution into smaller components: a core, GUI viewers like
Chainsaw, and other additions from the sandbox like filters and
configuration tools.

- report for log4net

No report has been submitted.

- report for log4php

Marco Vassura has contacted the various contributors in order to
obtain their formal approval.

Contributor             Licence change approval received by the
                       Logging Services PMC on:

-----------------------------------------
Attachment F: Status report for the Apache Perl Project

-- Releases --

The mod_perl 1.x is a maintenance track designed to work with httpd
1.3.x.

Nothing much happening on that track.  No new mod_perl 1.x releases
since the last report.

---

The mod_perl 1.99 series is a development track designed to become
mod_perl 2.0; it works with httpd 2.0.x.

Recent releases:

  1.99_14 - May 21, 2004

---

Apache::Test provides a framework which allows module writers to write
test suites than can query a running mod_perl enabled server.  It is
used by mod_perl, httpd and several third party applications.

Recent releases:

  1.12 - June 28, 2004
  1.11 - May 21, 2004

-- Development --

Development on mod_perl 2.0 and Apache::Test is moving at a healthy
pace. Now working on polishing the API so we can get ready for the 2.0
release hopefully somewhere in summer.

-- Users --

As always the mod_perl users list is thriving. Though usage is
declining a bit recently, with 1.5M or 4.8M sites depending on which
survey you look at.

the advocacy list was revived and a few folks are putting together a
mod_perl advocacy efforts plan.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment G: Status report for the Apache XML Project

General Comments
----------------

The Federation of many of the sub-projects is slowly 
happening, although not as quickly as everyone might like. 
With the Graphics TLP proposal pending, we will now 
concentrate on moving Xerces and Xalan to TLP over the next 
quarter.

PMC arrivals, departures
------------------------

With Forrest becoming a TLP, Jeff Turner <jefft@apache.org> 
requests that he be removed from the XML PMC.

The request for the XML Graphics TLP (Batik and FOP) is pending.

Issues needing attention:
-------------------------

The JuiCE sub-project in the incubator is still waiting 
on action on the corpriate CLA from uni of memphis.

Axkit
-----

Vacation and conference season is upon us so not a lot has 
changed. Code in the 1.6.x branch remains more-or-less 
stable with a few bug fixes along the way. We added Michael 
Nachbaur as a core committer. Migration to TLP is stalled 
pending the confirmation of the new proposed PMC Chair and 
markup of the subsequent charter proposal. Perhaps the biggest 
non-technical news item in the last period was the release of 
XML Publishing with AxKit from O'Reilly (yay!). We also saw a 
noticable increase in interest in AxKit at this year's OSCon.

Batik
-----

Cameron McCormack? was added as a committer.

Proposal for XML-Graphics joint TLP with FOP discussed.

Working to update the source headers.

No major code changes, some bug fixing, some enhancements to 
the handling of external documents.

Commons
-------

No major activity on xml-commons this quarter. Some small new 
code donations have been discussed briefly, but without a lot 
of followup. We need a few more committers to follow up and 
evaluate the ideas - especially to see if these kinds of things 
can just be added to xml-commons or if they'd actually need to 
go through the incubator.

Some Xerces and Xalan committers have been bugfixing in some of 
the common components, so I hope we'll prepare a release for 
general use in the next month or so. Note we should ensure 
the community followsup on the status report from Xerces-J 
to ensure the JAXP changes they noted get committed properly.

-- ShaneCurcuru

FOP
---

No big events, except for the discussions on the XML Graphics 
project and...

Peter B. West moved off to SourceForge? with his special FOP 
branch, just like Victor Mote did earlier. This was a result 
of the inability of the community to decide on a common design 
approach for the new layout engine. On the other side, both 
Victor and Peter remain in contact with the FOP project. They 
have both signalled that they are pleased about the XML 
Graphics project and that they will support the creation of 
shared basic components. This will faciliate comparing the 
three different layout engines being developed right now and 
will ensure that as little code as possible will need to be 
duplicated. It is clear that this is not an ideal circumstance 
but there's no alternative visible right now.

Xalan-C++
---------

A vote passed to move to Jira as the issue tracking system. 
This will happen in the near future. Other than that, just 
the usual bug fixes since the last status report.

Xalan-J/XSLTC
-------------

A vote passed to move to Jira as the issue tracking system. 
This will happen in the near future. Other than that, just 
the usual bug fixes since the last status report.

Xerces-C++
----------

Xerces-J Work has been continuing on Xerces 2.7.0. The current 
status is available here [*]. We understand that Sun intends 
to contribute the portions of the RI for JAXP 1.3 that were 
not developed in Apache back to Xerces-J and Xalan-J shortly; 
we hope to release Xerces 2.7.0 soon thereafter.

We have one new committer to report: Neil Delima was voted in 
during the last weeks of May.

The plan to migrate Xerces-* to a top-level project seems to 
be on a bit of a summer hiatus. Once everything moves back 
into high gear in the Fall, hopefully interest from the 
community will increase and this will pick up speed. [*]

Xerces-P
--------

Nothing to report for this period.

Xindice
-------

Nothing to report for this period. Xindice will stay within 
XML PMC for now.

XML-Security
------------

Two new committers have been voted in - Davanum Srinivas and 
Raul Benito. Raul has been doing a lot of work on optimising 
the library.

In the C++ library we have been developing a server to allow 
interop testing of XML Key Management Specification (XKMS) 
using the Apache xml-security library. We are almost at the 
point where we can put an Alpha server online with full 
support for the XKISS (XML Key Information Service Specification). 
Once that is online, we will start looking at an XKRSS (XML Key 
Registration Service Specification) message set implementation. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment H: Status report for the Public Relations Committee

The PRC has been very active since its inception in June, with most of
the efforts going towards determining what the exact mission of the
PRC will be.  Beyond that, our goal is to document a set of processes
for dealing with press and fundraising inquiries.

There have been a number of discussions concerning possible avenues
and goals for fundraising and PR, including: Hiring an Executive
Director, forming an ASF Sponsorship program, and other fundraising
and budget opportunities.

The acceptance of Derby into the Incubator provided the PRC with a
prime opportunity to learn the pros and cons of working with an
external entity under non-disclosure.  The PRC is currently discussing
how to better handle these cases in the future.

Lastly, in the last two weeks, numerous members have joined the PRC
mailing list in the hopes of observing and (hopefully) assisting.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment I: Status report for the Apache DB Project

Torque has not had much new development though bug fixes have been
committed. The user list remains active.

OJB has the big news this quarter, achieving 1.0 release.  New members
of the PMC include: Matthew Baird, Thomas Dudziak, and Brian
McCallister.  And two new committers: Martin Kalen and Robert Sfeir.

DB is currently sponsoring the Axion project within incubator which
has stagnated, but showed signs of progress again last week with a
request for creation of cvs module and mailing lists.

That's it.  No controversy to report.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment J: Status report for the Apache Geronimo Project

The Geronimo project is moving along.  After the push for TLP status,
there was slight 'relaxation' in organizational activity due to a few
factors, the main one being due to professional changes and commitments
outside of the project for a few major committers (people got jobs,
people got new jobs, etc).  I think that this is just part of the
normal ebb and flow of volunteer life.

Despite that, much progress has been made technically as well as in
terms of community outreach and engagement.   We also are discussing
our policy for comitters, both the requirements for new ones, and
possibly a proactive stance towards inactive ones.  In terms of the
goal of certification of compatibility, work is in progress and we feel
that it's slipping a little from our goal of 'in the third quarter' to
probably 'at the end of the third quarter'.

Technical Progress
------------------
Here's a partial list of the technical progress made by the project :

  - JTA: transaction recovery partly works using ObjectWeb
    HOWL logger.  Pluggable framework for recovery in place.

  - J2EECA: inbound adapters can be deployed against mdbs in
    OpenEJB and deliver messages: JMS inbound and outbound
    works with ActiveMQ.

  - EJB timer: Support in geronimo for generic transactional
    timer services.  Used in OpenEJB ejb timer support
    (currently stateless session and mdb only).

  - JSR 88 Deployment - working

  - Message Driven Beans - done

  - Support for old deployment descriptors - done

  - EAR deployment - done

External Community Engagement
-----------------------------

 - Spring : formed a close working relationship with the Spring
   application framework community.  Spring can now be hosted
   and managed by the Geronimo Container (not J2EE stack),
   providing to Spring users with the management and deployment
   features of Geronimo the Container.

 - ActiveMQ, targeted as the JMS implementation, is working well
   with Geronimo.  This is listed as community engagement as our
   original connection was James Strachan, Geronimo member and
   ActiveMQ founder and our current interactions involve more
   people on both sides

 - Apache Webservices : our planned collaboration with AWS is now
   working.  AWS community members are bringing AWS to Geronimo
   and working on the integration pieces.  An AWS member is being
   considered for Geronimo committer status.

 - ObjectWeb HOWL : we are using the HOWL project for transaction
   logging and recovery.  HOWL is a logging project at ObjectWeb
   with significant participation by Geronimo members.

 - OSCON : Geronimo will be well represented at OSCON via 3 talks
   (IIRC) and a "collaborative community" BOF presented by
   ObjectWeb and the ASF.

 - EJB3 EG : the ASF is represented on the EJB3 expert group by Jeremy
   Boynes, and there is a 'lurker' group at Geronimo providing advice
   and support.  Further, David Blevins, a Geronimo member, is an
   independent expert on the EG.

Community Development
---------------------

One of our first orders of business has been to continue to increase
our committers.  To that end, we are currently discussing the offering
of commit status to an individual from AWS.  There's no bad outcome
possible - it's all about timing and being sure of alignment with
project.

Future
------
Besides the continuing technical, community and committer work, our
next order of business is finalizing project guidelines.  So far, there
has been no issues to be resolved via appeal to law - it's a good
community that has had no trouble resolving differences - but we know
that there will be a time.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment K: Status report for the Apache Incubator Project

Nicola Ken Barozzi stepped down as Incubator PMC Chair, and was
replaced by Noel J. Bergman.  We thank Nicola Ken for his efforts in
helping to recast the Incubator to best fulfill its designated
functions.

Since the last report to the Board, several projects have graduate
from the Incubator, including: Geronimo, XML-Beans, SpamAssassin, and
Pluto.  Lenya appears ready to fly the nest, and may have a proposal
for the Board, although one is not ready at the time of this writing.

Significant entries into the Incubator include Beehive and MyFaces (a
JavaServer Faces implementation).  The long awaited Axion database
project appears ready to begin incubation.  A project sponsored by the
HTTP Server PMC for integrating Apache Web Server with ISO/ECMA CLI has
also begun incubation.

A few projects seem stalled in the Incubator, and are not responding
to requests for status.  We may have to cull the herd in a few cases,
but these appear to have failed to attract/build a community, and
seem relatively inactive.

Infrastructure bottlenecks are effecting the Incubator.  I say this
without pointing fingers, since as a member of the Infrastructure
Team, I am one of the people responsible for being or removing those
bottlenecks.  It is simply that we can create a rash of requests for
project resources, and we (the Infrastructure Team) are short-staffed.
One thing that should help will be improved scripts for mailing list
creation.

The Incubator has worked with the newly formed PRC to help establish
some guidelines, so that the PRC can help ensure that any PR related
to Incubator projects makes clear the project's status.  We have also
had discussions related to trying to make sure that projects really
are begun Incubation before they are used for PR purposes.

Licensing and other IP related issues remain a topic of discussion.
It would help to have some legal resource(s) participating with the
Incubator.

All in all, the Incubator seems to be finding its stride and proving a
good asset for the Foundation.

                           - 0 -

Here are the STATUS reports from the PPMCs that have sent one in.


Status report for WSRP4J
====================================

* is the STATUS file up to date? (also post link)

  The cwiki file on the incubator site is  up to date as well as the
STATUS file in the project directory.
  http://incubator.apache.org/projects/wsrp4j.html

* any legal, cross-project or personal issues
that still need to be addressed?

  No.

* what has been done for incubation since the last report?

  1.  Annointed a new committer: sgoldstein
  2.  Various bug fixes.
  3.  Restructured the website and added the Portals logo.
  4.  Migrated to the new moinmoin wiki.

* plans and expectations for the next period?

  1. Continue development work on outstanding WSRP 1.0 items
     (see TODO wiki: http://wiki.apache.org/portals/WSRP4JTodoList)
  2. Continue to build the community by encouraging developers
     to contribute code.  We are building a user population, but few
     outside developers have made code contributions.
  3. Will probably ask for a vote to graduate from the Incubator into
Portals.

* any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly for you?

  None.

* etc (your own thoughts on what is important would be helpful!)


Status report from the Directory PPMC
======================================

Since the last report:

  * Alan Cabrera has joined us to write the stub compiler for Snickers.
  * We have resusitated the original LDAPd code base right before we
entered the incubator to have a running server.  This is there for
people to be able to play around with as server: fire it up and kick the
tires.  Of course all the package names and other aspects of the server
have been adjusted to convey that it is now a part of Apache.
  * We have begun to focus specifically on Snickers after a
recommendation by Nicola and Noel.  The goal is to lift this sole IP
issue from the project to prepare us to exit the incubator.  At the
present time the decoder half of the BER codec is complete and working
well.  We should have the encoder half complete soon since it is already
under way.
  * The server front end is ready and comes up in the new Eve server.
The only problem at this point is that it returns busy for every
response.   This will remain the case until we pull the new backend
subsystem out of the sandbox to complete the new server.
  * Thanks to Vincent we have a new website look and feel using Maven
out of the box.   We also have been discussing a better ontological
organization to the site to reflect the role of our subprojects within
the overall effort.


Status report for Depot
========================================

1). Is the STATUS file up to date?
No

2). Any legal, cross-project or personal issues that still need to be
   addressed?
   No,  all files licensed, all commiters have singed CLA

3). What has been done for incubation since the last report?
   * Site update.
   * Packages renamed to "depot"

4). Plans and expectations for the next period?
   * Delete unused under developed code.
   * Complete Download manger for use by gump and others.
   * Support "directory artifacts" for use by antworks and others.

5). Any recommendations for how incubation could run more smoothly for you?
 no


Status report for Beehive
========================================

* Beehive's initial source code contribution was made on Friday, 19 July.
* All mailing lists and the SVN directory are completely up and running.
* We still need to get CLAs from three of the committers, but the rest
are working fine.
* Requests for JIRA and a wiki page are pending.
* So, basic infrastructure stuff is in good shape...now it's time to
start helping people understand the code base and how they can best
contribute to it.


Status report for JuiCE
========================================

Status report for JuiCE for the Incubator

JuiCE has stalled waiting on a set of changes to the CLA proposed by Uni
of Memphis being approved by the ASF.  Without this approval, Walter
Hoehn cannot get commit access to the repository.  As he is one of the
key developers we need this sorted out before we can really ramp up.

   * is the STATUS file up to date? (also post link)

Yes - http://incubator.apache.org/projects/juice.html

   * any legal, cross-project or personal issues
     that still need to be addressed?

No.

   * what has been done for incubation since the last report?

One account (for Noah Levitt) has been created, and the source code has
been imported into SVN.

   * plans and expectations for the next period?

Hopefully sort out the CLA for Memphis Uni and get development going again.


Status report for HTTPD-CLI
========================================

In March '04, the httpd PMC referred the mod_aspdotnet contribution
(Code Grant ack'ed in rev 1.7 of foundation/grants.txt) for incubation.

The project was recently picked back up, with Will Rowe now having
the cycles to devote to the care and feeding required of incubation.
Ian Holsman, also an httpd PMC member, stepped up to co-shepherd
the incubation.

Invites to the interested parties were sent last week to join the mailing
list cli-dev@httpd.apache.org, followed by an invitation to the dev@httpd
community.  The status page/ip incubation template was created, with
Ian managing the site.  Will has imported the initial contribution into
SVN (under asf/incubator/httpd/cli/).

Next steps are documented in status, first posts will be sent to this
list this week.  mod_aspdotnet should have an initial release soon,
followed by the refactoring of code to support an Apache.Web model
that is entirely independent of the Microsoft ASP.NET technology,
usable in C# with one of several CLI environments, including mono.

The cli-dev team would like to thank Noel and Sander for their advise
and handholding through initial mailing list creation, SVN setup, and
general guidance on the incubation process.


Status report for HTTPD-CLI
========================================

  * The Axion development team has (lazily) approved to sign the software
grant.  The comment period on this has expired. The grant should be signed
and faxed this week.

  * A request has been made to infrastructure to create the db-axion CVS
module, as well as the axion-dev and axion-user mailing lists.

  * Some members of the infrastruture team have volunteered to assist in
importing the Axion CVS tree (with history) from Tigris to Apache.

  * Once the appropriate infrastructure pieces are in place, we need to:
(1) cut a terminal release from Tigris, (2) move the code base and
discussion over to those apache resources.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment L: Status report for the Apache James Project

Pretty quiet quarter:

What code releases have been made?
James 2.2.0 was officially released.

Legal issues:
Nothing that requires board attention.

Cross-project issues:
I would like to claim we're working on a 3.0 release that will
incorporate a newer published release of Avalon, but I can't say I
know precisely what that means or gets us (besides known source code
we're running on as 2.x runs against unreleased/inaccessible code).


-----------------------------------------
Attachment M: Status report for the Apache Maven Project

o New projects

None, but the maven-components repository is now fleshed out with the
makings for maven2. There is a lot of code that has been added over the
last couple months.

o New PMC members

None.

o New Committers

John D. Casey (maven - core)
Tryve Laugstol (maven - core)

o Goings on

We finally managed to release the 1.0 of Maven and now we're forging
ahead preparing the the alpha-1 release of Maven 2. I waited until the
1.0 was released before doing the alpha-1 of Maven 2. Brett Porter
forged on to complete the release while myself, Michal, Emmanuel, Trygve
and John Casey worked on Maven 2. Maven 2 has the distinct difference of
originally entirely written by myself. So in terms of developer
involvement there is a stark difference between maven 1 and maven 2.
With Maven 1 users are essentially at the mercy of what Brett and I know
about Maven 1 whereas off the hop with Maven 2 we've got 5 people in
maven land in addition to a half dozen other folks who could manage
their way around Maven as it's a plexus application (a container akin to
phoenix and merlin but made specifically for embeddability and Maven 2).

I am also preparing to release Continuum which is a continuous
integration tool for Maven projects. I hired one of the committers, who
is a student, for the summer to finish the first release of Maven and
it's now finished and will be released the alpha-1 of Maven 2.

We are also planning on doing a release soon of Maven Wagon and Maven
SCM. Maven Wagon is used extensively in Maven 2 and Maven SCM is used
extensively in Continuum.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment N: Status report for the Apache Struts Project

We have started a reorganization of our repository. The goals of the refactoring 
are to better support subprojects  with their own release cycles and building 
Struts with Apache Maven. 

An initial draft of the reorganization is being done under Subversion on a 
private server, with all discussions taking place on the public DEV list. We will 
be ready to move the work to an Apache server soon, now that we have a 
consensus in favor of Subversion and Maven. 

We completed a draft of Apache Struts bylaws and developer guidelines, which 
is available at <http://struts.apache.org/bylaws.html>.

There was a discussion on the DEV list regarding the "bar" for Committership. 
The consensus is to keep the bar set fairly high and wait until a contributor has 
submitted a good number of useful patches directly to Struts. 

Our latest stable release is still 1.1 (29 June 2003). We issued a 1.2.1 release 
on 11 July 2004, which is currently catagorized as a beta. We anticipate 1.2.1 
(or a 1.2.2) being promoted to GA over the next 30 days. 


-----------------------------------------
Attachment O: Status report for the Apache TCL Project

Not much to report.  We added Pat Thoyts as a committer to take care
of Rivet on windows, which has been something that needed doing for a
long time, but that no one else had resources to handle.  Ronnie
Brunner has kept our web site up to date and functioning with some
improved code for the Websh section.  We released a new Rivet version
some months ago.  A new version in the works will have a compatibility
layer for the tcl standard library's cgi handler, making Rivet useful
to more people.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment P: Status report for the Conference Planning Committee

o Security Travel has been selected to produce the ApacheCon/US
  series of conferences for five years; Software and Support Verlag
  has been chosen to do the next conference in Europe.  Contracts
  for both are being negociated.
o The Call for Participation has been sent out; fifty two (52)
  submissions have been received to date.
o We are working with OSCOM to provide content for the ApacheTracks
  streams there.

We will be holding the scheduling meeting for ApacheCon 2004/US
around 7 August 2004.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment Q: Status report for the Security Team


-----------------------------------------
Attachment R: Status report for the Apache Jakarta Project

=== Status ===

Prior to his departure, Geir started some discussion (PMC list) concerning
Jakarta charter revisions and the various documents describing the
governance of Jakarta. The current documents are quite out of date in
places - "The number of PMC seats is set at seven". Expect more on this.

The PMC resolved a lack of oversight issue concerning the tomcat-security
list, and two committers have stepped up to moderate it. Equally, the
General list turned out to be lacking many moderators, so one of the
themes for the next month may be to double-check our moderation coverage.

Discussions on improved download pages to make it easier for user's to
download distributions and more obvious on how to handle PGP/MD5
signatures have occured on the general list.

Dion Gillard has volunteered to be a Junior Apmail Apprentice to try and
take some of common workload off of infrastructure.

=== Subproject news ===

(** implies report based on the mailing lists by the chair)

==== Alexandria ** ====

(dormant project)

==== BCEL ** ====

User list is active, Dev list is less so.

==== BSF ** ====

Again, User list is active, Dev list is less so.

==== Cactus ** ====

User list very active, dev list very quiet, mainly automated emails. I
believe a Cactus-2 is in the planning.

==== Commons ** ====

Commons has, as always, been very active. Outside of the components
themselves, work over the last quarter has gone into the build and site
generation system using Maven.

 * Chain was promoted from the Sandbox to Commons Proper.

==== Commons HttpClient ====

 * 2.0.1 and 3.0 alpha 2 releases are planned for the near future.
 * HttpClient plans to move to the Jakarta level after version 3.0

==== ECS ** ====

The developer list has been quiet for the last quarter. Occasional
questions are asked on the user list.

==== HiveMind ====

HiveMind is moving steadily towards an initial beta release.

==== JMeter ** ====

Very active user and dev lists. The JMeter sub-community appears to be
busily working on bugfixing.

==== Lucene ====

Lucene 1.4 Final has been released.

==== ORO ====

Pattern matching engine factories were added in response to needs
expressed by Commons, including a wrapper for J2SE 1.4 java.util.regex.
Also, subpackages were separated out into separate jars for users who need
only one pattern matching engine and are sensitive to jar file size.  A
combined jar with everything is still provided as users fall into two
camps on this issues.  More discussion of ORO has occurred on commons-dev
than on oro-dev recently.  There's no ETA for the next release, which will
probably be version 2.1.

==== POI ====

Work on the next release of POI has been ongoing, but no release date has
been set.

==== Regexp ====

Nothing happened this month. No release date for the next release, 1.4,
has been set.

==== Slide ====

Slide 2.1 release is under preparation including lots of nice new
features. A first beta is to be expected in August. CVS will branch with
the release of this beta.

==== Taglibs ** ====

The sub-community is largely dealing with user queries concerning JSTL and
the Standard tag-library, Apache's implementation of JSTL. A new version
of the String taglib was released in May. A new sandbox taglib, datagrid,
was also added in May.

==== Tapestry ====

Work on the next release of Tapestry, Tapestry 3.1, based on a new
infrastructure provided by HiveMind, has begun.  In addition, some
annoyances in the final Tapestry 3.0 release may result in a 3.0.1 bugfix
release.

==== Tomcat ====

The Tomcat CVS has branched, creating a TOMCAT_5_0 branch for continuing
maintenance on Tomcat 5.0.x releases, and allowing work on Tomcat 5.1 to
begin.  For some discussion about Tomcat 5.1 features and changes, search
the tomcat-dev mailing list archives for threads whose subject contains
"5.next."

==== Turbine ====

To make the creation of Web applications using Turbine easier, a plugin
for Maven has been designed and is currently tested in the 2.3 branch of
the Turbine framework. Some work towards the 2.4 release is going on, but
no release date has been set.

==== Velocity  ====

Both user and dev lists are active, but project is stable and widely used.

Upcoming plan is to release a new core 1.4.1 because of a non-backwards
compatible change made to in the 1.4 release that prevents people from
using a 'word' token in a directive other than in #macro() call or a
#foreach().  This bit users of the Webwork framework (and probably others)
and will revert back with a log notice that the feature is deprecated.

After that is planned the core 1.5 release of current features in CVS, and
then a large pile of new features in patch form including floating-point
support as core 1.6.

The Tools part of the project is at version 1.1.

==== Watchdog ====

The PMC discussed the status of Watchdog.  It is a dormant project with no
active committers.  However, it is still used by Tomcat as part of
Tomcat's release testing.  In addition, the PMC would like to retain the
option of future work on Watchdog, so the web site and accompanying
materials will not be removed.  A dormancy notice has been placed on the
Watchdog web page and the mailing list subscription links replaced with a
note to use general@jakarta.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment S: Status report for the Apache Avalon Project

Status Report for Avalon: July 21 2004

Stephen McConnell has resigned from the PMC and resigned his committer
status within Avalon.

The Avalon PMC and developer community are currently discussing "next
steps" though things have calmed down considerably over the last two
days (since Stephen's resignation).  There are a number of decisions
being considered which include:

  * Some internal restructuring of Avalon to partition the traditional
    framework development from newer container (merlin) development

  * Separating new Merlin development out into a new project, either
    directly to a TLP or to the incubator.

  * Possibly "freezing" or otherwise shutting down Avalon, particularly
    framework development (which is fairly stable).

And a host of other options.

The good news that I do want to report is that I am confident with
Stephen's resignation the remainder of the community is capable of
finding a path forward in the best interest of the ASF, the developers,
and our users.  We will be consulting with the newly formed Excalibur
project and other Avalon dependent projects during this restructuring
process.  Currently I believe we're all a little drained from recent
events and need a few days to regroup.


-----------------------------------------
Attachment T: Status report for the Apache SpamAssassin Project

Highlights of Events from the last month:

  * Pre-releases: SpamAssassin 3.0.0-pre1, SpamAssassin 3.0.0-pre2

    The project is zeroing in on our 3.0.0 release, we've completed the
    first set of mass-checks (contributors submit corpora results and
    they are used to train the score optimizer).  pre3 should be coming
    out in the next few days, followed by the second set of mass-checks,
    and then we will put out a release candidate.

  * New committer: Henry Stern (author of the perceptron that will do
    the score optimizations for SpamAssassin 3.0)

  * ASF integration (moving from the incubator to TLP status and
    transitioning away from a few bits of remaining non-ASF
    infrastructure) continues at a slow, but steady pace.  The web site
    is completely transitioned and under SVN control, lists are moving
    from incubator to TLP, we're in the process of moving the
    spamassassin.org domain registration.

    Two issues: a private non-ASF list that has been used for
    communication with other anti-spammers (privacy is competing with
    transparency) and Jira's non-open-source licensing resulted in a
    veto on moving to Jira, and the ASF bugzilla is reportedly
    undersupported, so we're still using our own bugzilla (supported by
    our committers and a contributor at an ISP) for the time being.

  * We can't claim credit for the integration work, but we have heard
    that installing SpamAssassin on the ASF mail servers has helped
    quite a bit, and we have helped out a bit with DNSBL selection.  :-)

  * We are holding a logo contest to replace our old project logo:
