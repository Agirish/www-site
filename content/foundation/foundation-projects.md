# What are Foundation 'Projects'?  {#foundationproject}

To support our hundreds of Apache software project communities, the Apache Software
Foundation has created several committees with a Foundation wide scope
and each with their own specific part to play. These committees include:

-  [Infrastructure](#infrastructure) 

-  [Incubator](#incubator) 

-  [Attic](#attic) 

-  [Legal Affairs](#legal) 

-  [Security](#security) 

-  [Travel Assistance](#travel) 

-  [Community Development](#community) 

The ASF has also created a number of Vice President officer roles with a foundation wide
scope in specific policy areas:

-  [JCP](#jcp) 

-  [W3C Relations](#w3c) 

-  [Brand Management](#brand) 

-  [Fundraising](#fundraising) 

-  [Marketing and Publicity](#pr) 

-  [Finance](#finance) 

The [overview of the corporate governance of the ASF](governance/) explains the reporting 
structure and authority of these committees and officers.  Importantly, while 
many of these positions create ASF-wide policy, Apache project PMCs each 
report directly to the Board, not to any specific officer or committee.

A [full listing of ASF officers](http://www.apache.org/foundation/) is available.

# Infrastructure  {#infrastructure}

The ASF does not have offices or buildings, it's a virtual entity that
exists only on the internet. Its only physical existence is the technical
infrastructure that enables it to operate.

The ASF has an Infrastructure team that is responsible for the management
and day-to-day system administration and operation of the various hardware
that runs the above services.

For more regarding the Infrastructure team and the Infrastructure President's Committee that governs it, see the [Infrastructure
webpage](http://www.apache.org/dev/infrastructure.html).

# Incubator  {#incubator}

The Incubator Project Management Committee is the entry path into ASF for projects and codebases
wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts. All code donations from
external organisations and existing external projects wishing to join
Apache enter through the Incubator.

The Apache Incubator has two primary goals:

- Ensure all donations are in accordance with ASF legal standards

- Develop new communities that adhere to the ASF's guiding principles

For more regarding Apache Incubator, see the [Incubator
website](http://incubator.apache.org/).

# Attic  {#attic}

The *Apache Attic Project Management Committee* -- where discontinued, abandoned, and retired
codebases and projects are stored. The Attic preserves the information for
posterity, reference, and potential future re-activation, while keeping it
clearly distinct from active work.

For more regarding the Apache Attic, see the [Attic
website](http://attic.apache.org/).

# Travel Assistance  {#travel}

The *Travel Assistance Committee* -- exists to help those that would like
to attend ApacheCon events, but are unable to do so for financial reasons.

For more regarding Apache Travel Assistance, see the [Travel
page](/travel/).

# Community Development  {#community}

understand how the ASF works and giving them then confidence to participate
more directly.

# Conference Planning  {#concom}

Note that as of 2013, the Conference Planning committee has been dissolved, 
and various corporate officers and the Community Development group are now
 responsible for assisting or approving running Apache-related events. 

For more regarding Apache conferences, see the [Conferences
page](conferences.html).

# Security  {#security}

The *Security President's Committee* -- responsible for the handling of potential
security holes in the software produced by the foundation that might impact
our users. It gets contacted by the finders of the problems before the
problem report is made available to the public, to allow the projects to
provide a fix in time for the report, thus reducing vulnerability to a
minimum.

For more regarding Apache Security, see the [Security page](/security/).

# Legal Affairs  {#legal}

The *Legal Affairs Committee* -- responsible for the legal issues
associated with licensing and license compatibilities and for the revision
of the Apache Software License.
