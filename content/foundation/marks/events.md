# Event Names Using Apache Marks Policy  {#events}

The use of Apache marks in any events run by third parties must be approved
by VP, Brand Management or the VP of the relevant Apache project.
This includes conferences, meetups, gettogethers, and any other
sorts of events. Events must comply with this policy and have permission
to use Apache marks in the name of the event or in any
of the primary branding, including the domain name, for the event.

Event branding and event organizers may not claim to be the organizers or
sole or exclusive leaders of any Apache project, nor claim to be the sole,
exclusive, or primary source of information for any Apache project.

Simply *presenting a talk* on an Apache project requires no approval, and is very much
encouraged! The [Community Development Project](http://community.apache.org/) may be
able to help with this. Approval is required when the event name or primary branding
features Apache marks. Thus, giving a talk on Apache Foo at your local technology
get-together requires no approval, while organising "An evening with Apache Foo" as
an event open to the public does require approval.

## Anti-Harassment Policy  {#anti-harassment}

Conferences organised by third parties which use Apache marks are required to have
an Anti-Harassment Policy. This policy must either be identical to the
[ASF Anti-Harassment Policy](/foundation/policies/anti-harassment.html)
or be an alternative approved by the ASF.

## Must Provide Open Educational Content  {#education}

At least a portion of any training and/or technical presentations at
events *must be applicable to the Apache product(s)* being referenced. For
example, an event about Apache Tomcat must include some sessions or lessons
that attendees can apply to an actual Apache Tomcat download directly - not
just lessons that apply to some third party product(s) built atop of or
related to Apache Tomcat.

## Must Allow PMC Representatives To Event Selection Committee  {#selection}

Event organizers must allow a PMC representative from any project whose
marks are used, or alternately a member from the Community Development,
to sit on their Selection Committee. The PMC or Community Development representative
will wear their Apache "hat", to help ensure that these guidelines are
followed. PMC representatives from Apache must be associated with at least two
different organizations, so as to avoid the appearance of the event being
beholden to one organization.

In particular, PMC representatives shall work to ensure that events with
an open CFP or talk selection process works in a fair and unbiased manner,
based on technical merit of talks selected.  For events that have pre-selected
talks or more limited technical content, PMC representatives can ensure that
sufficient open educational content is applicable to the actual Apache
product(s) in question, and that the content is not solely about a third party
product.

## Referring To Apache Marks And Projects/Products  {#naming}

The first and most prominent reference to any Apache product on every page
or major section of a page, both in titles and in body text,
must use the *full name* of the project, for example "*Apache Tomcat*".
Professionally produced events are expected to fully comply
with our [Apache Product Name Usage Guide][guide].

The event's main landing page, as well as any "About" or "Overview" page,
must include a prominent paragraph in the body content or sidebar (i.e. not
only in the footer content) that includes a brief **description of
the appropriate Apache project** - as an independent project, not just a technology.  This must also include a link back to the
Apache project's home page, linked from the "Apache Tomcat" wording.

## Trademark Attributions And Proper Apache Brand Usage  {#attributions}

Event pages must feature prominent attributions of all Apache marks. For
example:

>Apache Tomcat, Tomcat and Apache are either registered trademarks or trademarks of
the Apache Software Foundation in the United States and/or other countries,
and are used with permission. The Apache Software Foundation has
no affiliation with and does not endorse, or review the materials provided at
this event, which is managed by BigCo.

This may appear in page footers or in any other appropriate location. The
"Apache Software Foundation" text should link to http://www.apache.org/ and
the "used with permission" should link to this Event Branding Requirements
page.

You **must** have permission from a VP of the ASF to use the "used with permission" text.

## Logos And Graphics Usage  {#graphics}

Events may not normally use any Apache logos or graphics as part of their primary
event branding. Apache product logos may only be used to refer to the
Apache products or projects themselves, and must be clearly set off from
any of the events' own branding and logos.

If your event wishes to use an Apache project logo within your event branding,
you must work with VP, Brand to explicitly grant trademark and goodwill rights
for the brand and event logo to the ASF.

Event branding may not include the Apache feather in any way. The only use
of the bare Apache feather on event materials allowed is to provide a
single link to http://www.apache.org/ as a reference to The Apache Software
Foundation, typically as a Community Partner or to otherwise refer to
Apache as a whole.

## Event Profits And Donations  {#funding}

As a non-profit organization, the ASF always appreciates donations.
Community led events are not required to provide donations. Third
party commercial events are welcome to provide a portion of profits as a
donation to the ASF.

## ASF Listing As Community Partner Option  {#partner}

The primary website and other collateral for events must provide The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)
with the *option* to have Apache listed as a Community Partner, Sponsor,
or other appropriate category within the event's branding style.

This is intended to ensure that the ASF as a whole
has a formal recognition by the event organizers that is clear and specific
to event attendees and others.  ASF or project representatives can will determine the
appropriate text blurb, logo, and link back to the ASF website for this
recognition, and will let you know if Apache
should be listed or not for each event.  Note that listings for Community
Partner or the like are for the Apache Software Foundation as a whole, and
are not typically listed for an individual Apache project.

# Allowable Event Dates  {#dates}

The Apache Community Development Committee pro-actively seeks to avoid conflicts between
Apache-related technology conferences geographically, and between conferences
on the same Apache project topics internationally, to ensure that individual
conferences are successful and that they are not competing for participation
by the same limited collection of experts on individual Apache technologies.

The Apache Software Foundation will not approve the use of Apache trademarks
in conjunction with competing conferences that would adversely affect each
event's ability to put on content (i.e. get speakers) and fulfill the goals of having a rich community
event with educational content about Apache projects.

- Small events (under 250 expected attendees), and free or purely community
run (non-corporate & non-profit) events might be considered competing only with other events that are about the
same Apache project or related Apache projects.

- Large events (over 250 expected attendees) may be considered competing with
other events even in other Apache project areas, or compared with the ASF's
own ApacheCon conferences.

An "Announced Event" means an event called "ApacheCon" or "Apache
Roadshow" and listed on [https://events.apache.org/](https://events.apache.org/).

The Apache Software Foundation will not approve the use of Apache trademarks
where a date conflict exists with an Announced Event. A date conflict is defined as:

- A Proposed Announced Event (ie, an event that wishes to become an Announced
Event, as defined above) conflicts if it is within 60 days in the same
geographical area (ie, North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia/Pacific) and
30 days within a different geographical area.

- A third-party event, or a Project Event (ie, an Apache Foo event run by
the Apache Foo PMC) is in conflict if it is within 6 weeks in the same
geographical area, or 3 weeks in a different geographical area.


In order to ensure that
your use of the marks requested can be approved, [contact us][contactevents] with early notice of your
intended timeframe and location to verify no conflicts,
and then follow up with the specific dates and venue once scheduled for final
approval and to be placed on the
[calendar](http://community.apache.org/calendars/conferences.html).

The Apache Community Development committee attempts to track all relevant upcoming conference
dates for the purpose of scheduling and conflict avoidance. We publish all conferences
run by the ASF, and those approved to make use of ASF marks in
[our calendar](http://community.apache.org/calendars/conferences.html). Submitting
advance notice of your proposed event's intended dates and prompt confirmation of your
scheduled conference dates to dev@community.apache.org will ensure this calendar is up to
date and also avoids conflicts with related, relevant conferences of the
Apache Software Foundation, its partners, and the rest of the industry. Submission
to dev@community is **not** related to getting trademark permissions.

# Must Not Use "Apache" And "ApacheCon" Names  {#apachecon}

Third party events may not use either the "Apache" nor the "ApacheCon"
names, nor confusingly similar names, as any part of their primary
branding. These names are reserved exclusively for the ASF and its
own authorized conferences, or for specific PMC-run
events that are approved by the Foundation.

# Other Trademark Guidelines  {#other}

For more information about Apache marks, please see our [formal Trademark
Policy](/foundation/marks/) and our [site map of Trademark resources][resources].

# Steps to gain approval to use an Apache Mark in Events  {#approval}

Approval to use an Apache marks for your conference must be obtained in
writing from the foundation. If you have not received approval
from VP, Brand or that Apache project's VP, then *you do not have permission*!

1. Ensure Apache Marks are correctly attributed on your site and marketing
    materials (if not public yet, provide screenshots or explanations). See [Referring To Apache Marks And Projects/Products](#naming)
2. Ensure your date doesn't clash with another Apache event. See [Dates](#dates)
   for more information and a link to the current list. Approval will not be granted to
   events which clash, or are very close to another similar event.
3. Reach out to the appropriate PMC(s). PMC representatives are generally
   required, during both planning and the event itself, and the earlier you engage
   with the PMC the easier this will be. As an absolute minimum the PMC must approve
   your event through their chosen decision making process.
4. Identify your main point of contact for the approval process. If possible, this should be a member of
   the PMC
5. [Contact us][contactevents] with your confirmation of above to seek approval.
   Include details of:
    * What is the topic focus of the event?
    * Who is organising the event
    * When is the event
    * How many attendees are expected
    * How much PMC involvement is there already
    * Which marks are requested
    * How would you propose that the ASF will be listed as a community
      partner? (See "ASF Listing As Community Partner")
    * How will the event selection work? (See "PMC Representatives To Event
      Selection Committee" and "Providing Open Educational Content")
    * Is this for profit or non-profit? (See "Event Profits And Donations")

Make sure you've done all this and have a mockup ready to show us before
asking. If further information or changes are required, a representative from the
Brand Management or the Apache project in question will contact you. A decision will typically be made within two
weeks of all information being available, and all attributions being present.
Assuming the affected PMCs have approved your event through appropriate consensus
based methods **and** no objection from VP Trademarks or their representative has
been received you may proceed with your event as planned. However, please note that
only explicit approval should be considered authoritative. If in doubt please request
explicit approval.

Approval for events is given on a case by case basis and must be requested for each
events. If you plan to repeat your event, or if you are planning recurring for-profit events,
you can save time in the future by
[contacting us][contactevents] to negotiate a detailed agreement with the ASF.
