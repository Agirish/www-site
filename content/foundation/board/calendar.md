Title: Board Meetings and Calendar, 2015 - Present
license: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

# Board Meetings Schedule
Regular meetings of the Board of Directors are currently scheduled for the
third Wednesday of each month.

Meeting times vary, the exact schedule is available to ASF Members and 
Officers, search for "calendar" in the Foundation's private index page
(svn:foundation/private-index.html).

The Board Chair and/or Directors can call for special board meetings under
various circumstances as determined by our
[Bylaws](/foundation/bylaws.html). Such special
meetings might not be listed in the calendar.

Minutes from all meetings will always be produced.

# Board Meeting Minutes
Links to formal board meeting minutes from 2010 through present are here.  

**Note**: The board typically approves minutes from one meeting during the *following* board
meeting, so minutes will be published roughly one month after the
scheduled date.  Other [corporate records](/foundation/records/) are published,
as is a [categorized view of all board meeting minutes](https://whimsy.apache.org/board/minutes/).
