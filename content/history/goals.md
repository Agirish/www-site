Also useful, I think, would be a description of how the actual coding environment changed, from people submitting patches and one person being responsible for folding them into the code, the "3 +1s" required for a patch to be included, review-then-commit vs. commit-then-review, etc...

[15:37] &lt;quasi&gt; That could actually be _very_ interesting - along with stuff about how the foundation was formed - legal issues and stuff

[15:38] &lt;DrBacchus&gt; quasi: Actually, it's one of the *most* important things, in my mind, as it falls under the "what works, what doesn't work, why Apache is successful" header.

[15:48] &lt;DrBacchus&gt; One of the most important roles that Apache plays, apart from being a damned fine product, is as a model of how OSS projects are *supposed* to work.

[15:48] &lt;DrBacchus&gt; Folks inside the project often don't see that aspect of things.
