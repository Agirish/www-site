<p><strong>What's your name?</strong></p>
<p>Piotr Zarzycki</p>
<p><strong>Which ApacheCon/Apache event did you attend?</strong></p>
<p>I attended ApacheCon.</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project(s)/Open Source Software project(s) are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>I am involved in the Apache Flex project.</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>I am from Poland (Cracow).</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely one of the best things was meeting people who you know only from
mailing lists.</p>
<p><strong>Who was the best person you met at ApacheCon, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Chris Dutz - His smile and attitude to me and other people were amazing. He
gathered not only people from the Apache Flex project, but also from other
projects. Thanks to him I met many amazing people.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, Chris!</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite ApacheCon talk, and why?</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the best was Chris Dutz's talk "Building SCADA Systems with
Apache Software" - He did his talk with a lot of passion, which not only I
have felt but many other people. That was so strong that I know that his
idea is realistic.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not disappointed in any way related to TAC. People who handled the
program were well prepared. My expectations were more than fulfilled.</p>
<p>Thank you, TAC!</p>
<h2 id="andriy-redko">Andriy Redko<a class="headerlink" href="#andriy-redko" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What's your name?</strong></p>
<p>Andriy Redko</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>Apache CXF</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>Canada</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>For me ApacheCon is all about community. I met so many great people, had a lot of
thoughtful conversations, heard about dozens of very interesting projects I had no
idea existed. It is a terrific event.</p>
<p><strong>What was the best new project you heard about at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>The last ApacheCon brought Apache HTrace to my attention. This is very interesting
project in the niche of distributed tracing, and I was desperately looking for such
a solution to build Apache CXF features on top of.</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite ApacheCon talk, and why?</strong></p>
<p>I liked very much the "Introduction to Apache Kafka" talk, it was very well
delivered and received.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?</strong></p>
<p>By all means, ApacheCon was possible for me only because of TAC. I was not be able to make
it without assistance. I am very grateful to TAC for picking me and giving me a chance to
be a part of ApacheCon. This experience is worth repeating and I am looking for ways to
make it this year.</p>

<h2 id="gaurav-saini">Gaurav Saini<a class="headerlink" href="#gaurav-saini" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What's your name?</strong></p>
<p>Gaurav Saini</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project(s)/Open Source Software project(s) are you involved
in?</strong></p>
<p>Apache Fineract, Apache OFBiz and Apache Roller</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>Punjab, India</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>The best bit about ApacheCon is you get to meet many intelligent minds from
around the world. Interesting part going through TAC is you get an
opportunity to introduce the speakers and interact in person.</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite non-talk part of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Meeting your project people with whom you have been talking on mailing lists
for several years. I had two project-specific dinners with people from
one project get together and discuss tech and not tech :)</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to someone thinking of applying to TAC for the first
time?</strong></p>
<p>I would like to recommend that people make sure they are active
with some project in Apache and just think about what they will be
learning at ApacheCON. Don't think negatively that you might not be eligible
or many other things that come up to your mind, doubting your caliber.</p>
<h2 id="maxim-solodovnik">Maxim Solodovnik<a class="headerlink" href="#maxim-solodovnik" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What's your name?</strong></p>
<p>Maxim Solodovnik</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>OpenMeetings, Flex, Wicket</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>Russia, Siberia</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>I was able to meet new friends, meet lots of people I was emailing with "in person", I can now wear an "Ask me" badge and easily talk to people I never met before :)</p>
<p><strong>Who was the best person you met at ApacheCon, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Melissa, no doubt :) She one of the kindest people at Apache :)</p>
<p>To be serious it is hard to choose <em>one</em> best person. After 4 ApacheCons I can choose many more best persons</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite ApacheCon talk, and why?</strong></p>
<p>I still believe the TomEE talk by David Blevins is the best :) David is a great speaker, and his talk was very technical and full of examples</p>
<p><strong>What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>I was able to improve Apache OpenMeetings a lot after ApacheCons, I got new ideas, new easier ways of implementing things</p>
<p>Hopefully we got new users :)</p>

<h2 id="sharan-foga">Sharan Foga<a class="headerlink" href="#sharan-foga" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What's your name (as you like to be called / shown for the interview)?</strong></p>
<p>Sharan Foga</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>Apache OFBiz</p>
<p><strong>Were you a student/academic at the time of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a bit of a global traveller. I'm originally from the UK but currently
live in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most interesting thing you learned at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>At the Barcamp I learned that everyone in a community is empowered to do
what they think is the best for their project.</p>
<p>This has helped me to begin actively proposing and launching different
initiatives for my project.</p>
<p><strong>What unexpected things did you learn at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Apachecon is for anyone involved in a community.</p>
<p>I'm not a developer or a technical person, so was initially concerned that I
wouldnt fit in or that everyone would be speaking "techspeak".</p>
<p>Instead I found that Apache is like a huge open family and you don't have to
be a techie to be a part of it.</p>
<p>At the time I applied, I was surprised to find out that I was the only
female TAC volunteer - so I would urge women to apply.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?</strong></p>
<p>I expected to arrive at Apachecon and then just be given a list of tasks to
do.</p>
<p>Instead, as well as managing all my travel and accommodation planning, the
TAC team organised a dinner for all the TAC volunteers, so we
could meet and get to know each other informally. This meant that throughout
Apachecon we became a little micro community. This was
demonstrated several times when one of us was not available to do an
allocated task, and someone else would quickly jump  in to cover it.</p>
<p>From the moment you arrive at Apachecon, you are never alone!</p>
<p><strong>What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>During Apachecon myself and other attendees from my project decided to run
an informal brainstorming session. We came up with a lot of
suggestions for mailing list discussion proposals. The result being that our
community has agreed to progress some of these areas.</p>
<p>I think the dynamics of having a face to face meeting improves interaction
on the mailing lists and helps collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="bhargav-golla">Bhargav Golla<a class="headerlink" href="#bhargav-golla" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What's your name?</strong></p>
<p>Bhargav Golla</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>I was involved with Apache PhotArk (Retired project), and Apache Isis, as a Google Summer of Code Developer</p>
<p><strong>Were you a student/academic at the time of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I was a student.</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>I am a student at Clemson University, Clemson, SC.</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Being able to meet all the great committers from the community, and listening from each of them first hand about their experiences.</p>
<p><strong>What was the most interesting thing you learned at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Though working on ASF Projects, I wasn't aware of the reasons why many open source projects like to get under the umbrella of ASF. The session on "But we're already open source! Why would I want to bring my code to Apache?" was very informative, and so were the other sessions which were tuned towards people to understand more about ASF.</p>
<p><strong>What was the best new project you heard about at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Kafka. I had vaguely heard about it, but realized how widespread this tool is in many enterprises.</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite non-talk part of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>The Committer Receptions and the closing reception where all the committers and attendees could hang out and share things in a very informal and comfortable way. And also the free goodies provided by the ASF and sponsors.</p>
<p><strong>How did the Travel Assistance program compare to your expectations?</strong></p>
<p>The Travel Assistance program exceeded my expectations. I assumed that this program was about just a way for conference attendees to get sponsored. But all the recipients were expected to help in the organization of sessions. This led to increased involvement in the conference, and also more relations forming among the Travel Assistance recipients.</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to someone thinking of applying to TAC for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>Take your time to answer the questionnaire in detail so that the TAC can understand your case well and make sure that you are funded.</p>

<h2 id="jeff-genender">Jeff Genender<a class="headerlink" href="#jeff-genender" title="Permalink">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>What's your name?</strong></p>
<p>Jeff Genender</p>
<p><strong>What Apache project are you involved in?</strong></p>
<p>Camel, CXF, ServiceMix, Mina, TomEE, ActiveMQ</p>
<p><strong>Where in the world are you from?</strong></p>
<p>Colorado</p>
<p><strong>What was the best bit about ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Great opportunity to meet others on projects from all over the world and put names to faces</p>
<p><strong>Who was the best person you met at ApacheCon, and why?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone&hellip; because everyone is cool. ;-)</p>
<p><strong>What unexpected things did you learn at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Code with beer</p>
<p><strong>What was your favourite non-talk part of ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Keynotes and networking</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to someone thinking of applying to TAC for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>Highly recommended. It's a great way to get to these events when funds may be short.
It's an opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>What did your project get from having you at ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>Meeting with some of the folks and being able to talk about things that may take more time than on the lists.  Being able to exchange ideas before bringing them to the community.  Face to face can have a huge impact on attitude and interaction moving forward, and it's something that can be bestowed to the projects.  Sometimes it's tough to put tone in email, so it's good to share in a personal manner.</p>
<p><strong>What new things did you get into thanks to ApacheCon?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say it got me into anything new, but certainly underscored my feelings about Apache and the value it brings to me and my contributions.  It re-invigorates about why we do the things we do in open source and the impact it has on the world.</p>
