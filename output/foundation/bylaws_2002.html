initial registered office in the State of Delaware and the name of the
initial registered agent of the corporation at such address are set forth
in the Certificate of Incorporation. The corporation may, from time to
time, designate a different address as its registered office or a different

designation shall become effective upon the filing of a statement of such
change with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as is required
by law.</p>
<p><strong><a id="2.2" name="2.2">Section 2.2.</a>Other States.</strong> In the event the

than Delaware, the corporation shall designate the location of the

<p><strong><a id="3.1" name="3.1">Section 3.1.</a>Place of Meetings.</strong> Meetings of
the members shall be held at the principal office of the corporation or any
other place (within or outside the State of Delaware and within or outside
the United States) designated in the notice of the meeting.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.2" name="3.2">Section 3.2.</a>Annual Meeting.</strong> A meeting of the
members shall be held annually at such time as the Board of Directors may
determine (which shall be, in the case of the first annual meeting, not
more than thirteen (13) months after the organization of the corporation
and, in the case of all other meetings, not more than thirteen (13) months
after the date of the last annual meeting), at which annual meeting the
members shall elect a Board of Directors and transact other proper
business.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.3" name="3.3">Section 3.3.</a>Special Meetings.</strong> Special
meetings of the members shall be held when directed by the Chairman,
President or the Board of Directors, or when requested in writing by not
less than ten percent (10%) of all members entitled to vote at the meeting.
The call for the meeting shall be issued by the Secretary, unless the
Chairman, President, Board of Directors or members requesting the meeting
shall designate another person to do so.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.4" name="3.4">Section 3.4.</a>Notice.</strong> Written notice stating
the place, date and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be
delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the
date of the meeting, either personally or by first class mail, by or at the
direction of the Chairman, President, the Secretary, or the officer or
persons calling the meeting, to each member of record entitled to vote at
such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when
deposited in the United States mail addressed to the member at his or her
address as it appears in the membership records of the corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above paragraph, the corporation shall not be required
to give notice of a members' meeting to any member to whom notice of two
consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings or of the taking
of action by written consent without a meeting to such member during the
period between such two consecutive annual meetings, have been mailed under
the procedures outlined above and have been returned undeliverable. Any
action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to such
member shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly
given. If any such member delivers to the corporation a written notice
setting forth his or her then current address, the requirement that notice
be given to such member shall be reinstated.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.5" name="3.5">Section 3.5.</a>Notice of Adjourned Meetings.</strong>
When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, the corporation shall
not be required to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at
which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, any business may
be transacted that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If,
however, the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the
adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the
adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as
provided in Section 3.4 above, to each member of record on the new record
date entitled to vote at such meeting.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.6" name="3.6">Section 3.6.</a>Waiver of Notice.</strong> Whenever
notice is required to be given to any member, a waiver thereof in writing,
signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be the equivalent to the giving of
such notice. Attendance by a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of any
regular or special meeting of the members need be specified in the written
waiver of notice.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.7" name="3.7">Section 3.7.</a>Fixing Record Date.</strong></p>
<p>(a) For the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of or to vote
at any meeting of members or any adjournment thereof, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor
less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is
fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining members
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is
given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of members
of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of members shall
apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board
of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.</p>
<p>(b) For purposes of determining the members entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may
fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors,
and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If
no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date
for determining members entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is
required by the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware, shall be
the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action
taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery
to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the
books in which proceedings of meetings of members are recorded. Delivery
made to a corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified
or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been
fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors
is required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the
record date for determining members entitled to consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.</p>
<p>(c) For purposes of determining the members entitled to exercise any
rights, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the
date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which
record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no
record date is fixed, the record date for determining members for any such
purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.8" name="3.8">Section 3.8.</a>Record of Members Having Voting
Rights.</strong> The officer or agent having charge of the membership records of
the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before each
meeting of members, a complete list of the members entitled to vote at such
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the name, address,
telephone number, facsimile number and electronic mail address of each
member. For a period of ten (10) days prior to such meeting, the list shall
be open to the examination of any member, for any purpose germane to the
meeting, during ordinary business hours, either at a place within the city
where such meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the
notice of the meeting, or if not so specified, at the place where such
meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept open at the
time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any
member at any time during the meeting. Upon the willful neglect or refusal
of the directors to produce such a list at any meeting for the election of
directors, such directors shall be ineligible for election to any office at
such meeting.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.9" name="3.9">Section 3.9.</a>Member Quorum.</strong> Except as
otherwise required by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these
Bylaws, one-third (1/3) of the members entitled to vote, represented in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of
members. When a specified item of business is required to be voted on by a
class of members (if the members are divided into classes), one third (1/3)
of such class of members, represented in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item of business by
that class of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the members represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on
the subject matter shall be the act of the members, unless the vote of a
greater number or voting by class is required by the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these Bylaws. The directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of
the members present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by
class of members is required, the affirmative vote of a plurality of
members of such class represented at the meeting shall be the act of such
class unless the vote of a greater number is required by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation
or these Bylaws.</p>
<p>After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the subsequent
withdrawal of members, so as to reduce the number of members in person or
represented by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting below the number
required for a quorum, shall not affect the validity of any action taken at
the meeting or any adjournment thereof.</p>
<p>After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the subsequent
admission of new members, so as to increase the number of members required
for a quorum above the number of members present in person or represented
by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting, shall not affect the validity of
any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.10" name="3.10">Section 3.10.</a>Voting.</strong> Each member (except
emeritus members) shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to
a vote at a meeting of the members, except as may otherwise be provided in
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.</p>
<p>A member may vote either in person or by proxy executed in writing by the
member or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.11" name="3.11">Section 3.11.</a>Proxies.</strong> Every member
entitled to vote at a meeting of members or to express consent or dissent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or a member's duly
authorized attorney-in-fact, may authorize another person or persons to act
for him/her by proxy.</p>
<p>Every proxy must be signed by the member or his or her attorney-in-fact. No
proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from its date, unless otherwise
provided in the proxy. All proxies shall be revocable.</p>
<p><strong><a id="3.12" name="3.12">Section 3.12.</a>Action by Members Without a
Meeting.</strong> Any action required to be taken or which may be taken at any
annual or special meeting of members of the corporation, may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a written
consent setting forth the action so taken shall be signed by members having
not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that no written
consent shall be effective unless such consent (i) bears the date of
signature by each member signing such consent and (ii) is delivered to the
corporation within sixty (60) days of the date on which the earliest
consent was delivered to the corporation. Prompt notice of the taking of
the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written
consent shall be given to those members who have not consented in writing.</p>

eligible for membership, a person or entity must be nominated by a current
member of the corporation and must complete a written membership
application in such form as shall be adopted by the Board of Directors from
time to time. The nomination must be included in a notice to the members,
if any, of the corporation at least ten (10) days prior to any vote on the
applicant's admission, which notice may be by electronic means. The initial
members of the corporation shall be admitted upon the affirmative vote of
the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the initial meeting of the
Board of Directors. Thereafter, members of the corporation shall be
admitted as members of the corporation only by a majority vote of the
existing members of the corporation, and after receipt by the Secretary of
a membership application completed by each such proposed member within
thirty (30) days following the vote.</p>
<p><strong><a id="4.2" name="4.2">Section 4.2.</a>Emeritus Members.</strong> An emeritus
member is a former member whose membership has been suspended and converted
to emeritus status, either voluntarily or by action of the members, such
that all membership rights of the emeritus member, including the right to
vote and be counted for purposes of quorum, are suspended and terminated
until the emeritus member's membership is reinstated by subsequent action
of the members.</p>
<p>Upon the effective date of conversion of the membership of any member to
emeritus status, the membership, including all related voting rights, of
such member shall be suspended, except that such emeritus member shall be
entitled to attend (but not vote) at meetings of the members, and the
officers of the corporation shall attempt, in good faith, to continue to
deliver notices of meetings of the members of the corporation to such
emeritus member. References in these Bylaws to a "member" or to the
"members" of the corporation shall not include any emeritus member unless
explicitly provided otherwise.</p>
<p><strong><a id="4.3" name="4.3">Section 4.3.</a>Voluntary Conversion of Membership
to Emeritus Status.</strong> Members may convert their membership to emeritus
status at any time upon ten (10) days' written, signed notice delivered to

Membership to Emeritus Status.</strong> Upon an affirmative vote of a two-thirds
majority of the members of the corporation, the membership of a member
shall be converted into an emeritus membership.</p>
<p><strong><a id="4.5" name="4.5">Section 4.5.</a>Reinstatement of Membership of
Emeritus Members.</strong> Upon receipt of a written request and a new membership
application from an emeritus member and upon an affirmative vote of a
majority of the members of the corporation approving such membership
application, such emeritus member membership shall be reinstated as a full
member of the corporation, and shall be entitled to exercise all rights as
a member of the corporation, including all related voting rights.</p>
<p><strong><a id="4.6" name="4.6">Section 4.6.</a>Voluntary Withdrawal from
Membership.</strong> Members (including emeritus members) may withdraw from
membership in the corporation at any time upon ten (10) days' written,
signed notice delivered to an officer of the corporation.</p>
<p><strong><a id="4.7" name="4.7">Section 4.7.</a>Termination from Membership.</strong> No

Termination of Membership.</strong> Upon any withdrawal or termination of the
membership of any member, the membership, including all related voting

<p><strong><a id="5.1" name="5.1">Section 5.1.</a>Powers.</strong> The business and affairs
of the corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board
of Directors, which may exercise all such powers of the corporation and do
all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Certificate
of Incorporation or by these Bylaws specifically reserved to the members.</p>
<p><strong><a id="5.2" name="5.2">Section 5.2.</a>Qualification.</strong> Directors need

<p><strong><a id="5.3" name="5.3">Section 5.3.</a>Compensation.</strong> The Board of
Directors shall have authority to fix the compensation of directors unless
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation.</p>
<p><strong><a id="5.4" name="5.4">Section 5.4.</a>Number.</strong> The corporation shall
initially have nine (9) directors. Thereafter, the number of directors

at the organization meeting, as the case may be, as a member of the initial
Board of Directors shall hold office until the first annual meeting of

<p>At the first annual meeting of members and at each annual meeting
thereafter, the members shall elect directors to hold office until the next
succeeding annual meeting. Each director shall hold office for the term for
which he or she is elected and until his or her successor shall have been

death.</p>
<p><strong><a id="5.6" name="5.6">Section 5.6.</a>Resignation and Removal of
Directors.</strong> A director may resign at any time upon written request to the
corporation. Furthermore, any director or the entire Board of Directors may

entitled to vote for the election of directors or as otherwise provided in

<p><strong><a id="5.7" name="5.7">Section 5.7.</a>Vacancies.</strong> Any vacancy occurring
in the Board of Directors, including any vacancy created by reason of an
increase in the authorized number of directors, may be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than
a quorum of the Board of Directors or by a sole remaining director. If
there is more than one class of members, vacancies of directorships elected
by such class may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such
class or by a sole remaining director. A director elected to fill a vacancy
shall hold office only until the next election of directors by the members.</p>
<p><strong><a id="5.8" name="5.8">Section 5.8.</a>Quorum and Voting.</strong> A majority of
the number of directors fixed in accordance with these Bylaws shall

<p>The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted in accordance with this
section, may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
such committee, who may act in the place and stead of any absent or
disqualified member or members at any meeting of such committee. In the

meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.</p>

<p><strong><a id="12.1" name="12.1">Section 12.1.</a>Right to Indemnification.</strong>
Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (other than an action by
or in the right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she
is or was a director, officer or member of the corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee,
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or
other enterprise, shall be entitled to indemnification against expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in
settlement to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by applicable
law as long as such person acted in good faith and in a manner that such
person reasonably believed to be in or not be opposed to the best interests
of the corporation; provided, however, that the corporation shall indemnify
any such person seeking indemnity in connection with an action, suit or
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such action,
suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of
Directors.</p>
<p><strong><a id="12.2" name="12.2">Section 12.2.</a>Advance Payment of Expenses.</strong>
Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any person who
is or was an officer, director or member of the corporation, or who is or
was serving at the request of the corporation as an officer or director of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action,
suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the
final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it is
ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled under applicable law
to be indemnified by the corporation.</p>
<p><strong><a id="12.3" name="12.3">Section 12.3.</a>Right of Claimant to Bring
Suit.</strong> If a claim under this Article is not paid in full by the
corporation within ninety (90) days after a written claim has been received
by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit
against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
also the expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the
corporation unless such action is based on the claimant having committed an
act involving moral turpitude) that the claimant has not met the standards
of conduct which make indemnification permissible under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the burden of proving such
defense shall be on the corporation. Neither the failure of the corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
members) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard
of conduct.</p>

otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding such office.</p>

constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which,
if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority

person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,

believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an
employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not
opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this
Article.</p>
